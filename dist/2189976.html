    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, and did know, during the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I have Joan Barnes with me and she&#039;s going to talk about her childhood during the war.</div><div id="00:00:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Joan, have you got any special memories for us?</div><div id="00:00:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we have lots of special memories really. I can remember how the war broke out and I</div><div id="00:00:23.200" class="transcript_line"> can remember neighbours getting together and crying because the war, their husbands would</div><div id="00:00:30.680" class="transcript_line"> be either going into the army or the forces or the home guard. So it was an upsetting</div><div id="00:00:40.160" class="transcript_line"> time. I would be at school soon afterwards and of course we all had masks.</div><div id="00:00:50.400" class="transcript_line"> So you had gas masks?</div><div id="00:00:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, my younger brother had one in a box and it was a Mickey Mouse one. It was in a box and</div><div id="00:01:00.640" class="transcript_line"> they sat in it and as they got a little bit older they had a Mickey Mouse one. So they used to put</div><div id="00:01:06.800" class="transcript_line"> them on their face and flap their nose.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had a Mickey Mouse nose on it?</div><div id="00:01:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes they did.</div><div id="00:01:11.920" class="transcript_line"> Goodness. So what other memories? Did your dad go to war?</div><div id="00:01:17.200" class="transcript_line"> No, my father didn&#039;t go to war because we were from a mining village and he worked down the pit.</div><div id="00:01:26.400" class="transcript_line"> But odd warms have in the family. My dad&#039;s brother was in the war and he went abroad. He did come</div><div id="00:01:36.880" class="transcript_line"> back. He came back safely.</div><div id="00:01:40.080" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember rationing then?</div><div id="00:01:42.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. We had ration books until the 50s because they got married in the 50s so I know they still</div><div id="00:01:50.080" class="transcript_line"> had ration books.</div><div id="00:01:51.120" class="transcript_line"> So did you feel that you wanted to eat sweets or you wanted more butter? But you were in a mining</div><div id="00:01:56.880" class="transcript_line"> community so was there farms?</div><div id="00:01:59.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was no thought of saying I want to eat sweets and stamp my feet. No, no, there was</div><div id="00:02:06.640" class="transcript_line"> no sweets and that was it. Yes. We used to eat, mum used to peel a carrot and you could eat a</div><div id="00:02:14.960" class="transcript_line"> raw carrot.</div><div id="00:02:15.680" class="transcript_line"> A very satisfying raw carrot.</div><div id="00:02:18.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:20.240" class="transcript_line"> So were there any bad memories that you have?</div><div id="00:02:24.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember much about it but an aircraft did go over the village and swept quite low</div><div id="00:02:33.680" class="transcript_line"> and dropped a bomb on the edge of the village. They never knew whether he got a spare one or</div><div id="00:02:42.480" class="transcript_line"> whether he was aiming for the colliery so we never knew that.</div><div id="00:02:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And was anyone hurt in the...</div><div id="00:02:48.320" class="transcript_line"> No, no but the plagues it was because it crashed.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:02:52.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a German crashed.</div><div id="00:02:54.320" class="transcript_line"> And so...</div><div id="00:02:58.400" class="transcript_line"> And then there was the wardens. Another thing is you have to black out your windows,</div><div id="00:03:03.600" class="transcript_line"> they said be knocking on your door.</div><div id="00:03:07.920" class="transcript_line"> And where did you go if there was an air raid siren or just wasn&#039;t there because...</div><div id="00:03:12.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, they built air raid shelters. I don&#039;t know how good they&#039;d be because they were brick.</div><div id="00:03:21.760" class="transcript_line"> I think most probably there was wires somewhere in the roof of them.</div><div id="00:03:27.680" class="transcript_line"> But people got together, brought neighbours together. I know we used to get under the</div><div id="00:03:34.240" class="transcript_line"> stairs and that would have made a difference but you felt you were close and coming up.</div><div id="00:03:39.040" class="transcript_line"> It brought neighbourhood together, it brought people together.</div><div id="00:03:42.720" class="transcript_line"> So you think that maybe it was a time for being more social and friendlier?</div><div id="00:03:48.400" class="transcript_line"> Because sometimes conflict does bring people together.</div><div id="00:03:50.720" class="transcript_line"> I think so, yeah. And even before that, people, all their husbands worked in the coronary so</div><div id="00:03:58.240" class="transcript_line"> everybody was on level with... Yes.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So your childhood really, despite the fact that the war ran through your childhood...</div><div id="00:04:06.160" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t. No, it didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:04:08.240" class="transcript_line"> You were happy.</div><div id="00:04:08.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, if we were in school, they&#039;d got cellars underneath and we used to go there.</div><div id="00:04:13.440" class="transcript_line"> And it was horrible because there was this like sandy smell.</div><div id="00:04:16.880" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d all go in with pinching our noses.</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> On that note then, Joan, I&#039;ll say thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:04:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
