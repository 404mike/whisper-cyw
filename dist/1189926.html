    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, basically, normally most of the time, all the rooms only have single beds in,</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> so all they&#039;ve done is pushed two single beds together.</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> But because of the framework on the outside, it leaves quite a gap in between the two beds,</div><div id="00:00:18.800" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s not an ideal situation. You know, we basically have to roll up another quilt.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a quilted blanket, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:28.600" class="transcript_line"> And we roll that up and slide that down, but it&#039;s still not ideal, but it&#039;s better than nothing at all.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you need in order to just have a double bed?</div><div id="00:00:38.600" class="transcript_line"> We need two profilers, or the two sides that profile,</div><div id="00:00:42.800" class="transcript_line"> but both sides need to be able to raise up so that they can get the hoists underneath.</div><div id="00:00:48.200" class="transcript_line"> I know they are available, but I also know they carry a pretty price tag.</div><div id="00:00:52.600" class="transcript_line"> So would you have to pay for that or would be it up the council or something?</div><div id="00:00:55.400" class="transcript_line"> No, we would.</div><div id="00:00:56.600" class="transcript_line"> We would have to pay, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:00:58.600" class="transcript_line"> How does it feel not having to sleep in that situation?</div><div id="00:01:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Soul strain. You can&#039;t lie next to your husband at night</div><div id="00:01:09.400" class="transcript_line"> and even do something simple like fall asleep with your head in his chest.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No simple things that most people take for granted in a normal double bed. We miss that.</div><div id="00:01:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re not even talking about the intimate side of it.</div><div id="00:01:23.200" class="transcript_line"> That is the icing on the cake.</div><div id="00:01:25.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean that can be got round in a hammer if you feel that way inclined,</div><div id="00:01:30.800" class="transcript_line"> but it is just, like Steve said, the very basic things of watching a film and putting your arms around each other.</div><div id="00:01:39.600" class="transcript_line"> Just lots of little things really.</div></div></p>
