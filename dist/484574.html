    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Lorraine Castellano.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re in the Swicker office and today&#039;s date is the 21st or 22nd even of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Before we start, Lorraine, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> L-O-R-R-A-I-N-E. Castellano is C-A-S-T-E-L-L-A-N-O.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s 10 out of 10, that&#039;s well spelled. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Lorraine, of course I know you as part of what we informally know as the Burley Girls, very much part of the Cardiff Ballest scene.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you first come across Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it&#039;s part of a yearly event, we always go to the carnival and then we were very very pleased to be asked would we perform once again.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So of course we all jump at the chance because it&#039;s another opportunity to dress up and perform.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> One of our shows was called Flying Down to Rio.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So we needed the help and assistance from you guys at Swicker and obviously Adrian is such a whiz with the glue gun and the glitter and wire and everything.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we needed to know how to make our headdresses for our showgirl costumes and our cage bras.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So we came along to many sessions and the end result, obviously if you go on the page you&#039;ll see it, but the end result we just made the most fabulous costumes.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And sequins, feathers, braiding, everything and we shone and sparkled.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then obviously we performed at the actual carnival itself and we did a few numbers and then we paraded.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the audience reaction like to see these wonderful Samba showgirls, Burley style, in the centre of Cardiff?</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were transported and I think they absolutely thought that&#039;s carnival.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what a carnival should have. And we delivered.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That was big time.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we really, really, we knew we...</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Across your group there were hundreds of feathers, weren&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I often say there&#039;s a lot of bald chickens in China as a result of us.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether you believe in it or not, but hopefully we did it as humanely as possible.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure they&#039;re given woolen coats or something to walk around in.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll be happy.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> A good cause.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> A good cause because they were being shown off to their fall and it was beautiful.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We had the weather on our side as well, which was great.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a very, very special time for me because I&#039;d just been diagnosed with a very rare cancer.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So on the Thursday before the carnival, I&#039;d had my first chemo session and I was so determined.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I told my oncologist, there is no way I&#039;m missing the carnival.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And she went, well, I don&#039;t know how you&#039;re going to be, blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But this is your date. You have to be on it.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. Well, we negotiated.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So off I went to Vilyndra, had the session.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That was Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Costume went on.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had my son as an attendant running to the side of me.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he&#039;s a Marine. So I was in good hands.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And we just had an absolute blast.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Lots of funny moments. The wind caught our headdresses.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to hold them. Mine was a little bit spiky on the front.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to put a piece of kitchen sponge.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re a master of improvisation.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It was honestly. Yes.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was so much fun. We had lots of photographs.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody wanted the mayor wanted a photograph with us.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody did. So we were very famous.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Stars for one day.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we finished the parade and then we all decided in our regalia</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and our beauty, we&#039;d go into where the spoons.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a high class establishment. It was wonderful.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the football was on and the poor gentlemen that were in there,</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t know whether to watch the football come and talk to us.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They were in a twirl. Yes.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Complete twirl. They were having photographs with us.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I can imagine. It&#039;s very rare. Yes.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> 15, 20 beautifully underdressed samba dancers coming to your pub.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think the football would have been looking normally.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They think they thought they&#039;d been transported to Rio.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it Rio? Brazil? The football?</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They absolutely will come.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Was that last year or the year before? Anyway, I think we were a year in advance.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We were giving them a taste. A foretaste of what was to come.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we were giving them a taste of what, you know,</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> if you buy your ticket to Rio, you&#039;ll get a bit of this.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m right thinking the following year, so yeah, in my mind,</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> so I can see you there in all your samba finery looking wonderful.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the following carnival, there was a different theme, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Something a bit more piratical, I understand.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Very much so. This is what we try and do.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re all out to shock and to get the mind going of all our audience.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re all out there, and they never know what we&#039;re going to.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> This is our director.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We always have to think, OK, it&#039;ll turn out OK.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the glorious Fufu Labelle.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Fufu Labelle will definitely get your mind going.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, us as a group, we just have to say, OK,</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;ll go, run with it, run with it, just, you know, and we&#039;ll go, OK.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So we ran with it, and we were pirates.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Not your everyday pirates. And we had a boat as well.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to, yes, perform with a boat.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But our costume had to be three in one because we had to have one costume on,</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> which we could then do three dances.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re like Russian dolls, this is, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> A little bit, yes.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had nowhere to change.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was literally in front of everybody.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the drive-cars, full of soap and air.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d been watching the weather forecast.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We thought, oh, crumbs, this is going to be a bit tricky.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re freezing cold anyway.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But once you start dancing, you do warm up.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we do the first number is the pirates.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re in our full regalia.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d spent many hours again at Swicker with the workshops and the drop-in centres</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> so I could embellish the costume because I wanted to sparkle once again.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> This was completely different.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, yes, I was all ready to go.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we did the first number, pirates, that goes.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we have the music changes and we take a few more items off.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we do mine hair.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> From cabaret, which is a classic for the S-track.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you just think, where&#039;s this going?</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And that went down really, really well.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the finale was the time warp, which you just have to get your head around all of this.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> From the Rocky Horror Picture Show.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and there&#039;s no logic in it.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t match it up anything, but it works.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You see it performed as a cabaret knight.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Huge audience.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Huge audience.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So people chanting along with you and clapping.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And they love it because they know it.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They dance with it.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it the end where you&#039;re all on your backs like dying flies and the rest of it?</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What a way to end the show.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely, yeah, we have to do that.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That is the best bit.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And you collapse on the floor.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And you need to collapse on the floor because this is, you know, we&#039;ve done three numbers.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And one after another.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Normally, you get a gap.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Another performer comes in.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was in the haze outside St David&#039;s Hall, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and it was all outside.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was all public as you can get.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had photographs which have been taken from the shops surrounding the area.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But aerial shops.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So people who were working were taking them from the wind, you know, the bulky areas.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Above TK Maxx and all that area.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had some amazing shops posted.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Big audiences, 500,000 people.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had them in the palm of your hands.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They loved you.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Your audience adored you.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they follow us on the parade, obviously through Cardiff.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And the weather wasn&#039;t as kind on this occasion, but we still did our bit.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, I love to wear wigs.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So my hair stayed dry, but the rest of me, I was absolutely, it wasn&#039;t a part of me.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t soaked.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Welcome to Cardiff, Wales.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the dye from my fishnets and my boots came out, and my legs and my feet were permanently stained for weeks.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was, I just couldn&#039;t get it off.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I used nail varnish, removed everything.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I just couldn&#039;t get it off.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We do like to leave our mark on people.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That was literally there, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So we didn&#039;t venture into any pub because at the state of us, we all went sort of like home for hot cocoa, I think.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, hot toddies all around.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But all in all, the carnival for us is a highlight of our calendar.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s like, I&#039;m not quite sure about this carnival, not going to be.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure I agree.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t agree.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I passionately don&#039;t agree.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just think it&#039;s a little odd.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It leaves a gap.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not quite sure how you&#039;ll fill it.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think you will.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I just find it very odd that we&#039;re not having a carnival.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Everywhere has a carnival.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re a city.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It almost goes on.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Carnival is carnival, you know.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s all the things that go with it.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You plan it.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not just the day.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s everything.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s the buildup to it.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we, as a group, our Burley girls, that&#039;s what we enjoy is all the things that go to make that show.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the structure, the part, the build, and then the show.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And a funny anticlimax afterwards.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to experience that to then build again.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> To go to the next one.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the ups and downs.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s not a good thing.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not a good thing.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, we would like it to be every year.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe we&#039;d have to do a rogue one.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe a rogue one will have to happen.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I hear what you&#039;re saying there.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Something alternative.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Underhand.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Left field.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Pop up.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> A pop up carnival.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line">
