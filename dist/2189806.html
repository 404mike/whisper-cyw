    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandernow, for the longest</div><div id="00:00:06.580" class="transcript_line"> yarn and I&#039;m going to speak to Graham and he&#039;s going to tell me about his father&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:13.780" class="transcript_line"> exploits during the Second World War. It was Cedric John Charles Hickman. I&#039;ll never forget</div><div id="00:00:20.600" class="transcript_line"> he signed himself. CJC Hickman sounded very posh. In fact, he was completely down to earth.</div><div id="00:00:27.880" class="transcript_line"> He came from what&#039;s known as the Black Country, which is in central UK, West Midlands. He</div><div id="00:00:34.880" class="transcript_line"> was an amazing sportsman and never wanted to take second place. So it seemed natural</div><div id="00:00:42.920" class="transcript_line"> to him. I think he was only just 18 when war broke out or was coming. He signed up for</div><div id="00:00:50.280" class="transcript_line"> the RAF and was immediately sent away from the UK to America where there was a huge training</div><div id="00:00:59.080" class="transcript_line"> program in action to try and get the RAF ready for the onslaught, which they thought and</div><div id="00:01:07.040" class="transcript_line"> did in fact happen. So luckily, he missed the very start, which was of course the Battle</div><div id="00:01:14.080" class="transcript_line"> of Britain. Otherwise, I suspect he would have been like many people and have been killed</div><div id="00:01:19.380" class="transcript_line"> before he really got any flying time in. So he arrived back in 1941 and was immediately</div><div id="00:01:28.620" class="transcript_line"> put on hurricanes and thoroughly enjoyed, he told me, strafing at anything that moved</div><div id="00:01:36.580" class="transcript_line"> over the other side of the Channel with scant regard for his own safety. And when asked</div><div id="00:01:43.180" class="transcript_line"> by the commander what posting he would like, he said, I&#039;d like a faster airplane. Well,</div><div id="00:01:50.380" class="transcript_line"> the Spitfire was quite fast, but the plane that was faster was the wooden Mosquito. And</div><div id="00:01:58.180" class="transcript_line"> he got his way. Not many people got to pilot them. They were quite cantankerous, fast they</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> certainly were. And he would tell me stories. His eyes would light up and he would live</div><div id="00:02:13.560" class="transcript_line"> those moments and he thoroughly enjoyed it. He had a spell of intruder missions. He led</div><div id="00:02:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Lancasters and Pathfinders at night, bombing the targets with flares so the Lancasters</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> could accurately bomb and destroy the targets. Sometimes civilians, sometimes not. That&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:36.400" class="transcript_line"> war. But then a spell of night fighting, which he said was really just a matter of luck,</div><div id="00:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> despite what people will tell you. You were lucky. You&#039;d had a snapshot at a Heinkel or</div><div id="00:02:50.880" class="transcript_line"> a Junkers 88. You got away with it or you didn&#039;t. He was lucky. He did. He shot down</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> some</div><div id="00:03:00.820" class="transcript_line"> vagy and for his exploits was awarded a spell as a flying instructor. This he tells me was the</div><div id="00:03:09.680" class="transcript_line"> most dangerous time of his life. He was nearly killed three times. He made a model out of one</div><div id="00:03:16.480" class="transcript_line"> of the crashed the crashed OXFORDs, which was the two engine plane which he taught people to fly</div><div id="00:03:25.280" class="transcript_line"> have still got to this day, a quite proud place on my mantle piece, fond memories. However,</div><div id="00:03:32.560" class="transcript_line"> before much further went on, he did a tiny piece with DJ Landings with 49 Squadron, I</div><div id="00:03:41.760" class="transcript_line"> think. And then immediately, as it looked like it was all going to be okay for the invasion,</div><div id="00:03:48.760" class="transcript_line"> was shipped over to Burma and to India, of all places. A sort of second front, which</div><div id="00:03:55.760" class="transcript_line"> was happening over there, taking the faithful mosquitoes, which they actually flew all the</div><div id="00:04:02.280" class="transcript_line"> way with several hops. And he said that was incredibly arduous, especially for the navigator,</div><div id="00:04:08.720" class="transcript_line"> no GPS in those days. So when they got there and had rested off, they went on missions,</div><div id="00:04:14.400" class="transcript_line"> navigation missions, strafing, bombing, supply. The most versatile airplane of all really</div><div id="00:04:22.400" class="transcript_line"> was the Mosquito. But trouble was to strike in a most peculiar fashion. Several of his</div><div id="00:04:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Squadron, by that time he was a Squadron leader, failed to return after missions. They couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:04:37.360" class="transcript_line"> pin it down until one day when he got out after a mission. And I believe this is true,</div><div id="00:04:44.920" class="transcript_line"> I have no reason to doubt it. He slung his kit bag over the back tailplane, which promptly then</div><div id="00:04:51.880" class="transcript_line"> dropped off. And when he looked, he could see it had been eaten away by termites. The Squadron was</div><div id="00:04:59.880" class="transcript_line"> immediately grounded. And lo and behold, the Achilles heel of such a great airplane was found</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> to be the termite, the tiny creature. And when they looked more and more closely, they found that</div><div id="00:05:13.680" class="transcript_line"> the main spars inside aircraft had been indeed eaten away. So luck was on his side. That was a</div><div id="00:05:22.360" class="transcript_line"> close run thing. So he returned a hero back to his job, which he regretted. He really wanted to</div><div id="00:05:31.080" class="transcript_line"> stay on the RAF. They did actually ask him to go to RAF Valley for a short while, which is where</div><div id="00:05:39.160" class="transcript_line"> he fell in love with North Wales. And latterly, he purchased a caravan for the young children,</div><div id="00:05:45.520" class="transcript_line"> myself and my sister. And we were dragged, I say dragged, I certainly loved it. Over to Valley,</div><div id="00:05:52.480" class="transcript_line"> we met the Squadron commander and we had wonderful picnics in the sand dunes where I would enviously</div><div id="00:06:01.120" class="transcript_line"> look at the fighters screeching overhead and dad would just mutter, they&#039;re just bits of tin with</div><div id="00:06:08.160" class="transcript_line"> fire up their bottoms. He was always a bit of a petrolhead really. So that was really a brand</div><div id="00:06:16.800" class="transcript_line"> finale for a wonderful career. Thank you so much. And did you take, have you taken up flying? Did you?</div><div id="00:06:24.080" class="transcript_line"> I joined the ATC and when I was at grammar school, I went to his grammar school. Bad move. He&#039;d won</div><div id="00:06:32.720" class="transcript_line"> everything and did everything. But I remember one day in the sports room on the big wall was</div><div id="00:06:40.640" class="transcript_line"> the name of everybody in the different houses and the fastest runners. And without really, I shouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:48.640" class="transcript_line"> say this modesty, but I looked and saw 100, 220, 440, 880 yards, one name, Hickman. And it was me.</div><div id="00:07:00.960" class="transcript_line"> So I never made head boy, I say I joined the ATC, but I was to join the Royal Navy and became a Marine</div><div id="00:07:13.440" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ll just skip over the, it was great fun. I never thought I&#039;d ever, it was only short service,</div><div id="00:07:20.160" class="transcript_line"> I never thought I&#039;d ever sort of do that kind of thing again. But 1983, I got a letter through the</div><div id="00:07:28.240" class="transcript_line"> post saying I was required for duty. So I was off to the Falklands. So I was involved with that and</div><div id="00:07:38.080" class="transcript_line"> we were in before anyone else and we took the SAS into, what&#039;s the word I can suppose, suppress</div><div id="00:07:46.560" class="transcript_line"> the forces which we were told by the American Secret Service were the</div><div id="00:07:54.080" class="transcript_line"> youngsters that were being trained up in guerrilla warfare. And we found out to our cost,</div><div id="00:08:01.600" class="transcript_line"> it was actually the crack regiment of all the Argentinians with the general, which was the</div><div id="00:08:08.320" class="transcript_line"> prize possession because we actually nabbed him, very expensive, lost a lot of friends,</div><div id="00:08:15.680" class="transcript_line"> but we did our job and back home. And that was the end for me, I&#039;m glad to say. I was a bit</div><div id="00:08:21.440" class="transcript_line"> shut up, but no huge problems for the rest of my life other than I went back to engineering</div><div id="00:08:30.960" class="transcript_line"> and then ended up being a mountain guide, wandering the mountains, dragging people up things they</div><div id="00:08:39.840" class="transcript_line"> shouldn&#039;t and wouldn&#039;t go up and then returned to where Dad bought the first caravan,</div><div id="00:08:49.600" class="transcript_line"> which was Conway. So I now walk my cully and watch the planes fly over from valley.</div><div id="00:08:56.320" class="transcript_line"> You do, don&#039;t they? Quite low. Very moving. Yes, it is. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.</div></div></p>
