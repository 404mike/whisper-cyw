    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They were born in Pakistan and I moved to England in the 1960s and since then been here.</div><div id="00:00:09.840" class="transcript_line"> My children are born here, I was married in Pakistan, my wife and children are here, they&#039;re all grown up.</div><div id="00:00:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Coming over to Newport in the 60s, how old were you when you came over?</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> I was just about 15 when I came over and actually in those days, you know, I wasn&#039;t mature enough to know what was going on.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was still in school and there was no sort of limit to what age you can go to school.</div><div id="00:00:49.120" class="transcript_line"> When I came here, I was over the age to go and stay in school. I only spent about 3-4 months in school.</div><div id="00:00:59.760" class="transcript_line"> And then I tried to get into college but those days there was no sort of evening or any classes where I could join because my English wasn&#039;t high enough to join anything.</div><div id="00:01:15.440" class="transcript_line"> I had to go and work which was very good at that time.</div><div id="00:01:23.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it was one of the first jobs that you got when you were here, was it driving a bus?</div><div id="00:01:30.640" class="transcript_line"> No, the first job I got was in the timber factory down in Pail. It&#039;s a sawmill, I think it&#039;s still there.</div><div id="00:01:40.320" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for about a year. Then I went to work in the board mill, Mahamasha board mill.</div><div id="00:01:48.240" class="transcript_line"> And I worked there about 8-9 months. And I went to work in the battery factory.</div><div id="00:01:58.720" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for about 3-4 months.</div><div id="00:02:00.720" class="transcript_line"> And then I worked for about 2 days in the buildings outside of Paz, Calif.</div><div id="00:02:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Then I came to work, looked for a job in the buses and I got the job in the buses.</div><div id="00:02:14.720" class="transcript_line"> And that was the last job I had. And after that I had health problems.</div><div id="00:02:26.240" class="transcript_line"> And they retired me in paternity.</div><div id="00:02:31.280" class="transcript_line"> In those days I think there was a shortage of workforce in England because of the</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> world war. And they wanted people to come from, I think, what happened.</div><div id="00:02:48.080" class="transcript_line"> To my knowledge, I don&#039;t know, I might be wrong, because of the independence of India and Pakistan.</div><div id="00:02:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Few years before they wanted people to come over and help out or carry on their life with the community living here.</div><div id="00:03:09.040" class="transcript_line"> So my parents came over and I just came with them.</div><div id="00:03:13.760" class="transcript_line"> And since then we just settled down here. Now I get my grandchildren growing up here as well.</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Happy, everybody&#039;s happy living here with the community. But things have changed.</div><div id="00:03:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, you can&#039;t say, when I came over there was lots of work.</div><div id="00:03:36.640" class="transcript_line"> You could go anywhere and find work. The work is done. Most of the factories in Nepal are gone.</div><div id="00:03:42.320" class="transcript_line"> And it is, I think, it&#039;s a bit difficult for the youngsters to get a job now unless they got a good</div><div id="00:03:50.160" class="transcript_line"> qualification. And then there is just office work, I think. Office work,</div><div id="00:03:56.880" class="transcript_line"> warehouse or shop works left in Nepal now. It&#039;s not much industry.</div><div id="00:04:04.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where the future is going to be.</div><div id="00:04:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where the future is going to be. As you can see around,</div><div id="00:04:14.560" class="transcript_line"> you know, when I came over you could finish one job in the morning and you have another</div><div id="00:04:21.120" class="transcript_line"> job in the afternoon. They will start you up, you know, so you go and look for a job.</div><div id="00:04:26.320" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t say no, come back tomorrow. They said, all right, come and start now.</div><div id="00:04:29.840" class="transcript_line"> So, that was the situation then. Very different.</div><div id="00:04:34.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very difficult now to get a job. When you first moved into the area,</div><div id="00:04:40.320" class="transcript_line"> did you live close by to the community house? Yes, the community also did play a big part in</div><div id="00:04:47.680" class="transcript_line"> my life because, as I said in the beginning, in that time there was no, I wanted to learn</div><div id="00:04:55.120" class="transcript_line"> and there was no classes I could join. But there was people in the community also used to come</div><div id="00:05:00.560" class="transcript_line"> once a week to teach English. There was two teachers from different schools. One of them moved to</div><div id="00:05:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Germany after and the one stayed here. They helped us. There was a group of us, the boys,</div><div id="00:05:17.360" class="transcript_line"> who used to come here, play around and meet and learn English as well.</div><div id="00:05:24.400" class="transcript_line"> And then after that, quite a few people came and helped, you know,</div><div id="00:05:33.920" class="transcript_line"> learn and just carry on with the things. I guess also when you were working on the buses,</div><div id="00:05:42.960" class="transcript_line"> you were meeting people every day and that must have improved your English.</div><div id="00:05:47.600" class="transcript_line"> That helped as well to learn and speak. But the main point which I learned from is the community</div><div id="00:05:57.040" class="transcript_line"> house, which we had a couple of different people at the time coming over. And after the teachers,</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> they were here for a while. Then somebody else took over. The three girls who were studying as</div><div id="00:06:14.320" class="transcript_line"> trainee teachers, they came over. One from Rondawali and I think the other one was from either</div><div id="00:06:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Manchester or Lied. The two or three of them, they were good friends. They came over and they</div><div id="00:06:27.200" class="transcript_line"> used to come over every Thursday and Tuesday, twice a week, to teach whoever wanted to learn.</div><div id="00:06:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Summers, who was the bishop of the church, he lived next door. His daughter,</div><div id="00:06:49.200" class="transcript_line"> and Brian, and Mrs. Jones, who used to run the cafe here. They were very friendly people,</div><div id="00:06:57.760" class="transcript_line"> very, very friendly and very, very helpful. And we had a good group of people from different</div><div id="00:07:06.480" class="transcript_line"> nationalities and different cultures. So we had a good time here.</div><div id="00:07:14.320" class="transcript_line"> I can see on the film, there&#039;s some really nice footage of you all having a nice</div><div id="00:07:18.400" class="transcript_line"> party and coffee bar and having a dance, like Scottish dancing.</div><div id="00:07:23.120" class="transcript_line"> It was like a sort of a get together sort of thing. It was quite nice, good day, good times.</div><div id="00:07:32.320" class="transcript_line"> There was good time, good friendly times. People from all walks of their life.</div><div id="00:07:39.360" class="transcript_line"> There was not just Pakistani or English. There was people from all other communities.</div><div id="00:07:48.320" class="transcript_line"> There was people from France and Africa. There was others, I just can&#039;t remember now.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s quite a lot of people. Everybody was quite happy to get together and help each other.</div><div id="00:08:09.200" class="transcript_line"> And do you remember any special evening? Like you say you have Thursday evening.</div><div id="00:08:14.640" class="transcript_line"> Was that a thing, Thursday evening in particular?</div><div id="00:08:17.200" class="transcript_line"> No, it was just two days. We had Tuesday and Thursday, which was available. The hall was</div><div id="00:08:26.160" class="transcript_line"> available. The community was also available. And people just got together and we just talked.</div><div id="00:08:33.760" class="transcript_line"> We had English classes. We had a play group playing tennis.</div><div id="00:08:42.080" class="transcript_line"> Then there was other sort of game table tennis. Another small</div><div id="00:08:50.080" class="transcript_line"> food table. And also the game playing. It was to call the Asian club.</div><div id="00:08:57.280" class="transcript_line"> And then it became the international club. And that&#039;s how it carried on.</div><div id="00:09:03.920" class="transcript_line"> Then Ingrid Wilson who joined us. She did quite a lot. Her husband as well.</div><div id="00:09:12.240" class="transcript_line"> He was here as well. Mr. Wilson. They both sort of helped to run the community group.</div><div id="00:09:21.200" class="transcript_line"> There was other people like we just sort of got on with it.</div><div id="00:09:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Ingrid is still very much involved.</div><div id="00:09:27.120" class="transcript_line"> She is still very much involved. She still comes. But</div><div id="00:09:32.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have much time now because my wife is quite ill now. And I spend most time</div><div id="00:09:41.920" class="transcript_line"> staying home, taking her hair and there. And life is quite busy at home.</div><div id="00:09:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Kind of my time.</div><div id="00:09:52.880" class="transcript_line"> I got my daughter-in-law. My daughters, they are very good. They help out. They do most of the</div><div id="00:09:59.360" class="transcript_line"> things. But because my daughter and my son, they are mostly working. And I&#039;m home because I&#039;m</div><div id="00:10:08.560" class="transcript_line"> retired quite a while now. And I am retired officially now two years ago as well. So I do</div><div id="00:10:17.920" class="transcript_line"> get out and about. But not a lot because my own health is not all that good.</div><div id="00:10:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m sorry to hear that.</div><div id="00:10:27.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been suffering for quite a while now with this anxiety and distressions and back problem.</div><div id="00:10:36.640" class="transcript_line"> So thank God I&#039;m able to get around.</div><div id="00:10:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:42.640" class="transcript_line"> I can get about. But not a lot. I spend the time at home mostly now.</div><div id="00:10:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy your work as a bus driver?</div><div id="00:10:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I love it. If I had a chance to go back.</div><div id="00:10:56.880" class="transcript_line"> How many years would you say you were doing that job?</div><div id="00:10:59.040" class="transcript_line"> On and off. I was about 10, 15 years altogether because I was working from 70 to 74.</div><div id="00:11:13.040" class="transcript_line"> 74 years. End of 74 I go up, went back home to get married, come back, went to work in</div><div id="00:11:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff for a year. Then I came back to Newport. And after that I became ill and I was unable to</div><div id="00:11:29.680" class="transcript_line"> carry on then.</div><div id="00:11:30.800" class="transcript_line"> What did you like most about the job?</div><div id="00:11:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Meeting people. Meeting different people. And I go all the time. It was the best point was</div><div id="00:11:41.440" class="transcript_line"> meeting people, different people all the time. And very friendly people. Group of people to work</div><div id="00:11:49.600" class="transcript_line"> with as well.</div><div id="00:11:51.840" class="transcript_line"> When you look back at your film Home From Home, when was the last time you saw it?</div><div id="00:11:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Not long ago. It was shown in Sendmite, Riverside. My family went to see it.</div><div id="00:12:08.160" class="transcript_line"> And they also have it put on the internet. And my son showed it to me on the internet.</div><div id="00:12:16.560" class="transcript_line"> At home we all watched it at home.</div><div id="00:12:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you like to see yourself? Did you think it was a good representation of your life?</div><div id="00:12:24.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a very good representation. But as I said I was young and naive those days. Just the things</div><div id="00:12:33.600" class="transcript_line"> could have been better if I had known what I was doing. But at the time what we did and what we made</div><div id="00:12:45.040" class="transcript_line"> was quite good. And it&#039;s quite helpful.</div><div id="00:12:49.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it is very interesting always to look at old films to see what people were wearing,</div><div id="00:12:54.640" class="transcript_line"> what the traffic was doing, the shops. It was fascinating. I got the feeling that you were</div><div id="00:13:01.280" class="transcript_line"> lonely. It was a street scene at the end and you&#039;re walking off in the distance and the street&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:05.840" class="transcript_line"> empty. There&#039;s no traffic and it&#039;s just you walking away. And I thought, oh that looks very</div><div id="00:13:11.760" class="transcript_line"> poignant.</div><div id="00:13:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Just the scene he wanted to create some reason or other. Because maybe to show I was, I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:13:23.840" class="transcript_line"> what he meant with that. At that time I said, like I said, it didn&#039;t come to my mind what</div><div id="00:13:30.960" class="transcript_line"> we were doing or what it was about. It was just about what the life was in the UK.</div><div id="00:13:40.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it was all about. Getting family together and spending time together.</div><div id="00:13:45.440" class="transcript_line"> And the shop with the street. There&#039;s some sort of band, a marching band.</div><div id="00:13:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Because that was the lifestyle those days. You could see bands marching and every time.</div><div id="00:13:56.960" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t see them now. It&#039;s gone. You don&#039;t see them anymore.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> People used to go to church and every Sunday it&#039;s gone. Every Sunday you wake up, you hear the bells</div><div id="00:14:11.360" class="transcript_line"> going. You don&#039;t hear the bells no more. I think people are just going away from that religion.</div><div id="00:14:18.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just life is, I don&#039;t know, hustle and bustle. Too much.</div><div id="00:14:27.520" class="transcript_line"> The life is so expensive I think that&#039;s why it is. And there&#039;s not much work. People are just,</div><div id="00:14:35.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s just I think this life is changed altogether to what it was in the 60s and 70s.</div><div id="00:14:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Life has become very, people have become more busy in their phones and internet and tablets.</div><div id="00:14:54.960" class="transcript_line"> See the children, they&#039;re mostly busy. They&#039;ve got their headphones on, the phone going.</div><div id="00:15:03.120" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re more interested in their iPad or phone instead of</div><div id="00:15:10.080" class="transcript_line"> being together. That closeness of families, it sort of seems to be, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:15:20.080" class="transcript_line"> it seems to be dying away in the family. It&#039;s just me or it&#039;s happening every day, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:29.280" class="transcript_line"> I got that feeling that we are coming to this situation where</div><div id="00:15:33.200" class="transcript_line"> people are becoming more selfish and this more problem, world is becoming,</div><div id="00:15:42.640" class="transcript_line"> has become more problematic. You see people killing each other. We&#039;re in the 70s and after</div><div id="00:15:49.680" class="transcript_line"> World War, everybody was trying to make friendship and build up the relationships. And I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:15:59.760" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re going back instead of going forward because</div><div id="00:16:07.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s every, every day is trouble. Yeah, we live in some very interesting times.</div><div id="00:16:13.280" class="transcript_line"> The social media is creating more problem because everybody&#039;s putting up so much rubbish</div><div id="00:16:20.880" class="transcript_line"> into young people&#039;s minds. It&#039;s too busy, it&#039;s too crowded. That&#039;s it. Yeah. Everyone seems to be</div><div id="00:16:27.280" class="transcript_line"> switched on all the time. There&#039;s no escaping it. It feels like you can fill your every waking hour.</div><div id="00:16:33.280" class="transcript_line"> People don&#039;t slow down anymore. No, no. It&#039;s everything is like</div><div id="00:16:38.960" class="transcript_line"> we have before people used to get together, meet, family used to sit in one room.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember when my children and myself and my wife in the evening, children came from school,</div><div id="00:16:54.080" class="transcript_line"> I come from work, we all sat down in one room. We had our food together. We sat and watched TV</div><div id="00:17:02.800" class="transcript_line"> for a while together. Now it&#039;s all different. The children come from school, they take their food</div><div id="00:17:11.040" class="transcript_line"> up in their bedrooms, next room, they just don&#039;t seem to be that</div><div id="00:17:19.680" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not. The families sort of life, what maybe is a new generation as their way of life,</div><div id="00:17:31.600" class="transcript_line"> completely different to ours. Maybe that&#039;s what it is, you know. Life, you know. Makes you want to</div><div id="00:17:38.080" class="transcript_line"> think, you know, what we was and what it is now in the last 15, 20 years. This is</div><div id="00:17:49.840" class="transcript_line"> completely changed. The things are completely changed.</div><div id="00:17:54.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:17:57.280" class="transcript_line"> you know. There&#039;s no that feeling of getting together. Maybe it&#039;s me getting old, maybe it&#039;s</div><div id="00:18:09.120" class="transcript_line"> the old age, you know. I don&#039;t know, it could be. It&#039;s maybe me. No, yes, it is. Yes, it is.</div><div id="00:18:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t know, like I said, that, you know, the people, they were more interested in</div><div id="00:18:26.320" class="transcript_line"> religion at that time, not so long ago. People used to come to the church here as well because</div><div id="00:18:32.800" class="transcript_line"> they used to have Sunday service and also in the other churches. The people, this day and age,</div><div id="00:18:41.040" class="transcript_line"> they can&#039;t wait for the religion of the churches, which sort of had a big bond in the people.</div><div id="00:18:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Because when you went to church, there was other people there. You met them,</div><div id="00:18:54.400" class="transcript_line"> they listened to the lecture from the vicar or whoever was in charge of the church.</div><div id="00:19:01.280" class="transcript_line"> And people sort of have some thing to take some thought back home. Now everybody is into internet.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And whatever you see in the internet or social media, that is being fed into the minds of people.</div><div id="00:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> People are not interested into the groups or the churches. As everybody might have noticed,</div><div id="00:19:27.360" class="transcript_line"> the churches are closed down. Some have been knocked down, some been sold because people</div><div id="00:19:35.520" class="transcript_line"> are not interested. So that&#039;s what I think is breaking up the, how do you call it,</div><div id="00:19:44.560" class="transcript_line"> bond in the people like what we had when we was growing up or when we was in our</div><div id="00:19:55.440" class="transcript_line"> growing up days. It&#039;s not the same.</div><div id="00:20:00.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a shame. It&#039;s a shame really. I don&#039;t know, maybe youngsters, maybe they have more</div><div id="00:20:07.680" class="transcript_line"> activities than what we had. But because it&#039;s maybe because I&#039;m most of the time I&#039;m home,</div><div id="00:20:15.920" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t go almost much out and about. That&#039;s maybe, I don&#039;t know. Maybe that&#039;s the problem that I</div><div id="00:20:25.840" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t see it was like as a community host. Like you said, it must remain open to the community.</div><div id="00:20:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Like there are different groups every day, different</div><div id="00:20:38.880" class="transcript_line"> activities going on afternoon and evenings. I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s going on here now.</div><div id="00:20:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s been a long time since I come to community house.</div><div id="00:20:52.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a women&#039;s group, there&#039;s a men&#039;s group that happens today from two till four every</div><div id="00:20:58.480" class="transcript_line"> Tuesday. It&#039;s quite a nice group. Just a few men that will sit there and they will have chat and</div><div id="00:21:05.360" class="transcript_line"> have a cup of tea and play cards. And they seem very friendly. And then there&#039;s a coffee group</div><div id="00:21:11.520" class="transcript_line"> on a Thursday and then there&#039;s a main youth project that happens tonight, but they finished now.</div><div id="00:21:18.960" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s all kinds of things. I think what the project, the purpose of this project that I&#039;m</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> involved in, we won Heritage Lottery money over two years. And we won a bid. Originally it was</div><div id="00:21:36.080" class="transcript_line"> going to be for repairs to the building, but then the Heritage Lottery looked at the building and</div><div id="00:21:40.640" class="transcript_line"> they thought that it didn&#039;t, you know, it wasn&#039;t significant. If it was that old church building</div><div id="00:21:47.200" class="transcript_line"> that used to stand here with the Victorian brick gothic style, if it was that, then maybe they</div><div id="00:21:52.160" class="transcript_line"> would have given us money for the renovation of the building. But what captured their attention</div><div id="00:21:59.440" class="transcript_line"> most of all was the way that they heard about Cyril Somers and his vision for community</div><div id="00:22:07.040" class="transcript_line"> and how he thought about rebuilding the church once they knew that the old building had to be</div><div id="00:22:12.240" class="transcript_line"> demolished. And Cyril&#039;s idea was looking at the changing area mainly and seeing lots of new people</div><div id="00:22:19.360" class="transcript_line"> coming in and he could see the church was taking less and less focus over their lives.</div><div id="00:22:26.160" class="transcript_line"> And then he thought, which is very unusual at the time, him and his wife and he consulted all the</div><div id="00:22:32.080" class="transcript_line"> people that used the building and it seemed to appear that a community centre should be created</div><div id="00:22:40.160" class="transcript_line"> that still has a church in it, it still has that function, but it&#039;s more about the people and the</div><div id="00:22:46.880" class="transcript_line"> people at the heart of the community. So it was unusual to think like that in those days, early 60s</div><div id="00:22:55.040" class="transcript_line"> and it was his vision that enabled this to happen and you can still feel his spirit, I suppose,</div><div id="00:23:04.400" class="transcript_line"> in the way that people... He was a very good man, he sort of, because he was the church man and he</div><div id="00:23:11.840" class="transcript_line"> knew the importance of the community and he played a big part in running this community,</div><div id="00:23:19.840" class="transcript_line"> also the church altogether, him and his daughter, who I haven&#039;t seen for ages.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you know her? Yeah, she came up here and I talked to her for the project.</div><div id="00:23:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Valerie Martin. Yeah, same. Yeah, very nice. Very nice person, she was very nice, very sweet person and</div><div id="00:23:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Somer himself was a very nice person. We got on very, very well with each other when he was</div><div id="00:23:49.600" class="transcript_line"> around here, when he became a mayor as well, then he moved away from here.</div><div id="00:23:56.640" class="transcript_line"> And Dorothy, do you remember Dorothy, his wife? Yes, yes, yes, I remember them both very well</div><div id="00:24:03.200" class="transcript_line"> and like I said, they moved away and last time I saw was when he came here and I was working the</div><div id="00:24:10.320" class="transcript_line"> bus at the end, they added the special night for him at the hotel in town and I was invited to that,</div><div id="00:24:23.920" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when we met last time and Brian, I see him now and again on the street going past, he&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:24:34.880" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, there&#039;s a lot of people came and gone and it&#039;s good memories of them left,</div><div id="00:24:43.440" class="transcript_line"> good people and I hope myself like you said, this keeps going but you need people</div><div id="00:24:52.720" class="transcript_line"> to run it, you can&#039;t just do it with one or two people. Did you, after you were involved with</div><div id="00:24:59.280" class="transcript_line"> driving buses and did you have any other sort of involvement with the community in a more,</div><div id="00:25:07.040" class="transcript_line"> in a sort of, yeah, like in a community capacity like? Yeah, I&#039;ve been involved with the mosque,</div><div id="00:25:15.680" class="transcript_line"> with our Muslim community but like I couldn&#039;t carry on there as well because of my health.</div><div id="00:25:27.120" class="transcript_line"> I had nothing to do, I couldn&#039;t do much work there because I was just like being a part of the</div><div id="00:25:35.280" class="transcript_line"> community, you know, because to be with the youngsters and organize things for them,</div><div id="00:25:46.960" class="transcript_line"> meetings, attend the meetings and tell them what to do and what, that&#039;s what we do now,</div><div id="00:25:52.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s only four or five of us, the rest is our youngsters and we just sort of</div><div id="00:26:01.200" class="transcript_line"> guide them to running a mosque day-to-day business. Even there, we don&#039;t see people turning up to</div><div id="00:26:10.160" class="transcript_line"> mosque very much, only on certain occasions like Ramadan, Muharram or if there is a special</div><div id="00:26:18.560" class="transcript_line"> event, people come otherwise, there&#039;s only a few people go to mosque as well. People are</div><div id="00:26:27.760" class="transcript_line"> not into the religion in any community now. I think the people are running away from the</div><div id="00:26:37.280" class="transcript_line"> religion and all this</div><div id="00:26:41.840" class="transcript_line"> wars going on in Syria, Iran, Iraq and Yemen,</div><div id="00:26:49.840" class="transcript_line"> all, what do you call it, there&#039;s other, they&#039;re fighting each other and</div><div id="00:26:57.520" class="transcript_line"> you see young people being killed, children being killed, women running around doing,</div><div id="00:27:03.280" class="transcript_line"> it makes me cry when you see all these youngsters and people, what they&#039;re doing them for,</div><div id="00:27:13.440" class="transcript_line"> what they&#039;re bombing them for, what they&#039;re killing each other, I don&#039;t know why.</div><div id="00:27:22.240" class="transcript_line"> In Yemen, this is one of the poorest countries in the world, they got nothing there and yet</div><div id="00:27:28.800" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve been bombarded for the last three years, four years maybe, whatever, for what? I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:27:36.640" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s difficult to understand why people are doing this, just killing innocent people</div><div id="00:27:49.280" class="transcript_line"> all over the world and the world leaders here,</div><div id="00:27:52.960" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. It&#039;s a shame, shame, it&#039;s not difficult to understand things,</div><div id="00:28:04.720" class="transcript_line"> too difficult for us to understand. The world could be better if there was a, like in the beginning,</div><div id="00:28:14.080" class="transcript_line"> live and let live sort of business, especially these people, these mental people who go around</div><div id="00:28:24.720" class="transcript_line"> killing other people, suicide bombers, I mean there&#039;s no religion gives you the teaching of</div><div id="00:28:33.200" class="transcript_line"> that to go and kill other people, why, why you gain for them? You know what I mean? No, it makes no sense.</div><div id="00:28:39.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s no good to think. It makes no sense. They kill themselves, they kill other innocent people,</div><div id="00:28:43.760" class="transcript_line"> they damage properties, I mean a house is all right for someone like me and you, we might have</div><div id="00:28:52.560" class="transcript_line"> buy a house, it takes a lifetime to build that, make their homes into home and somebody just comes</div><div id="00:28:59.920" class="transcript_line"> along and blow it up, blow himself up. Why? You know, why, what they gain from that?</div><div id="00:29:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t understand. They&#039;re doing so stupid things they&#039;re doing, killing other people for what?</div><div id="00:29:18.480" class="transcript_line"> For a few, a few thousand pounds? What would they gain from that? I mean they&#039;re not alive to</div><div id="00:29:25.760" class="transcript_line"> appreciate that money they got from somebody, whatever it was, dollars, pounds, rupees or whatever</div><div id="00:29:35.680" class="transcript_line"> they got from someone who brainwashed them to go and kill other people, what they gain from it?</div><div id="00:29:44.160" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s very very difficult to understand and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no, 100 percent</div><div id="00:29:53.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no religion or no culture will say this is right. Is there anything that you want to add</div><div id="00:30:02.080" class="transcript_line"> about making a life in in Main Day or other memories of Community House or where you think</div><div id="00:30:11.120" class="transcript_line"> or what we could be doing to sustain what goes on here? Like I said, I, it&#039;s difficult for me to</div><div id="00:30:19.360" class="transcript_line"> suggest or say because I haven&#039;t been involved in anything for ages now.</div><div id="00:30:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Most of my time is spent at home and I go to mosque here twice a day but</div><div id="00:30:36.400" class="transcript_line"> the interest I had when I was younger age, they all sort of gone. It&#039;s not,</div><div id="00:30:42.080" class="transcript_line"> I just don&#039;t know what to suggest. But I, like I said, I would love to see this place</div><div id="00:30:51.600" class="transcript_line"> keep going, keep going and people should run it because it is for the benefit of other people</div><div id="00:31:01.920" class="transcript_line"> and they should benefit from it and start letting it run down or close down. It&#039;d be shame.</div><div id="00:31:12.240" class="transcript_line"> To see it being closed like the churches or the mosque. It&#039;s good to have it running.</div><div id="00:31:25.040" class="transcript_line"> I come across some very nice people when I&#039;ve been doing the project and finding out about their</div><div id="00:31:29.200" class="transcript_line"> lives and what they&#039;ve done. It&#039;s amazing. You know, it was an Asian evening then we came</div><div id="00:31:36.240" class="transcript_line"> international club, we called it because there was a lot of people. But it was happy days.</div><div id="00:31:43.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, people got together, we used to have different nights. You know, we used to meet twice</div><div id="00:31:50.080" class="transcript_line"> a day. We used to have different nights, organize different functions on our special days like</div><div id="00:31:58.240" class="transcript_line"> play up small dramas or cooking night or something. It was quite nice.</div><div id="00:32:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Social media and internet is killing all the relations because people are more interested</div><div id="00:32:14.720" class="transcript_line"> in the gossip and what&#039;s happening to that person, what&#039;s happening, what&#039;s he doing,</div><div id="00:32:19.040" class="transcript_line"> what she&#039;s doing. All these stories, they&#039;re interesting and there is still a lot of good</div><div id="00:32:27.120" class="transcript_line"> people who are helping out and they&#039;re trying to do good in the world. It&#039;s not sort of</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> finished everything, it&#039;s still hope.</div><div id="00:32:40.480" class="transcript_line"> There people are still doing good and there&#039;s good people out there.</div><div id="00:32:46.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m glad there&#039;s still quite a few things going on.</div><div id="00:32:49.920" class="transcript_line"> The government is used to fund it, to run it as a community, house and church.</div><div id="00:32:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Then everything is sort of changed, they stopped everything. It is a good cause</div><div id="00:33:01.680" class="transcript_line"> for the community and it&#039;s keeping the community interested and together.</div><div id="00:33:06.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very helpful place for people around here. It would be a shame to see it go.</div><div id="00:33:12.880" class="transcript_line"> It would be a shame to see it go.</div><div id="00:33:17.280" class="transcript_line"> My hope and my appeal to the people who have got the resources to keep it going, please keep it going.</div></div></p>
