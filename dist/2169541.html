    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> A spaceship. The next breakthrough in car ownership came about as a result of the government&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:07.440" class="transcript_line"> privatisation programme, where my regional electricity company was floated as a PLC,</div><div id="00:00:13.640" class="transcript_line"> that is Public Limited Company. Along with personal contracts, new job titles and share</div><div id="00:00:19.320" class="transcript_line"> options, the previously restricted list of approved manufacturers was expanded to include</div><div id="00:00:25.240" class="transcript_line"> other European carmakers. This was eagerly embraced by managers in the company and soon</div><div id="00:00:31.440" class="transcript_line"> our car park was filling up with gleaming new BMWs and bottom of the range Mercedes.</div><div id="00:00:37.480" class="transcript_line"> Neither of these appealed to me, but at last a company van was possible, or more correctly</div><div id="00:00:43.400" class="transcript_line"> an MPV in the form of a Renault Espace. This was the Mark 2 Espace and to my mind an improvement</div><div id="00:00:51.960" class="transcript_line"> over the boxy first attempt. Certainly the load carrying ability was very attractive apart from</div><div id="00:00:58.920" class="transcript_line"> anything else, but this car was to provide new levels of auto equipment to my car ownership.</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> Remote central locking with an alarm, air conditioning, essential with all the glass,</div><div id="00:01:09.680" class="transcript_line"> a decent stereo with a multi-CD player and controls on the stalk for the driver,</div><div id="00:01:15.160" class="transcript_line"> seven seats and a number of permutations. It was even possible to swivel the two front seats</div><div id="00:01:21.360" class="transcript_line"> around to face the two at the very back with a single seat folded down in the middle to form a table.</div><div id="00:01:27.240" class="transcript_line"> The new car must have for some reason was cup holders and he had lots of these.</div><div id="00:01:32.920" class="transcript_line"> The Espace was my first car equipped with air conditioning, common in cars nowadays,</div><div id="00:01:38.920" class="transcript_line"> but much rarer then and the Espace had a particularly powerful unit. I was delighting</div><div id="00:01:44.280" class="transcript_line"> putting it down to the coldest setting and putting the fan on full and it was possible</div><div id="00:01:49.680" class="transcript_line"> to see people&#039;s breath condensing and getting them shivering when I would innocently inquire</div><div id="00:01:54.720" class="transcript_line"> whether it was cool enough yet. The load carrying was tested early on when I discovered that the</div><div id="00:02:00.480" class="transcript_line"> data centre at work had loads of clean wooden pallets to dispose of and by removing all the</div><div id="00:02:06.160" class="transcript_line"> five rear seats I could bring home seven or eight of these to construct giant compost bins in the</div><div id="00:02:11.440" class="transcript_line"> garden, most useful. The car had a two litre injection engine with anti-lock braking systems</div><div id="00:02:19.040" class="transcript_line"> and despite its size was relatively light so gave a spirited performance for such a big vehicle of</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> that era. Some of this was down to the so-called space age composite body panels, probably some</div><div id="00:02:32.320" class="transcript_line"> kind of plastic I guess. It would be good to be able to say that all this sophisticated European</div><div id="00:02:38.320" class="transcript_line"> design meant that the car was reliable and a joy to own and drive and it was apart from one</div><div id="00:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> memorably scary incident where this car appeared to be taken over by evil spirits.</div><div id="00:02:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Returning to Sussex along the Eastbound M4 one evening after a work trip I was rather</div><div id="00:02:56.720" class="transcript_line"> shocked to see all the warning lights on the dashboard starting to flash on and off</div><div id="00:03:00.880" class="transcript_line"> randomly. I quickly pulled over onto the hard shoulder and turned off the ignition.</div><div id="00:03:06.640" class="transcript_line"> I was just about to restart it and hope that the warning lights would go out when the engine</div><div id="00:03:11.280" class="transcript_line"> started itself. I took the key out of the ignition and got out grabbing my coat and briefcase.</div><div id="00:03:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Standing beside it holding the ignition key I was mystified that the engine was still running.</div><div id="00:03:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Then I had a brainwave and used the remote control ignition key to lock the car calculating that the</div><div id="00:03:29.280" class="transcript_line"> immobiliser would cut the ignition which it did but for some reason the alarm then went off.</div><div id="00:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Pressing the key to unlock it only took a few seconds before the engine started itself again.</div><div id="00:03:41.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m standing outside holding the ignition key. I know that today using remote apps it&#039;s now</div><div id="00:03:48.080" class="transcript_line"> possible to start your engine remotely and even drive a car remotely into a parking space</div><div id="00:03:53.760" class="transcript_line"> but this technology wasn&#039;t to my knowledge available in the mid 1990s unless I had unbeknownst</div><div id="00:04:00.160" class="transcript_line"> to me been provided with some advanced future car technology testbed by Renault. So it was a choice</div><div id="00:04:07.280" class="transcript_line"> car locked engine off but alarm going or alarm off and the engine running. Luckily my company</div><div id="00:04:14.720" class="transcript_line"> mobile phone had been upgraded from an in-car model to one that could be removed and worked</div><div id="00:04:19.360" class="transcript_line"> outside so I rang the RAC which we had membership of through the company. They took the details of</div><div id="00:04:25.600" class="transcript_line"> the last junction I remembered passing and told me to wait away from the car and asked if I noticed</div><div id="00:04:31.040" class="transcript_line"> any burning smells or smoke. There might have been some rubber on the road either from me stopping or</div><div id="00:04:36.400" class="transcript_line"> me sprinting from the car but I avoided mentioning this. They warned me the response time could be</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> over an hour and that the fire brigade might attend as it sounded electrical. I was tempted</div><div id="00:04:47.600" class="transcript_line"> to suggest calling Ghostbusters then remembered they were fictional. So I sat up on the grass</div><div id="00:04:54.080" class="transcript_line"> bank and phoned home and explained yes I was likely to be delayed and yes the car alarm was ours but</div><div id="00:05:00.480" class="transcript_line"> if I switched it off I was fearful of the car driving itself away. I was tempted to open up the</div><div id="00:05:05.920" class="transcript_line"> car again and switch on all the electrics to try and run down the car battery as quickly as possible</div><div id="00:05:11.200" class="transcript_line"> and shut off the alarm but in truth having explained the bizarre symptoms three times</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> including twice to the RAC I&#039;m not sure believe me at the first telling I was now a little scared</div><div id="00:05:21.760" class="transcript_line"> of the car and fairly wary of going near it. It was quite a pleasant spring evening and could have</div><div id="00:05:27.920" class="transcript_line"> been quite peaceful sitting above the quiet motorway were it not for the insistent car alarm.</div><div id="00:05:33.680" class="transcript_line"> This was soon drowned out though unfortunately by a fire engine siren which was coming from a full</div><div id="00:05:39.360" class="transcript_line"> size fire engine as it roared up and stopped behind the possessed car. It escorted several</div><div id="00:05:44.480" class="transcript_line"> firemen two in suits with breathing apparatus and one without asking for the keys and trying to</div><div id="00:05:50.240" class="transcript_line"> understand what I was saying over the double noise of the alarm and the siren which they</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t switched off. Once the car was unlocked they went to open the bonnet but of course the</div><div id="00:05:59.520" class="transcript_line"> engine started which certainly startled the fireman who was about to stick his arm in the engine</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> despite me explaining about the problem. So we went through the lock in the car to stop the engine</div><div id="00:06:10.160" class="transcript_line"> routine and then shouted at each other over the alarm which thankfully was no longer accompanied</div><div id="00:06:15.280" class="transcript_line"> by their siren. This was now silent maybe because having now had enough excitement from having a</div><div id="00:06:21.360" class="transcript_line"> limb potentially removed they decided to calm things down a bit. One fireman disconnected the</div><div id="00:06:27.760" class="transcript_line"> battery while he came over to tell me this his colleague would appear to still be enjoying his</div><div id="00:06:32.400" class="transcript_line"> own adrenaline rush as he filled the engine compartment with foam from a fire extinguisher,</div><div id="00:06:38.480" class="transcript_line"> a large one. I was now past caring so I wished them a thanks and goodbye and waited for the RIC</div><div id="00:06:44.800" class="transcript_line"> recovery vehicle. I was hoping it would arrive before dark as I couldn&#039;t put the car&#039;s lights on.</div><div id="00:06:51.360" class="transcript_line"> Remembering there was a breakdown triangle in the boot I cautiously walked 50 yards back down the</div><div id="00:06:56.160" class="transcript_line"> hard shoulder and put that up as a precaution. Thankfully the RIC man arrived before sunset and</div><div id="00:07:03.040" class="transcript_line"> a couple of hours later I was dropped off home with the car being collected by an apologetic</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> mechanic from the Renault dealer. The car was taken away for another low loader trip and I</div><div id="00:07:13.040" class="transcript_line"> was left with a replacement car which hopefully was less autonomous. Some days later the sales</div><div id="00:07:19.200" class="transcript_line"> manager rang up full of apologies and the usual excuse that this has never happened before to his</div><div id="00:07:24.080" class="transcript_line"> knowledge allowing me to say that that was of little comfort to me as it had happened in every</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Renault Espace that I&#039;d owned and I was not impressed. Upon return of the errant car it was</div><div id="00:07:35.440" class="transcript_line"> explained to me that the wiring loom had been completely replaced as it was too tight passing</div><div id="00:07:40.720" class="transcript_line"> into the engine bay from behind the dashboard and there was a suspicion of a rubber insulating grommet</div><div id="00:07:46.800" class="transcript_line"> that had been missed. This had frayed, shortened the wiring and luckily had not caused a fire.</div><div id="00:07:54.240" class="transcript_line"> It was a little while before I trusted the car enough to be good friends again.</div><div id="00:08:00.480" class="transcript_line"> Ford again. When it was time to replace the Renault the company allowed us to do this every three</div><div id="00:08:06.560" class="transcript_line"> years. It was always an opportunity to try something else and at somebody else&#039;s expense the risk</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> always seemed minimized. We got used to the space flexibility and higher driving position of the</div><div id="00:08:18.080" class="transcript_line"> Espace so we looked around for an alternative in the range that had come to be called people carriers.</div><div id="00:08:24.960" class="transcript_line"> A ridiculously redundant term as surely this was a feature of all cars and other vehicles nevertheless</div><div id="00:08:30.480" class="transcript_line"> the market for these was growing in popularity and Ford had joined the market with a joint</div><div id="00:08:35.360" class="transcript_line"> development with Volkswagen, the Ford Galaxy and the VW Charon. Now call me old-fashioned but I</div><div id="00:08:42.480" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t fancy owning a Charon or even a Charan, no offense it&#039;s a lovely name but at least the</div><div id="00:08:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Galaxy shares its title as something astronomical and a chocolate bar. In any event the Ford has</div><div id="00:08:54.800" class="transcript_line"> better value in my allowed price range probably because the company bought a lot more Ford vehicles</div><div id="00:09:00.320" class="transcript_line"> mostly transit vans than they bought VWs. I don&#039;t know or maybe it was a badge premium</div><div id="00:09:06.880" class="transcript_line"> exercised by the German company as the models are virtually identical.</div><div id="00:09:11.120" class="transcript_line"> The car was to be a Galaxy 2.0-litre gear and petrol as it was the early days of the ill-judged</div><div id="00:09:18.320" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s all move to more economical and greener diesel engines. What a cul-de-sac that has turned</div><div id="00:09:24.080" class="transcript_line"> out to be. As cars were becoming more alike in appearance and some of this was down to</div><div id="00:09:30.160" class="transcript_line"> aerodynamics and drag coefficients it was not easy to select them based on brand. In fact a friend</div><div id="00:09:36.560" class="transcript_line"> who was also entitled to a company car claimed to select his on two important criteria.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> How comfortable the driver&#039;s seat was, he drove all over the country in parts of</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> mainland Europe and secondly how easy it was to operate the sound system and how loud it was.</div><div id="00:09:54.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure this simplified things when he was not seduced by issues of branding and design.</div><div id="00:09:59.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not so single-minded and swayed by the upmarket luxury features of the Ford gear model,</div><div id="00:10:05.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what the brochure said. I selected a metallic maroon model but let&#039;s be realistic</div><div id="00:10:10.640" class="transcript_line"> here it&#039;s basically a van with more windows and stuff full of thick carpet and six armchairs</div><div id="00:10:16.800" class="transcript_line"> in a hideously grey patterned velour that could have come from the DFS novo bilious range.</div><div id="00:10:24.560" class="transcript_line"> It was well equipped with the so-called luxuries including electric sunroof, six electric windows,</div><div id="00:10:30.480" class="transcript_line"> CD multiplayer, heated front windscreen, climate control, rear heater controls and enough map</div><div id="00:10:36.720" class="transcript_line"> reading and courtesy lights to equip a Christmas tree amongst other refinements. It was impossible</div><div id="00:10:43.520" class="transcript_line"> to order a 12-volt small fridge that clipped in place of one of the rear seats so we had one of</div><div id="00:10:48.640" class="transcript_line"> those as an extra and very civilised it was too for picnics. Mechanically it was a two-litre</div><div id="00:10:55.840" class="transcript_line"> double overhead camshaft Ford petrol engine with ABS and traction control and described by</div><div id="00:11:02.400" class="transcript_line"> Ford&#039;s marketing department as providing lively performance with impressive economy.</div><div id="00:11:08.160" class="transcript_line"> The power output was an increase over the Renault 115bhp against 105 but the Ford was considerably</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> heavier at kerb weight. What is that? It was 1650kg to the lighter Renault&#039;s 1320kg.</div><div id="00:11:26.080" class="transcript_line"> The lively performance of 12 seconds to 0-60 and 110 top speed doesn&#039;t sound so impressive by</div><div id="00:11:33.040" class="transcript_line"> modern standards today but despite its weight it was livelier than the Espace that claimed a 0-60</div><div id="00:11:39.680" class="transcript_line"> at 13.5 seconds. The extra weight did make it feel more solid and stable but maybe it was the arm</div><div id="00:11:46.240" class="transcript_line"> rest on the seats that helped with that. I&#039;ve always felt the Renault could use more power</div><div id="00:11:51.200" class="transcript_line"> and some lunatic of Renault agreed but maybe went a little too far. To celebrate the 10th</div><div id="00:11:56.960" class="transcript_line"> anniversary of Renault&#039;s Formula One involvement the Espace F1 show car was developed using a</div><div id="00:12:03.680" class="transcript_line"> carbon fibre reinforced body and a chassis. A three and a half litre V10 engine from a 1993</div><div id="00:12:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Williams Renault car was mounted mid-engine and powered the rear wheels race car semi-automatic</div><div id="00:12:17.920" class="transcript_line"> gearbox. The performance was electrifying 0-60 in 2.8 seconds, 0-124mph in under 7 seconds plus a</div><div id="00:12:28.640" class="transcript_line"> top speed of 195mph. I wouldn&#039;t mind a go in that although there was no room behind the front seats</div><div id="00:12:35.280" class="transcript_line"> for passengers and it apparently got a little too warm inside for an Irish war found. I&#039;m racking</div><div id="00:12:41.600" class="transcript_line"> my brains to think of any memorable experience of a galactic or otherwise nature world stone in the</div><div id="00:12:47.040" class="transcript_line"> car. Maybe it&#039;s the way with forwards as with the Sierra it just does what it says on the tin.</div></div></p>
