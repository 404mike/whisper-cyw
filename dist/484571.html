My name&#039;s Liz Price, which is L-I-Z-P-R-I-C-E.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Liz, how did you first get involved with the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I got involved with Swicker because I volunteered for them.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was studying graphic design in Cardiff and I&#039;d just come to the end of my course,</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> graduated and had a minor, oh my God, what am I going to do moment.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And I contacted a load of different organisations and said, can I come and volunteer on some projects?</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;d always enjoyed doing things with school kids and, you know, like projects and things like that.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got in touch with the Swicker office and I think the first project I did was the Cofilly Lantern Parade.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So I volunteered over three weeks, three weekends doing that, enjoyed it, had a great time.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when it came around to the carnival project the following year,</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> you guys got in touch with me and asked if I&#039;d like to work as a trainee.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I believe we felt that the force is strong in this one.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was great. So it was working with Ben and Jude, who I&#039;d worked with on the Lantern Parade.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t quite as frightening arriving there on day one.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, then working with all of the guys from St Vincent.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was St Vincent guys and Amara was leading it.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Ben and Jude were working as artists and Zoe Hewitt was fellow trainee with me.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the year of Spirit of Mother Earth when we did a lot of spray dyeing.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it rained almost continuously through the summer.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was like working in a Chinese laundry.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We were spray dyeing costumes.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was great because it introduced me to loads of different techniques.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were doing a bit of batik and a bit of spray dye and stamping and things like that.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then these people were hung up on ropes in the carnival camp, which looked like a Chinese laundry.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lovely image.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely. I think Ben and Jude were doing it part time.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it was a lot to take in, as I remember it.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And a really intensive project, but people made me feel really welcome.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great fun.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first year was really just getting my head around it.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember going on parade for the very first time?</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember it lining up behind the Butte Town Youth Pavilion and it just being enormous.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And just that whole day of organizing people, the amount of time it took to get everything out there, get people in costume.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s it like being under the intense, but everybody wants your attention, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody needs that additional staple, that additional complete.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re like this magnet with sort of people accreting themselves to you.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I can see you and the other tutors sort of walking around and people, yeah, they spot you.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it&#039;s just a whoomp. You can tell where any member of the team is because they&#039;ve got a little world to them.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So how do you manage to, because I always say you with a very calm demeanor and a fabulous smile.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s happening below the water line?</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m paddling like crazy.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, it&#039;s.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought you were superhuman.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you just deal with whatever&#039;s in front of you as quickly as you can, because it&#039;s like I always think of it like being on a very busy bar on match day.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to work in emails.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So on match day, the minute you&#039;d served someone, there would be someone else in their place and it would just go on for hours and hours and hours.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, I&#039;ve now got machines that can pour 10 or 20 pints in one go.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Have they?</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They have, allegedly. I wouldn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That would have been good.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and that and that.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, so.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Robot tutor.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what you need.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I serve your cultural needs.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, you just remember that that people people get in a bit of a tis and they get they&#039;re very excited and the energy is rising and the noise levels are rising and they&#039;re not trying to do your head in and they&#039;re not trying to stress you out.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They just, you know, they&#039;ve got something that has broken or a bit of elastic that&#039;s come astray or they&#039;re not entirely sure what they&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So all you can do is just try and direct them.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the on the big day itself, would you be of course garbed in the what would you call them?</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The workmen sort of.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Tool belt.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Tool belt.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Something about Batman and his utility belt and you guys or RoboCop.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like, you know, there&#039;s almost like nothing you&#039;re not carrying.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s like your wrists have got gaffer tape on, you&#039;ve got the tool belt on with additional bits hanging off in the rest of it.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no question that you&#039;ve been asked to which the answer is I don&#039;t know or I can&#039;t help.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve got to figure it out.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Supreme positivity.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just like no barrier.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just like boom, boom, boom, boom.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t get through it.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to go round it.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to go over it.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you just figure it out because on that day it&#039;s not like, right, I&#039;m going to go away and think about it.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just, well, it&#039;s going to have to work.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The clock is ticking.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first year, it was pretty, I remember it being pretty overwhelming and just trying to take it all in.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I tend to be someone who learns by by doing.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got to go through something to then be able to reflect on it and figure out, OK, how can I approach this differently next time?</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> How many paracetamol?</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So the second year then, once you understand the process, you can take a bit more ownership of it.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the following year was all to do with the abolition of slavery.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was great.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoyed having the themes to work from, actually.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> As a designer, I really enjoy having having a limited set of rules that I have to work to.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It forces me to be more creative.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, something terrifying about a blank piece of paper, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> What? An infinite variety of possibilities? What?</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you just do nothing at all.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very difficult.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Community participants used to, left without, used to come up with the Simpsons or Power Rangers.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We very early had a rule saying there&#039;s nothing Simpson-esque or Power Ranger-y going to happen in this grade.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> No, definitely not. No Simpsons.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We did have a Lego, what was it, something from the Lego movie.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s public culture snuck in once we&#039;ve had our...</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> She did it well, though, fair play to her.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t even seen the movie, but it did look good.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, no, I really enjoyed that one.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it was quite a meaty theme to get your teeth into.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So, Heloise Godfrey and I made some quite large puppets with enormous heads that were big backpack costumes</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> that were like the people profiting from the slave trade, the people importing the sugar and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was great.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoyed making something large and having to figure out all of those problems.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got to find someone to go in the cost.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. Would you care to portray a baddie?</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s never a good opening line, is it?</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, would you like to be a...</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember Sambergalaius had to be colonialist 18th century troops</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and effectively subdue Caribbean slaves who escaped and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t best pleased.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t best pleased. It was like, we&#039;ll do it this time, but we don&#039;t actually want to play the forces of oppression.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t want to be meanies.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we don&#039;t want to play the forces of oppression in the future.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, that&#039;s what&#039;s the dilemma if you&#039;re trying to actually tell the story.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. And we used to make for all the bands as well.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So all of the bands had headdresses and costumes.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And although, I mean, that was full on making for all of the bands as well, because they&#039;re not in making with you.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re just trying to find members of the public to help you with it.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But the good thing about that was that you get this mass of 30 of the same things, which I always thought was just great.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They also look beautiful. They&#039;re pleasing to the something about, as you say, multiplicity, which is just like good for the brain.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, pattern. Yeah, exactly.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Look at Ikea. Repetition.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Look at Ikea.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, many things on a shelf. Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I did enjoy that, although, you know, that is easy to say that with hindsight when you&#039;re in the midst of making.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, what did Anna Rutter designed a headdress one year?</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was that year, I think, and it was ships and they all had these tiny little fiber pole masts on them.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were about 30 of them. And halfway through, you&#039;re just thinking, why are we doing this?</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There has to be a simpler way of doing this.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And she she, you know, she was very interested in making things that pleased her and that were a particular form.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think she made some fish where you had almost all of the rib, the rib parts of the fish and the fabric joined it all together.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And they looked amazing. But my God, it was absolute.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s all very well, they&#039;re going, oh, I&#039;ve designed this marvelous thing.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I like to. Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But the interesting thing about when I first started was that we used to run and we used to run the carnival in Swansea as well.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So everything we made in Cardiff, you could then add to when you got to Swansea.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And although we&#039;d be making new there as well, it gave you a base to build on.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And I loved Swansea.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was a very different beast, really, being because we were living there as well.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So everyone was staying in a shared house, which made it just that much more intense.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> No escape to Hammersmith.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the parade set off, and I do remember this, the first.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first year I did a traineeship, I was in Cardiff, but I didn&#039;t go to Swansea.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were. Heloise was one of the trainees in Swansea then.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But the second year I did, we both did both.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And Anna Rutter was working that year. This was the Spirit of Resistance one.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And she, as the carnival went off, and you know, you&#039;ve been running around like a headless chicken,</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> trying to get everyone into their costumes, everyone into their sections, all the sections in the right order.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it went off down that road because we were right at the top of the hill, weren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And she stopped me and she said, right, look at that. You did that.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just the most amazing moment to see it all spread out ahead of you.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly seeing it up and down the hills in Townhill and knowing that, in fact, Swansea Carnival,</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> about the time you&#039;re talking about, was at its peak.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And simply in terms of numbers, there were over a thousand costumes there.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And certainly I have never seen a swifter, has never produced a bigger parade before or since.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s beautiful sunshine. But something about seeing it being at the bottom of a hill and seeing it going up a slope.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we talk about rivers of light or rivers of colour.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, that was just like astounding. It was, wasn&#039;t it? Absolutely.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a high point in many ways.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve come to the end of essentially a whole summer of making because you&#039;ve done three weeks carding for Week Off, three weeks Swansea.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re completely spent. No, no, absolutely.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And the concept of a summer holiday just didn&#039;t exist for ten years.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. Yeah. But it was I mean, that was that was a moment that I&#039;ll never forget, actually.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m so pleased that she, you know, had the foresight to stop me and say, right, just take this moment.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, bless. You know, she&#039;s very sweet.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I learned a lot from from her and from Ben and Jude and from all of the artists I worked with, really.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were all very welcoming and inclusive.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Your hands don&#039;t seem unduly scarred by glue gunning.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I have learned. You have learned.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I did get a glue gun injury, one that went under my nail. They&#039;re the worst.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And it had been on, I think the gun had been on for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was in Blind Avenue. Oh, right.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Blind Avenue Carnival.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a tendency, you know, to associate the creative carnival with the smell of burning flesh.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> With the advent of the glue gun.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s true. It&#039;s true. Yes.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, that was quite a while ago.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I learned not to not to do that again.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And then, of course, you took a break from Carnival and rejoined us in 2014.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I did. So I I took a break because I went and did a teaching qualification.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was working, teaching, studying, studying, teaching and teaching at the same time, which was interesting.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I got a job working for a charity, Vision 21, who have some of the members of Vision 21 have been involved in the project as well.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So while I was there, I built up a bit of a collaboration with Swicker and Vision.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The difficult thing with Vision 21 is that the students desperately want to come, but it&#039;s not up to them whether or not they can, because they need someone to bring them.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. So they loved being involved.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Becky would come over and make things with them.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But anything where you asked for participation on a weekend, it was very, very difficult to guarantee.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very sad that there&#039;s that barrier that for many, yes, almost insuperable at times.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Really frustrating, because if you try to do anything extracurricular, they used to do almost like a sports event on a weekend and we&#039;d managed to get maybe six or seven students out of, God, you know, there must have been close to 100 attending.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a very poor turnout. Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:14:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a rush. And they were all winners. They all got medals. Yeah, it was all good.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, so I sadly then I had a proper job, which meant I couldn&#039;t take three weeks off to play with sequins and feathers and get involved with that.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had a bit of a break and then I went freelance again.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Tell us a bit about your freelance artistic practice.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, so I&#039;m a graphic designer and an illustrator.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I kind of straddle the two. So I&#039;m not quite one and not quite the other and a bit of both really.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, visual communication, really.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I do some bits of graphic design work like logos, brochures and stuff for web.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I also do some illustration work for people when they need it.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But also I teach. So I&#039;m a lecturer up in Hereford College of Arts and I do bits and pieces in Cardiff as well.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m a bit of a jigsaw of different bits and pieces, really.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But having done the proper job for a few years, I just got to the point where I was like, oh, you know what, this isn&#039;t me.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> All I was doing was managing other people and not really getting to even teach.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very much in a in a in a middle management role.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And although that was challenging in its own way, I wasn&#039;t getting the contact with people or the chance to to really be creative myself.</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So I just got to the point where I thought, you know what, I&#039;ve just got to take the plunge and see what happens.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> If it doesn&#039;t turn into anything, then I can get another job.</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But it did. So it&#039;s all good and I&#039;m happy.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent. Excellent.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I came back and it was the first year we were in Fitz Allen High, which was such a such a good venue.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Really good space.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The I didn&#039;t do it at the sports place.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Where was that?</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> At Townsview Leisure Centre.</div><div id="00:16:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I know natural daylight.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Lots of space, no natural daylight.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And really, we didn&#039;t have access to sunlight outside either.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, it was it met the brief.</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It had to be in South Cardiff.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But other than that, it was a and then the noise down there as well.</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you&#039;re in a big booming sports hall.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Very echoey.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, I popped down and visited.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I was pleased not to have.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And Fitz Allen was a great space being able to have an area for the larger costumes and an area for public and for the smaller stuff that we were doing with the groups and things.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And for the boys to go outside and do everything from sit around and chat or kick a football around, you know, far more community orientated.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So 2015.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You were with us again.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you tell us a bit about the section and your designs in particular?</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What what moments stand out for you?</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> What challenges you faced this summer just gone?</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> How was it for you, Liz?</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, because since I&#039;ve returned to the carnival, there isn&#039;t really a theme linked to to the parade.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I tend to impose my own theme because I can&#039;t I can&#039;t just pick things out of thin air.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So 2015 was the year of light, according to a scientific association somewhere I discovered.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So all of my costumes were based on on that as a starting point.</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m just thinking I had a section of fireflies who had lighter bums.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I wondered if that was going to come up.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, yeah, that was like a bums.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anybody out there?</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was really fun.</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that was that was something to get my teeth into.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What else did I have?</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a large costume, which was a Zeus based on the fact that he has lightning.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a Las Vegas section.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Was that it?</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Did I have anything else?</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was going to have a little section of lampshades, but it didn&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody was terribly excited.</div><div id="00:19:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I like the whole of the audio visions, but Las Vegas in particular quite fun because if you could get them to that, they actually had letters, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> To explain who they were.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And if the unlikely event you could persuade them to stand still in the right order, it totally decoded it.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then within two seconds, it was like, hang on.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was like, yeah, it was dyslexic nightmare.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, and the last one was the last one.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It was dyslexic nightmare.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, and the Las Vegas, the Las Vegas thing, it wasn&#039;t about Las Vegas.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was about the neon signs, which is how it linked back to the Nation of Light.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But also for me, a massive love for me is typography.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I was about to say there was something about that.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I could tell instantly where this had come from.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a nice productions.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit like that.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but it was entirely good like that.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very clear as well.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, and I do have a bit of a love for that old circus type.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called bifurcated.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that what it is?</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I like that as well.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And recently I&#039;m a veteran charity shopper and I got a national geographic from, I think,</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s about 1913 and I got it because it&#039;s got its principal articles about circus.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had an older version of exactly what you&#039;re talking about.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was trying, you know, the minute you get to a charity shop, you can run in there forever.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But as soon as I saw that typeface, it made me think of what you&#039;ve done.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just thought, oh, and it was circus.</div><div id="00:20:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Sold.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very much so.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I must get a frame for the cover, which I just thought it was.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just very beautiful artwork.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I bet.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it made me think of lots of positive times.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, sign writing is having a bit of a resurgence as well.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The people who do the lettering on ferris wheels and all that kind of stuff.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s seen as quite a hipster thing.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it?</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s an old time, I only know one sort of sign writer in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the guy in Clare Road.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know him.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He does all the work for Mario Morris, our carnival emcee.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s very distinctive, his writing and the way he approaches it.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I always know it&#039;s, oh, that&#039;s the Rangetown man, that&#039;s the Rangetown man, that&#039;s the Rangetown man.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You can spot it a mile off.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s his.</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what he does and that&#039;s how he does it.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Doesn&#039;t matter what message you want to put on it.</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they could be, you know, two antipathetic ones next to each other.</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re still his work.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like, you know, and there&#039;s something about the fact that, you know, that they were made by machine.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re also, you know, that&#039;s, yeah, no electricity was used in the production of this.</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. Yeah, you haven&#039;t just typed it into words.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Which could explain the odd spelling mistake in his work, truth be told.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But there we go.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There are many heroes in Cardiff Carnival, but I hereby declare Liz Price, you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
