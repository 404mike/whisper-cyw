So it was again trying to recognize is it going to be</div><div id="00:01:02.920" class="transcript_line"> impacted towards Skullman, Skullcombe and Ramsey? Is it going to hit the coastline?</div><div id="00:01:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Is it going to go up the Haven, which we had nature reserves up the further up the Haven?</div><div id="00:01:15.400" class="transcript_line"> Is it going to, you know, what is it, what&#039;s present? One of my roles was to actually go out</div><div id="00:01:22.200" class="transcript_line"> into the field and visually try and see what was happening, but also to meet down when they were</div><div id="00:01:28.600" class="transcript_line"> doing press releases. So they set up in Milford Haven a press room and it was on the Port Authority,</div><div id="00:01:38.200" class="transcript_line"> one of their buildings, and they were starting to release information there that you could go</div><div id="00:01:43.080" class="transcript_line"> down there and find out. But we were also preparing information to try and highlight</div><div id="00:01:48.360" class="transcript_line"> why is this important from a wildlife perspective. In the midst of all of this, you had the tourism</div><div id="00:01:55.800" class="transcript_line"> industry saying, please don&#039;t talk about this. Do not say bad things about our area. Their phones,</div><div id="00:02:02.600" class="transcript_line"> they said to me, because I was on the tourism board at the time, they said the phones have</div><div id="00:02:07.160" class="transcript_line"> stopped ringing. We have no clients whatsoever there. Why would they want to come here now?</div><div id="00:02:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Because all they see is oil on the television and you&#039;re helping to promote that.</div><div id="00:02:17.400" class="transcript_line"> And I said to them at that time, look, I said this is our only opportunity to highlight</div><div id="00:02:24.520" class="transcript_line"> something as important as an oil spill that has occurred. It&#039;s not going away. It&#039;s here.</div><div id="00:02:31.320" class="transcript_line"> I think the impact for me was as you spend years protecting an environment or environments,</div><div id="00:02:37.480" class="transcript_line"> because you were talking woodlands and meadows, and suddenly something completely out of your control</div><div id="00:02:44.200" class="transcript_line"> occurs, you realize that you failed. And so there was a sense of failure occurring. What could we</div><div id="00:02:52.120" class="transcript_line"> have done better? It was just really sad that you can spend years trying to protect something,</div><div id="00:02:59.080" class="transcript_line"> and then something like this occurs. I think because we were an on-the-ground environmental</div><div id="00:03:04.200" class="transcript_line"> group, different from other organizations that came in from the outside that were involved in</div><div id="00:03:10.520" class="transcript_line"> the environment, and they have their voice, and they have their members. We&#039;re talking</div><div id="00:03:15.560" class="transcript_line"> millions of members. We&#039;re not decrying them. Their voice is as the point is, is that we have</div><div id="00:03:21.480" class="transcript_line"> to live here on a day-to-day basis. We need to understand how people survive here in a very</div><div id="00:03:31.720" class="transcript_line"> pristine but very rural area.</div></div></p>
