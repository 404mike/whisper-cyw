    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was one thing that happened when I was president, yes, hit the newspapers,</div><div id="00:00:08.700" class="transcript_line"> well hit the Jewish Chronicle, is when I first started there was still a bit of</div><div id="00:00:15.600" class="transcript_line"> antagonism between some people of the Orthodox and some people of the Reform.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I started there was a Bar Mitzvah coming up where the mother was a</div><div id="00:00:27.660" class="transcript_line"> member of the Orthodox, the father was a member of the Orthodox and the Reform,</div><div id="00:00:33.740" class="transcript_line"> but the father&#039;s family were members of the Reform. And as I told you, you</div><div id="00:00:40.620" class="transcript_line"> read the law on the Saturday and you give segments to various members of the</div><div id="00:00:45.180" class="transcript_line"> thing. And the father, they&#039;re quite wealthy people, they&#039;ve always got their own way.</div><div id="00:00:50.620" class="transcript_line"> And the father told me that there&#039;s two things he wants. He wants his father to</div><div id="00:00:55.740" class="transcript_line"> be called up to read the law as the most important one. And also they&#039;re having a</div><div id="00:01:01.740" class="transcript_line"> function in the City Hall but they don&#039;t want it to be supervised because if it&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:06.300" class="transcript_line"> supervised, the person supervising might tell someone what a surprise the meal is</div><div id="00:01:12.420" class="transcript_line"> going to be. I thought, God, yeah, I&#039;ve got to put up with all this. So I said, look, as far as I&#039;m</div><div id="00:01:18.780" class="transcript_line"> aware, you&#039;ve got to have it supervised but we&#039;ll try and be flexible because</div><div id="00:01:23.500" class="transcript_line"> also they&#039;re having, the City Hall hasn&#039;t got kosher kitchen, so all the</div><div id="00:01:28.700" class="transcript_line"> ovens in the City Hall have to be sort of koshered, cleaned, and they&#039;re having</div><div id="00:01:34.420" class="transcript_line"> special pots and pans, good. I said, but then it&#039;s got to be supervised so</div><div id="00:01:40.100" class="transcript_line"> everything is okay because you&#039;ve got so many people coming, you know, from various</div><div id="00:01:45.220" class="transcript_line"> strands of the religion. I said, you know, I&#039;ve got a problem in that at the moment</div><div id="00:01:51.940" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s changed because of this. At the moment the Constitution of the Cardiff</div><div id="00:01:56.420" class="transcript_line"> United Synagogue says that if you&#039;re a member of the Reform Trial, you can&#039;t be</div><div id="00:02:02.180" class="transcript_line"> called up. So which is a terrible thing for the grandfather but we had people</div><div id="00:02:07.140" class="transcript_line"> around me who said this is how it is. He was a member, this is the point, he was a</div><div id="00:02:12.100" class="transcript_line"> member of the Orthodox and he left and became a member of the Reform and he knew</div><div id="00:02:17.380" class="transcript_line"> that when he became a member of the Reform he could never be called up in</div><div id="00:02:20.980" class="transcript_line"> the thing. So in the end we had a rabbi visiting that week and the person who</div><div id="00:02:28.620" class="transcript_line"> ran the services who was very right-wing said the rabbi can&#039;t make a</div><div id="00:02:33.340" class="transcript_line"> presentation, they always present the boy with, called a humish, which is a book of</div><div id="00:02:37.900" class="transcript_line"> Bible in Jewish and Hebrew and he said we&#039;re not presenting the boy with a</div><div id="00:02:43.340" class="transcript_line"> humish and we&#039;re not going to have a sermon. So I said but it&#039;s not the boy&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:49.700" class="transcript_line"> fault, it&#039;s the boy&#039;s big day, what do you want to do in the boy&#039;s day over this? I</div><div id="00:02:54.740" class="transcript_line"> said he&#039;s got to. So they said no, as far as we&#039;re concerned, no. So I went to see them</div><div id="00:03:00.060" class="transcript_line"> and I said look we&#039;ve got to do something about this. So I said I&#039;ll tell you what I</div><div id="00:03:03.620" class="transcript_line"> can do and I said I&#039;ll arrange for the supervision of the food and everything to</div><div id="00:03:12.340" class="transcript_line"> be done and our kosher, the arrangement for the everything to be kosher, some</div><div id="00:03:17.940" class="transcript_line"> rituals, so you needn&#039;t worry, done. Someone will go in at six o&#039;clock in the</div><div id="00:03:22.460" class="transcript_line"> morning, the man suing the supervision will go in at six o&#039;clock in the morning,</div><div id="00:03:27.660" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ll clean the ovens, the man who&#039;s supervising the food will leave at nine</div><div id="00:03:34.620" class="transcript_line"> o&#039;clock. So if you want to do anything extra after nine it won&#039;t be supervised</div><div id="00:03:40.980" class="transcript_line"> but we&#039;ll accept it. And I said as far as your father&#039;s concerned he can&#039;t be</div><div id="00:03:46.140" class="transcript_line"> called up to read the law but I&#039;ll arrange for him to be called up to have</div><div id="00:03:50.980" class="transcript_line"> some other honour, lesser honour. And they said fine, okay. So then the day before</div><div id="00:03:58.580" class="transcript_line"> this permits Friday night doing surgery I get a phone call, you&#039;ve got to</div><div id="00:04:04.500" class="transcript_line"> come here straight away. I said I can&#039;t go, I&#039;m in the middle of surgery. No you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:04:09.060" class="transcript_line"> to come straight away. I said what&#039;s happened? The family said they don&#039;t want</div><div id="00:04:13.780" class="transcript_line"> the father to have the special honour, they want him to read the law and</div><div id="00:04:17.700" class="transcript_line"> therefore the senior warden says if that&#039;s the case I&#039;m not going in to at</div><div id="00:04:23.140" class="transcript_line"> six o&#039;clock in the morning and to do all this. So I thought hell. So what happened</div><div id="00:04:30.140" class="transcript_line"> in the end is I did the presentation, I gave the sermon in the synagogue and</div><div id="00:04:38.420" class="transcript_line"> the family, and also I praised the grandfather, how wonderful it&#039;s to see him</div><div id="00:04:44.540" class="transcript_line"> fit and well and he survived the Holocaust and we&#039;re pleased to see him etc etc.</div><div id="00:04:49.260" class="transcript_line"> And the family came up and thanked me, said thank you very much, you&#039;ve made</div><div id="00:04:53.060" class="transcript_line"> the day, you know it&#039;s been a wonderful day and everyone was happy. Six months</div><div id="00:04:58.260" class="transcript_line"> later, six months later, headlines in the Jewish Chronicle, Shul prevents</div><div id="00:05:05.540" class="transcript_line"> grandfather from being called up for his grandson&#039;s permits for and the</div><div id="00:05:10.300" class="transcript_line"> grandfather had given this whole story to the Jewish Chronicle. Now A, it was</div><div id="00:05:16.220" class="transcript_line"> wrong, so I wrote it, but B, the Jewish Chronicle have writers who are</div><div id="00:05:20.940" class="transcript_line"> syndicated all over the world, so two of the people who have actually</div><div id="00:05:26.180" class="transcript_line"> attacked me personally over this as if I was the one to blather, I was trying to</div><div id="00:05:30.900" class="transcript_line"> smooth things over and what happened was when my son went to Australia</div><div id="00:05:37.540" class="transcript_line"> and he got called up in the synagogue and they said, what&#039;s your name?</div><div id="00:05:42.500" class="transcript_line"> He said, where you from Carl? He said, you&#039;re no relation to that man who refused to</div><div id="00:05:48.940" class="transcript_line"> let the grandfather, and he said, yes, he said, well we feel like shucking you off.</div><div id="00:05:55.100" class="transcript_line"> So that was quite dramatic, that was goes down in the history, but</div><div id="00:06:01.660" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s changed now, they had to change it because there&#039;s so few men and so</div><div id="00:06:06.580" class="transcript_line"> you know through actual what&#039;s going on they had to change the Constitution.</div></div></p>
