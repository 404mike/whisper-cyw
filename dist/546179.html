    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There were the useful presents. Engulfing mufflers of the old court days and mittens made for giant sloths.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Zebra scarves of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o-warred down to the galoshes.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Blinding tamarish hunters like patchwork teak hoses and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> From ants who always wore wool next to the skin, there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the ants had any skin left at all.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And once I had a little crocheted nose-bag from an ant now, alas, no longer winnieing with us.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles&#039; pond and did and drowned.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And books that told me everything about the wasp except why.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Bags of moist and many-coloured jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram conductor&#039;s cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Never a catapult. Once, by mistake, that no one could explain a little hatchet.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unduck-like sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red humbugs, glaciers, marzipan and butter Welsh for the Welsh.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And troops of bright-tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And snakes and families and happy ladders and easy hobby games for little engineers, complete with instructions.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, easy for Leonardo.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And a whistle to make the dogs bark, to wake up the old man next door, to make him beat on the wall with his stick, to shake our picture off the wall.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And a packet of cigarettes. You put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours in vain for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then with a smirk you ate it.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was breakfast under the balloons.</div></div></p>
