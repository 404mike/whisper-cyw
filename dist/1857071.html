    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pleased to reminisce and speak about my relationship with Wales. I&#039;m Dave Stephanie</div><div id="00:00:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Shirley, but in the time that I&#039;m talking about, my name was Vera Buchtal. Nobody could</div><div id="00:00:15.840" class="transcript_line"> pronounce it because it was spelled B-U-C-H-T-H-A-L. I came over as an unaccompanied child refugee</div><div id="00:00:25.080" class="transcript_line"> from Nazi Europe and had settled with foster parents in the Midlands of England and with</div><div id="00:00:30.080" class="transcript_line"> whom I was very happy. I was doubly lucky because both my birth parents survived, but</div><div id="00:00:39.080" class="transcript_line"> sadly I never bonded with them again. That often happens when families are separated.</div><div id="00:00:46.080" class="transcript_line"> I was with my older sister. We couldn&#039;t bear to let go of each other because it was such</div><div id="00:00:52.120" class="transcript_line"> a major uprooting to come from one country to a new country, different language, different</div><div id="00:00:58.120" class="transcript_line"> parents, different food, different everything. It was traumatic. When we got to England,</div><div id="00:01:05.120" class="transcript_line"> we lived with our foster parents and I started to visit Osmousby where my mother had settled</div><div id="00:01:12.120" class="transcript_line"> around about 1942. She had gone to Osmousby partly because it was a border town and she</div><div id="00:01:21.160" class="transcript_line"> thought that would help in our assimilation. We knew one other family, the Ryders. There</div><div id="00:01:28.160" class="transcript_line"> was no antisemitism in Osmousby. Correction, certainly not as far as I&#039;m concerned. I</div><div id="00:01:35.160" class="transcript_line"> was in Osmousby for six years from 1946 to 1951 and it was quite an important time for</div><div id="00:01:43.160" class="transcript_line"> me, partly because I needed peace and quiet after the turmoil of leaving Austria and my</div><div id="00:01:51.160" class="transcript_line"> parents and Osmousby gave me that. When I got to Osmousby, the unisex school apparently</div><div id="00:02:01.160" class="transcript_line"> announced that two little refugee girls were arriving and that they would be very disturbed</div><div id="00:02:06.160" class="transcript_line"> and everyone was to be very nice to us. Certainly that happened. We were not made to feel unwelcome</div><div id="00:02:13.160" class="transcript_line"> at all and I had no idea that the school had been primed for our ingress until years later.</div><div id="00:02:21.160" class="transcript_line"> I needed those six years of peace in Osmousby to put down roots. I was very conscious that</div><div id="00:02:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Osmousby is politically English but geographically Wales. On market days, the farmers came down</div><div id="00:02:40.160" class="transcript_line"> from the hills with their cattle and the whole town spoke Welsh, which I do not. It was a</div><div id="00:02:48.160" class="transcript_line"> very warm community. The other link that got us to Wales was my father&#039;s story. In 1940,</div><div id="00:02:56.160" class="transcript_line"> he was interned as an adult German to New South Wales, Australia and then got the opportunity</div><div id="00:03:03.160" class="transcript_line"> to come out of his internment camp and join the pioneer corps in England. First he was</div><div id="00:03:11.160" class="transcript_line"> in Bicester and then he was put in charge of what became the Mid Wales Psychiatric Hospital</div><div id="00:03:18.160" class="transcript_line"> at Talgarth. So for several years we would occasionally see him at Talgarth. I can remember</div><div id="00:03:27.160" class="transcript_line"> picking bilberries on the Brecon Beacons and really feeling the mountain environment that</div><div id="00:03:33.160" class="transcript_line"> I was accustomed to in Austria. There are lots of things that make Wales very dear to</div><div id="00:03:41.160" class="transcript_line"> me. I can remember my tears of joy when I heard people singing spontaneously on the</div><div id="00:03:50.160" class="transcript_line"> trains. Maybe I was going to Talgarth, which would happen very much in continental Europe.</div><div id="00:03:58.160" class="transcript_line"> And I sung in my school choir at the Iced Steadford in Langlaster one year. Later I was billeted</div><div id="00:04:06.160" class="transcript_line"> in Oakhurst, a hospital for girls. It was an old manor house that had been used commercially</div><div id="00:04:14.160" class="transcript_line"> by the Coventry Climax Company and is today back in private hands. Osborne Street Town</div><div id="00:04:21.160" class="transcript_line"> Council have brought up a blue plaque for me in the centre of the town alongside Wilfred</div><div id="00:04:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Owen, one of the great World War I poets. And I&#039;m sponsoring a history of Oakhurst</div><div id="00:04:35.160" class="transcript_line"> as a thank you. I had the feeling of this quiet and musical country that valued education.</div><div id="00:04:46.160" class="transcript_line"> I think that resonated with me even as a child. So there are lots and lots of links with Wales.</div><div id="00:04:54.160" class="transcript_line"> My sister Renata was four years older than I, so she was nine when we arrived in England,</div><div id="00:05:01.160" class="transcript_line"> ten plus at Osborne Street. She became infected with the polio virus and was paralysed in</div><div id="00:05:08.160" class="transcript_line"> an iron lung at the orthopaedic hospital for ten months. The Park Hall Military Training</div><div id="00:05:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Establishment was there. So this small hall, Robert James and Agnes Hunt Hospital had wonderful</div><div id="00:05:24.160" class="transcript_line"> facilities and in particular they had penicillin, which was scarce in those days. She managed</div><div id="00:05:32.160" class="transcript_line"> to get two doses of penicillin a day for goodness knows how long. It was really rather remarkable</div><div id="00:05:40.160" class="transcript_line"> that they should do that for a refugee child. I&#039;ve been to Osborne Street a couple of times</div><div id="00:05:48.160" class="transcript_line"> recently once to unveil the blue plaque when I met some Syrian refugees who&#039;d also been</div><div id="00:05:56.160" class="transcript_line"> made to feel welcome. The town is starting to feel proud of its border status, that it</div><div id="00:06:04.160" class="transcript_line"> really can welcome different cultures and find them interesting without having to necessarily</div><div id="00:06:10.160" class="transcript_line"> wanting to change them. Osborne Street is especially important to me because unusually</div><div id="00:06:20.160" class="transcript_line"> they allowed me to study mathematics, which in those days girls did not do. The only science</div><div id="00:06:27.160" class="transcript_line"> thought respectable for girls of that generation was botany, the study of plants. But I wanted</div><div id="00:06:35.160" class="transcript_line"> to study maths and I was pretty firm about it. They put me through some psychological</div><div id="00:06:43.160" class="transcript_line"> testing and eventually agreed. But my girls&#039; school did not have the capability to teach</div><div id="00:06:49.160" class="transcript_line"> maths at the school certificate level, we called it that then. And so I had to go to</div><div id="00:06:54.160" class="transcript_line"> the boys&#039; school for all my maths lessons. So I was always walking between the two schools,</div><div id="00:07:02.160" class="transcript_line"> which had different timings. But thankfully somebody, somewhere, had enough sense to realise</div><div id="00:07:08.160" class="transcript_line"> that I should study mathematics. I wanted to and I had the capability. And that was</div><div id="00:07:16.160" class="transcript_line"> important to me because I spent my main career in the computer industry, which in the early</div><div id="00:07:21.160" class="transcript_line"> days was highly mathematical. So Oxford Street has made my career and I&#039;m very conscious</div><div id="00:07:30.160" class="transcript_line"> of that. Starting at 18, I had a vigorous professional career which was thoroughly enjoyable</div><div id="00:07:40.160" class="transcript_line"> and now at age 88 I still enjoy work. When I nominally retired at the age of 60, I put</div><div id="00:07:48.160" class="transcript_line"> my energies and efforts into philanthropy. I operate as a venture philanthropist, not</div><div id="00:07:57.160" class="transcript_line"> just giving money to charities, though I do that as well, but seeing problems, working</div><div id="00:08:04.160" class="transcript_line"> out a solution, doing a feasibility study to see if we can make something happen. All</div><div id="00:08:12.160" class="transcript_line"> philanthropists, nothing to do with stamps by the way, all philanthropists aim to make</div><div id="00:08:19.160" class="transcript_line"> the world a fairer place. I suppose having been considered subhuman by the Nazis, I&#039;m</div><div id="00:08:27.160" class="transcript_line"> conscious of my own position in the world and I&#039;m dedicated to vulnerable people wherever</div><div id="00:08:33.160" class="transcript_line"> they are. In general, I work with people with autism spectrum disorders. I work with people</div><div id="00:08:41.160" class="transcript_line"> with autism disorders because that was my late son&#039;s condition. So three quarters of</div><div id="00:08:47.160" class="transcript_line"> my total spend of some 70 million to date is on autism and the rest is on my professional</div><div id="00:08:55.160" class="transcript_line"> discipline of information technology. These are the two things I know and care about.</div><div id="00:09:03.160" class="transcript_line"> There may be other things more important, but that is what I choose to do. I&#039;m a very</div><div id="00:09:11.160" class="transcript_line"> good person. My venture philanthropy in autism resulted in quite a few Welsh projects. Because</div><div id="00:09:17.160" class="transcript_line"> I felt that a bilingual country was particularly hard for people with communication difficulties.</div><div id="00:09:25.160" class="transcript_line"> In 1999, a very invigorating and creative year for me, I started several projects, one</div><div id="00:09:33.160" class="transcript_line"> of which was called Autism Connect, which was a portal website on autism and that combined</div><div id="00:09:43.160" class="transcript_line"> with the Welsh the words, saving the Blondifredd School for Autism from closure. When my consultant</div><div id="00:09:51.160" class="transcript_line"> looked at this school, the physical conditions were ghastly with wooden boards going across</div><div id="00:09:58.160" class="transcript_line"> a muddy playground out to the toilets. You knew very well that no inspector would visit</div><div id="00:10:05.160" class="transcript_line"> because he would have to have the school closed down forthwith. But you could see the excellent</div><div id="00:10:11.160" class="transcript_line"> teaching of extremely vulnerable, difficult to reach children. So I was happy to be able</div><div id="00:10:19.160" class="transcript_line"> to contribute to Wales in keeping that school going. I visited it in the last few years.</div><div id="00:10:26.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now first class all round. I was also privileged to open the Ty Corridan School</div><div id="00:10:34.160" class="transcript_line"> for Autism in Cardiff. I&#039;ve set up the all party parliamentary group for autism in Westminster,</div><div id="00:10:43.160" class="transcript_line"> and that had turned into the second largest such group. Because of that success, I tried</div><div id="00:10:51.160" class="transcript_line"> the same in Scotland, which failed, but was a success in Wales where the all party group</div><div id="00:10:58.160" class="transcript_line"> eventually merged with the national charity for Wales, Autism Cymru, which I also founded</div><div id="00:11:04.160" class="transcript_line"> and initially chaired. Autism Cymru had a lifespan of 11 years and took Wales to be</div><div id="00:11:12.160" class="transcript_line"> the first country in the world to have a national autism project. It was a success in the last</div><div id="00:11:20.160" class="transcript_line"> year. It also absorbed the Autism Connect portal website. As the National Ambassador</div><div id="00:11:28.160" class="transcript_line"> for Philanthropy in 2009 and 10, I spoke in the Senate Building to the Community Foundation</div><div id="00:11:36.160" class="transcript_line"> of Wales. I&#039;ve set up another Welsh project about PEX, Picture Exchange Communication</div><div id="00:11:43.160" class="transcript_line"> System, where you&#039;re teaching children with, well, adults for that matter, with very little</div><div id="00:11:53.160" class="transcript_line"> communication capabilities. By looking at picture exchange, you&#039;d show a picture and</div><div id="00:12:01.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s word underneath. Tomorrow you would see the same picture with the word underneath.</div><div id="00:12:08.160" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re trying to set up the association. Then day by day, the picture would get smaller</div><div id="00:12:16.160" class="transcript_line"> and smaller, leaving the word underneath. And many months later, the child is reading.</div><div id="00:12:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Very basic stuff, but the beginnings of communication when you&#039;ve got somebody who is really without</div><div id="00:12:31.160" class="transcript_line"> speech. That project was also subsumed into Autism Cymru. Autism Cymru was instrumental</div><div id="00:12:41.160" class="transcript_line"> in getting the first chair in autism, I think, in the world, certainly in Britain. That was</div><div id="00:12:48.160" class="transcript_line"> at Cardiff University and was a big step forward. Bilingual Wales certainly led the British</div><div id="00:12:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Isles for some time in opening doors for people with autism and in looking after the half</div><div id="00:13:04.160" class="transcript_line"> a million autistic people and their families in Wales. And that&#039;s a quick summary of my</div><div id="00:13:12.160" class="transcript_line"> recollections of and relations with Wales.</div></div></p>
