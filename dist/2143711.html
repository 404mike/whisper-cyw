    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But the difficult part was to hear your own family. My children, I can only, I&#039;ve always</div><div id="00:00:09.600" class="transcript_line"> called them my children, I can&#039;t help it. My children never cried unless they were hungry.</div><div id="00:00:19.920" class="transcript_line"> And when they cried they were hungry. I couldn&#039;t tolerate this. So after a while I went to the</div><div id="00:00:29.400" class="transcript_line"> superintendent. I must explain first that I had long blonde plaits and blue eyes. My</div><div id="00:00:48.120" class="transcript_line"> brother also was fair. We didn&#039;t look very Jewish. And I decided that we were going shopping.</div><div id="00:00:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So I went to the superintendent and said, please can I have some money? I wanted to know why. I</div><div id="00:01:06.480" class="transcript_line"> said my children are hungry. I want to go shopping. So we did. We went to different parts of town.</div><div id="00:01:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Because normally we weren&#039;t allowed out of the orphanage gates. We went to different parts of</div><div id="00:01:23.480" class="transcript_line"> town and we shopped. And the two little children with an enormous basket full of necessities of</div><div id="00:01:33.560" class="transcript_line"> life. And we knew the necessities. And we got away with it for about two months. And we suddenly</div><div id="00:01:42.640" class="transcript_line"> found we were followed by Nazi youths. And they caught us one day and beat us and took our basket.</div><div id="00:01:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And literally threw us into the gates of the orphanage and called us all the vile names they</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> could lay tongue to. And the superintendent said, you know, that&#039;s it, no more. For a while that was</div><div id="00:02:09.200" class="transcript_line"> it, no more. Until I could no longer bear to hear my children cry. I went to the superintendent.</div><div id="00:02:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Excuse me.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, please can I have some money?</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she said, not going out again. I said, if you don&#039;t give me money, I will steal it.</div><div id="00:02:41.440" class="transcript_line"> I was a very obstinate child and I still am. She looked me straight behind and said,</div><div id="00:02:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I believe you would. She gave me money. We went out to the little gate on the other side.</div><div id="00:02:57.680" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t get away with it for very long.</div><div id="00:03:01.840" class="transcript_line"> After a few weeks somebody must have followed us again. This time we were caught by the Gestapo</div><div id="00:03:08.240" class="transcript_line"> and beaten with truncheons. Sorry. My brother was eight and I was nine.</div><div id="00:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And ever since I&#039;ve had 240 kidneys,</div><div id="00:03:29.920" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve been TEACHED that</div><div id="00:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> grown men who age of nine years, and the symptoms of blood abscess,</div></div></p>
