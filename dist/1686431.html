I gotta say I watched</div><div id="00:02:50.080" class="transcript_line"> that program that was the um Cardiff footballer yeah yeah yeah and I thought and that&#039;s that&#039;s who</div><div id="00:02:58.800" class="transcript_line"> you can come up with my grand my granddad was a miner yeah I thought he was poor because I knew</div><div id="00:03:06.720" class="transcript_line"> quite a few men who were miners it&#039;s like after the um the west indians had settled in Cardiff</div><div id="00:03:16.720" class="transcript_line"> yeah they were all lumberjacks up in Scotland but it but you know Peter it&#039;s like the guys who</div><div id="00:03:23.040" class="transcript_line"> went through the first world war on the ships like my granddad did my man my nan said to him</div><div id="00:03:28.880" class="transcript_line"> you ain&#039;t going you ain&#039;t going again you ain&#039;t going to war it on the ships during war again</div><div id="00:03:35.600" class="transcript_line"> so second world war they everybody moved up to Geckley Gare and they were working on the mines</div><div id="00:03:41.840" class="transcript_line"> working on the mines so loads loads of black Caribbean particularly merchant seamen</div><div id="00:03:48.480" class="transcript_line"> were up the valleys so correct did not be able to come up with any I just thought with two or three</div><div id="00:03:54.880" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was poor that was like a lack of asking people you you know because you&#039;ve done</div><div id="00:04:00.880" class="transcript_line"> yourself if you&#039;re going to do something do it with a good research I don&#039;t bother at all</div><div id="00:04:06.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah that&#039;s my feeling if you&#039;re going to do it at least what I&#039;m interested in is invisible history</div><div id="00:04:14.240" class="transcript_line"> you know what exactly what I mean and that&#039;s that&#039;s our history it&#039;s invisible it&#039;s inconvenient</div><div id="00:04:22.480" class="transcript_line"> so to just come up with two or three that&#039;s feeding the people who don&#039;t really want to know</div><div id="00:04:29.440" class="transcript_line"> about us well yeah because as you see I mean I was I was amazed because he didn&#039;t go far</div><div

that&#039;s he said he said I watched that</div><div id="00:05:05.600" class="transcript_line"> program and I thought what have you done you you&#039;re not even asked anybody you ask any miner in the</div><div id="00:05:11.760" class="transcript_line"> valleys over 60 or over 70 they&#039;ll name two or three guys they knew exactly exactly like that</div><div id="00:05:19.680" class="transcript_line"> and they knew and liked not just you know it&#039;s not about you know racism whatever else</div><div id="00:05:28.960" class="transcript_line"> people they knew and liked but you see as I said to you he never even went down the Swansea valley</div><div id="00:05:36.800" class="transcript_line"> to check out people and you&#039;ve got to go if you&#039;re going to make a program like that and he&#039;s not</div><div id="00:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody who&#039;s not known he&#039;s a well-known player he&#039;s a well-known reporter the self of his echo</div><div id="00:05:50.080" class="transcript_line"> I just thought he was poor I was kept on saying to myself he haven&#039;t asked so and so and he</div><div id="00:05:55.920" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t asked this person yeah and I thought well it&#039;s not for me to tell him what to go and ask</div><div id="00:06:01.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean that that&#039;s what strikes me it was lazy it was lazy the idea is good and it needs doing</div><div id="00:06:07.280" class="transcript_line"> it in my generation in the 50s and 60s you&#039;ve never you&#039;ve never had no blacks working on the</div><div id="00:06:14.480" class="transcript_line"> on the dock on the wet dock you had no blacks working there it was family after family was all</div><div id="00:06:20.560" class="transcript_line"> white yeah as I say to you when when you when you think about they talk about this black lives matter</div><div id="00:06:28.400" class="transcript_line"> fewer discrimination they wouldn&#039;t allow you in the ducks conservative club they wouldn&#039;t allow you</div><div id="00:06:35.680" class="transcript_line"> in green town conservative club and one of the sweetest stories I ever heard</div><div id="00:06:40.960" class="transcript_line"> was a colored gentleman that I knew personally who went to the docks conservative club in other</div><div id="00:06:48.480" class="transcript_line"> street and they said he wasn&#039;t allowed he wasn&#039;t welcome to when he pulled out his affiliation card</div><div id="00:06:57.040" class="transcript_line"> of being a member in rummy conservative club the quiet went the club went quiet</div><div id="00:07:03.920" class="transcript_line"> and he said no put me out he didn&#039;t put him out but these are people that&#039;s what I say to you</div><div id="00:07:10.640" class="transcript_line"> you always you&#039;re the same old cliche oh my best friend is so soft yeah and I used to say to him</div><div id="00:07:17.680" class="transcript_line"> you wouldn&#039;t like him marrying your daughter and they used to go quiet</div><div id="00:07:21.440" class="transcript_line"> they go quiet tell it like it is it&#039;s true but you you mentioned the place that I probably enjoyed</div><div id="00:07:28.400" class="transcript_line"> I used to go to regular was my stay yeah because my stay got a nice little nice little nightclub</div><div id="00:07:35.200" class="transcript_line"> there four sevens it was a regular place to go and uh it was well we always I played with we are</div><div id="00:07:42.080" class="transcript_line"> lower valleys and we was always made welcome because as you said there was black miners up</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> there were you playing for the kayaks then peter yep yep they yeah there is no way you go in the</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> valleys on any rugby any rugby club whether you know the major ones all the small ones</div><div id="00:08:01.920" class="transcript_line"> you mentioned the kayaks and all of them their faces light up and they say hardest game I ever</div><div id="00:08:09.680" class="transcript_line"> played but the best night I ever had yeah and the best thing about it was one of the reason</div><div id="00:08:20.480" class="transcript_line"> the main reasons that we played up the valleys or regular was because we could go into the</div><div id="00:08:27.840" class="transcript_line"> pitted bars and have a good shower instead of dragging that old big tumble bath out in your</div><div id="00:08:33.120" class="transcript_line"> own house to buy in the cows and that was that was the main reason I was oh there&#039;s lovely and</div><div id="00:08:38.880" class="transcript_line"> a nice shower you haven&#039;t got to drag that big bath out and fill it with hot water and then empty it</div><div id="00:08:45.840" class="transcript_line"> so that&#039;s why and as I said I still got friends from all over the valleys they sent Christmas</div><div id="00:08:52.400" class="transcript_line"> cards to and from play rugby in the 50s and 60s and you see this is this is the thing we youngsters</div><div id="00:09:00.240" class="transcript_line"> today they don&#039;t keep their relationships today no they are it seems to me there&#039;s a there&#039;s a</div><div id="00:09:06.800" class="transcript_line"> chip on the shoulders instead of getting out to meet the people well you know you know you take</div><div id="00:09:11.840" class="transcript_line"> you take the work that that Kyra is doing with with the community and give no parcels</div><div id="00:09:19.200" class="transcript_line"> he shouldn&#039;t be on his own there should be everybody you could drive and come</div><div id="00:09:22.640" class="transcript_line"> motorist he&#039;d go in and say Kyra I&#039;m available I&#039;m available I&#039;m available yeah but that&#039;s not there</div><div id="00:09:29.040" class="transcript_line"> no more it&#039;s gone it&#039;s gone years ago he&#039;d be intoxicated with cash he&#039;d say no I got plenty</div><div id="00:09:37.360" class="transcript_line"> I got plenty I got plenty because everybody would know it&#039;s us I&#039;ve been letting get on with it</div><div id="00:09:42.400" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s also but it&#039;s also Peter years ago say you were 20 years old and you walk into your</div><div id="00:09:49.360" class="transcript_line"> into your house you know your mum and dad&#039;s house and your mum or your dad would turn around and go</div><div id="00:09:54.880" class="transcript_line">
