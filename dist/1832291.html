    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Avril Hopwood.</div><div id="00:00:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you Avril.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother was Marjorie Roach.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s Kenneth Roach and Ruth Roach, my mum.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then little Avril Roach.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The thing is, my father is very well known.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t matter where he goes within the county, north or south.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Ken Roach.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like so many people know him.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They farmed in Llanboydy.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> My father worked on the estate in Bracely until he led in the army.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he became a bricklayer.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But no matter where you go, even if you go into a pub somewhere, someone knows him.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Ken Roach.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go camping, apparently, when I was a very young child, up in the Bracelys.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like 50 years ago.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a trek to go to the Bracelys, if you can imagine all the lanes.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Cairw was brought up first when I was very young.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmother is from the Bracely area.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> She was born in the Aberston area, so south of the county.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t speak Welsh, but we often went camping apparently up in the mountains.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I love these photos because it&#039;s before my brother was born.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And we all look so young, as we do.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the things you used to bring.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s even a teapot with a tea cozy on it.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, who&#039;d bring a tea cozy camping?</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t dream of that today.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I know we used to have a lot of fun.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Me digging in the mud.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Got to dig in the mud, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Like some mud pies.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure there must have been water somewhere because wherever...</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I always found water apparently.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I was always wet.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to play in this...</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a few streams coming down the Bracelys, and they seem to have been less of them now than they were when I was little.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember even as a young girl, there were more of a stream.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas now they&#039;re like trickles.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But before you could even find the facial tadpoles and things.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But nowadays you don&#039;t seem to see that in them, which is a shame.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to bring my girls up when they were young as well.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I live in Haverdwast.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m again, like, from Caerw originally.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we went to Lanffy.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we slept in the van.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> From what I remember.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Really, it was like it had a very big bed at the back.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> A very big open bed with bench sheets.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think my father slept out under the van.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> From what I&#039;ve been told.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother and me, me cutched in the middle.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Bless.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only from what I&#039;ve been told.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They more than likely had a mattress in there, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I really wouldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t sleeping bags then.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quilts and blankets.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But it does look as though it wasn&#039;t too cold.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It looks like it&#039;s summer.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s not too bad.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Nice silk quilts.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother had two or three of them.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they, I don&#039;t know what became of them, which is a shame.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m lucky enough to have nearly all their photos.</div></div></p>
