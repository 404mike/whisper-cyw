    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Carder Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Heather Brown.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Location Swicker Office.</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date the 29th of September 2015.</div><div id="00:00:19.400" class="transcript_line"> Heather, would you be kited up for the record to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s Heather.</div><div id="00:00:25.400" class="transcript_line"> H-E-A-T-H-E-R Brown.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> B-R-O-W-N.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Carder Carnival obviously dates back to 1990.</div><div id="00:00:36.400" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember when you first got involved and in what capacity?</div><div id="00:00:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, I recall first seeing the carnival around about 1994, 95,</div><div id="00:00:47.400" class="transcript_line"> when I watched various parades.</div><div id="00:00:49.800" class="transcript_line"> But I got involved, I think, in 1997</div><div id="00:00:53.800" class="transcript_line"> when I started working for Cardiff Council, initially as a production assistant</div><div id="00:01:00.800" class="transcript_line"> and then in later years as the development manager,</div><div id="00:01:05.800" class="transcript_line"> where I kind of worked more closely with Steve in terms of developing routes</div><div id="00:01:11.400" class="transcript_line"> and looking at venues and trying to decide where to go next</div><div id="00:01:16.200" class="transcript_line"> and trying to help with places for the camp, etc.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So at various different levels I&#039;ve worked with the carnival</div><div id="00:01:23.200" class="transcript_line"> for, well, it&#039;s nearly 20 years.</div><div id="00:01:27.600" class="transcript_line"> And you have the emotional scars to prove it.</div><div id="00:01:29.400" class="transcript_line"> I have, yes.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, one thing I&#039;ve always enjoyed about working with Heather,</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> who is better known as Hetty, is your unflappability.</div><div id="00:01:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Carnival is a riot of colour.</div><div id="00:01:42.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s certainly not a riot in a political sense,</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s an energy and enthusiasm and a libertarian outlook</div><div id="00:01:51.400" class="transcript_line"> which can be daunting to some.</div><div id="00:01:53.800" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s true to say in all the time we&#039;ve worked together,</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> have you ever come close to losing your carnival cool?</div><div id="00:02:02.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I have.</div><div id="00:02:03.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I enjoy the chaos.</div><div id="00:02:06.600" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the truth of it.</div><div id="00:02:08.800" class="transcript_line"> There is an element of not knowing what&#039;s going to happen.</div><div id="00:02:11.400" class="transcript_line"> There is an element of just kind of starting off and seeing where it goes.</div><div id="00:02:14.800" class="transcript_line"> But most of the time I can honestly say I&#039;ve really enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:02:18.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we have had some really insane moments.</div><div id="00:02:22.200" class="transcript_line"> And I think the half naked blue ladies of whichever carnival that was</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> spring to mind in terms of not knowing what the reaction to that was going to be like.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had some crazy people join us on the parade.</div><div id="00:02:37.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s always one that is kind of hard to predict.</div><div id="00:02:40.600" class="transcript_line"> You know, the participants usually know what&#039;s expected of them and where they&#039;re going.</div><div id="00:02:44.400" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, so many times people have just stepped in.</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> And again, you know, have been either encouraged or discouraged,</div><div id="00:02:51.600" class="transcript_line"> depending on their general behaviour.</div><div id="00:02:54.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:56.800" class="transcript_line"> But no, you know, I think, you know, weather as well.</div><div id="00:02:59.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we&#039;ve had some ferocious weather to contend with sometimes.</div><div id="00:03:03.800" class="transcript_line"> And again, I think the fact that there&#039;s a deluge years as is known in the company.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> 2005, six and seven, three in a row, five, six and seven.</div><div id="00:03:11.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re talking not rain, not precipitation.</div><div id="00:03:15.400" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re talking complete whiter.</div><div id="00:03:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re talking all day.</div><div id="00:03:19.200" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s during the setup, during the parade.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So our audience is affected and those who appear</div><div id="00:03:25.200" class="transcript_line"> turn up in like full body sou&#039;esters, which is they&#039;ve just come off a trawler ship or something.</div><div id="00:03:30.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think, again, the thing that I&#039;ve always admired about the participants</div><div id="00:03:34.800" class="transcript_line"> is they&#039;re just up for it regardless.</div><div id="00:03:36.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s weatherproof in that sense.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve worked so hard.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve put everything into the sort of the two weeks or the two months</div><div id="00:03:42.400" class="transcript_line"> or however long they&#039;ve been working and preparing and what they&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:03:45.600" class="transcript_line"> And they just they want to do it regardless.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think only once have we postponed it for a day.</div><div id="00:03:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Was there one year where we didn&#039;t do it on the Saturday, but we did it on the Sunday?</div><div id="00:03:54.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there was in all honesty.</div><div id="00:03:58.200" class="transcript_line"> You think we&#039;ve always put it on the act of it?</div><div id="00:03:59.200" class="transcript_line"> The only parade we&#039;ve ever postponed, and it was postponed, it was cancelled, was actually</div><div id="00:04:06.800" class="transcript_line"> not the Cardiff Carnival itself, but the first ever time we attempted to remount it</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> for Cardiff Bay Development Corporation.</div><div id="00:04:15.800" class="transcript_line"> And it was the day on which the evening before Lady Diana had died in a car crash in Paris.</div><div id="00:04:23.400" class="transcript_line"> And then the morning came and then gradually it became apparent as football matches were being cancelled.</div><div id="00:04:30.800" class="transcript_line"> That was the Rainbow Festival.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there we are.</div><div id="00:04:32.800" class="transcript_line"> It was going to be the Rainbow Festival.</div><div id="00:04:34.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:34.800" class="transcript_line"> And the news came through when we were building the site really early in the morning, sort of like 6 o&#039;clock, I think.</div><div id="00:04:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all over the UK, everything was being cancelled.</div><div id="00:04:45.600" class="transcript_line"> And so that&#039;s the only one that, yes, I think I would remember if it had been postponed its entirety.</div><div id="00:04:51.400" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the other thing that I have to say to the credit as myself, as one of the organisers, is</div><div id="00:04:58.400" class="transcript_line"> the carnival has never not started exactly on time.</div><div id="00:05:02.800" class="transcript_line"> And if you&#039;ve ever tried to organise hundreds of excited people and to get them in the right line up,</div><div id="00:05:10.200" class="transcript_line"> all things to actually be able to do what it says on the tin as advertised, it will start at this time.</div><div id="00:05:18.600" class="transcript_line"> You know, in 26 years, you know, I&#039;ve never looked at you or Yanis, your colleague and said we&#039;re not ready.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s absolutely true.</div><div id="00:05:26.800" class="transcript_line"> And anyone who&#039;s ever seen that kind of time before it sort of steps off where, you know, everybody&#039;s getting ready,</div><div id="00:05:34.400" class="transcript_line"> be it in the car park of the atrium or, you know, at Buton Community Centre or wherever it was,</div><div id="00:05:39.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, there&#039;s just this gradual build up and build up of excitement and kind of buzz.</div><div id="00:05:44.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s almost like, you know, you&#039;re not going to contain it any longer.</div><div id="00:05:47.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, if it&#039;s going to go, it&#039;s going to go.</div><div id="00:05:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And if it&#039;s going at two, it goes at two because everybody&#039;s ready.</div><div id="00:05:52.600" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, that&#039;s really impressive to see and very exciting, I think, to watch the start of the parade</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> because, you know, everybody can&#039;t wait.</div><div id="00:05:59.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s kind of, you know, what they&#039;ve been working towards.</div><div id="00:06:02.400" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s always been a fantastic place to be.</div><div id="00:06:04.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve enjoyed being at the start of the parade and sort of seeing all that.</div><div id="00:06:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And also, I think, just, yeah, some of the amazing costumes and creations down the years.</div><div id="00:06:15.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve kind of gone through various phases of trying different things,</div><div id="00:06:20.400" class="transcript_line"> of kind of trying to bring in Simon Systems, going back to being everything on foot,</div><div id="00:06:25.200" class="transcript_line"> trying to build different sculptures, working with lots of different artists and all of those things.</div><div id="00:06:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Kind of each building on the other to get you back to where you end up.</div><div id="00:06:34.600" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m sure if anybody looked at the very first carnival and the one that we just had this summer,</div><div id="00:06:39.800" class="transcript_line"> you know, the kind of journey of all of the people who&#039;ve been involved from the beginning to the end in terms of their</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> their creativity and their skills and, you know, their abilities is just huge.</div><div id="00:06:51.400" class="transcript_line"> No, absolutely. And of course, as you mentioned, we&#039;ve taken different routes, different,</div><div id="00:06:55.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve started at different places, we&#039;ve had the carnival camps at different places</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve had the outcomes in different places.</div><div id="00:07:02.400" class="transcript_line"> And one of my faves, I have to say, has to be the steps of the National Museum of Wales,</div><div id="00:07:10.600" class="transcript_line"> which is an unlikely place for a stage.</div><div id="00:07:15.100" class="transcript_line"> And yet, before they, you know, in order to make them accessible to everybody,</div><div id="00:07:21.100" class="transcript_line"> they placed those lovely brass railings through them.</div><div id="00:07:25.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was it was like a layer cake that we could end up on with different platforms,</div><div id="00:07:30.500" class="transcript_line"> everyone doing different dances or performances and then having something to say at the end.</div><div id="00:07:36.800" class="transcript_line"> But I know that you were very much you very much helped us come down in less or see at times to to the bay</div><div id="00:07:42.800" class="transcript_line"> where we&#039;d benefit from what can only describe as a rather wonderful roll off,</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> a roll on, you know, a full on rock festival stage.</div><div id="00:07:51.500" class="transcript_line"> And and even I recall a soaker version of the National Anthem of Wales with red, green and gold,</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Caribbean colours, pyrotechnics.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> In terms of the outcomes, did you have a favourite or one that sort of comes to mind as work particularly well?</div><div id="00:08:11.500" class="transcript_line"> I mean, like we&#039;ve staged it in all sorts of different ways.</div><div id="00:08:15.400" class="transcript_line"> And although the full on stage was great,</div><div id="00:08:19.900" class="transcript_line"> I liked the sort of the catwalk bit that we added in.</div><div id="00:08:22.700" class="transcript_line"> So at one point when we had the parade coming down the middle of the oval basin,</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> we built like a ramp that it could go up and over so that everyone could see it.</div><div id="00:08:30.200" class="transcript_line"> And I that to me kind of worked best because it was seeing the parade as it was meant to be seen as a parade</div><div id="00:08:36.700" class="transcript_line"> rather than as a sort of stage performance when everybody.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, they&#039;re at the end of the line and they&#039;re kind of, you know, letting off steam and celebrating.</div><div id="00:08:45.500" class="transcript_line"> But the costumes are almost like meant to be seen.</div><div id="00:08:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s commented on decoded for the public.</div><div id="00:08:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And I always felt that that was a really big step forward for us in terms of being able to present it to a big audience.</div><div id="00:08:58.100" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we were, as you say, very lucky that we kind of were able to sort of work through those years</div><div id="00:09:03.400" class="transcript_line"> when the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and subsequently Harbour Authority had funds to just to develop the area really.</div><div id="00:09:12.400" class="transcript_line"> And the mass carnival, I think, was a very big part in sort of developing audiences down there</div><div id="00:09:17.200" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, getting people coming back to events and to see things in that part of town.</div><div id="00:09:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. The support role of the council and I have to say the events team has been invaluable over time.</div><div id="00:09:31.300" class="transcript_line"> So when I come late this interview now by declaring that Hetty, you are a carnival hero.</div><div id="00:09:39.500" class="transcript_line"> Will you also take that message back to all your colleagues?</div><div id="00:09:41.900" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all the stewards, all the traffic management people, everybody who basically enabled it to happen.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, carnival is a huge bubble of excitement and goes across many grains of society.</div><div id="00:09:54.700" class="transcript_line"> So to be able to be given that opportunity, you know, it really has been people open minded, fair, celebratory people like yourself</div><div id="00:10:04.800" class="transcript_line"> giving large scale celebration of crack of the whip.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, we did have whip crackers one year as I recall. Risk assessed that.</div><div id="00:10:13.700" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a personal and a collective. I hereby declare you a carnival hero.</div><div id="00:10:19.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed. Thank you.</div></div></p>
