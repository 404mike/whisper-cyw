    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church in Sandinow as part of the Longest Yarn</div><div id="00:00:05.680" class="transcript_line"> and I have with me Peter and Jackie Smith and they&#039;re going to talk about their parents&#039;</div><div id="00:00:14.080" class="transcript_line"> time during the war. I&#039;ll start with you Peter if I may please. Can I ask you a little bit about</div><div id="00:00:20.080" class="transcript_line"> you what you remember about your father and what he did during the war? My dad was a coal</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> William Smith and he served in the Second World War between 1939 and 1941. As far as I know he</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> told me stories of him serving in Iceland primarily to keep the the Germans from occupying Iceland</div><div id="00:00:42.960" class="transcript_line"> and having some sort of influence in the North Atlantic. He was there like I said well about</div><div id="00:00:49.840" class="transcript_line"> 1941 and he served with the Sixth Battalion York&#039;s and Length Regiment</div><div id="00:01:00.800" class="transcript_line"> known as the Polar Bears from Sheffield that&#039;s their nickname and he didn&#039;t tell me a lot but</div><div id="00:01:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I think people at that time kept a lot to themselves. I&#039;ve got photographs of him</div><div id="00:01:19.280" class="transcript_line"> actually traveling to Iceland on a troop ship of a sort and one thing I do remember is that</div><div id="00:01:29.360" class="transcript_line"> his best man at his wedding was his best mate in the army and he has got photographs of them both</div><div id="00:01:37.600" class="transcript_line"> stood together with their obviously with their battle dress and steel helmets on. So he survived</div><div id="00:01:44.320" class="transcript_line"> the war and did he meet up with his Sheffield Polar Bears? Polar Bears from Sheffield.</div><div id="00:01:51.040" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the most amazing name isn&#039;t it? So did he meet up with them? Did they feel them?</div><div id="00:01:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I do not recall him meeting up with a sort of reunion or anything like that but he</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> obviously kept in touch with his best man because he married my mum in 1952.</div><div id="00:02:12.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a really lovely story I think you know something wonderful for you to remember</div><div id="00:02:18.960" class="transcript_line"> especially today thank you. I&#039;m going to now speak to Jackie and ask her about her father&#039;s stories</div><div id="00:02:26.480" class="transcript_line"> during the war. Well actually it was my grandfather. My own parents they were too young to serve</div><div id="00:02:36.800" class="transcript_line"> in the war but my grandfather he was around when it was the Sheffield Blitz and I can recall him</div><div id="00:02:46.640" class="transcript_line"> telling me about the horrific scenes that he did. Go and see and help retrieve the bodies from the</div><div id="00:02:56.720" class="transcript_line"> blitz and and all the devastation that was around there and as he was a coffin maker</div><div id="00:03:04.960" class="transcript_line"> he made lots of coffins and helped with all the funerals and things for all the people that</div><div id="00:03:11.520" class="transcript_line"> you know that died at that point. So he must have had quite a traumatic war really I mean</div><div id="00:03:16.080" class="transcript_line"> yeah it must have been really difficult and he probably didn&#039;t get any medals for it.</div><div id="00:03:21.600" class="transcript_line"> I think he&#039;s got a lot of two medals various medals. My husband&#039;s got those he collects all</div><div id="00:03:28.400" class="transcript_line"> the things from us. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s got a little tin with all his machine books in and all his</div><div id="00:03:34.960" class="transcript_line"> little things he&#039;s got. So did he stay as a he was you said he was a joiner? He was a joiner and he</div><div id="00:03:42.400" class="transcript_line"> remained a joiner for most of his life. From that he went into construction building and stuff</div><div id="00:03:50.320" class="transcript_line"> like that with his contracting. More fun and less devastating. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:03:56.640" class="transcript_line"> So back to Peter because he&#039;s now going to talk about his mother who worked in an</div><div id="00:04:01.120" class="transcript_line"> ordnance factory during the war. Peter? Yeah I mean during the outbreak of war 1939 1940</div><div id="00:04:10.160" class="transcript_line"> my mum would have been 20 years old and she she worked in the royal</div><div id="00:04:15.600" class="transcript_line"> well. The ordnance factory which was about six miles away from where where she lived</div><div id="00:04:23.200" class="transcript_line"> and it was set up as a sort of ghost factory. It took all sort of out of the bombed areas and</div><div id="00:04:35.120" class="transcript_line"> moved it up to Yorkshire out of the way of the bombs and yeah she she manufactured bullets and</div><div id="00:04:43.680" class="transcript_line"> shells for use in this for use by the army. Did she do that right the way through though?</div><div id="00:04:51.280" class="transcript_line"> I think she did yes I think she did I mean the the factory was still there</div><div id="00:04:58.160" class="transcript_line"> after the war. I mean I can remember it as a bit it had been converted into something for</div><div id="00:05:04.480" class="transcript_line"> peacetime production but it was always there and I don&#039;t believe that she did serve</div><div id="00:05:14.480" class="transcript_line"> to the end. Did she suffer afterwards? Did she have long problems? Really? I mean she</div><div id="00:05:18.960" class="transcript_line"> totally protected were they? No I mean there wasn&#039;t protected but the area that she was in</div><div id="00:05:24.960" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it wasn&#039;t a heavily bombed area during the war and it was like I said at a time where</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> they were sort of moving the sort of critical manufacture of certain things that you know</div><div id="00:05:40.240" class="transcript_line"> into sort of ghost factories and that. Did she speak about it after the war?</div><div id="00:05:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot I mean she obviously told me where she was during the war and she always sort of</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> the one particular story that I get is that she was walking home one night</div><div id="00:06:04.160" class="transcript_line"> and there was a bombing raid on Sheffield and the village that we lived in on the top of the hill</div><div id="00:06:14.240" class="transcript_line"> with two anti-aircraft guns and these anti-aircraft guns opened fire and she said she just never</div><div id="00:06:21.120" class="transcript_line"> stopped running until she got home and that&#039;s just one snippet that I do remember her telling me.</div><div id="00:06:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t imagine being fired on on your way back from work. Thank you Peter very much. Thank you.</div></div></p>
