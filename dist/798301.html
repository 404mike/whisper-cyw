    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say probably my favourite Welsh variety I&#039;ve got on the orchard is a variety called</div><div id="00:00:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Frederick. It&#039;s an old Monmouthshire cider apple. The apples are very, very small actually.</div><div id="00:00:11.040" class="transcript_line"> Some of them are about a golf ball size and they&#039;ve got a very dark kind of skin on them.</div><div id="00:00:16.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all mottled and cracked. Really interesting character for a looking fruit and the trees</div><div id="00:00:21.760" class="transcript_line"> themselves are very wild. They kind of branch, fork a lot. When you look into a Frederick</div><div id="00:00:27.320" class="transcript_line"> tree you can easily tell it because you can see hundreds of forks in the branches. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:34.040" class="transcript_line"> quite a vigorous variety and it does produce a good crop of these little apples that are</div><div id="00:00:37.800" class="transcript_line"> an absolute pain to pick. The reason everyone does pick them is it&#039;s regarded as a vintage</div><div id="00:00:42.160" class="transcript_line"> cider apple variety. When we say vintage what we actually mean is it can make good cider</div><div id="00:00:49.200" class="transcript_line"> on its own. Most ciders blend it and so you take a blend of several varieties to get it</div><div id="00:00:55.440" class="transcript_line"> but some of the varieties are called vintage and all that basically means is it&#039;s good enough on</div><div id="00:00:59.520" class="transcript_line"> its own. So Frederick&#039;s one of those. It&#039;s called a full sharp and what that means is it&#039;s a very</div><div id="00:01:06.320" class="transcript_line"> acidic apple. It&#039;s got a very sharp, you know, appley taste to it. It also does have some tannins</div><div id="00:01:13.640" class="transcript_line"> in there which are the kind of dry and bitter characteristics you get. When you make single</div><div id="00:01:18.680" class="transcript_line"> variety cider out of it, I mean these days it&#039;s probably not to the commercial taste. It&#039;s a bit</div><div id="00:01:24.720" class="transcript_line"> too sharp. So these days you generally do blend it in but it&#039;s an interesting cider. It will ferment</div><div id="00:01:30.800" class="transcript_line"> to produce a kind of sharp fruity rich product with nice interesting flavours. I mean historically</div><div id="00:01:39.320" class="transcript_line"> as well the variety has also been used for making crabapple jelly. It has enough pectin in there</div><div id="00:01:45.120" class="transcript_line"> to make the jelly and so that&#039;s one of the other uses it&#039;s used for as well. I guess the other</div><div id="00:01:49.800" class="transcript_line"> things to say about it is quite often the flesh is quite pink in it so when you press it you get</div><div id="00:01:55.280" class="transcript_line"> a pink juice out of there. Sadly that doesn&#039;t carry through to the cider. It oxidises out but</div><div id="00:02:00.360" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s one of the things you look at and you get a nice pink juice from it but it&#039;s a fun variety.</div><div id="00:02:04.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit of an odd one to prune given its tree shape but yeah I really like it. I haven&#039;t done</div><div id="00:02:10.520" class="transcript_line"> single variety this year because as I said it&#039;s a bit too sharp for the modern palette. I use it</div><div id="00:02:16.560" class="transcript_line"> extensively in my May Day, my festival sweet cider and that cider, yeah it&#039;s got about say</div><div id="00:02:25.840" class="transcript_line"> three parts Frederick to one part bittersweet. That&#039;s the kind of blend so it is quite sharp</div><div id="00:02:33.720" class="transcript_line"> and appley and I serve it sweet as well and it works like that I&#039;d say. At the moment I&#039;m making</div><div id="00:02:41.240" class="transcript_line"> up my sunshine cider and I&#039;m bagging that up then I&#039;m pasteurising the bags and boxing them</div><div id="00:02:47.800" class="transcript_line"> and labelling up all ready to go then. Cider is obviously a live natural product when you ferment</div><div id="00:02:54.040" class="transcript_line"> it in big barrels and it&#039;s full of all kinds of different wild yeasts and bacterias and you know</div><div id="00:02:59.360" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s fine and stable as it is but the modern taste of the consumer is basically they want it sweet and</div><div id="00:03:04.880" class="transcript_line"> so you have to sweeten it. You can either do it with a natural sugar like I use or you could use</div><div id="00:03:10.440" class="transcript_line"> artificial sweetener which I don&#039;t believe in. So you need to do something and hence you have to</div><div id="00:03:15.480" class="transcript_line"> pasteurise it. So that&#039;s basically today&#039;s job. After I pasteurise them in the boxes, in the old</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> days you know you start draining the barrel you get a big air space on the top and it&#039;ll be off</div><div id="00:03:26.160" class="transcript_line"> within five days and when I started running cider bars with camera and making cider you know over a</div><div id="00:03:33.040" class="transcript_line"> decade ago it&#039;s a clean and nicer product. You can guarantee when it goes to someone I know it&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:38.440" class="transcript_line"> going to be good. It&#039;s basically what modern industry demands. Well I guess two favourite</div><div id="00:03:44.560" class="transcript_line"> parts is one you&#039;re outside. You know when you&#039;re working in the orchard you&#039;re pruning,</div><div id="00:03:48.560" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re cutting, you&#039;re outside in the fresh air and like I say I love that. I&#039;ve worked in</div><div id="00:03:53.560" class="transcript_line"> office for about 15 years sitting there and I can&#039;t stand it. I love being outside. The best,</div><div id="00:03:58.480" class="transcript_line"> you know that&#039;s probably one of the best bits is being outside and wandering around and the other</div><div id="00:04:03.400" class="transcript_line"> bit is when you&#039;re like somewhere at a show and you&#039;re selling it to the customer and they like</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> it and they appreciate it there&#039;s no better feeling to think I&#039;ve made this product and</div><div id="00:04:11.320" class="transcript_line"> somebody&#039;s really happy with it. You know that&#039;s wonderful you know you can&#039;t pay for that. That&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:16.440" class="transcript_line"> brilliant.</div></div></p>
