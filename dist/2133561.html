class="transcript_line"> Looks like I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how long you&#039;ve been coming, yeah?</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a good while, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well since from the old one, but then they came over a year, so I really don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t come up to Mencap very often.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s about 10 years.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we move them down there and then we move them up here, so I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, and most of it tends to be out where you live and in the evenings, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s when you want to come in the evenings.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because you live in Cardicat, we tend to come out to you, don&#039;t we, when we do the events out there.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And actually Jess, you&#039;re the first one that we&#039;ve interviewed who lives on their own, lives independently.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to live with my mum and dad a long time ago, but they&#039;re not around, so.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so you live in your own flat, is that right?</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And if

class="transcript_line"> Five years ago?</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So how long have you been together?</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That I don&#039;t know, we met at Chepstow School.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Five years, you&#039;ve been in a relationship together?</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Thursday night.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Thursday night, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when John Butter was live.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so you met on the Thursday night social group?</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so do you remember the actual night or is it?</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I think he&#039;s got the detail, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You do?</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> 18th of January.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, so that must have stuck out.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you know what you were doing at the time?</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> 18th of January?</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s last year, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That was when the sports group joined the cooking group when we started to do events together, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was the cooking group on Thursday night with Annie.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were in a cooking group originally and Kev you were...</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You were doing sports with the boys, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> With Gary.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> With Gary and the boys doing the sports evening.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh nice, and you&#039;ve been together ever since?</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, since.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if this is going to be edited out but was it love at first sight for the both of you?</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Hmm, I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t know really, just in between.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He grew on you, did he?</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and she grew on you, was it Kev?</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it was a bit difficult, yeah, but there you go.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You just have to get on with it because he can&#039;t text like he normally does because he keeps playing with his phone too much and wants a new phone.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So he rings and says, I love you, that&#039;s all he can do.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we do talk and he says, I love you, I love you too, okay.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, yeah, but sometimes he does it on his phone and says, I love you, and he says, I love you too Kev, and they can keep playing with their phones too much, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s nice to be told you love, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so nice.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So what things do you do at Chepstermencap then Kev? Can you tell me a little bit about your time with Chepstermencap?</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Just go to the club, to the club.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Chepstermencap?</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Chepstermencap? Is that where you first started?</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, in 82.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In 82?</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, tell me a little bit about how that started then.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Am I right in saying you used to be the DJ at the Chepstermencap?</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, DJ, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You were the DJ at the Chepstermencap?</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go on the mountain, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you and the boys behind the decks?</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So what kind of music do you used to play?</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to play the band.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> A bit of everything, was it?</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do? Was Saturday club at the Ledger Centre?</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I remember coming to that as a kid and we used to go for a swimming session, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And then play sports afterwards and go for a drink in the bar.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you learn to swim at Mencap?</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a long time ago, isn&#039;t it, 82?</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So what about you, Jess? Do you remember when you first came to Mencap?</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I really haven&#039;t got a clue, to be honest, Mike. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Would it have been at the social evenings with Annie?</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;d do a lot of different things. We&#039;d do cook, we&#039;d eat and then we&#039;d come to join with you with the best of the gang, try to drink that tune.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I really don&#039;t know how long that go is. I really don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fine if you don&#039;t know the dates or anything.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know dates.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know either myself, to be honest.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Are they all marriages, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve definitely known you since I started working here, so that&#039;s a good over 10 years that I&#039;ve been working with you.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, so when I&#039;ve seen you two together, it&#039;s mainly been in the evening groups, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So what evening groups do you remember? Can you remember any activities you&#039;ve done?</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I used to do a cookery, we used to do sports with you a lot and then we&#039;d done cookery with the girls quite a few times with the girls.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we went to review, so it was a long time ago.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a year before, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to the pub for a pint.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, sometimes.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The Hay Wain and Caldecott, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to Chepster one as well, sometimes.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the Bent Barn.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, mum.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all stopped now because of the germs and the Covid.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It did stop during Covid, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, Kev, what did you say?</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Dairy Centre.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The Lentre Centre?</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No, the other one.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember?</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In YB?</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the sports hall.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No, the other one.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in the road.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The other one down the road.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Dairy Centre.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the Diving Centre.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go up there.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Go there in the summer because it&#039;s nice to sit off the deck in there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember that.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But actually...</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In the coming times.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hm.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You were just saying about it doesn&#039;t happen so much now because of the germs and everything</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> because Covid hit, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hm.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So were you two in contact during Covid or was it really difficult?</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably difficult, I think.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not really sure, to be honest.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you, Kev?</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> What makes it worth us then?</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you find Covid?</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you live on your own, Jess.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you find...</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You coped well with it or did you struggle?</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I coped well with it because I&#039;d been jabbed up so I didn&#039;t catch anything from it.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So you just got to be careful in what you do.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you find...</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you experience any loneliness as you weren&#039;t seeing anyone as often?</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a little bit lonely but now it&#039;s not...</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t normally see people.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Only if I go for a walk and I say hello to people and that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s not many people around so it&#039;s quite good very often.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you manage with your supermarket because I know you like going to Aspen, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes the supermarket wouldn&#039;t let us in or only one at a time, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because last time I couldn&#039;t go out because Dee had done my shopping for me because of the gym, was going around.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So one of our support workers did that for you?</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I couldn&#039;t go down because the gym was going around so I couldn&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was not so much now.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Dee takes me shopping now so...</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can go with Dee?</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And is it mostly Dee that...</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> If Dee&#039;s got a day off or something and I&#039;m one of the people like Carol or something like that.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Nice.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I know I don&#039;t like change but I always go along with it so I don&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I know you don&#039;t like change.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great but that&#039;s because I presume if Dee&#039;s having a day off she lets you know in advance.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so she&#039;s very good at that.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And so if you&#039;ve got advance notice, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Have you been there before?</div><div id="00:16:48.160" class="transcript_line"> To Canada?</div><div id="00:16:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, quite a few times.</div><div id="00:16:50.160" class="transcript_line"> What made you choose Canada then?</div><div id="00:16:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it was my mother&#039;s idea before she went, so it was her idea, really.</div><div id="00:17:01.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:02.660" class="transcript_line"> How many times have you been?</div><div id="00:17:04.380" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:17:06.140" class="transcript_line"> Long time ago, been on this thing.</div><div id="00:17:09.140" class="transcript_line"> Because it was cold at that time.</div><div id="00:17:12.140" class="transcript_line"> Because it was my Auntie Cass surprise birthday party</div><div id="00:17:15.580" class="transcript_line"> when somebody else&#039;s friend saw me.</div><div id="00:17:17.980" class="transcript_line"> Me and my mum and dad came and went down to somebody&#039;s house,</div><div id="00:17:21.860" class="transcript_line"> friends basement just downstairs.</div><div id="00:17:23.740" class="transcript_line"> And had to go and say hello, so and so.</div><div id="00:17:25.580" class="transcript_line"> And we all came up and said, surprise!</div><div id="00:17:28.580" class="transcript_line"> Because it was cold that time over there.</div><div id="00:17:31.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was quite good.</div><div id="00:17:34.140" class="transcript_line"> But now Jenny told me, I&#039;m going to take you to Canada.</div><div id="00:17:37.220" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;d be nice.</div><div id="00:17:38.420" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t wait.</div><div id="00:17:39.100" class="transcript_line"> So there we are.</div><div id="00:17:42.100" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been to Canada and I&#039;ve got a feeling where you&#039;re saying</div><div id="00:17:46.740" class="transcript_line"> Bramford, I think that might be where Cara went with himself.</div><div id="00:17:51.060" class="transcript_line"> Your dad&#039;s cousin.</div><div id="00:17:53.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I call it Toronto.</div><div id="00:17:54.260" class="transcript_line"> But I call it Toronto.</div><div id="00:17:55.220" class="transcript_line"> But people call it, it&#039;s not Toronto, it&#039;s Bramford.</div><div id="00:17:57.540" class="transcript_line"> Toronto&#039;s on the other side.</div><div id="00:17:59.740" class="transcript_line"> I still call it Toronto.</div><div id="00:18:01.220" class="transcript_line"> So part of Canada, really.</div><div id="00:18:03.140" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what you know.</div><div id="00:18:04.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Do you buy anything when you&#039;re in Canada?</div><div id="00:18:08.260" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes clothes, sometimes I buy sweets.</div><div id="00:18:11.460" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes, depends really.</div><div id="00:18:14.140" class="transcript_line"> Because I go to Niagara on the lake.</div><div id="00:18:17.380" class="transcript_line"> Niagara?</div><div id="00:18:18.260" class="transcript_line"> Mm.</div><div id="00:18:19.020" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:18:19.700" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been to Niagara Falls because when you go to Niagara Falls,</div><div id="00:18:22.300" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got this boat that takes you up by the waterfall.</div><div id="00:18:25.900" class="transcript_line"> Because you go with this mat thing to keep your clothes dry</div><div id="00:18:29.020" class="transcript_line"> or something, you just go near the, oh gosh, it&#039;s getting cold.</div><div id="00:18:32.540" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m getting wet.</div><div id="00:18:33.180" class="transcript_line"> No, you&#039;re not wet.</div><div id="00:18:34.060" class="transcript_line"> Just where the water splashes you.</div><div id="00:18:36.380" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite fun.</div><div id="00:18:37.660" class="transcript_line"> Do you know people used to go over that in barrels?</div><div id="00:18:40.820" class="transcript_line"> Mm.</div><div id="00:18:41.580" class="transcript_line"> Some adrenaline junkies used to get in a little wooden barrel</div><div id="00:18:45.020" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d float off the edge of it.</div><div id="00:18:47.300" class="transcript_line"> And I have no idea why.</div><div id="00:18:48.700" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s stupid.</div><div id="00:18:49.780" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:18:50.420" class="transcript_line"> Especially when you&#039;ve seen it in person.</div><div id="00:18:52.300" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t want to go over there in a boat, let alone fall.</div><div id="00:18:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was a little boat it was.</div><div id="00:18:56.940" class="transcript_line"> It was quite fun.</div><div id="00:18:58.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think of what they call that though.</div><div id="00:19:01.100" class="transcript_line"> Is it Sea of the Mist or something?</div><div id="00:19:03.140" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:19:04.220" class="transcript_line"> Lady of the Mist or something like that.</div><div id="00:19:05.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:06.460" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a poncho.</div><div id="00:19:07.900" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re all given a certain colour poncho, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:19:11.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:12.100" class="transcript_line"> To protect you.</div><div id="00:19:13.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s like a big mac poncho.</div><div id="00:19:15.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think it&#039;s either mac or poncho.</div><div id="00:19:17.940" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not really sure.</div><div id="00:19:18.860" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s to keep your clothes not too, if you get a little bit wet,</div><div id="00:19:21.900" class="transcript_line"> it doesn&#039;t matter anyway.</div><div id="00:19:23.260" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:23.860" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s worth it for the experience, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:19:25.660" class="transcript_line"> It is, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:27.820" class="transcript_line"> And Kevin, you&#039;ve just come back from holiday, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:19:30.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Landednow.</div><div id="00:19:31.820" class="transcript_line"> Landednow?</div><div id="00:19:32.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:33.020" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:19:33.980" class="transcript_line"> What did you do up there?</div><div id="00:19:37.300" class="transcript_line"> You know, walk.</div><div id="00:19:38.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:19:39.980" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go walking?</div><div id="00:19:44.060" class="transcript_line"> Conway.</div><div id="00:19:46.220" class="transcript_line"> Conway?</div><div id="00:19:46.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:47.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:19:48.380" class="transcript_line"> So did you see all the mountain ranges up there?</div><div id="00:19:50.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:51.060" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s beautiful in North Wales, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:19:53.460" class="transcript_line"> Loads and loads of take-hills.</div><div id="00:19:55.700" class="transcript_line"> Loads of?</div><div id="00:19:56.620" class="transcript_line"> Seagulls.</div><div id="00:19:57.420" class="transcript_line"> Seagulls, is it?</div><div id="00:19:58.860" class="transcript_line"> Trying to steal your food.</div><div id="00:20:00.500" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re renowned up there for stealing your chips, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:20:03.580" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to be careful.</div><div id="00:20:04.780" class="transcript_line"> And Weston.</div><div id="00:20:06.100" class="transcript_line"> And Weston.</div><div id="00:20:07.300" class="transcript_line"> Weston.</div><div id="00:20:08.420" class="transcript_line"> Weston.</div><div id="00:20:08.900" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to talk about Landednow, though.</div><div id="00:20:11.380" class="transcript_line"> Did you go out on the pier on the?</div><div id="00:20:13.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a couple of times.</div><div id="00:20:14.300" class="transcript_line"> A couple of times.</div><div id="00:20:15.020" class="transcript_line"> I thought you would like it.</div><div id="00:20:16.820" class="transcript_line"> And the reason why I thought you would like it is just</div><div id="00:20:20.140" class="transcript_line"> what you&#039;re about to say.</div><div id="00:20:21.980" class="transcript_line"> Where did you used to go on holiday every February?</div><div id="00:20:26.780" class="transcript_line"> Weston.</div><div id="00:20:27.900" class="transcript_line"> Weston, the supermaid.</div><div id="00:20:30.060" class="transcript_line"> I miss it now.</div><div id="00:20:30.940" class="transcript_line"> I miss it now.</div><div id="00:20:31.820" class="transcript_line"> We all miss it.</div><div id="00:20:33.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we all used to go together, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:20:35.780" class="transcript_line"> Mm.</div><div id="00:20:36.700" class="transcript_line"> When was the last time you went?</div><div id="00:20:38.740" class="transcript_line"> Last time we went was?</div><div id="00:20:41.940" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all we did.</div><div id="00:20:42.620" class="transcript_line"> No, about...</div><div id="00:20:43.340" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all we did.</div><div id="00:20:44.820" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:45.460" class="transcript_line"> About five years ago, I think, we stopped.</div><div id="00:20:47.820" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:50.620" class="transcript_line"> I can remember, we went to Weston, the supermaid.</div><div id="00:20:54.620" class="transcript_line"> There was a carnival.</div><div id="00:20:57.900" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:20:59.180" class="transcript_line"> I think coming from...</div><div id="00:21:00.380" class="transcript_line"> You went on the coach for that.</div><div id="00:21:03.380" class="transcript_line"> That was...</div><div id="00:21:05.460" class="transcript_line"> It was at night time, it was.</div><div id="00:21:07.100" class="transcript_line"> With Alan Bishop.</div><div id="00:21:08.340" class="transcript_line"> With Alan Bishop and Margaret and then other friends,</div><div id="00:21:11.300" class="transcript_line"> because we were in different groups.</div><div id="00:21:12.460" class="transcript_line"> I went with Margaret and then we have...</div><div id="00:21:16.460" class="transcript_line"> And, what&#039;s his name, Alan?</div><div id="00:21:18.340" class="transcript_line"> And then with me, Kimberly and Jimmy,</div><div id="00:21:20.500" class="transcript_line"> and one came with us.</div><div id="00:21:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And we went in other groups</div><div id="00:21:24.820" class="transcript_line"> and we all went to...</div><div id="00:21:25.980" class="transcript_line"> Because there was normally drums and stuff comes first,</div><div id="00:21:28.620" class="transcript_line"> and then you&#039;ve got the big carnival comes along as well.</div><div id="00:21:32.660" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I can remember, but it is quite good.</div><div id="00:21:34.900" class="transcript_line"> All the floats.</div><div id="00:21:35.820" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, very good down there, actually.</div><div id="00:21:38.940" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t realise you went to that.</div><div id="00:21:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was organised, it was.</div><div id="00:21:43.460" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why we all went down there.</div><div id="00:21:45.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:46.180" class="transcript_line"> And we came back late, so...</div><div id="00:21:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Chester and Minkup used to organise a trip</div><div id="00:21:50.060" class="transcript_line"> to Weston, the supermaid,</div><div id="00:21:52.380" class="transcript_line"> but the actual carnival was Bridgewater Carnival.</div><div id="00:21:55.740" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been there, Kimberly, 10.</div><div id="00:21:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you&#039;ve been to actually Bridgewater</div><div id="00:21:59.580" class="transcript_line"> and Glastonbury as well.</div><div id="00:22:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:01.820" class="transcript_line"> And it used to tour a few towns, about 10 towns.</div><div id="00:22:07.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:07.900" class="transcript_line"> And you used to choose to go to the one in Weston.</div><div id="00:22:10.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was quite good.</div><div id="00:22:12.420" class="transcript_line"> And why was that?</div><div id="00:22:13.260" class="transcript_line"> They stopped doing that now, so.</div><div id="00:22:15.060" class="transcript_line"> But why was it at night?</div><div id="00:22:17.260" class="transcript_line"> Because it was quite easy with some people.</div><div id="00:22:21.340" class="transcript_line"> People normally do work during the days</div><div id="00:22:22.900" class="transcript_line"> and some people like doing it at night times</div><div id="00:22:25.620" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s easier at night time.</div><div id="00:22:27.100" class="transcript_line"> So I think that&#039;s why we decided to do it at night time</div><div id="00:22:29.060" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s easier.</div><div id="00:22:30.540" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s because they all lit up, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:22:32.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:34.340" class="transcript_line"> Thousands of light bulbs.</div><div id="00:22:35.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, that&#039;s why it&#039;s easy to do at night time.</div><div id="00:22:38.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:40.340" class="transcript_line"> It was quite spectacular, actually.</div><div id="00:22:42.300" class="transcript_line"> Mm, it was, very good.</div><div id="00:22:43.740" class="transcript_line"> Did you like it, Kimberly?</div><div id="00:22:46.020" class="transcript_line"> I mean, went to Weston, Baywater.</div><div id="00:22:49.940" class="transcript_line"> And Bridgewater, yes.</div><div id="00:22:51.700" class="transcript_line"> We used to park on a carriage four quarter.</div><div id="00:22:54.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, car park.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> in the Special Olympics, Jess?</div><div id="00:23:27.500" class="transcript_line"> God, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:23:29.820" class="transcript_line"> Doing sports

class="transcript_line"> about the Special Olympics?</div><div id="00:23:55.740" class="transcript_line"> What sports did you do?</div><div id="00:23:58.260" class="transcript_line"> Running.</div><div id="00:23:59.260" class="transcript_line"> Running.</div><div id="00:24:06.500" class="transcript_line"> Born.</div><div id="00:24:07.820" class="transcript_line"> Bumbling.</div><div id="00:24:08.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:09.500" class="transcript_line"> Was it boccia or?</div><div id="00:24:10.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, anything, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:11.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, boccia, I think they call it now.</div><div id="00:24:14.420" class="transcript_line"> We went to meet the Special Olympics team,</div><div id="00:24:17.180" class="transcript_line"> the Welsh athletes.</div><div id="00:24:19.420" class="transcript_line"> From the Great British team on Monday</div><div id="00:24:23.220" class="transcript_line"> at the Senate in Cardiff, a few of us went along</div><div id="00:24:25.580" class="transcript_line"> to like a good luck ceremony before they go to Berlin.</div><div id="00:24:29.900" class="transcript_line"> That was nice.</div><div id="00:24:31.900" class="transcript_line"> So did you enjoy the Special Olympics?</div><div id="00:24:33.380" class="transcript_line"> Was that a good experience?</div><div id="00:24:34.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I swindled in.</div><div id="00:24:36.220" class="transcript_line"> In Swindon?</div><div id="00:24:37.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:38.020" class="transcript_line"> So you traveled up there and you competed in the games.</div><div id="00:24:41.020" class="transcript_line"> Did you win?</div><div id="00:24:42.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a couple of times.</div><div id="00:24:43.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, did you get any, what do you get, a medal?</div><div id="00:24:45.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:46.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, nice.</div><div id="00:24:48.860" class="transcript_line"> You look back on that with fond memories.</div><div id="00:24:52.140" class="transcript_line"> Who organized that then?</div><div id="00:24:55.340" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:24:56.300" class="transcript_line"> Not sure?</div><div id="00:24:58.020" class="transcript_line"> I think, if I&#039;m right, Sarah Griswold was quite instrumental</div><div id="00:25:00.860" class="transcript_line"> in doing a lot of the Special Olympics trips.</div><div id="00:25:03.780" class="transcript_line"> Is that right?</div><div id="00:25:04.620" class="transcript_line"> I think there was a chap called Tony.</div><div id="00:25:07.060" class="transcript_line"> Tony, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:08.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think he used to do it with you.</div><div id="00:25:11.060" class="transcript_line"> And so Sarah was saying, Jess,</div><div id="00:25:14.700" class="transcript_line"> that she thinks she went to Swansea.</div><div id="00:25:17.300" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember doing any sports?</div><div id="00:25:19.100" class="transcript_line"> Did you run or relay anything?</div><div id="00:25:21.220" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:25:24.900" class="transcript_line"> because Sarah said I don&#039;t run</div><div id="00:25:26.140" class="transcript_line"> when I jumped on the sand on my bum.</div><div id="00:25:29.100" class="transcript_line"> You did the long jump then.</div><div id="00:25:30.540" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t know, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:25:32.620" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what Sarah did.</div><div id="00:25:33.460" class="transcript_line"> Remember you used to do the long jump,</div><div id="00:25:35.060" class="transcript_line"> you went on your bum, I can&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="00:25:37.860" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite a long time ago.</div><div id="00:25:38.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a long time ago, I believe.</div><div id="00:25:41.980" class="transcript_line"> So have you ever?</div><div id="00:25:42.940" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, I used to have run down,</div><div id="00:25:43.940" class="transcript_line"> having Swansea, jacking and out of bottoms.</div><div id="00:25:47.620" class="transcript_line"> So are you talking about the tracksuit?</div><div id="00:25:49.580" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the tracksuit, yeah, I still got it.</div><div id="00:25:52.820" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Jess.</div><div id="00:25:54.860" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m warning you, but I still got it.</div><div id="00:25:57.220" class="transcript_line"> I have been looking for someone</div><div id="00:26:01.380" class="transcript_line"> to see if they&#039;ve still got their tracksuit.</div><div id="00:26:03.620" class="transcript_line"> I still kept mine, I still don&#039;t know if I still kept it.</div><div id="00:26:07.060" class="transcript_line"> Would you mind us maybe borrowing it for the exhibition?</div><div id="00:26:11.100" class="transcript_line"> Just for a month.</div><div id="00:26:12.340" class="transcript_line"> It depends what size it is.</div><div id="00:26:15.020" class="transcript_line"> No one will wear it.</div><div id="00:26:16.260" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll just be to show what the outfit looked like, really.</div><div id="00:26:20.580" class="transcript_line"> Only if you&#039;re comfortable with it,</div><div id="00:26:21.620" class="transcript_line"> you can have a think about it.</div><div id="00:26:22.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll think about it.</div><div id="00:26:24.180" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t have to answer now.</div><div id="00:26:26.180" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll think about it.</div><div id="00:26:27.020" class="transcript_line"> Was it a red tracksuit or was it a black and yellow?</div><div id="00:26:28.900" class="transcript_line"> No, it was yellow, it was black and yellow.</div><div id="00:26:32.140" class="transcript_line"> Yellow, yeah, that&#039;s the one I&#039;m familiar with</div><div id="00:26:35.020" class="transcript_line"> and then they had a red tracksuit in the later years,</div><div id="00:26:37.660" class="transcript_line"> I think, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:38.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I still got my tracksuit, it was black and yellow.</div><div id="00:26:41.460" class="transcript_line"> Well, we would love to see it</div><div id="00:26:42.620" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;d be willing to let us see it.</div><div id="00:26:44.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll think about it.</div><div id="00:26:46.540" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a piece of history, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:48.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s kind of what this is all about.</div><div id="00:26:50.340" class="transcript_line"> I think we used to share bedrooms, something like that.</div><div id="00:26:54.980" class="transcript_line"> I remember, must be a long time ago.</div><div id="00:26:57.740" class="transcript_line"> I know there&#039;s a bedroom there,</div><div id="00:26:59.540" class="transcript_line"> it must be a long time ago, but I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:27:01.380" class="transcript_line"> It would have been a long time ago,</div><div id="00:27:02.740" class="transcript_line"> but actually, before you leave today,</div><div id="00:27:06.860" class="transcript_line"> I do have photos of everyone</div><div id="00:27:10.220" class="transcript_line"> in their yellow and black tracksuits.</div><div id="00:27:14.100" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ll have a look and we&#039;ll see if you&#039;re on the photos.</div><div id="00:27:17.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because Adrian wears his ponzi jacket now and again.</div><div id="00:27:21.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:21.940" class="transcript_line"> Adrian, he?</div><div id="00:27:23.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, he wears his jacket now and again.</div><div id="00:27:26.660" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you&#039;ve got the tracksuit,</div><div id="00:27:27.980" class="transcript_line"> you must have been part of the team.</div><div id="00:27:30.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s where we went out to ponzi.</div><div id="00:27:33.460" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so you did yours in ponzi?</div><div id="00:27:36.260" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, must have been, yeah,</div><div id="00:27:38.420" class="transcript_line"> because Sarah was there as well.</div><div id="00:27:39.940" class="transcript_line"> I think they did it in Birmingham as well,</div><div id="00:27:41.660" class="transcript_line"> I know there&#039;s a few over the years.</div><div id="00:27:43.380" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll have to look back through the photos.</div><div id="00:27:45.660" class="transcript_line"> My sister Wendy did it in the Isle of Wight.</div><div id="00:27:48.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:27:49.260" class="transcript_line"> And Edinburgh.</div><div id="00:27:50.700" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:27:52.060" class="transcript_line"> Long way away, but I&#039;m thrilled to bits</div><div id="00:27:56.220" class="transcript_line"> to think you&#039;ve still got the tracksuit, Jess.</div><div id="00:27:59.340" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:28:01.100" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ll have a chat with you about that later.</div><div id="00:28:05.100" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any other memories</div><div id="00:28:06.420" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;d like to share about Chatsumetha?</div><div id="00:28:09.220" class="transcript_line"> Could be anything, good or bad, funny, sad?</div><div id="00:28:14.340" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:28:16.180" class="transcript_line"> No, anything you can think of over the years</div><div id="00:28:18.100" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;d like to mention,</div><div id="00:28:20.140" class="transcript_line"> that you think would be important</div><div id="00:28:22.140" class="transcript_line"> for people to hear that you&#039;ve done?</div><div id="00:28:25.700" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:28:27.380" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s fair enough, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:28:29.940" class="transcript_line"> What about you Jess?</div><div id="00:28:31.020" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:28:32.140" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any memories of Chatsumetha</div><div id="00:28:34.340" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;d like to share?</div><div id="00:28:35.380" class="transcript_line"> Not particularly, just all good fun</div><div id="00:28:37.940" class="transcript_line"> and fun to laugh and joke with friends,</div><div id="00:28:40.580" class="transcript_line"> not particularly much.</div><div id="00:28:42.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so just a good time all right.</div><div id="00:28:44.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:45.340" class="transcript_line"> Nice, well I&#039;ll ask you some questions then.</div><div id="00:28:48.220" class="transcript_line"> What do you think of the new building we&#039;ve got?</div><div id="00:28:50.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s quite nice.</div><div id="00:28:52.100" class="transcript_line"> This used to be a wood barn, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:28:54.100" class="transcript_line"> But then Kevin said,</div><div id="00:28:54.940" class="transcript_line"> now you&#039;ve got wood down there now.</div><div id="00:28:57.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this used to be a school originally, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:01.940" class="transcript_line"> And then it was kind of a-</div><div id="00:29:04.580" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a wood thing,</div><div id="00:29:05.420" class="transcript_line"> you see a wood by there, wood over by there,</div><div id="00:29:08.420" class="transcript_line"> and then they changed it around.</div><div id="00:29:10.620" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a glass factory after all,</div><div id="00:29:12.100" class="transcript_line"> not a factory but a glass merchant&#039;s.</div><div id="00:29:14.300" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve seen any change for wood something over there,</div><div id="00:29:16.660" class="transcript_line"> you said didn&#039;t you Kev?</div><div id="00:29:18.460" class="transcript_line"> Kev, you said you&#039;d been moving stuff around</div><div id="00:29:22.020" class="transcript_line"> the woods from over there, you said didn&#039;t you,</div><div id="00:29:23.740" class="transcript_line"> with the wood stuff.</div><div id="00:29:25.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh the workshop.</div><div id="00:29:26.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it used to be here but it&#039;s moved over there.</div><div id="00:29:28.780" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s next door, that&#039;s where we do all the-</div><div id="00:29:31.140" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s probably the-</div><div id="00:29:32.580" class="transcript_line"> The workshops at the-</div><div id="00:29:34.740" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s where you swapped it around.</div><div id="00:29:36.540" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:29:38.260" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:29:39.500" class="transcript_line"> But compared to the Barclay,</div><div id="00:29:40.660" class="transcript_line"> because the Barclay was a lot smaller than this place,</div><div id="00:29:42.740" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:29:43.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:45.260" class="transcript_line"> Do you miss the Barclay?</div><div id="00:29:46.380" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:29:47.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve got fun memories there?</div><div id="00:29:49.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, good things, good dinner.</div><div id="00:29:53.700" class="transcript_line"> Used to do a lot of-</div><div id="00:29:54.540" class="transcript_line"> Good dinner.</div><div id="00:29:55.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:56.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they used to do that.</div><div id="00:29:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you used to do a lot of little parties</div><div id="00:29:58.180" class="transcript_line"> in there, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:29:59.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:30:00.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, little fun disco things and whatever.</div><div id="00:30:02.300" class="transcript_line"> Good, the best,</div><div id="00:30:03.300" class="transcript_line"> thanks for being through the night.</div><div id="00:30:07.180" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div><div id="00:30:08.020" class="transcript_line"> So there you go there, yeah?</div><div id="00:30:09.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:10.260" class="transcript_line"> So what do you think of the new space we got here?</div><div id="00:30:13.620" class="transcript_line"> Very big.</div><div id="00:30:14.900" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s huge, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:30:15.740" class="transcript_line"> Plenty of room.</div><div id="00:30:16.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:30:17.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was a lot of stuff in there.</div><div id="00:30:20.220" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had a few parties here since it&#039;s been open.</div><div id="00:30:24.300" class="transcript_line"> Had some good fun.</div><div id="00:30:25.340" class="transcript_line"> So on a Thursday night at the Barclay,</div><div id="00:30:27.620" class="transcript_line"> I believe you made pizzas, Jess,</div><div id="00:30:31.740" class="transcript_line"> in the cookery group,</div><div id="00:30:33.700" class="transcript_line"> and then the boys would come in later and eat the pizzas.</div><div id="00:30:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:38.140" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how you started to combine your evening, actually.</div><div id="00:30:42.460" class="transcript_line"> It went from full-on cooking</div><div id="00:30:45.060" class="transcript_line"> to more of a social at the pub.</div><div id="00:30:48.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it would be hungry after a game of football, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:30:52.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:54.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was originally a ladies group, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:30:56.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a girls group, you know, we do it.</div><div id="00:31:00.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think that was when I started doing all that,</div><div id="00:31:03.260" class="transcript_line"> I think doing a girls cookery thing.</div><div id="00:31:05.300" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:31:06.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:07.700" class="transcript_line"> And you all used to learn how to cook</div><div id="00:31:09.700" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d make a dish on the night, which you could take home, couldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:31:13.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:14.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we can&#039;t do that anymore.</div><div id="00:31:17.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:31:20.540"

the honeymoon would be, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:33:34.660" class="transcript_line"> either this hotel over the road or something.</div><div id="00:33:37.460" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:38.820" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t people go abroad on their honeymoon, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:33:41.060" class="transcript_line"> They do.</div><div id="00:33:41.740" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they just do a honeymoon, go to the hotel, stay a bit longer or whatever.</div><div id="00:33:46.260" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:33:47.300" class="transcript_line"> What about you two, any wedding bells ringing?</div><div id="00:33:49.700" class="transcript_line"> God, no way.</div><div id="00:33:50.500" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:33:51.380" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:33:55.140" class="transcript_line"> One day, one day.</div><div

you, Sue?</div><div id="00:34:02.180" class="transcript_line"> What do you do?</div><div id="00:34:03.500" class="transcript_line"> What do I do?</div><div id="00:34:04.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:04.700" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:34:06.540" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m actually chair of Chester Mencap, which means I do the paperwork.</div><div id="00:34:12.740" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m interested in doing what I do as a volunteer, because I just like knowing all of you.</div><div id="00:34:22.140" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I love the fact that we go out in the evenings, that we see you in the day.</div><div id="00:34:28.020" class="transcript_line"> I just like being involved with Chester Mencap.</div><div id="00:34:31.620" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that, I&#039;m retired.</div><div id="00:34:34.620" class="transcript_line"> So I like holidays.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m really no good at it.</div><div id="00:34:49.540" class="transcript_line"> I discovered that last night.</div><div id="00:34:51.020" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:34:52.700" class="transcript_line"> Does that mean you have to teach her to do it again?</div><div id="00:34:55.060" class="transcript_line"> Her work is beautiful.</div><div id="00:34:56.220" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s been humble.</div><div id="00:34:57.620" class="transcript_line"> Humble.</div><div id="00:34:58.580" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I love you.</div><div id="00:35:00.140" class="transcript_line"> I just don&#039;t do pots.</div><div id="00:35:02.980" class="transcript_line"> You do any gardening at all?</div><div id="00:35:05.380" class="transcript_line"> Funnily enough.</div><div id="00:35:07.220" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a nice day.</div><div id="00:35:08.420" class="transcript_line"> My garden is looking beautiful.</div><div id="00:35:10.820" class="transcript_line"> Do you water any plants at all?</div><div id="00:35:12.380" class="transcript_line"> Because we do have this weather.</div><div id="00:35:14.220" class="transcript_line"> Mark does watering.</div><div id="00:35:15.740" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:35:16.820" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve planted everything up and it&#039;s all in pots, so it&#039;s easy.</div><div id="00:35:21.300" class="transcript_line"> He mows the lawn.</div><div id="00:35:22.980" class="transcript_line"> I like sitting on it.</div><div id="00:35:24.140" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got the most lovely patio.</div><div id="00:35:26.460" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re just lying in the sun.</div><div id="00:35:28.860" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a couple of times.</div><div id="00:35:30.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think you&#039;ve had squash or an ice cream on my patio.</div><div id="00:35:32.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a couple of times.</div><div id="00:35:34.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:35.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so.</div><div id="00:35:37.260" class="transcript_line"> How many live here for?</div><div id="00:35:40.100" class="transcript_line"> How many?</div><div id="00:35:40.860" class="transcript_line"> How many live here for?</div><div id="00:35:42.900" class="transcript_line"> How many have I lived here?</div><div id="00:35:43.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:44.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:45.140" class="transcript_line"> Well, funnily enough, we moved there.</div><div id="00:35:48.660" class="transcript_line"> How old are you, Mike?</div><div id="00:35:50.380" class="transcript_line"> 32 now.</div><div id="00:35:51.820" class="transcript_line"> So I moved into that house.</div><div id="00:35:53.620" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 43.</div><div id="00:35:55.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:56.100" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:35:56.820" class="transcript_line"> I thought me and you were similar age.</div><div id="00:36:00.860" class="transcript_line"> So we moved into the house and I got pregnant that night.</div><div id="00:36:05.740" class="transcript_line"> With Mike, was there?</div><div id="00:36:07.060" class="transcript_line"> Nine months later, we had Michael.</div><div id="00:36:09.020" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my God.</div><div id="00:36:10.260" class="transcript_line"> Now he&#039;s grown up like a weed now.</div><div id="00:36:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:13.020" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s grown up like a weed.</div><div id="00:36:14.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when you&#039;re a baby, you&#039;re like this.</div><div id="00:36:18.060" class="transcript_line"> So I always know how long I&#039;ve lived in my house.</div><div id="00:36:21.660" class="transcript_line"> By asking Mike how old he is.</div><div id="00:36:24.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:25.460" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:27.740" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m basically a walking time stamp.</div><div id="00:36:31.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:33.020" class="transcript_line"> So any other questions?</div><div id="00:36:34.220" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:36:34.740" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite nice to be asked the question.</div><div id="00:36:36.060" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:36:36.860" class="transcript_line"> You should be.</div><div id="00:36:38.100" class="transcript_line"> How tall are you?</div><div id="00:36:40.660" class="transcript_line"> 1.2, because both 2.4.</div><div id="00:36:47.820" class="transcript_line"> When did I join?</div><div id="00:36:48.660"

class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known you guys.</div><div id="00:36:54.020" class="transcript_line"> How many years?</div><div id="00:36:55.140" class="transcript_line"> Well, 32 years.</div><div id="00:36:56.060" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known most of you.</div><div id="00:36:57.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:58.060" class="transcript_line"> But then I came back from university.</div><div id="00:37:01.740" class="transcript_line"> You knew me when I was that tall.</div><div id="00:37:03.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:03.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:04.300" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have known him from a baby, actually.</div><div id="00:37:06.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:07.100" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I got photos of some of you guys holding me as a babe.</div><div id="00:37:10.700" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:37:11.900" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:37:13.380" class="transcript_line"> Still as happy as I was.</div><div id="00:37:15.220" class="transcript_line"> So was

class="transcript_line"> I tell you what, Michael&#039;s going to take your photo, actually,</div><div id="00:37:24.020" class="transcript_line"> with your permission.</div><div id="00:37:25.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:26.700" class="transcript_line"> I like photographing.</div><div id="00:37:27.780" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re photographing, and what we&#039;re doing is we&#039;re sending the photos off</div><div id="00:37:31.420" class="transcript_line"> to people who are running this project.</div><div id="00:37:34.300" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re building up, well, just our story about how we&#039;re doing this project.</div><div id="00:37:39.700" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s OK.</div><div id="00:37:40.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:41.180" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s photos that we took, like of Michael as a baby, with you guys</div><div id="00:37:47.580" class="transcript_line"> and you, Jess, in your black and yellow tracksuit.</div><div id="00:37:52.340" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what gives us the memories and helps us remember.</div><div id="00:37:55.540" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:37:57.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:57.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;re just trying to build up a picture from the beginning</div><div id="00:38:00.860" class="transcript_line"> all the way to this beautiful building we&#039;re sat in.</div><div id="00:38:03.420" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:38:04.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:04.860" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s happened over the last 50 years.</div><div id="00:38:07.740" class="transcript_line"> Because how old are you, Kev?</div><div id="00:38:12.620" class="transcript_line"> Right, so you would have been eight years old when, no, six years old</div><div id="00:38:17.620" class="transcript_line"> when Mencap started.</div><div id="00:38:19.860" class="transcript_line"> And you know Leonie, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:38:23.380" class="transcript_line"> Because she lives in your street.</div><div id="00:38:25.940" class="transcript_line"> Because you used to go to another place rather than Chester Mencap</div><div id="00:38:30.740" class="transcript_line"> during the week.</div><div id="00:38:32.060" class="transcript_line"> You used to go to Orchard Trust.</div><div id="00:38:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:35.100" class="transcript_line"> About 18 years.</div><div id="00:38:37.140" class="transcript_line"> About 18 years.</div><div id="00:38:38.140" class="transcript_line"> About, about.</div><div id="00:38:39.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well that would fit in.</div><div id="00:38:41.220" class="transcript_line"> 18 years there.</div><div id="00:38:42.460" class="transcript_line"> About 18 years.</div><div id="00:38:44.140" class="transcript_line"> And what did you use to do at Orchard Trust?</div><div id="00:38:49.220" class="transcript_line"> Dominoes.</div><div id="00:38:51.020" class="transcript_line"> Dominoes?</div><div id="00:38:52.260" class="transcript_line"> Dominoes.</div><div id="00:38:53.900" class="transcript_line"> Animals.</div><div id="00:38:54.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the animals.</div><div id="00:38:55.900" class="transcript_line"> The sheep.</div><div id="00:38:57.740" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a photo of you holding a lamb, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:39:00.020" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:01.020" class="transcript_line"> I got a picture of him up home as well.</div><div id="00:39:03.780" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s holding a
