    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Initially, let us say thank you from HDA to the Heritage Lottery Wales for their support</div><div id="00:00:10.720" class="transcript_line"> in enabling us to undertake this series of podcasts.</div><div id="00:00:16.200" class="transcript_line"> This podcast is about the Glamorganshire Canal.</div><div id="00:00:23.240" class="transcript_line"> The Glamorganshire Canal in South Wales first started in 1790 and the reason it is relevant</div><div id="00:00:30.600" class="transcript_line"> to Bute Town is that is where it ended up.</div><div id="00:00:37.360" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of people don&#039;t know where it is now.</div><div id="00:00:40.800" class="transcript_line"> But nonetheless, it ran from Merthyr down to Cardiff and the sea.</div><div id="00:00:49.080" class="transcript_line"> In 1794 the canal was opened between Cardiff and Merthyr over the mountains of South Wales.</div><div id="00:00:56.520" class="transcript_line"> This was considered fairly wondrous at the time.</div><div id="00:01:01.020" class="transcript_line"> Within 24.5 miles it rose to a height of 300 meters requiring 49 locks.</div><div id="00:01:09.920" class="transcript_line"> As you will understand what a lock does.</div><div id="00:01:13.760" class="transcript_line"> The lock controls levels.</div><div id="00:01:17.360" class="transcript_line"> So every time a canal barge now or then goes through a lock, two lock gates close.</div><div id="00:01:26.600" class="transcript_line"> One behind it, one in front of it.</div><div id="00:01:29.520" class="transcript_line"> And if it is travelling to Cardiff from Merthyr, every time that happened it dropped in height</div><div id="00:01:38.360" class="transcript_line"> and came out the other gate lower than the original height.</div><div id="00:01:43.460" class="transcript_line"> So it is important to think of lock gates as a series of stairs, steps so to speak.</div><div id="00:01:51.980" class="transcript_line"> So when the canal was opened in 1794 Cardiff had a population of just 4,000 people.</div><div id="00:02:00.580" class="transcript_line"> And in 1798 the canal was extended one mile seaward and included a sea lock.</div><div id="00:02:09.400" class="transcript_line"> The total cost of building the canal was Â£103,600.</div><div id="00:02:15.640" class="transcript_line"> The hills and valleys surrounding Merthyr were rich with limestone, iron ore and coal.</div><div id="00:02:21.040" class="transcript_line"> The canal predominantly followed the route of the River Tath and was able to carry these</div><div id="00:02:26.480" class="transcript_line"> raw materials and finished goods from the four Merthyr ironworks far more cheaply and</div><div id="00:02:33.100" class="transcript_line"> quickly than the previous method which was mule train.</div><div id="00:02:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Merthyr at the time was the largest town in Wales.</div><div id="00:02:42.480" class="transcript_line"> That was in 1850.</div><div id="00:02:44.840" class="transcript_line"> It was twice the size of its nearest rival Swansea and greater than the combined populations</div><div id="00:02:51.400" class="transcript_line"> of Swansea and Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Merthyr&#039;s growth was brought about due to the expansion of the iron industry.</div><div id="00:02:59.560" class="transcript_line"> It was the industrial heart of Wales.</div><div id="00:03:03.320" class="transcript_line"> The four great ironworks, Dowlus, Penadarren, Plymouth and Caerphartha were able to transport</div><div id="00:03:11.320" class="transcript_line"> their finished iron on a single barge 9 foot wide and 60 foot long.</div><div id="00:03:16.440" class="transcript_line"> 24 tonnes of iron could be towed by one horse needing only one man and a boy to run it efficiently.</div><div id="00:03:26.320" class="transcript_line"> These round trips in Cardiff could be completed in a fortnight.</div><div id="00:03:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Previously the tonnage required 48 horses, 12 men, 12 boys and would take significantly</div><div id="00:03:37.200" class="transcript_line"> longer.</div><div id="00:03:39.480" class="transcript_line"> Despite the railway boom in the 1840s and the opening of Bute Docks in Cardiff the canal</div><div id="00:03:44.760" class="transcript_line"> continued to flourish.</div><div id="00:03:47.200" class="transcript_line"> The Industrial Revolution, especially the coal boom in South Wales, saw unprecedented</div><div id="00:03:53.160" class="transcript_line"> growth of trade on the canal.</div><div id="00:03:55.720" class="transcript_line"> In 1858 at its economic peak the canal transported 467,000 tonnes of coal.</div><div id="00:04:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Within a decade this had slowed considerably.</div><div id="00:04:10.160" class="transcript_line"> The canal was a victim of its own success.</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> The trade boom and subsequent congestion was the primary cause of its decline.</div><div id="00:04:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Richard Crochet, owner of the Carpatho Ironworks, had the canal built to his ironworks in Merthyr.</div><div id="00:04:28.640" class="transcript_line"> He then opposed all efforts from the three other ironworks owners to do the same.</div><div id="00:04:37.160" class="transcript_line"> They tried to extend the canal or allow feeders to be built and this eventually led to the</div><div id="00:04:42.720" class="transcript_line"> setting up of the Taff Vale Railway Company by the three other iron masters to transport</div><div id="00:04:51.080" class="transcript_line"> their wares to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:04:53.440" class="transcript_line"> By 1888 the canal was owned by Lord Bute.</div><div id="00:04:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Lord Bute planned to use much of the canal on which to build a railway.</div><div id="00:05:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Its economic life was effectively over.</div><div id="00:05:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Although sand dredges and timber floats carried on using parts of the canal until 1942.</div><div id="00:05:13.920" class="transcript_line"> There are very little remains of the canal in Cardiff today.</div><div id="00:05:18.280" class="transcript_line"> The exception is the Glamorganshire Canal Nature Reserve at Corryton adjacent to junction 32 of the M4,</div><div id="00:05:27.960" class="transcript_line"> some five miles from Cardiff Docks.</div><div id="00:05:31.200" class="transcript_line"> The one kilometre stretch of the canal was lovingly restored in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:05:38.080" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the only jewel of the canal and that&#039;s in Forest Farm Country Park.</div><div id="00:05:45.240" class="transcript_line"> Today limited traces of the canal remain.</div><div id="00:05:48.720" class="transcript_line"> About one half being covered by the A470 Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil Drunk Road which was constructed</div><div id="00:05:55.520" class="transcript_line"> in the 1970s.</div><div id="00:05:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Much of the Taff trail between Abercunnan and Merthyr Tydfil follows the line of the canal.</div><div id="00:06:03.680" class="transcript_line"> A section from Tanguinalis to the Melingrefeth Tin Plateworks at Wychurch has been retained</div><div id="00:06:10.440" class="transcript_line"> in water and was used for fishing but is now the Glamorganshire Canal Local Nature Reserve.</div><div id="00:06:17.760" class="transcript_line"> In addition there are a few bridges and locks which have not been destroyed.</div><div id="00:06:23.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s also a short stretch in water at 19 Gale Bush and at locks 31 and 32 in Pontypriddh.</div><div id="00:06:32.120" class="transcript_line"> A boat weighing machine, one of only four known to have existed on British canals,</div><div id="00:06:36.960" class="transcript_line"> was originally installed at Tanguinalis and was later moved to North Road Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:42.400" class="transcript_line"> The machine was presented to the British Transport Commission in 1955 and was re-erected at the</div><div id="00:06:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Stoke-Burn Canal Museum in Northamptonshire.</div><div id="00:06:52.880" class="transcript_line"> In 2013 it was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea.</div><div id="00:06:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s briefly consider another very very important building, very near the North Norwegian Church,</div><div id="00:07:06.520" class="transcript_line"> the Pierhead building.</div><div id="00:07:09.080" class="transcript_line"> Bright red it appears in every single photograph.</div><div id="00:07:12.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s grade one listed and it&#039;s built in what is now Cardiff Bay, Wales but of course was</div><div id="00:07:19.720" class="transcript_line"> on the docks.</div><div id="00:07:21.920" class="transcript_line"> It was originally built in 1897 as the headquarters for the Bute Dock Company.</div><div id="00:07:27.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now part of the estate of Senedd Cymru, the Welsh Parliament, which also includes</div><div id="00:07:32.800" class="transcript_line"> the Senedd Building at Teowel.</div><div id="00:07:34.840" class="transcript_line"> The clock on the building is unofficially known as Baby Big Ben or the Big Ben of Wales.</div><div id="00:07:43.440" class="transcript_line"> The building was built by the English architect William Frame and it was a replacement for</div><div id="00:07:48.280" class="transcript_line"> the headquarters of the Bute Docks Company which burnt down in 1892.</div><div id="00:07:53.960" class="transcript_line"> The Bute Dock Company was renamed Cardiff Railway Company in 1897.</div><div id="00:07:59.080" class="transcript_line"> A coat of arms on the building faÃ§ade bears the company motto, The Water and Fire, by</div><div id="00:08:07.280" class="transcript_line"> Water and Fire.</div><div id="00:08:10.780" class="transcript_line"> The building became the administrative office to the Port of Cardiff in 1947.</div><div id="00:08:17.040" class="transcript_line"> There are a number of other listed buildings in Cardiff Bay and the Docklands which give</div><div id="00:08:23.560" class="transcript_line"> you a sense of the opulence and wealth that existed in Cardiff Docks.</div><div id="00:08:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Much of what you now sit on, if you&#039;re at that end of Butetown and Cardiff, actually</div><div id="00:08:40.820" class="transcript_line"> never existed because it was underwater and the docks were filled.</div><div id="00:08:47.300" class="transcript_line"> For a lot of children from Butetown, going back to the Glamourne</div><div id="00:08:49.940" class="transcript_line"> Chiew Canal, their memories are very clear of it.</div><div id="00:08:56.580" class="transcript_line"> I say children, I mean those in their 60s, 70s, 80s.</div><div id="00:09:03.580" class="transcript_line"> They remember swimming in the canal, making boats, remember some of their friends drowning</div><div id="00:09:13.640" class="transcript_line"> in there.</div><div id="00:09:15.420" class="transcript_line"> So, Glamourne Chiew Canal was a significantly important part of the growth of the docks.</div><div id="00:09:23.420" class="transcript_line"> But the thing that I find most interesting in a lot of ways is that when it was first</div><div id="00:09:29.820" class="transcript_line"> opened Merthyr was the biggest town in Wales.</div><div id="00:09:36.460" class="transcript_line"> And I will continually restate this point.</div><div id="00:09:40.620" class="transcript_line"> And then thanks in part to the vision and the wealth of Lord Bute and a number of iron</div><div id="00:09:51.700" class="transcript_line"> work companies, but largely, in my opinion, to the sweat of the miners at one end, the</div><div id="00:10:04.900" class="transcript_line"> iron workers at one end, and at the other end, the merchant seamen and dock workers.</div><div id="00:10:12.900" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff grew beyond Merthyr, beyond Swansea, and became the capital of Wales.</div><div id="00:10:19.900" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s just a brief explanation of the Glamourne Chiew Canal and the Pierhead building.</div></div></p>
