    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Tuesday the 30th of October 2018 and I am Nigel May standing in for Stephanie Cruz,</div><div id="00:00:06.440" class="transcript_line"> Cultural Heritage Officer for the Elan Valley Project.</div><div id="00:00:10.960" class="transcript_line"> With me today are Tim Hipkis, Mike Leitcham and Don Emerich.</div><div id="00:00:16.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s correct.</div><div id="00:00:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I pronounced that correctly.</div><div id="00:00:18.560" class="transcript_line"> A group of friends who are walking the Elan Valley Way and Sections.</div><div id="00:00:22.300" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for talking to me today.</div><div id="00:00:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Don, if I can start with you, I know you and your friends have been walking together now</div><div id="00:00:28.420" class="transcript_line"> for many years and have done over 200 walks across England and the Welsh Marches.</div><div id="00:00:33.460" class="transcript_line"> What made you choose the Elan Valley Way and when did you start doing it?</div><div id="00:00:38.500" class="transcript_line"> When did we start doing it?</div><div id="00:00:40.380" class="transcript_line"> May this year.</div><div id="00:00:43.380" class="transcript_line"> May this year.</div><div id="00:00:45.500" class="transcript_line"> Like you said, we&#039;d done quite a lot of walks and we were doing a St Canelm&#039;s Way and on</div><div id="00:00:51.900" class="transcript_line"> that way we saw some pipe work being laid, the pipe works being laid and we took an interest</div><div id="00:00:58.900" class="transcript_line"> mostly because they&#039;re made in Spain and I have experience of living in Spain so I caught</div><div id="00:01:04.380" class="transcript_line"> our eye and took some nice photographs and then Tim did some research and found out about</div><div id="00:01:12.180" class="transcript_line"> the Elan Way and has organised the walk and off we go.</div><div id="00:01:18.420" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:01:19.420" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Don.</div><div id="00:01:20.420" class="transcript_line"> Whilst the Elan Valley doesn&#039;t follow the exact route of the pipeline from Elan Valley</div><div id="00:01:23.800" class="transcript_line"> to Franklin and Birmingham, Mike, what are your thoughts on this massive piece of Victorian</div><div id="00:01:28.580" class="transcript_line"> engineering?</div><div id="00:01:29.580" class="transcript_line"> I was just amazed to find out the detail about it.</div><div id="00:01:33.700" class="transcript_line"> We actually had a walk which took in the pipes crossing the Ledwich Brook just east of Ludlow</div><div id="00:01:41.020" class="transcript_line"> which was in our local paper and we went and did that a couple of years ago I think and</div><div id="00:01:46.500" class="transcript_line"> the detail was given in that article.</div><div id="00:01:48.100" class="transcript_line"> It was just amazing the fact that it&#039;s all done by gravity which I never realised.</div><div id="00:01:53.300" class="transcript_line"> I thought all those little houses you could see were pump houses but the fact that it&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:56.940" class="transcript_line"> all gravity and that it was all done what, 130, 110, 120 years ago wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:04.940" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of experience then.</div><div id="00:02:07.340" class="transcript_line"> They dug canals, Manchester and Liverpool had had water from the Lake District and Lake</div><div id="00:02:12.860" class="transcript_line"> Wrenwey and so on so there was a lot of experience but it was still I think a brilliant undertaking</div><div id="00:02:18.380" class="transcript_line"> that the water can fall at the rate of, well across your living room, sixteenth of an inch</div><div id="00:02:24.460" class="transcript_line"> and do that for 73 miles or whatever.</div><div id="00:02:26.420" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s absolutely staggering.</div><div id="00:02:29.060" class="transcript_line"> I visited the Elan Valley and the lakes and so on many times with the kids and the grandkids</div><div id="00:02:33.460" class="transcript_line"> but never appreciated the scale of it until I read those sort of details and then we saw</div><div id="00:02:37.740" class="transcript_line"> the pipes and it&#039;s been great.</div><div id="00:02:40.420" class="transcript_line"> Ever since we&#039;ve enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:02:42.580" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Mike.</div><div id="00:02:43.580" class="transcript_line"> And finally Tim, I know you used to be a geography teacher.</div><div id="00:02:46.780" class="transcript_line"> Is there any elements that stand out for you particularly in terms of social geography</div><div id="00:02:51.420" class="transcript_line"> of the pipeline?</div><div id="00:02:52.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ve done a script here and I think it&#039;s best if I go through them and then you</div><div id="00:02:57.500" class="transcript_line"> can use it however you want.</div><div id="00:02:59.860" class="transcript_line"> I said my interest was provoked like Mike and Don when we crossed the new pipeline route</div><div id="00:03:05.300" class="transcript_line"> on several occasions throughout our last walk.</div><div id="00:03:08.460" class="transcript_line"> I contacted 7 Trent to find out what it was all about.</div><div id="00:03:12.140" class="transcript_line"> I had a very helpful document download which explained that the new pipeline was being</div><div id="00:03:16.180" class="transcript_line"> constructed to enable work to be done on the existing pipeline as and when needed.</div><div id="00:03:22.220" class="transcript_line"> If the pipeline was closed this new section called the Birmingham Resilience Project would</div><div id="00:03:28.180" class="transcript_line"> be used to keep water flowing to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:03:31.100" class="transcript_line"> The 26K pipeline runs from Lickhill on the River Severn between Budely and Stourport</div><div id="00:03:37.380" class="transcript_line"> to Frankley Reservoir.</div><div id="00:03:39.180" class="transcript_line"> I then contacted a friend who I&#039;d recorded asking me to walk with him on the Elam Valley</div><div id="00:03:43.060" class="transcript_line"> Way near my home.</div><div id="00:03:44.980" class="transcript_line"> I was then able to secure an out of print copy of the book and put the idea to the others.</div><div id="00:03:50.420" class="transcript_line"> Geographically these are the points that have interested me.</div><div id="00:03:54.100" class="transcript_line"> What was the reason for the dams and aqueduct?</div><div id="00:03:56.860" class="transcript_line"> The area selected to meet a need for fresh water was based on sound theoretical geography</div><div id="00:04:02.620" class="transcript_line"> i.e. there was high rainfall in the area, on average 70mm per annum.</div><div id="00:04:08.540" class="transcript_line"> The narrow valleys were ideal for building dams.</div><div id="00:04:11.820" class="transcript_line"> The bedrock of the area was impermeable, ideal for retaining water.</div><div id="00:04:16.940" class="transcript_line"> And the two valleys were higher than Birmingham, thus gravity would facilitate the flow to</div><div id="00:04:21.460" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham avoiding the need for pumps.</div><div id="00:04:25.020" class="transcript_line"> Second point, the effect on the population of the valleys was negative but positive for</div><div id="00:04:29.780" class="transcript_line"> the growing population of Birmingham.</div><div id="00:04:32.820" class="transcript_line"> In Elan 18 cottages, a church, a chapel, a school and two residences were destroyed.</div><div id="00:04:39.620" class="transcript_line"> The effects of, the third point, the effects of major construction project not just in</div><div id="00:04:44.420" class="transcript_line"> Elan but along the route.</div><div id="00:04:46.580" class="transcript_line"> The influx of navvies on the social make-up of the various settlements.</div><div id="00:04:53.100" class="transcript_line"> Increasing demand in Birmingham led to the construction of a second reservoir, Barclay,</div><div id="00:04:57.660" class="transcript_line"> which is now a provider of open space and water activities.</div><div id="00:05:01.500" class="transcript_line"> That was in the 1930s I think.</div><div id="00:05:04.780" class="transcript_line"> Industry and nature along the route is the fifth point.</div><div id="00:05:07.780" class="transcript_line"> The geology of the iron, coal and limestone deposits along the route around Coockley,</div><div id="00:05:13.460" class="transcript_line"> on the Clees, around Lentwood Island and so on.</div><div id="00:05:16.860" class="transcript_line"> Sixth point, the nature and wildlife on the two Birmingham reservoirs and at Trimpley</div><div id="00:05:22.180" class="transcript_line"> and the stunning scenery, the woods, the vistas, the route through the wire forest.</div><div id="00:05:28.260" class="transcript_line"> Seven on the Clee Hills, there was the history of it, the scattered settlements and evidence</div><div id="00:05:33.820" class="transcript_line"> of pipeline valve chambers were appearing and the interesting human population I think</div><div id="00:05:40.060" class="transcript_line"> is the expression interesting in quotation marks.</div><div id="00:05:43.780" class="transcript_line"> The eighth, the area south of Ludlow, the vision of the three pipes crossing at Ledwich</div><div id="00:05:49.300" class="transcript_line"> and the Canem Iron Age Camp nearby.</div><div id="00:05:53.780" class="transcript_line"> The ninth point, Lentwood Island itself is a Roman site and the influence of the Marcher</div><div id="00:05:58.500" class="transcript_line"> Lords, the boundary between England and Wales, why was it there and so on.</div><div id="00:06:03.700" class="transcript_line"> Tenth point, the wildlife and land use on the approach to Knighton and the hills of</div><div id="00:06:07.140" class="transcript_line"> the marchers has been fascinating.</div><div id="00:06:10.340" class="transcript_line"> The eleventh point, the warring factions, Owain, Glendua, the Mortimer&#039;s, the English Civil</div><div id="00:06:16.140" class="transcript_line"> War, whilst that&#039;s a matter of history, why here, why in this region?</div><div id="00:06:21.620" class="transcript_line"> And finally, Offers Dyke, which we&#039;re going to walk today, why is it there, how was it</div><div id="00:06:27.540" class="transcript_line"> built and what&#039;s its route?</div><div id="00:06:30.060" class="transcript_line"> Those are my points that I would use as a geography teacher that I could see an awful</div><div id="00:06:34.700" class="transcript_line"> lot of work done with my colleagues in history and biology and so on.</div><div id="00:06:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Tim, that was very very thorough and thank you for that.</div><div id="00:06:46.380" class="transcript_line"> In conclusion, are there any other points that you&#039;d like to say about the valley and</div><div id="00:06:53.140" class="transcript_line"> the pipeline?</div><div id="00:06:54.140" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the countryside.</div><div id="00:06:55.140" class="transcript_line"> I would just add to that, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:56.860" class="transcript_line"> I think also the contrast from beginning in Birmingham and realising that all this pipe</div><div id="00:07:01.940" class="transcript_line"> work is bringing water and you just take it for granted, water&#039;s so much tame for granted.</div><div id="00:07:07.620" class="transcript_line"> And then walking through fabulous countryside, absolutely wonderful.</div><div id="00:07:11.060" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve met some nice people along the way.</div><div id="00:07:14.140" class="transcript_line"> Cumberlanding agree.</div><div id="00:07:15.140" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you very much for your time, it&#039;s very very much appreciated and good luck with</div><div id="00:07:19.420" class="transcript_line"> the rest of the walk and hope you have an enjoyable time.</div><div id="00:07:21.900" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:07:22.900" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
