    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> ...interview by Dr. L.H. Thomas with W.E. Davis of Regina, September 1st, 1970.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, they didn&#039;t have to go and live on the farm. They could stay at home.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But if they were over the 7-mile limits, they were already quite well-off.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s six months of the year. The other six months they would love to...</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them went away to work in the bushes during the winter months, you know,</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> to get some money to help themselves along, or went out to work on farms and so on.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But they, again, they couldn&#039;t start working until they were 18.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the time they started to improve their homesets.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they received by the time, they said that three years to get their titles.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they&#039;d be about 21, you see.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Get their titles on the land.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we came here, of course, all they were asking was to cultivate 30 acres in that three years.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s only just 10 acres a year, see, that was all that was required.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was no requirement for any buildings of any amount.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s changed, of course, a lot since then.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the way it was worked up then.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. Would you say that the first years, the first two or three or four years in the settlement</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> were particularly hard, tough for the migrants?</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, I wouldn&#039;t say they were tough.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No more so than for the settlers, generally.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the climate was, that was the thing that we had to get accustomed to, you see.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there you don&#039;t get any lower than 30 or, although they had frost there,</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and there too, you see, in the Argentine, when we were thinking frost there.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember sleet there.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We were there.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there any significant number of people who withdrew, who left the settlement</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and either went back to the Argentine or went into work in the towns, Winnipeg, shall we say?</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, some returned to Wales, and some returned back to Patagonia and all of that,</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and others went to various places in Canada.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, am I right in thinking that very few of the people spoke anything but Spanish and Welsh initially?</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there just very few English speakers?</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> There weren&#039;t very many.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there were very few.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, my mother was very fluent in English.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d been teaching in Wales before coming out.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> She was very fluent.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, her father, he didn&#039;t have any hard-earned education at all, you know,</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> because he was half-dead before he was six.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there was, all he had was a little Welsh, but he had to work when he was very young.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I know what that means.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I gather that the settlers were anxious to establish schools promptly where the children could learn English quickly.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that your...?</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We were here, we came here in June 1902, and the Royal School Districts, number eight out of seven,</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> it was open on the 4th of May, 1904, so we were practically almost two years before we had a school.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember that very well.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I often wonder, you know, what the teachers of today would do.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> There were about 30 pupils there that morning, and you could count on one hand the number that understood English.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The rest of them had no English at all.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We had no English, but we were bilingual then.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We could speak Spanish, I could speak Spanish.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the rule, I think, and I speak English today when I first came out,</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s gone, I was too young to keep it up, you see.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But we kept up the Welsh.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s the point I wanted to come at now.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh was kept up relatively well.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, for a good many years.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, yes, just as it had been in the Argentine.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But unlike the situation originally in the Argentine,</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> where the idea had really been to establish a separate Welsh state,</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> that objective had long since been given up.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I take it from what you say, Mr. Davies, then, that taking that settlement as a whole,</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> that you could say that the success of the settlers was comparable to the success of settlers</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> of other origins in adjacent areas.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I would say so, yes.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the situation when the first war broke out?</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there many who enlisted and went overseas?</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> A good number, a good number.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of them are lying in France, and they were born in the Argentine.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They found their resting place in the first war.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure this was true of many areas of the prairies where United Kingdom settlers established themselves.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The interwar years were, I suppose, similar due to other areas of Saskatchewan in terms of the relative success of farming.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have, in the 30s, the same drug conditions up there, did you?</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not in parts, we didn&#039;t have that severe, it was dry enough, of course, but it wasn&#039;t like some parts,</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> south more to the southwest here.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have that.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Was the wheat pool an active factor in the community?</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess I&#039;m one of the few original ones that, I didn&#039;t know that people came there in 1923.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, now I&#039;m out of farming, I&#039;m out of it altogether, but I&#039;m certain there&#039;s not very many of them left in the community,</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, the younger generation.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, now, that was another question that I was interested in.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The children of the Welsh settlers have remained on the land, at least some of them, I take it,</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and have taken over the family farm, or have they tended to move away?</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s some of them still, but very few of them remain there on the farm.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There are some, of course.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Some have gone to various occupations in them.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> What would your guesstimate be that 40 or 50 people of Welsh background now farming there, or more than that?</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think there&#039;d be more than that.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose there was an effort in the early years to keep up the musical tradition of the Welsh.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, that was kept up.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our singing festivals and we used to draw them from all parties to come there and just listen to the singing.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our competitive festivals there for years.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Instead, we&#039;d see that was held there for a good many years.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the Welsh Church was organized there in 1904.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, which denomination was that?</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the Calvinistic Methodist.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Not the Calvinistic Methodist, but as they are known today, the Presbyterians.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, yes.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> In 1905, they became affiliated with a denomination in the United States.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And from there, we had help to keep a minister, and we were alone to build our church.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> We built the church in 1910.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Before that, we all had our services in the schools.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s another congregation that has their services in the school at the Glendul district,</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> another five miles away, the other part of Welshmeadow.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, indeed.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And did they succeed in getting Welsh clergymen in the early years?</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Did I understand you to say that there was an Anglican church in the community?</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there&#039;s an Anglican church. There&#039;s a St. David&#039;s Anglican church in Bangor.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s the St. David&#039;s and St. Athelps in the Fluonan district.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s on the farm that my father bought.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He bought a farm with a church situated there.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, now, I&#039;m a little surprised at this because I tend to think of Welsh people as being nonconformist rather than Anglican.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But some of them were Anglican, were they?</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, very few of them.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But the Anglicans, the Church of the English Seculars, were coming in.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But they did have a Welsh service there for the Anglican church, too.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> A man came out there in 1906.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was Levenyver Jones.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was there in 1907 or 1908, I think, when he left.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t have a minister at that time.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And my oldest sister, she was the first marriage that took place in that St. Athelps church, with the servant Jones, Lyra Jones.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He left there and he went to Prince Albert when he was in Denver for many years.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, tell me a bit about the centenary celebrations in Patagonia that you attended.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That must have been quite a thrill for you.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was quite a thrill, of course, going all that way.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you fly down?</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;d never been in a plane before.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the three sisters, my sister, my other sister, she was in the poor town, the state of Washington, USA.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She wanted to go, but the doctor wouldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:12:55.000" class="transcript_line"> The minister said there&#039;s too long a journey.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And her husband, he was born out there, too, and he had a lot of problems.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So he came with us, with the five of us.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> He came here from Fort Thomas to Regina and joined us here and we went.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We had quite a good time there.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And now I see there, of course, there&#039;s some there that&#039;s still remembered.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There were quite a few of the children we used to go to school with.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite a few of them.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We were playing a real rally.</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a banquet and all that.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> No admissions, we were just going on the buses, just walked on there.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Just a second and I&#039;ll get you a mic.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well that&#039;s a very nice medal, Mr. Davies.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for doing that.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And you must have enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That picture is 105 years old.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my father.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well?</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my grandmother and that&#039;s his brother.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another one there, he died on the sea.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I see, I see.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a picture, or a copy of a picture, of the 1865 settlers and also a picture taken on the ship bringing the group to Canada.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think that all of the people who came to Canada are in the picture, but quite a number are.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I hope to reproduce these two pictures when I do this little article on the settlement.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> There was an interesting article written by Bryn Williams in the British Journal, the Geographical Journal on the Patagonian Welsh back in 1961 with a number of interesting photos in it.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was surprised.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I went back and I met some of the, I knew there were children of the old settlers like my father was, you know, like I was.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They were there and they said that he&#039;s got quite a few errors in his books.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, how is that?</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I said, I remember the old gentleman, his name was Richard Jones, but he took the name Berwyn after him.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was another Jones there, and he was from that range of mountains, the Berwyn Mountains.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> He came from close, he took the name Berwyn.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to call him Berwyn, that&#039;s all of them.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember him quite well.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to be the recorder there and everything else.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, well, those records were lost in the flood of 1905 after you left.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s nobody afterwards.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s got most of this information, you see, from other people.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of them had no connection with the first pioneers.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So then they had one book here, it&#039;s not here now, my sister had it.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And in that year, I know that one is an error.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s talking about the group that went up with Colonel Fontana to explore the country in 1885.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said they were a group of young, single, romantic young men.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They were married people among them.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was amongst them, and he was married and had two children.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Is this the group that founded the settlement up in the foothills of the Andes?</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Richard Welland&#039;s novel, Up into the Singing Mountain?</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I haven&#039;t seen that book.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it is a sequel to How Green Was My Valley.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a very good novel, and it&#039;s set in the Patagonian settlement.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the combination of it is the movement of this group up into that area,</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> or at least the main character goes up with some others after the floods of, I guess, 1899.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> At the turn of the century.</div><div id="00:17:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that flood.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;m sure you do.</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember it quite well.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I would have lost to that.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Where are the big pictures that you have taken?</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, get those others that I took. They&#039;d be more interesting.</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a bit of this.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Just repeat, Mr. Davies, about the group who went down to the anniversary celebrations and the congregational singing.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you see, there&#039;s a group of 72 there from Wales.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And the editor of this journal, Elvis of the Rainbow, he was there.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s also the secretary of the union of the Welsh people in dispersion, as they&#039;re called.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s the secretary of that too. He was there.</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And the other thing, the leader was Dr. J. Alvin Davies, that, progressively, has since passed away.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They were there. But the singing was there, of course, just as good as it had ever been in Wales.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Couldn&#039;t be any better.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Couldn&#039;t be any better.</div><div id="00:19:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a real good time there.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh people in that province are quite influential in the government, aren&#039;t they, of Patagonia?</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, some of them. There was one of them, well, I knew his brother. His brother used to be in school with me.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He was the minister of interior in Hayton Davies.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And, incidentally, his mother was the first child born after they landed there.</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s born in these caves where they...</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> See, there&#039;s a rock there, they call it a tosca.</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s very soft. If you&#039;ve got a good nail, if you can carve your name on it.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And they dug these caves in the rocks, and that&#039;s where they spent about...</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were there about six weeks before they started the journey into the valley.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they took some of the children by boat.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> These would take about two days to go by boat, then go up the Chubut River.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were met with a storm, and they were lost at sea, and they were away for about two weeks before they landed.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d run out of water and out of provisions, so it was pretty hard on the children, you know?</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure whether Dad was amongst that group or not.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether he did go with them, or whether he walked with the rest of them.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I heard him talking quite a bit about them going across these sandy, rocky places, you know?</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And about one man would put his stuff in the wheelbarrow, you know, and he&#039;d stand up,</div><div id="00:20:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and the whole thing was digging down into the sand.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had to leave that and throw the things on his back and carry them there.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t make any headway at all.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was loose gravel. I heard him talking about that, but I don&#039;t know for certain, you know, whether he went...</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they established very good relations with the Indians, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, thank you.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Indians taught them how to hunt with the bola and the lasso.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was an expert with his lasso and his bolas.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there was another one, a short one, about a yard long, two little...</div><div id="00:21:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to get the rabbits and patties or anything like that.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, a patties and then the sweet address, all that.</div><div id="00:21:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Just take the head, clean off.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Just drop right on the stone, you see, and it&#039;d be dropped right there.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But the head would be gone clean when you only want to...</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we first came out here, you see, your father and mother and sister, they went out to a farm.</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They were in the Crescent District to buy a cow.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And they got this cow and the calf was out sucking, you see.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And the old farmer says, well, we&#039;ll have to drive her into the barn, you see, to get this calf.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And he told my sister, you stay there.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And dad had his rope in his hand.</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We had no larry at the work.</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We just had an ordinary rope, you see.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And this calf went by my sister all this good work.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the old man says, why&#039;d you let that calf go?</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the next moment he saw the calf was lying down on the ground there.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He caught it, you see.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw the calf and he was lying down pulling and he was lying right down there.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And the hired man on the field had caught it there.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, come here, come here.</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, I want you to see what some of these new immigrants can do, is it?</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He was crazy.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I laughed over that.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Then Mr. McNutt.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think I&#039;m right in saying that he was the first speaker in the Saskatchewan Institute.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he was the first.</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew him quite well.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew the son, too, Russell.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew him, too, quite well.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had a lot of cattle out, you know, and shares to the lair of 25 head of cattle.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the young boys got them out and brought them out to the district there.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And they got to a certain place where they were to meet.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And that one there, when he got there here, they were trying to get these cows into the barn, you know, to catch them.</div><div id="00:23:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, and then we got a rope.</div><div id="00:23:13.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d taken some rope with him because he had two coming there.</div><div id="00:23:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, you ask, we have some rope here.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, all right.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So he started off and he was cutting a piece off every time.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The last two to one, the cow cut a piece off.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And till the end he wanted a short piece before he finished.</div><div id="00:23:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But he cut them all for them.</div><div id="00:23:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s very interesting.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very... and he could do braiding, you know, just...</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He learned that.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He braided anything with the leather, no matter how many strands you had or anything.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they did most of their own lair there, you see, their lair there, were leather.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they braided things, what they never tend to hide.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They just shaved the hair off, you know, and they braided them when they were real wet.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after they got finished, they tied onto their saddle and then they put the horse on there to pull for all those words.</div><div id="00:24:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after that they&#039;d soak it in oil.</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d iron the ring on the end of it, you see.</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw one of them breaking too, just before we came here.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The settlers weren&#039;t able, of course, to bring much in the way of property with them.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t much room on the boat for them to bring.</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there wouldn&#039;t be much room.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But what sort of things did they bring?</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There was mostly household articles and life with articles.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That?</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we have no regrets of it.</div><div id="00:24:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Father said he had never no regrets of coming to Canada anyway.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> See, the reason that he really left there was not so much the flooding, but the instability of the government.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, while we were there, I was introduced to the governor of the Chubut province, you see, my relative in land, in Chukwis.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then two or three days later he was out.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, still goes on.</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Still goes on. Yes, still goes on.</div><div id="00:25:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:25:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, the Argentine government originally had pursued a more or less hands-off policy,</div><div id="00:25:52.000" class="transcript_line"> had let the settlers carry on with their own schools, their own teachers, and really their own South government.</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That went on for ten years.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Ten years, that ended ten years.</div><div id="00:26:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then those little, bit by bit they came in, and then of course the schools went out and they had to take the Spanish, the national school.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to go there until you were fourteen.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But the Welsh people, they built a school there, that contributed to it before he came out here.</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was opened, I think, about 1912, a kind of a high school, to teach Welsh and English.</div><div id="00:26:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had a teacher from Wales there, a Mr Edmunds, and his wife, he was a BSc, you know, and his wife was a BA, and they both taught in that school.</div><div id="00:26:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s two or three from the colony went back to Wales, where they then graduated from the University of Aberystwyth,</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and then went back and taught in that school, the English and the Welsh.</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course they got no support from the government for it, and eventually they got that the Welsh people couldn&#039;t keep it up.</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So that had to be closed.</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So a good number of them there today are child English in that colony today.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousins there are all, they have got English, the Spanish and the Welsh.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Welsh, because of this school, there&#039;s quite a number of them like that there.</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re now, they&#039;re teaching the English in the schools there now too, you know.</div><div id="00:27:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s going to be quite a help.</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the thing that they&#039;re starting to do there now.</div><div id="00:27:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well in the 1890s, as I understand it, another source of worry to, I take it particularly the mothers,</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> of the young men who were getting to be of military age was that the boys would be in the Argentine Army with a lot of rough types.</div><div id="00:28:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, that was quite...</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I look forward to that.</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:28:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Pleasure.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a battle which they used to tell on Sundays, you know, and that was very much a cancer.</div><div id="00:28:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And they won out on that, they fought.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They won out on that, that there was no drilling to be honest with you.</div><div id="00:28:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the president promised them.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they could go with that.</div><div id="00:28:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Argentine national anthem, as he was in, unison.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And in 1890, Rocca, he was the president then, he said he was going to visit this colony at the time.</div><div id="00:28:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was an old... there he&#039;d been a bandmaster and he was well known in music and a bard too.</div><div id="00:28:55.000" class="transcript_line"> His name was William Jones, but there he was never known as William Jones.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He was called the old band.</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody knew him as the old band.</div><div id="00:29:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had a bardic and a musical named Guiney.</div><div id="00:29:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There was this bardic in it.</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he harmonized the national anthem, you see, for the voices, and he trained a choir to sing it by the time Rocca came down.</div><div id="00:29:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he heard the singing he says, that&#039;s going to be it.</div><div id="00:29:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the one they were singing there when we were now back in the hundred years,</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> was the harmonies of this old William Jones band, as they called it.</div><div id="00:29:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the harmony that was sung there, played and sung there at the hundredth anniversary.</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He was, I should say, he was really a musician, all right?</div><div id="00:29:45.000" class="transcript_line"> A natural musician.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, but he&#039;d been an old bandmaster, you know, in Wales and North Wales.</div><div id="00:29:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He was from Fristina.</div><div id="00:29:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he was quite a... quite a...</div><div id="00:29:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He went under the name of Guiney.</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And on this harmonies, you see, it says that the harmony, the air is by so-and-so, and the harmony by Guiney.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Doesn&#039;t it? William Jones is by Guiney.</div><div id="00:30:09.000" class="transcript_line"> His musical and bardic name, you see.</div><div id="00:30:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s very...</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No, he was quite a character.</div></div></p>
