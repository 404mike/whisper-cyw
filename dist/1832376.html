    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I did live in a tiny village at the foot of the Preselis.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We arrived there from the Midlands towards the end of 1972.</div><div id="00:00:15.320" class="transcript_line"> It was quite an experience.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It only took me what about a month to realise that I was living in a completely different</div><div id="00:00:27.160" class="transcript_line"> world.</div><div id="00:00:28.160" class="transcript_line"> The village at that time consisted of 11 dwellings and a pub which was an institution.</div><div id="00:00:37.720" class="transcript_line"> I was once asked when I was district nursing and I was 20 miles away what the patient said.</div><div id="00:00:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Jacobond?</div><div id="00:00:45.120" class="transcript_line"> I said, Oh yes indeed I do know Jacobond.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very tight knit community.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it took me about 10 years.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I met four different people, all of whom were Welsh nationalists and who were</div><div id="00:01:04.720" class="transcript_line"> all very kind and welcoming.</div><div id="00:01:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Both Peter and I, before we even came to Wales, knew that we were coming into a different</div><div id="00:01:16.920" class="transcript_line"> country with a different language.</div><div id="00:01:19.600" class="transcript_line"> I had started Welsh lessons within eight weeks of us living there.</div><div id="00:01:25.880" class="transcript_line"> I had looked around for the Welsh classes and decided on the one which was held at a</div><div id="00:01:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Skol Preseli in Crimyth, which of course is up in the Preselis.</div><div id="00:01:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And I chose that one because it had a language laboratory which I thought might help me.</div><div id="00:01:46.720" class="transcript_line"> On the way there, I&#039;d gone just a mile.</div><div id="00:01:49.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a very cold night, but clear moonlight.</div><div id="00:01:54.920" class="transcript_line"> I knew my way along that particular lane and the car stopped.</div><div id="00:02:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t know what to do.</div><div id="00:02:04.960" class="transcript_line"> However, it had stopped outside a house which at that time had become the post office.</div><div id="00:02:13.720" class="transcript_line"> It was called Hebron Post Office.</div><div id="00:02:17.720" class="transcript_line"> And the lane went from one end.</div><div id="00:02:21.520" class="transcript_line"> One end was called a place called Hleti.</div><div id="00:02:24.720" class="transcript_line"> And the other end, it was Glandua, which was in Pembrokeshire.</div><div id="00:02:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, I chatted with the lady at the post office who had three children.</div><div id="00:02:36.720" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, she said, well, my husband&#039;s out at the moment.</div><div id="00:02:41.720" class="transcript_line"> She said, but I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be able to help you.</div><div id="00:02:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And then I think she heard him coming.</div><div id="00:02:50.720" class="transcript_line"> She walked up the lane with me along with her one year old who just had just learned to walk.</div><div id="00:02:58.720" class="transcript_line"> And yes, along came her husband.</div><div id="00:03:01.720" class="transcript_line"> So he said, oh, yes.</div><div id="00:03:04.720" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ll siphon some off my car.</div><div id="00:03:07.720" class="transcript_line"> I was just so kind.</div><div id="00:03:09.720" class="transcript_line"> So yes, it did.</div><div id="00:03:11.720" class="transcript_line"> That was my first acquaintance.</div><div id="00:03:13.720" class="transcript_line"> And I felt as if I was in a different world.</div><div id="00:03:17.720" class="transcript_line"> It helped to welcome me.</div><div id="00:03:20.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, of course, they all belonged to their own extended families and who all held together and helped each other out,</div><div id="00:03:30.720" class="transcript_line"> which was something I hadn&#039;t had any real experience of ever.</div><div id="00:03:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Regarding the Welsh lessons, I ended up with the ones that were being taken up at the local primary school.</div><div id="00:03:48.720" class="transcript_line"> It was called Asgol Beca.</div><div id="00:03:51.720" class="transcript_line"> I then began to learn about the Rebecca Riots.</div><div id="00:03:55.720" class="transcript_line"> We were very near where the gate had been.</div><div id="00:03:58.720" class="transcript_line"> And I think the only mistake that the teacher made was to not get us to do some homework because my life at that time was in a turmoil within the family.</div><div id="00:04:15.720" class="transcript_line"> And well, yes, I loved the sounds of Welsh.</div><div id="00:04:24.720" class="transcript_line"> And which came a year later, I managed to get a job in Carmarthenshire as a relief district nurse midwife district nurse midwife.</div><div id="00:04:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:42.720" class="transcript_line"> And which took me into places that I&#039;d never even dreamed of.</div><div id="00:04:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And but before I started that, I made sure that I knew all the parts of the body and come right in Welsh and and so that I could say, oh, hello, Mrs.</div><div id="00:05:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Whoever.</div><div id="00:05:09.720" class="transcript_line"> How is your back today?</div><div id="00:05:12.720" class="transcript_line"> And then, yes, listen to her.</div><div id="00:05:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Everybody did speak English.</div><div id="00:05:20.720" class="transcript_line"> That was something that had surprised me a great deal.</div><div id="00:05:23.720" class="transcript_line"> But when I asked about I mean, even the older ones had learned English, somebody pointed out that that was the language of finance.</div><div id="00:05:31.720" class="transcript_line"> And of course, that rules everything, I think.</div><div id="00:05:34.720" class="transcript_line"> And to only know a few words in in Welsh, I think it helps it make me feel more at home because I would go into a shop where I knew they were well speaking.</div><div id="00:05:47.720" class="transcript_line"> And I would say, I can&#039;t remember how to say it now in Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:54.720" class="transcript_line"> And they would come back with a whole load of Welsh, which I could not make out at all.</div><div id="00:05:59.720" class="transcript_line"> As Haussmann said, the valleys and rivers and streams, a country of easy livers, the quietest under the sun.</div><div id="00:06:11.720" class="transcript_line"> The Braceles themselves, I found, had very little water on them, which surprised me.</div><div id="00:06:19.720" class="transcript_line"> .</div></div></p>
