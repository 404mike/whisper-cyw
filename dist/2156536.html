    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Now we&#039;re going to add a few things to our very interesting conversation.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> John, you mentioned the parish of Cumdeidh rather than Ryder at all.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me what your connection with Cumdeidh is?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve lived in Cumdeidh all my life and when I was on Ryder and Cumdeidh council</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> they used to make fun of me and said my world finished at Cumdeidh bridge.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But Cumdeidh is a very, very big parish with a lot more sheep than people living in it</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s supposed to be the biggest parish in Great Britain.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And, I forgot where I left it.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s much bigger than Ryder then, is it?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but Cumdeidh goes all the way up to the bridge by Clirwyn Farm</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and then on the mountain road it goes to Abergoongie, which is in Cardiganshire,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and Batalough, which is in Montgomeryshire.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So the three sort of counties meet there.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So from the top of the Batalough across to Clirwyn is all Cumdeidh.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can see why it&#039;s so big.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It is huge, in fact.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I ask John, if you went to church, would you have gone to Cumdeidh church</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> or the Nantworth church in Ellyn Valley?</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t go to either.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Bethania Baptist Chapel and I probably went there 52 Sundays a year.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Sunday school at two o&#039;clock, a service at two thirty,</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and on the third Sunday a service was at six o&#039;clock in the evening.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And where we had big thanksgivings in October, Harvest Thanksgiving,</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and my mother and father would bring people home for tea and supper, you know,</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and very often the current preacher would come.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And my parents were both very religious, so there was no getting out of it,</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> but as I became a teenager I went less and less.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what happens.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that often happens, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> If we could just perhaps say a little bit more about the shearing</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and the festivities that you had there.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I expect shearing went on into the night, did they?</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, shearing when I was a youngster, say before I was fourteen,</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> was all done by hand shears where a man would catch them,</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> put the sheep over the cove, another one would carry them in,</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and drop it on the bench in front of you,</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you would shear the belly of the sheep,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and then tie its four legs in a woolen cord and shear it, you know, until you&#039;d finished.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was another man called the carrier out.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He carried the sheep outside with his arm through the four legs</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and put it on the floor on a bed of newly cut racken.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be a bar down the middle of the racken where ewes went one side of it,</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and tups and weathers, which were male castrated sheep, put the other side, the pole,</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and then the man with the pitch spot would come along and pitch them,</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and he would mouth all the weathers, and if they had a full mouth,</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> which means they&#039;ve got all their teeth up, they had the sail weather pitch mark put on them.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the children&#039;s job was to loose these sheep go</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and hand the strings over to a man who had a pen and book,</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and he would write down, and then you would have a perfect count at the end of the day</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> of the sex and age of all the sheep.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is Friday the 23rd of September, 2022.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Jewel Willie, and I&#039;m talking with Mr John Jones at Harvard Hardware here in Reda.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> John, first of all, could we just get your date of birth, thank you.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The 2nd of February, 1948.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And where were you born and where did you go?</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in the city of Reda.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And where were you born and where did you grow up, John?</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born at Upper Lengvadug, Elm Valley, and I was brought up there,</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was there until, well, I was 20 something.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And can you tell me a little bit about the building itself,</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> how old it was and what sort of facilities you had, water, etc.?</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It belonged to the Lewis Lloyd Estate, and half of it was very old,</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> the left-hand side, as you&#039;re looking at it from the road,</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> but there was an extension built later, and there&#039;s a great big window on the right-hand side,</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and that was a shop when the dams were being built, a grocery shop.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, and your memories of growing up, your facilities, access to water, etc.?</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, I had a happy, loving home.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There was my mother, father, my grandmother, and my middle sister still living at home,</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> so I had this sort of love.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have many toys, but it was a very loving relationship with my family.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I expect there were plenty of things to do, lots of jobs to do on the farm, John.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, there was any amount of jobs.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I always liked poultry, so I used to feed the hens with my mother,</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and when I attended Ellen Village School, I always milked a cow before going in the morning.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> She was my favourite cow, and very quiet, and then when I finished her,</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d come in and have her wash and go to school.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had your routine.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely, and were your family mainly sheep farmers, John?</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, mainly sheep. We kept about ten cows,</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and we sold the calves off when they were about a fortnight old,</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> as we kept them for milk, which we delivered to the Ellen Valley Hotel in Ellen Village.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I see. Now, some of the main events that took place in the valley, for instance, the shearing,</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> can you tell us a little bit about how involved you were in that?</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the shearing was the highlight of the year, as far as I was concerned.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, all the neighbouring farmers came to help you,</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and we had always roast dinner, and all the women were very busy,</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and at lunchtime we would have a game of football, then go back to shearing in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was busy, but it was a highlight, and it was always the last Thursday in June at Llanfattig.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So you would, in this way, get to know all the farmers in the valley, would you, John,</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and shared a very good social life?</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I knew all the farmers, and they all went by their names of where they were farming,</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> not by their surname. You would have Richard the Henfran or Richard Reece Llanfattig, you know.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is how they did it in them days, out damp and coy.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I see. Right. Now, we associate the Ellen Valley with water, of course.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What sort of water supply did you have to your house?</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We had water out of the brook until I was through, well, I can&#039;t remember exactly,</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but after a few years the Louis Lloyd estate piped it in from a well,</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> which was 300 or 400 yards up the field, and it was a harder water,</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> but it never went dry until the hot summer of 1976, and it did go dry then.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to go to Kingsfield House in the van and have two churns of water, and that was nothing.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, and your family, John, were they from the Upper Llanfaddog Farm as well?</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my father was born there, and his grandfather and his great-grandmother, they were there.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> My family, on my father&#039;s side, the one side of it, came over from Cardiganshire in 1817,</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and my mother&#039;s side, she was born at the Gunfran Blanier, and she was christened in Langley Hangel,</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> a hellegan, and she moved to the clean Ellen Valley when she was four-year-old.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So... There were Joneses on both sides.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, and where did you play? You must have found lots of places to play as a young lad in your farming...</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, there was plenty of places to play on a farm. You could hide behind the trees,</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> but a lot of our time was spent down the brook, joining the river where we was catching minnows and that</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> until I was old enough to fish with a rod and line.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Excuse me. Is it still up?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s still going.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only about down.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all right. If you want a break, you can have one.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m all right.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine. Right, so, did you get around a lot by horseback, John, or did you use a bike?</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, both, but mainly horseback. But we used a bike. My sister Joan delivered milk round the Ellen Village,</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was a churn of milk carried on the handlebars of the bike with a pint measure.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you got into a house, you measured a pint out and poured it in the jug.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different now, but later on we had bottles and delivered them when we had a van.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we had a van until I was about 13.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine. What about sporting events, John? Did you take part in sporting events at the Ellen Valley?</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. We had a sports in the Ellen Valley every year up to 1916.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a sports in the Ellen Valley every year up to 1964, I think it was.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s on the fields, which I own now.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always run there every year and rode a bike in the bicycle race.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think I ever raced a horse there, although there was race horses,</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because our two horses were more flodders than race horses.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine. How often did you actually go to market then, being farmers?</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The market would be in Ryder, I suppose?</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well, my father occasionally sold a cow or cow and calf in Ryder during the year,</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> but the main market sales was now in the autumn, the sale use.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And we always used to drive them down to Ryder with the dogs, and we never lost the sheep.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we got them to the market. We tied the dogs to the rails, and they were there all day with us.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Except one year the trade was bad and we decided to take the sheep home.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> A car pulled up and said, you can manage the sheep, John, I&#039;ll give your father a lift home.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He left his dog with me, and as soon as he got in the car, the dog ran back to Ryder,</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and unfortunately he got killed.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And my sister Joan went to look for him and she came back with a dead dog.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And even worse, the next day the sheep were no better, and we sold them then.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a waste of time bringing them home.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> An unfortunate incident, but they stick in your mind, don&#039;t they, John?</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, let&#039;s talk a little bit about school now. Can you tell me where you went to school when you started?</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I went to school in the Ellen Village School, which was run by Birmingham then.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I lived on the Radnorshire side, the river, I went to the school which is in Brackenshire.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to walk there every day, and once a year I had to pay a penny to cross the footbridge to go in the Ellen Village,</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> because the footbridge was privately built, I think, by the Thomases, Lawland, Vadug when they owned the Ellen Valley Hotel.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was there for people from Ellen Village to walk down to the Valley Hotel.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a private bridge, and I paid a penny once a year to cross it.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And how long were you at that school, John?</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I started there in Eastern 1953, and I was there until the summer of 1959.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I really enjoyed myself there. We had a lot of fun.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And coming home from school, there was a brook in the middle of the Ellen Village, and we had empty polished tins.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And us boys used to put these tins in at the top, and a race would get to the bottom first, you know.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my parents would be saying, why are you so late coming home? But I never told them what we were doing.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly lots of things to entertain yourself with.</div><div id="00:14:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, am I right in thinking that where you went is now the current Ellen Valley Lodge?</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that is correct.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But the school prior to that was somewhere else, John. Can you tell us a little bit about that?</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was a school immediately above the lodge. There&#039;s a flat in the ground there between there and Stone House.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That was built for the Navvy children when the old village was there.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And before that, there was a school halfway up the cabin, not far from the old Lankwill Church,</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> where my grandmother, Alice Ann Ably, taught English, no Welsh. And they come there about 1891.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And the purpose of speaking and teaching English was to accommodate all the Navvy children coming into the area, was that correct?</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That is correct. You know, up to then, it had been all Welsh.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me a little bit about the 11+, John. I understand you were one of the few children that went to that school from the Radnorshire area.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> How did that affect you?</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was only two of us of my age who was leaving that year.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The other boy didn&#039;t try the 11+, so he went straight to Brintyrian Secondary.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I tried the 11+, and luckily enough, I don&#039;t know what it is, I managed to scrape in.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I had a place in Landerindard Grammar School.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I found it hard. I&#039;d gone from 15 pupils to about 500. It was a big change in my life.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t know anybody, only my one nephew, because I didn&#039;t mix with Radar children.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They had their own school, and life was hard on the bus.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of the older pupils give us a hard time. Every time they walk by us first-formers, they hit us across the head with their daps.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Unpleasant memories, but there we are.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So am I right in thinking then that the business about the 11+, was simply because Radnorshire and Brackenshire had their own rules</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> regarding the 11+, and when or if you took it?</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that was right. The children on the Brackenshire side, the river, all went to Belf High School.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have to try it. And they were graded there when they got there.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But us Radnorshires side had to try it, but there wasn&#039;t many from the Radnorshires side.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And am I right in thinking again that it&#039;s the Ellyn River itself that formed the county boundary?</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was. And I mean, I only lived about 200 yards from the river, but I was classed at Radnorshire.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I spent most of my time in Brackenshire, but that didn&#039;t count.</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Now you spoke about your relatives who came to teach at the former school.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s talk a little bit about Welsh, Welsh in your own background.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> How much of many of your family do you remember using Welsh as a day-to-day language?</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t hear my mother ever talk in Welsh, but my father wasn&#039;t brilliant at it, but he could speak Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But then his father and his grandparents were fluent Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose like mother speak in English and my father speak in Welsh, it was predominantly English.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But I picked up a lot of Welsh. And when I went to Llandrind at grandma&#039;s school, I had a choice between French and Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I chose Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, you wanted to keep it going. Right.</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose your former ancestors would have been all Welsh speaking from the farms in the Llandrind?</div><div id="00:18:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were. My mother&#039;s family, a lot of them come over from Abergwesh. They couldn&#039;t speak any English.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father&#039;s side were all Welsh, you know. My great-grandmother was from a Sputty Estrid.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think they could hardly speak English until Alice Ann Ably married my grandfather.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the English came into our family.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I see. What about the changes that you yourself have seen in the Valley, John, through your lifetime?</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you enlarge on that?</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s been many changes and not all for the better.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Like Birmingham, you can say what you like about them. They were very good landlords.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very good to the farmers and they supplied them with poles and gates and hurdles to keep the farms up.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they kept the rents very low.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But when it went to Welsh Water, everything changed. You weren&#039;t given anything and the rents spiralled.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is one of the things.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Valley has changed completely.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in the old days you could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garry Dee up the old railway line.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And there wasn&#039;t a bush growing.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now it&#039;s like a jungle because they fenced it off and there&#039;s no stock nibbling at the new plants which come up.</div><div id="00:20:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s so much busier now since the centre opened.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just one line of cars going up all the time.</div><div id="00:20:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not the only one that thinks it, but the Valley was much better in the old days.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, memories for you John.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the Ellen Valley area is part of the bigger parish of Cwmdyda.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us a little bit about Cwmdyda and its extremities?</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Cwmdyda is a very big parish.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It starts on the Y there, the boundary between Raider and Cwmdyda.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the Ellen Valley, all the way up to Clirwyn Farm is Cwmdyda.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And it comes back across the top to where we joined Cardiganshire.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And although Abergungie is in Cardiganshire, the Talug was in Montgomeryshire, the rest is all...</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it goes up the Durnall Valley quite a long way.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So that is why it&#039;s the biggest parish in Great Britain.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And probably not a lot of people are aware of that then.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s in fact the biggest.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you a churchgoer or a chapelgoer John?</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I was a chapelgoer, Bethania Baptist Chapel.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father was a deacon and a trustee.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to go 52 Sundays a year.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Sunday school at 2 o&#039;clock, service at 2.30.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the third Sunday, 6 p.m.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> On a Sunday night.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went there till I was a late teenager and then quietly drifted away.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But my parents were both very religious.</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bethania Chapel, John.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Has there always been a chapel in that area or was that...?</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The old Bethania Chapel was immediately under Garrick D. Bridge.</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was one of the first jobs they did.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Build a new chapel on part of Upper Llanfadu ground on the field there.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> As they could bring the bodies down and transfer them.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you ever go in the graveyard in Bethania,</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> a lot of the headstones are sloping and falling.</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father said it was because the coffins, the decayed ones,</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> were put in big oak boxes, much bigger than the coffins.</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And when they&#039;ve rotted, the ground just fell in.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think Bethania held its first service in 1895.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was almost ten years before the dams were opened.</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I see. Most interesting.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a record at home of the first money paid in in 1895.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The collection.</div><div id="00:23:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Very interesting.</div><div id="00:23:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So many memories.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Can we go now from the chapel to pony trekking, John?</div><div id="00:23:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand you were very involved with that in your younger days.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was one of the committee members of the Raider Pony Trekking Association.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did a lot of work for it.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always had two or three horses in the association.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we rented them out and we got paid at the end of the week so much a horse.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is where I met my first wife, Gina Day.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She was a trekker and eventually we married.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I left Llanfaduk, I became chief guide for two years.</div><div id="00:24:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it was much different then because we&#039;d become nearly all day trekkers.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Before that, the girls would come for a week and they could ride.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you had day trekkers.</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of them were novices.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Some had to be led.</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And the only ones I found who were good riders were people who arrived on a motorbike.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I see. They probably had using similar muscles, I suppose.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Indeed.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And where was the actual centre?</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Where was the pony trekking based in those days?</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> John, did it have a base?</div><div id="00:24:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Down Water Lane, at the bottom, there&#039;s a building there now belonging to Michael Lloyd.</div><div id="00:25:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that and a yard.</div><div id="00:25:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the horses were grazed on the wagglo, amongst other places.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There were fields around town they were taken to when we had too many.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the real base.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a very handy place because that&#039;s where the blacksmith came to shoe the horses.</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> In the yard there.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, inside the building.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I&#039;ve got many happy memories of Water Lane.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And you could ride the horses across the ford and come out by the triangle.</div><div id="00:25:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So really it was based over the other side of the river then, in Red?</div><div id="00:25:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The wagglo of Water Lane.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> That was amazing.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had some down here where Simon Price&#039;s yard is now.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We had ground there.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in South Street, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Where the old tannery was.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that there was some down here by the old mill house that belonged to Percy Curtis.</div><div id="00:26:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main place was down Water Lane.</div><div id="00:26:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And you rode the horses up Water Lane and most days you turned left for the valley.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes they went right and they were going to the Sun Inn and, you know,</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> that would be coming away.</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And is the industry as big today or has it changed a lot?</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s changed a lot now.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, people can go abroad for a lot less money than you spend on a week&#039;s trekking.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different.</div><div id="00:26:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And the only trekking which is going now is the Lion Royal.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, they&#039;re not busy like we were.</div><div id="00:26:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They might be ten or a dozen now.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, I&#039;ve seen a hundred horses out with the association in a day,</div><div id="00:26:56.000" class="transcript_line"> which is a lot of horses.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Sad, the demise of such an industry like that, because it really was an industry.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Coontide-Rams and Cornhill and them, they were full every week in the summer from May till September.</div><div id="00:27:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And well, they&#039;re not pubs anymore now, are they?</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And everything&#039;s changed.</div><div id="00:27:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything has changed.</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And the two former pubs you&#039;ve mentioned, they&#039;re the ones, am I right, in West Street?</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> As you go towards the...</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And the funny part about it, not many valley people drunk in the Triangle,</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> only the ones who live close to it.</div><div id="00:27:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The valley farmers always drank in Coontide-Rams.</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was their center.</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, I was in there when I was 14, 15 long before I should have.</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But you could...</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Mother used to come down on the bus on a Wednesday and do some shopping.</div><div id="00:28:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And if a bag was getting heavy, the one bag, she would just leave it inside the door at Coontide-Rams.</div><div id="00:28:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the powwls would let you pick it up later.</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, it was home from home.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you say there&#039;s any pubs like that in the area now, John, where...</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no.</div><div id="00:28:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The powwls have been here for generations, you know, and they knew every farmer.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And now the pubs, every three or five years, change hands.</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re not run by locals anymore.</div><div id="00:28:39.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of changes.</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> John, can we just briefly get on to this fascinating family tree that you and your son Tom have been working on?</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand you&#039;ve gone back many, many generations, tracing your ancestry back to the Lewis Lloyds.</div><div id="00:28:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, even before that, the powwls, when they married into the Lewis Lloyds, they were at Lanarkow.</div><div id="00:29:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And Lanarkow was the first place where the Baptist chapel started.</div><div id="00:29:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Before, they went down to Gary Dee and then came down to Bethania.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The one at Gary Dee was called Bethany Ellen Vale.</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, we&#039;ve gone back.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Tom has gone back about 700 years in our family.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I know we&#039;ve been helped by being related to the Lewis Lloyds because they had a lot of records of their own which are up in Abba, you know.</div><div id="00:29:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m proud, you know, we can go back so far that our family have been associated with Ellen Vale.</div><div id="00:29:45.000" class="transcript_line"> A wonderful connection. Wonderful, wonderful heritage.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned Lanarkow.
