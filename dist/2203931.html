    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> For our alibi, recording Mr Preet Munaram on the 7th of March 2024.</div><div id="00:00:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Hi Preet, tell me about your father&#039;s life in Mauritius.</div><div id="00:00:15.920" class="transcript_line"> Right, my father was the eldest of seven children and he lived in a place called Cupid in Mauritius.</div><div id="00:00:25.360" class="transcript_line"> He was born on the 7th of May 1932. He was a very hard working young man and tried his hand at</div><div id="00:00:35.040" class="transcript_line"> everything. Sport, education, he had an extreme thirst for knowledge. Books, surrounded himself</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> with books and being the eldest of a family where their father had died when they were quite young,</div><div id="00:00:54.240" class="transcript_line"> he became the breadwinner. He spent very little of his childhood in his mother&#039;s house. He was</div><div id="00:01:01.120" class="transcript_line"> living with his uncle who lived 13 miles away from the family home. So my dad had a 13 mile cycle trip</div><div id="00:01:10.800" class="transcript_line"> to school every day. He won what was called an open scholarship to attend the Royal College in Cupid,</div><div id="00:01:19.440" class="transcript_line"> which was a fee-paying school but he won an open scholarship. He came from quite a poor background</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> as you can imagine but he was the highest scoring pupil on the whole of the island.</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> So he won this scholarship to go to the school. Whilst he was a pupil there, he was very</div><div id="00:01:38.480" class="transcript_line"> entrepreneurial and started giving private lessons to boys and girls who quite didn&#039;t reach the</div><div id="00:01:45.840" class="transcript_line"> expectation that they were supposed to but had a bit of money.</div><div id="00:01:49.680" class="transcript_line"> And he helped fund the education of his siblings. He was quite strict with his siblings and insisted</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> that they, boys and girls, both insisted that both of them complete school to at least A level.</div><div id="00:02:05.280" class="transcript_line"> And testimony to that is that the four brothers all embarked on different professions, accountant,</div><div id="00:02:14.400" class="transcript_line"> headmaster of a school, surgeon and my dad doing what he did. The girls became school teachers</div><div id="00:02:23.120" class="transcript_line"> and headmistresses of various schools, which was quite rare really in the 50s and early 60s.</div><div id="00:02:31.840" class="transcript_line"> After finishing school at the age of 18, my dad decided to work for a while because he had to</div><div id="00:02:39.040" class="transcript_line"> raise money to come to Britain and to take a degree. He&#039;d applied to study medicine in</div><div id="00:02:45.360" class="transcript_line"> St Andrews in Edinburgh and his plan was that it would take him about 10 years to raise sufficient</div><div id="00:02:52.800" class="transcript_line"> funds to fund his course and fund his time in Britain. In the meantime of course he met my</div><div id="00:03:00.240" class="transcript_line"> mother and life takes on a different course. They got married. My mum came from quite a very</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> quite a wealthy background and it was a match made in heaven actually because</div><div id="00:03:18.560" class="transcript_line"> they would both be sotted with each other from the moment they met. It was a love marriage,</div><div id="00:03:23.040" class="transcript_line"> not arranged, you know, contrary to the normal Asian expectation of life. And they were happily</div><div id="00:03:33.040" class="transcript_line"> married until his death in 1990, sorry 2001. My father continued to work then in Mauritius. He</div><div id="00:03:43.440" class="transcript_line"> taught in a Church of England school called St Andrews where he taught sciences and English</div><div id="00:03:50.720" class="transcript_line"> and French to write up to Cambridge certificate A level. And funny enough some of the pupils in</div><div id="00:03:58.480" class="transcript_line"> there were his siblings in that school and various other family members who all remember him with</div><div id="00:04:05.600" class="transcript_line"> affection. He was very keen on school sports days, extracurricular activities like boy scouts. My mum</div><div id="00:04:15.520" class="transcript_line"> was involved with the guides and he raised the expectations of the children he came across to</div><div id="00:04:25.040" class="transcript_line"> expect be the best they could. And years later you meet people who&#039;ve said that&#039;s what he did for us.</div><div id="00:04:33.280" class="transcript_line"> He was passionate about teaching, absolutely passionate about it. Then he was due to come to</div><div id="00:04:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Britain in 1957. Unfortunately the island was hit by a cyclone and as you can see from this</div><div id="00:04:50.160" class="transcript_line"> photograph here our house was demolished by cyclone Carroll. That&#039;s my dad standing amongst</div><div id="00:04:57.040" class="transcript_line"> the ruins and he spent the next five years earning enough money to rebuild the house,</div><div id="00:05:05.360" class="transcript_line"> in which time my brother and myself were born. So that changed plans completely. His chances of</div><div id="00:05:12.880" class="transcript_line"> doing medicine as he saw it had gone out of the window because in those days it took seven years</div><div id="00:05:18.080" class="transcript_line"> and that was just far too long. By the time he was coming to Britain he was 30 years of age and</div><div id="00:05:24.400" class="transcript_line"> he decided seven years in higher education wouldn&#039;t be feasible. So he supported his younger brother</div><div id="00:05:32.240" class="transcript_line"> who went to Trinity in Dublin to study medicine and my dad followed a few years later and went</div><div id="00:05:39.440" class="transcript_line"> to Cardiff University. However before going there my mother and myself were sent over</div><div id="00:05:48.560" class="transcript_line"> with my elder brother to Britain to acclimatise to the weather over here. My dad decided that we</div><div id="00:05:55.840" class="transcript_line"> should come over in June of 1962 as it was still the British summer and he would follow at the end</div><div id="00:06:03.680" class="transcript_line"> of the term time in Mauritius and come over to start his degree in the September of that year.</div><div id="00:06:11.600" class="transcript_line"> My mother, my brother, myself and a girl called Geeta came over to Britain together, my mum in</div><div id="00:06:19.680" class="transcript_line"> charge of all of us and we arrived at London Airport Heathrow, fresh off the boat as they say,</div><div id="00:06:27.920" class="transcript_line"> and we took a coach to Victoria coach station where we were met by my mother&#039;s sister who had</div><div id="00:06:36.240" class="transcript_line"> been in Britain since 1951 and she had arranged a flat for us in Bayswater and she put us into a</div><div id="00:06:47.680" class="transcript_line"> taxi and my mum met with the landlady and the landlady told my mother what the rent would be.</div><div id="00:06:54.800" class="transcript_line"> My mum worked out that this would wipe out her whole year&#039;s allowance in about a month</div><div id="00:07:02.320" class="transcript_line"> and promptly jumped back into the taxi and we ended up back at Victoria station.</div><div id="00:07:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Fortunately for us there were some former scouts of my dad who&#039;d also arrived and they helped us</div><div id="00:07:16.560" class="transcript_line"> find some temporary accommodation in Victoria in London. Shortly after that my mum found a more</div><div id="00:07:23.840" class="transcript_line"> permanent house in Norwood Junction and we had a one-bedroomed flat. There was my mum, my brother,</div><div id="00:07:35.600" class="transcript_line"> myself and Geeta and we shared this flat for the whole of the summer of 1962 until my mum</div><div id="00:07:42.640" class="transcript_line"> arranged the wedding of Geeta with her then-husband, still of today,</div><div id="00:07:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Dale Maddew and they still very happily live in London to this day and my mum organized the wedding</div><div id="00:07:57.440" class="transcript_line"> literally a few months after arriving in Britain. Then our life in Britain began. 1962 my father</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> arrived in London, he moved to Cardiff to find us accommodation, he found us a flat in Richmond</div><div id="00:08:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Crescent and we all moved to Cardiff. My dad attended Cardiff University and I went to a little</div><div id="00:08:24.560" class="transcript_line"> nursery school in Richmond Road called Nurseryland. My brother went to Albany Infant School, Albany</div><div id="00:08:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Junior School and my cousin who was with us went to Rother Park and my dad attended university for</div><div id="00:08:38.800" class="transcript_line"> the year 1962 to 63 and as events happened my mum became pregnant with my youngest brother,</div><div id="00:08:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Vin and that changed everything because my dad decided that funding would be an issue because</div><div id="00:08:52.720" class="transcript_line"> he was self-funding. So he decided to take a break from university for the academic year 1963 to 64</div><div id="00:09:04.080" class="transcript_line"> and he got the job in Hlan Wyrn in the steelworks programming computers which were very much the new</div><div id="00:09:11.600" class="transcript_line"> thing and because he was a mathematician it was second nature to him. He traveled from Cardiff to</div><div id="00:09:17.200" class="transcript_line"> Hlan Wyrn every day to do this job and in the evenings he would run the adult education department</div><div id="00:09:27.360" class="transcript_line"> at Grangetown Adult Education Centre teaching English to overseas people and he did that for</div><div id="00:09:36.800" class="transcript_line"> his entire time that he was doing his degree from 1963 to 1966. He completed it after the year of</div><div id="00:09:46.720" class="transcript_line"> Unininefmany in Hlan Wyrn, he came back to his studies in Cardiff University and finally graduated</div><div id="00:09:52.640" class="transcript_line"> in 1966. After graduation he couldn&#039;t get a job in education and he was working as a labourer</div><div id="00:10:06.240" class="transcript_line"> for Cardiff Corporation cutting grass and it wasn&#039;t until the former leader of the Labour Council,</div><div id="00:10:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Jack Sloan saw him cutting the grass of the mansion house and said, Rav what are you doing?</div><div id="00:10:24.880" class="transcript_line"> And my father said I&#039;m earning money to feed my family and look after them and Jack Sloan actually</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> said well we&#039;ve a teacher shortage in Cardiff, this is ridiculous. Next thing my father gets a</div><div id="00:10:40.240" class="transcript_line"> letter from the education department and he&#039;s offered a job teaching French in Sintwale High</div><div id="00:10:49.360" class="transcript_line"> School in Ely and Sintwale was a secondary modern school, quite a tough school, quite a tough area</div><div id="00:10:56.720" class="transcript_line"> but like everything he did he did it with relish and total enthusiasm and from 1967 to 1960 end of</div><div id="00:11:06.880" class="transcript_line"> 1969 he taught the boys French and anything else they needed assistance with and at the end of it</div><div id="00:11:15.040" class="transcript_line"> you know some in fact 30 40 years later I met some of the pupils by pure accident from the school</div><div id="00:11:22.960" class="transcript_line"> who commented that he was one of the few teachers who taught them who treated them with any respect</div><div id="00:11:30.160" class="transcript_line"> and dignity and typical Asian he turned up every day to this school smartly dressed in a suit</div><div id="00:11:39.280" class="transcript_line"> and showed the boys they could be better than their expectations that they were led to believe by</div><div id="00:11:46.960" class="transcript_line"> their expectations they were more than limitations put upon them. Day one of the school my dad went</div><div id="00:11:53.760" class="transcript_line"> along in his suit and briefcase always had the briefcase and he came home from from work that</div><div id="00:12:02.480" class="transcript_line"> day and he had a huge black eye and we just thought what an earth has happened you&#039;ve been in a fight</div><div id="00:12:10.080" class="transcript_line"> someone of the boys didn&#039;t like took took a dislike to you and he said no I was playing football with</div><div id="00:12:15.600" class="transcript_line"> the boys in the yard and we went up to head a ball and someone&#039;s head caught me and from that day on</div><div id="00:12:22.320" class="transcript_line"> I think the boys took to him they absolutely took to him I remember going on a school trip with them</div><div id="00:12:28.880" class="transcript_line"> I was in junior school and we&#039;d had a and my dad had organized a school trip for these boys they&#039;d</div><div id="00:12:35.040" class="transcript_line"> never been anywhere and he&#039;d organized because no one had trusted them to leave the city and he took</div><div id="00:12:40.640" class="transcript_line"> them to Bristol Zoo he and another teacher called John Davis and another good friend of his from</div><div id="00:12:46.480" class="transcript_line"> the school Len Williams who was the woodwork teacher John Davis was the music teacher and this</div><div id="00:12:52.720" class="transcript_line"> coach was full of boys and we turned I turned up at the school with my dad just before half past</div><div id="00:12:59.360" class="transcript_line"> eight in the morning and the school is full of you know 14 15 year old boys running around I was in</div><div id="00:13:05.360" class="transcript_line"> junior school infant school and my dad shouted out to this one boy said Churchill this is my son take</div><div id="00:13:12.800" class="transcript_line"> care of him and that&#039;s the last I saw of my dad until the coach came back from Bristol Zoo I spent</div><div id="00:13:18.560" class="transcript_line"> the whole of the day with these boys at the back of the coach for the whole of the trip and it was</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> absolutely amazing a good day out with some really special people and I won&#039;t mention what happened</div><div id="00:13:33.360" class="transcript_line"> in the gift shop though can you tell us a little bit about the reception of your father at the</div><div id="00:13:41.200" class="transcript_line"> school in Ely when he initially arrived because that was back in the days in what 1960 1969 yeah</div><div id="00:13:48.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah um initially some of the parents weren&#039;t happy with being taught having their children taught by</div><div id="00:13:56.160" class="transcript_line"> an Asian man and there was a period where um he was received or we were receiving obscene phone</div><div id="00:14:05.280" class="transcript_line"> calls on on the home telephone because all your telephone numbers were published in a phone directory</div><div id="00:14:10.640" class="transcript_line"> in those days do you know what that is a phone directory yeah um and he um people used to phone</div><div id="00:14:17.680" class="transcript_line"> us the police actually put a trace and they went on for quite a while and the police put a trace on</div><div id="00:14:22.640" class="transcript_line"> the line and they identified where the call was coming from and typical of my dad he didn&#039;t want</div><div id="00:14:29.440" class="transcript_line"> to press charges he just went to go and pay the parents a visit and ask them why they were doing</div><div id="00:14:34.560" class="transcript_line"> it and turn them around really just meeting them having a chat with them and it just stopped from</div><div id="00:14:41.520" class="transcript_line"> then on and so I&#039;m sensing that he was meant met initially with some um racism and resentment</div><div id="00:14:50.720" class="transcript_line"> well I think that featured right throughout his life to be quite honest in Britain right throughout</div><div id="00:14:56.400" class="transcript_line"> his life um but it was never used as a badge for him he never used it as a reason not to be able</div><div id="00:15:05.120" class="transcript_line"> to do anything in fact he raised himself above it and everything he did he he he didn&#039;t allow</div><div id="00:15:13.040" class="transcript_line"> himself to become restrained by anything colour or being told you can&#039;t do this funding he he just</div><div id="00:15:21.680" class="transcript_line"> was bigger than than than his job</div><div id="00:15:27.520" class="transcript_line"> so racism wasn&#039;t really it was there it was you know it&#039;d be stupid not to say it wasn&#039;t there</div><div id="00:15:34.480" class="transcript_line"> but um he never let it become a limiting factor on his life</div><div id="00:15:39.040" class="transcript_line"> life</div><div id="00:15:44.080" class="transcript_line"> yeah so moving on now to um teaching um at in a league he was also at the same time in</div><div id="00:15:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Grange Townstall yes he was teaching adult education in the great and I have letters of</div><div id="00:16:01.040" class="transcript_line"> testimony from the warden of the centre who absolutely sends a glowing reference of him</div><div id="00:16:07.920" class="transcript_line"> um saying that um you know this man should be doing more than he is you know he shouldn&#039;t be</div><div id="00:16:15.120" class="transcript_line"> limited by the type of posts he was being offered or not offered as the case may be</div><div id="00:16:21.920" class="transcript_line"> after Ely the job in Fitzallan came up and that basically was uh in those days this was 1969</div><div id="00:16:32.240" class="transcript_line"> um there had been um a lot of children coming in from former British colonies</div><div id="00:16:39.760" class="transcript_line"> from the Indian subcontinent whose it who for whom English was a second language and for whom</div><div id="00:16:49.520" class="transcript_line"> a lot of the parents didn&#039;t speak English in the home so what South Glamorgan education department</div><div id="00:16:56.480" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff education department decided to do was to house them in one building in Fitzallan high</div><div id="00:17:02.640" class="transcript_line"> school which they very nicely called the immigrant block and it was a three or four story building</div><div id="00:17:10.240" class="transcript_line"> where all the kids from non-English speaking backgrounds were put and before my dad arrived</div><div id="00:17:18.400" class="transcript_line"> they were being treated as educationally so normal they were treated they were banded as</div><div id="00:17:23.360" class="transcript_line"> ESN and a lot of their day would be spent litter picking around the yard because no one knew what</div><div id="00:17:29.120" class="transcript_line"> to do with them and they were not part of mainstream school and they didn&#039;t have school</div><div id="00:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> uniforms you know they weren&#039;t told to wear school uniforms you know they they didn&#039;t know what the</div><div id="00:17:41.760" class="transcript_line"> arrangements were in the school no one from the school actually directed them on that front</div><div id="00:17:46.080" class="transcript_line"> and so on my dad&#039;s first day there realizing that there may be cultural issues with teaching</div><div id="00:17:53.600" class="transcript_line"> some of the girls in school took my mum along with him and they had a conversation luckily</div><div id="00:18:00.400" class="transcript_line"> my mum speaks Urdu my dad speaks Hindi and they could communicate in some of the South</div><div id="00:18:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Asian languages South Indian languages and they were able to get across to the kids that um</div><div id="00:18:14.240" class="transcript_line"> to be part of this school we need to be look like the pupils in this school so we need to dress</div><div id="00:18:21.040" class="transcript_line"> in the same way and from then on um he called the parents in as well and actually got them on board</div><div id="00:18:30.560" class="transcript_line"> with um having school uniforms for their kids so they felt part of the school and it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:18:37.600" class="transcript_line"> uncommon for him because it was very they had very few teachers in the so-called immigrant block and</div><div id="00:18:43.440" class="transcript_line"> he came along um and i remember sitting on um occasional days when my dad had to look after</div><div id="00:18:51.360" class="transcript_line"> my younger brother and myself he&#039;d take us into school with him so our occasional days off were</div><div id="00:18:56.080" class="transcript_line"> not spent at the park we&#039;d go back to school and have the school so we&#039;d be in this classroom and</div><div id="00:19:02.720" class="transcript_line"> on the way in my dad would always stop off at one of the shops in Grangetown and buy several bottles</div><div id="00:19:09.680" class="transcript_line"> of large bottles of pop and biscuits and crisps then we&#039;d go into a classroom and there would be</div><div id="00:19:17.280" class="transcript_line"> something like 120 kids in one classroom of all ages ranging from 11 to almost 17 and he would</div><div id="00:19:27.600" class="transcript_line"> have them eating out of them all speaking different languages he would have them eating out of his hand</div><div id="00:19:34.880" class="transcript_line"> by the end of a sort of short session and it was just amazing you know he&#039;d be teaching them the</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> same thing because they all had to learn English they all had to get on board with this and um</div><div id="00:19:48.720" class="transcript_line"> the pop and the crisps and the biscuits were for them you know in their break time and um</div><div id="00:19:55.920" class="transcript_line"> he also thought it was important to get to the parents because he realized that he was</div><div id="00:20:02.320" class="transcript_line"> trying to teach the kids English in school they were going home and speaking in mother town</div><div id="00:20:07.440" class="transcript_line"> and the parents weren&#039;t able to communicate in English to the children so I think that&#039;s where</div><div id="00:20:13.440" class="transcript_line"> the idea of the pavilion or the parade came along teaching English as a second he&#039;d always been</div><div id="00:20:21.280" class="transcript_line"> involved in teaching English as a second language to overseas people and he decided to contact some</div><div id="00:20:29.680" class="transcript_line"> of the parents he would go to their homes he would take my mother along and encourage them</div><div id="00:20:35.600" class="transcript_line"> to come to classes and I as a young boy of 11 12 years old I remember doing leaflet drops around</div><div id="00:20:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Grangetown and Bute town to various houses in Riverside of these English classes that</div><div id="00:20:51.520" class="transcript_line"> been run by this man Ravi Muniram in Seven Road adult community centre</div><div id="00:20:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Seven Road was a school in in Grangetown and he would run these classes every evening and</div><div id="00:21:09.200" class="transcript_line"> this was on top of the day job by the way he would run these classes and then increase the</div><div id="00:21:15.680" class="transcript_line"> staff you would get various people involved various people who studied English teaching</div><div id="00:21:22.320" class="transcript_line"> of English as a second language and things grew from there really the opportunity to take up the</div><div id="00:21:32.480" class="transcript_line"> tenure of the parade came up when Cardiff High School the girls abandoned the school in 1971</div><div id="00:21:39.600" class="transcript_line"> because they amalgamated with the boys school in T. Kelly so there was a lovely old Victorian</div><div id="00:21:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Victorian building empty on the parade literally 1971 summer 1971 and I remember receiving a phone</div><div id="00:21:57.120" class="transcript_line"> call from my dad on the landline and he said I was 13 at the time and he said you&#039;ve got a toolbox</div><div id="00:22:06.960" class="transcript_line"> have you and I said yes he said bring it over I&#039;ve just taken over a building on the parade</div><div id="00:22:12.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the old Cardiff High School for girls so I went around to number 28 which was the old</div><div id="00:22:19.840" class="transcript_line"> main building of the school I walked in and literally the school had shut in at the end of</div><div id="00:22:26.880" class="transcript_line"> term in July 71 and the bins were still full of the rubbish because no one was coming back</div><div id="00:22:33.840" class="transcript_line"> so our first job was to empty the bins and clean the floors etc etc he had a caretaker there who</div><div id="00:22:42.160" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t very receptive to working for my dad and who lived in the top floor of number 28 he had an</div><div id="00:22:49.680" class="transcript_line"> apartment in number 28 parade and he was not very cooperative with opening doors for functions that</div><div id="00:22:58.960" class="transcript_line"> went on there for cleaning the building for organizing cleaners cleaning stuff to come in</div><div id="00:23:03.920" class="transcript_line"> because he didn&#039;t like the idea of working for my dad so my dad quite often would be seen with a</div><div id="00:23:09.520" class="transcript_line"> brush after spending a full day teaching and a full day doing adult work sweeping the floor in</div><div id="00:23:15.920" class="transcript_line"> the parade to clean the building after it had been used and I you know I&#039;ve helped him do it on occasion</div><div id="00:23:24.160" class="transcript_line"> um but on a positive note um the parade became an amazing building where at the end of his 22-23</div><div id="00:23:36.480" class="transcript_line"> years of running the place and developing it it became a hub for some 4 000 people a week</div><div id="00:23:44.320" class="transcript_line"> using it and it was people from all backgrounds all communities in life</div><div id="00:23:50.720" class="transcript_line"> you know which I can go into detail if you wish um use that building please do give us some detail</div><div id="00:23:57.840" class="transcript_line"> well let me pick up a photograph and have a look at this</div><div id="00:24:07.280" class="transcript_line"> this these are pictures of the summer schools that used to go on in the parade every</div><div id="00:24:14.960" class="transcript_line"> June July and August when school term finished my dad would run summer schools in the parade for</div><div id="00:24:22.720" class="transcript_line"> those kids who were struggling in various subjects in school kids from all backgrounds all communities</div><div id="00:24:30.320" class="transcript_line"> would attend this school and he did this for as long as I can remember not only that he would</div><div id="00:24:38.320" class="transcript_line"> also organize I think this picture here is actually of an exchange group um he would have</div><div id="00:24:44.400" class="transcript_line"> the exchange groups from Nantes and Stuttgart our twin cities coming over and staying for a month</div><div id="00:24:51.200" class="transcript_line"> in Britain being hosted out by various families and we on occasion hosted some of these kids who</div><div id="00:24:57.040" class="transcript_line"> would come over and they were pre-university you know they were a 17 18 year olds who were basically</div><div id="00:25:02.960" class="transcript_line"> on a holiday here but would have to spend morning of the weekday learning English as a set because</div><div id="00:25:09.840" class="transcript_line"> prior to going to their universities in Stuttgart or Germany or France you know and uh so over the</div><div id="00:25:17.520" class="transcript_line"> years um he became like a foster parent to these groups of 70 80 kids for the whole summer um I</div><div id="00:25:26.480" class="transcript_line"> tell you a story of um one night where these uh a group of German guys and girls got stuck in</div><div id="00:25:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Barry and this was pre-mobile phones so believe me it was prehistoric and we get a phone call on</div><div id="00:25:42.160" class="transcript_line"> the landline uh we&#039;re in the Barry police station I thought oh no what&#039;s going on they didn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:25:50.800" class="transcript_line"> any money and they couldn&#039;t get home so I remember ferrying these kids home I did about five trips in</div><div id="00:25:58.480" class="transcript_line"> the car to ferry them home to their various homes in around Cardiff that night and the one thing I</div><div id="00:26:06.160" class="transcript_line"> remember is I kept on asking them the time because I was frustrated and a few days later they turned</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> up at the house with a present of a watch for me but there we are that&#039;s another story but um</div><div id="00:26:18.960" class="transcript_line"> yeah these these photographs here they&#039;re of which there are numerous spanning various eras</div><div id="00:26:25.680" class="transcript_line"> you know we have pictures of young Vietnamese children from the first waves of immigration into</div><div id="00:26:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Britain of the so-called Vietnamese boat people and the reception that they received in the parade</div><div id="00:26:38.480" class="transcript_line"> my dad worked with the Welsh Refugee Council to make sure that people were being treated properly</div><div id="00:26:44.640" class="transcript_line"> the community the Community Relations Council the Criminal Justice Board these were just a few</div><div id="00:26:52.400" class="transcript_line"> of the things that he did that were extracurricular um so he organized he not only hosted the kids over</div><div id="00:27:03.200" class="transcript_line"> here but he took groups of uh children from this area 18 17 18 year olds over to Stuttgart and</div><div id="00:27:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Nantes in exchange and my mum would always accompany him with that so they became like these</div><div id="00:27:19.360" class="transcript_line"> children surrogate parents on these trips and my mum quite often would come home from these trips</div><div id="00:27:25.360" class="transcript_line"> and say you know on two nights I had groups of girls in my bedroom talking about they&#039;d fallen</div><div id="00:27:31.920" class="transcript_line"> in love with someone some French guy on the trip how were they ever going to come back to Cardiff</div><div id="00:27:37.920" class="transcript_line"> and my mum would be sitting there trying to console them you know</div><div id="00:27:42.240" class="transcript_line"> and the letters of thanks you would get afterwards were just incredible</div><div id="00:27:48.240" class="transcript_line"> there were other photographs there&#039;s one in here of a chap called Jürgen Gutmann with a German</div><div id="00:27:56.240" class="transcript_line"> from I think from Stuttgart in the 1972 there was a touring company called Moral Rearmament which is</div><div id="00:28:05.040" class="transcript_line"> a big international organization and it staged a play a musical called the Song of Asia</div><div id="00:28:13.760" class="transcript_line"> and there were people from all over the world in this cast and they went touring around the world</div><div id="00:28:18.880" class="transcript_line"> with this this this musical called Song of Asia and they ended up playing in the Sherman Theatre</div><div id="00:28:24.960" class="transcript_line"> and we hosted Jürgen Gutmann um on his time here we had him staying with us for about three weeks</div><div id="00:28:32.720" class="transcript_line"> whilst the touring company was here and they he became a very good friend and uh there&#039;s just a</div><div id="00:28:40.880" class="transcript_line"> picture of him later on with his young family and his life back in Germany just saying how much it</div><div id="00:28:47.280" class="transcript_line"> meant to him to well to have been here and to get their message of moral rearmament around the uh</div><div id="00:28:55.360" class="transcript_line"> around the world um dad was also involved with the interfaith associations where um the the church</div><div id="00:29:04.160" class="transcript_line"> the leaders of various religious groups would meet in the parade rabbis imams priests vickers</div><div id="00:29:10.800" class="transcript_line"> reverends you name it they would meet and you know talk about issues of the day and go back to their</div><div id="00:29:18.960" class="transcript_line"> various religious organizations and disseminate what they&#039;d heard in the parade and</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> meeting other people it was a forum where people could come together</div><div id="00:29:30.400" class="transcript_line"> and be open-minded which was what which is if you look at the world now we could do with a bit of</div><div id="00:29:38.320" class="transcript_line"> that now a little bit of understanding a little bit of um respect for other people&#039;s viewpoint</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> a little bit of compassion i think that summed up the parade really and summed up certainly summed</div><div id="00:29:53.040" class="transcript_line"> up my dad well i was going to say that they&#039;re they&#039;re your father reverend moonram and 28th</div><div id="00:29:59.520" class="transcript_line"> parade are kind of inextricable but i would like to uh pull them in tees and apart slightly so i</div><div id="00:30:06.000" class="transcript_line"> think one of things that um i&#039;m hearing really is that um your father was a powerhouse and a pioneer</div><div id="00:30:15.280" class="transcript_line"> for for transformation in the education system for the global majority who&#039;d come overseas</div><div id="00:30:24.320" class="transcript_line"> and he really you know going into that school um and it just being a block of um students who are</div><div id="00:30:33.200" class="transcript_line"> totally unaware i mean that&#039;s really shocking to me um but for him to turn that around so</div><div id="00:30:39.360" class="transcript_line"> so can you give us an idea of like how many pupils oh crumbs where&#039;d you begin it would be in the</div><div id="00:30:48.000" class="transcript_line"> thousands it would be in the absolute thousands you know you could literally i mean it&#039;s dad</div><div id="00:30:55.680" class="transcript_line"> retired in 1993 i meet people now taxi drivers for example or builders or guys working in hospitals</div><div id="00:31:05.600" class="transcript_line"> an accountant the other day um you know people who from all walks of life and have said to me</div><div id="00:31:12.480" class="transcript_line"> oh moon around we know that name um and i&#039;m thinking they&#039;re thinking of my younger brother</div><div id="00:31:18.640" class="transcript_line"> who had a law firm in cardiff and they say no he was a teacher um how is he and then i break the</div><div id="00:31:25.600" class="transcript_line"> news that he passed away a long time ago oh and they say well do you know and they all have a</div><div id="00:31:31.120" class="transcript_line"> story to tell they all have a story to tell it&#039;s not as if they were some insignificant</div><div id="00:31:36.800" class="transcript_line"> those kids were never insignificant to him everyone was important as the next person</div><div id="00:31:43.920" class="transcript_line"> and i also get a sense that he has a huge personality and he was constantly engaging</div><div id="00:31:49.520" class="transcript_line"> with people i think you know looking back on it i used to cringe because you do cringe what your</div><div id="00:31:54.480" class="transcript_line"> parents do you do cringe what you know you don&#039;t want to be involved in their life you know you</div><div id="00:32:00.320" class="transcript_line"> dad&#039;s telling you oh i&#039;m doing a function with the parade tonight and i&#039;m thinking oh no i don&#039;t</div><div id="00:32:04.240" class="transcript_line"> want to be there i want to be out with my friends and um but yeah his personality was enormous and</div><div id="00:32:11.120" class="transcript_line"> i used to cringe because he he would project himself and i know why he was doing it there</div><div id="00:32:16.560" class="transcript_line"> was no one else doing it for him there was no one else saying oh ravi moonram is doing this down in</div><div id="00:32:21.840" class="transcript_line"> the parade he had confidence and he always had confidence though from a young man everyone you</div><div id="00:32:27.600" class="transcript_line"> know you speak to his i had the opportunity and good fortune to meet his best friend you know he</div><div id="00:32:34.320" class="transcript_line"> came over on holiday once and um manna and he was telling me about my dad and then i meet other</div><div id="00:32:40.880" class="transcript_line"> people from maritius who tell me about my dad as a young man and how he was a leader there&#039;s no doubt</div><div id="00:32:47.280" class="transcript_line"> about it he was a leader you know but a kind one it wasn&#039;t dictate he wasn&#039;t a dictator</div><div id="00:32:53.920" class="transcript_line"> he was a leader you know he he actually brought people along with him and i think if i was to</div><div id="00:33:00.960" class="transcript_line"> sum him up in in a professional capacity i would say he was bigger than any job he took on bigger</div><div id="00:33:08.800" class="transcript_line"> than any job he never allowed himself to be defined by that task in that job he would always look</div><div id="00:33:46.320" class="transcript_line"> the owner&#039;s son to britain to experience some time with john windows williams because of their</div><div id="00:33:53.440" class="transcript_line"> business relationship they sent over ht solanke harry solanke and he came over in summer of 1970</div><div id="00:34:03.360" class="transcript_line"> and uh my father had a phone call one summer&#039;s evening from john when john williams himself</div><div id="00:34:12.080" class="transcript_line"> john of john windows and he said oh can you help out i have this indian man here i don&#039;t know what</div><div id="00:34:21.120" class="transcript_line"> to do with him and it wasn&#039;t a racist thing he literally didn&#039;t know how to communicate with</div><div id="00:34:29.040" class="transcript_line"> harry harry didn&#039;t speak english so my dad went along next thing we know harry&#039;s with my dad and</div><div id="00:34:35.120" class="transcript_line"> he lived with us for three months while he was on his sabbatical with john windows at the end of it</div><div id="00:34:41.760" class="transcript_line"> he sent a letter of thanks to my dad he wrote regularly but that&#039;s his family in india and</div><div id="00:34:49.920" class="transcript_line"> when he heard of the miners strike in britain and how we were having blackouts in the early 70s</div><div id="00:34:58.480" class="transcript_line"> he air freighted food over to us from india air freighted fresh mangoes and yeah and my dad had</div><div id="00:35:09.600" class="transcript_line"> to go and collect it from the depot at e-throw right so he had to drive to e-throw to get this</div><div id="00:35:15.600" class="transcript_line"> crate of food and that wasn&#039;t the only example the managing directors of panasonic with whom my dad</div><div id="00:35:24.960" class="transcript_line"> was a matsushita electric in pentwind they heard about that when the miners strikes were on and how</div><div id="00:35:32.400" class="transcript_line"> things were supposedly difficult in britain for getting things they thought we were all on rations</div><div id="00:35:38.560" class="transcript_line"> they flew over fresh salmon to our house it was just unbelievable you know my dad wasn&#039;t into</div><div id="00:35:47.200" class="transcript_line"> taking gifts and all that sort of stuff an example of that is when the panasonic connection</div><div id="00:35:55.280" class="transcript_line"> um vhs recorders had just come into being and um we still had a black and white television</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> though at home and when i heard my dad was doing work with the managing directors and that&#039;s a</div><div id="00:36:09.760" class="transcript_line"> shooter my little eyes lit up star trek in color i thought this is fantastic dad are they going to</div><div id="00:36:16.320" class="transcript_line"> give you a tv are they going to give you a tv well he came home one day and there was a tv</div><div id="00:36:22.160" class="transcript_line"> and a video recorder i thought this is it i&#039;m in heaven vin and myself we sat there and we thought</div><div

video it ended up in the parade he wouldn&#039;t take it personally as a gift</div><div id="00:36:42.960" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where it ended up they they had the first pop-up video cassette recorders</div><div id="00:36:49.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s something about the character of your father that is very altruistic very philanthropic</div><div id="00:36:59.200" class="transcript_line"> incredibly generous um a heart that strikes me as being as uh you know deep as an ocean</div><div id="00:37:06.960" class="transcript_line"> as wise to see um and of course he was doing all of these numerous jobs yeah so one would think</div><div id="00:37:13.280" class="transcript_line"> that he could afford his own television can you tell me oh the story of the television</div><div id="00:37:20.320" class="transcript_line"> i know it&#039;s going backwards i&#039;m sorry about this but it is an important story</div><div id="00:37:24.720" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s of when we arrived in britain my dad we arrived to our flat in in richard crescent</div><div id="00:37:32.800" class="transcript_line"> and it was winter was coming

after doing the day job my dad would drop her off and at nine o&#039;clock we&#039;d go and pick her up</div><div id="00:41:29.040" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d go for the ride you know from roth to panarth road exotic pick mum up and</div><div id="00:41:35.040" class="transcript_line"> this was also whilst your father was teaching right yeah my father was teaching yeah yeah</div><div id="00:41:41.280" class="transcript_line"> so we we have a story of two parents who are working working day jobs and night jobs with</div><div id="00:41:46.080" class="transcript_line"> children yeah with children not only their children two others as well we had shake and my cousin</div><div id="00:41:51.200" class="transcript_line"> and his sister who was studying in college across the road cardiff institute which is gone now</div><div id="00:41:57.840" class="transcript_line"> um she was learning um she was trained to become a secretary and then she went back to mariches</div><div id="00:42:04.320" class="transcript_line"> but she studied here for three years and lived with us for three years and shake was living with</div><div id="00:42:10.000" class="transcript_line"> us and my my my dad never took money from the family to have you know he considered that an</div><div id="00:42:17.440" class="transcript_line"> insult if they paid him you know the attitude i think it&#039;s a very much an asian thing you know</div><div id="00:42:23.600" class="transcript_line"> um if we&#039;re cooking for one we can cook for two doesn&#039;t matter okay so just getting a sense of</div><div id="00:42:33.680" class="transcript_line"> the early your early life settling in cardiff and sounds like it was really um</div><div id="00:42:42.800" class="transcript_line"> hard work not for us not for the children but for your parents hard work for your parents yeah um</div><div id="00:42:49.280" class="transcript_line"> and i feel now maybe we can focus on what was happening in the parade okay um</div><div id="00:42:58.560" class="transcript_line"> um because i understand and i have experience being a ugandan refugee that we use the parade</div><div id="00:43:07.040" class="transcript_line"> for nothing and we were one of the communities that used the parade so i&#039;m interested to know</div><div id="00:43:14.240" class="transcript_line"> a bit more about the parade who used the parade and what went on in the day yeah what communities</div><div id="00:43:21.600" class="transcript_line"> this is the photograph number 28 i have it here my dad standing outside and various people on the</div><div id="00:43:26.800" class="transcript_line"> steps of number 28 which is very distinctive it&#039;s the sea master it was the old sea master&#039;s house</div><div id="00:43:33.680" class="transcript_line"> that goes up up in the gallery upstairs it&#039;s a 360 degree viewing gallery in the top of number</div><div id="00:43:41.200" class="transcript_line"> 28 the parade and that was i always thought that what an amazing the caretaker had an amazing place</div><div id="00:43:47.520" class="transcript_line"> to live in andy absolutely amazing place that was and he hardly used that room hardly used that</div><div id="00:43:54.400" class="transcript_line"> south glomorgan owned the building they still do or the council owned the building he was part of</div><div id="00:43:59.120" class="transcript_line"> the education department and my dad with his persuasive skills said oh well you know we need</div><div id="00:44:04.960" class="transcript_line"> a bigger place if we&#039;re going to teach adults as well because adult education was becoming a big</div><div id="00:44:11.040" class="transcript_line"> thing and i think cardiff realized that the director of education was very much on board with this</div><div id="00:44:17.680" class="transcript_line"> actually very much realized that adult education was an important aspect of integrating people</div><div id="00:44:25.840" class="transcript_line"> into life in britain and if you can&#039;t communicate with as an adult with your doctor or your pharmacist</div><div id="00:44:34.160" class="transcript_line"> or your work colleagues you see we didn&#039;t have huge asian populations in carlisle like lester</div><div id="00:44:43.440" class="transcript_line"> where they will support networks in place like parts of birmingham where people could stick to</div><div id="00:44:48.640" class="transcript_line"> mother tongue and get on quite well cardiff there has to be a certain amount of integration it&#039;s</div><div id="00:44:54.080" class="transcript_line"> quite it was quite a small city and in that respect people had to get on and adapt to their new life</div><div id="00:45:04.800" class="transcript_line"> and uh yeah the communities that use the parade were as diverse as there are communities on this</div><div id="00:45:12.320" class="transcript_line"> planet so they&#039;re italians greeks um old somali communities from cardiff indian communities</div><div id="00:45:22.720" class="transcript_line"> bangladeshi pakistani communities all with their own little um customs that they wanted to keep</div><div id="00:45:31.840" class="transcript_line"> alive you know they were in a different place they didn&#039;t have places where they could meet</div><div id="00:45:36.560" class="transcript_line"> and if you look at the kenyan asian immigration to britain or ugandan asian</div><div id="00:45:41.440" class="transcript_line"> immigration to britain a lot of these people were kicked out with nothing that you know idy amin</div><div id="00:45:47.920" class="transcript_line"> was not very kind to the asian people that were made to leave um uganda and they forfeited a lot</div><div id="00:45:56.640" class="transcript_line"> and testament to them that a lot of them grabbed their bootlaces and got on with it</div><div id="00:46:04.240" class="transcript_line"> they absolutely got on with it but can you tell me how the communities used the space</div><div id="00:46:10.800" class="transcript_line"> and was that outside was it a school as well in the daytime in like culturally as well as</div><div id="00:46:16.000" class="transcript_line"> their cultural events did that happen well there was teaching that was first and foremost the</div><div id="00:46:21.520" class="transcript_line"> centre for teaching english as a foreign language to people who say who for whom english was not a</div><div id="00:46:28.880" class="transcript_line"> first language so you had adults being taught there in the daytime adults being sent there from</div><div id="00:46:34.960" class="transcript_line"> various organizations adults realizing they needed to speak english to get on in the community</div><div id="00:46:40.800" class="transcript_line"> adults realizing they needed to speak english to get on with their neighbors you know and to be</div><div id="00:46:45.520" class="transcript_line"> able to have an effective life here and that used to go on in the daytime at the weekends you&#039;d have</div><div id="00:46:52.880" class="transcript_line"> saturday school where kids from mainstream schools around cardiff would come to the parade</div><div id="00:47:00.160" class="transcript_line"> and learn english or better their english and then it would extend into other subjects you know dad</div><div id="00:47:06.800" class="transcript_line"> was very partial to stick in his hand in with the mathematics and sciences he still loved his</div><div id="00:47:12.960" class="transcript_line"> sciences throughout life although he actually didn&#039;t get a chance to do anything with that</div><div id="00:47:18.640" class="transcript_line"> but the cultural side of it you should come along in the evenings in the evenings various groups</div><div id="00:47:27.920" class="transcript_line"> would put their names down and say on wednesday night the ismaili association would like to have</div><div id="00:47:33.200" class="transcript_line"> a function at the parade and quite often you know we&#039;d find ourselves being invited to various</div><div id="00:47:39.520" class="transcript_line"> functions i say you don&#039;t want to get involved in your parents lives but sometimes you had to</div><div id="00:47:44.160" class="transcript_line"> because there were friends involved so you&#039;d go along to various functions and you&#039;d have the</div><div id="00:47:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Sikh community coming along and they&#039;d have a function and i don&#039;t think there were weddings</div><div id="00:47:54.960" class="transcript_line"> that took place there i don&#039;t think that ever happened but it was usually times of religious</div><div id="00:48:00.080" class="transcript_line"> festival someone would be celebrating something at easter you&#039;d probably have the italians and</div><div id="00:48:06.880" class="transcript_line"> the greeks doing something and from that comes other people seeing you doing these things and</div><div id="00:48:14.320" class="transcript_line"> taking part some people would not want to they think oh well you keep it to yourself but there</div><div id="00:48:19.680" class="transcript_line"> was a lot of open mindedness as well a lot of people would want to know what&#039;s going on and a</div><div id="00:48:25.280" class="transcript_line"> great way in with asian people or historically has always been the food thing people always think</div><div id="00:48:32.720" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what associates people but you know you look at it now it&#039;s very trendy isn&#039;t it you watch</div><div id="00:48:37.920" class="transcript_line"> these chefy programs they&#039;re traveling around the world telling us how you know it&#039;s how food</div><div id="00:48:44.160" class="transcript_line"> integrates people but we&#039;ve known that all our lives so i remember as a child in the 1970s being</div><div id="00:48:50.000" class="transcript_line"> part of that smite community and we used the parade for free for friday prayers and and</div><div id="00:48:57.200" class="transcript_line"> um and for big religious occasions and i also understand that the the puja community yeah</div><div id="00:49:05.760" class="transcript_line"> and the hindu community before they found spaces of their own used so i get an understanding that</div><div id="00:49:12.400" class="transcript_line"> the 28th parade was a place where all communities gravitated for help and for space and support</div><div id="00:49:20.160" class="transcript_line"> for nothing courtesy of your father right that&#039;s right that&#039;s right and quite often if they</div><div id="00:49:26.480" class="transcript_line"> you know he&#039;d have a chat with some of the um so-called leaders of these groups who are</div><div id="00:49:32.160" class="transcript_line"> usually you know professional people or business people they understood how things work make a</div><div id="00:49:37.280" class="transcript_line"> contribution to this for the council or whatever you know or do this and i i&#039;ve often heard people</div><div id="00:49:44.160" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re saying oh muniram must be making a fortune out of this and nothing made me more angry than</div><div id="00:49:50.400" class="transcript_line"> to hear that because if you knew my dad money was the last thing of course he realized the the value</div><div id="00:49:56.720" class="transcript_line"> of money to live but money to have money for the sake of it was never his thing and he certainly</div><div id="00:50:03.760" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t take money to for education no if you could just elaborate clarify that for me so what</div><div id="00:50:09.360" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;m hearing is that um he he had a salary as a teacher yeah um but his extracurricular activities</div><div id="00:50:17.120" class="transcript_line"> well he wasn&#039;t people he did for nothing yeah when he when he ran the parade he became the community</div><div id="00:50:22.800" class="transcript_line"> education officer um and basically he was his task was to ensure the teaching of english as a second</div><div id="00:50:32.080" class="transcript_line"> language to children in south clamorgan schools so he was the county chief community education officer</div><div id="00:50:39.200" class="transcript_line"> so he would have to liaise with every school junior high grammar you name it in our area</div><div id="00:50:47.200" class="transcript_line"> so he knew all the headmasters and they had a fantastic working relationship with him</div><div id="00:50:52.560" class="transcript_line"> fantastic rush there&#039;s a file here of thank of congratulations letters that have come from such</div><div id="00:51:00.560" class="transcript_line"> a dive i didn&#039;t even know these existed you you focused my mind on this i didn&#039;t even know these</div><div id="00:51:06.000" class="transcript_line"> existed until i went into the garage to pull out these files that have been sat in a filing cabinet</div><div id="00:51:11.840" class="transcript_line"> for the past 30 years and these letters of thanks from every single organization you can imagine</div><div id="00:51:20.560" class="transcript_line"> when dad had his award he was he was actually awarded an mbe for services to community relations</div><div id="00:51:28.160" class="transcript_line"> in 1981 and there&#039;s a letter from the prime minister the then prime minister margaret thatcher</div><div id="00:51:33.200" class="transcript_line"> of the day telling him he she has nominated him she&#039;s putting forward um to receive an award he</div><div id="00:51:38.560" class="transcript_line"> had to keep it quiet because this letter came out in november that he should be given an award in</div><div id="00:51:44.480" class="transcript_line"> the queen&#039;s honours list and she was making making a recommendation to the queen the for 1982 the new</div><div id="00:51:52.800" class="transcript_line"> year&#039;s honours list of 1982 for my dad to get this award we didn&#039;t even know anything about it until</div><div id="00:51:58.480" class="transcript_line"> my dad came home with a newspaper on new year&#039;s eve and said look at this and there was a list</div><div id="00:52:05.600" class="transcript_line"> no picture it&#039;s just a name uh awards and new year&#039;s honours list published and his names there</div><div id="00:52:13.440" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the first we heard typical of him absolutely typical other things that were typical of him</div><div id="00:52:20.000" class="transcript_line"> were um my mum and dad were invited to a party private party on board the royal yacht britannia</div><div id="00:52:27.600" class="transcript_line"> and uh the by the queen and they have my dad gets this series of invitations from and yet you</div><div id="00:52:36.240" class="transcript_line"> could you could tell it was something important the envelopes even the postman was hanging around</div><div id="00:52:40.880" class="transcript_line"> to see what it was you know he&#039;d be on the doorstep you can open it master of the household you know</div><div id="00:52:46.400" class="transcript_line"> on the big buff coloured envelope for a few weeks these letters used to come and what they were</div><div id="00:52:53.280" class="transcript_line"> they were instructions about how you what you should do not tell anyone you&#039;re going to this</div><div id="00:52:58.560" class="transcript_line"> party and they were vetting him for the next few weeks for security reasons you know they were</div><div id="00:53:04.480" class="transcript_line"> that he was vetted our car was vetted and all the rest of it but they went to this private party on</div><div id="00:53:10.320" class="transcript_line"> on board the royal yacht britannia and it was full of dignitaries and my dad now my dad that night</div><div id="00:53:20.000" class="transcript_line"> was gardening until six o&#039;clock the reception was at 7 30 my dad was out in the garden gardening</div><div id="00:53:28.240" class="transcript_line"> hadn&#039;t bought gone out to buy a suit a new suit hadn&#039;t gone out to hire one and my mum had been</div><div id="00:53:34.240" class="transcript_line"> dressed for three weeks she&#039;d been prepared for this her hair all her friends were involved</div><div id="00:53:40.560" class="transcript_line"> someone bought an orchid for her for her hair the hairdresser vied came and did her hair insisted</div><div id="00:53:46.880" class="transcript_line"> on doing her hair but people in city road there was a different feel about city road in those days</div><div id="00:53:52.160" class="transcript_line"> you know the the shops were different and we knew everyone and you&#039;d go into the uh the delicatessen</div><div id="00:53:59.360" class="transcript_line"> the greek people right you must drive past when you&#039;re going so literally they had to drive down</div><div id="00:54:05.440" class="transcript_line"> city road before they went to join the royal yacht and uh anyway they got on board this yacht and uh</div><div id="00:54:13.600" class="transcript_line"> they were just being you know just in the corner keeping themselves to themselves</div><div id="00:54:17.200" class="transcript_line"> next thing that happens the queen&#039;s private secretary approached my dad approached my dad</div><div id="00:54:21.600" class="transcript_line"> and said oh her majesty would like to speak to you sometime this evening anyway some time later</div><div id="00:54:27.600" class="transcript_line"> he comes across said right she&#039;s ready so my dad goes and speaks to the queen with mum and they</div><div id="00:54:33.680" class="transcript_line"> were chatting and typical of my dad he does his research he does his research he spoke to her</div><div id="00:54:40.800" class="transcript_line"> about her commonwealth speech of 1977 the speech that she delivered in canada and delivered it in</div><div id="00:54:47.840" class="transcript_line"> french and he commented on particular points of the speech to the queen apparently my mum said her</div><div id="00:54:57.280" class="transcript_line"> face lit up and she said to my dad do you speak french i want from marisha&#039;s and they spoke in</div><div id="00:55:02.960" class="transcript_line"> french for about 10 or 15 minutes the queen and my dad spoke in french after that you couldn&#039;t get</div><div id="00:55:10.720" class="transcript_line"> these other people off them well which country you representing you know who are you and the whole</div><div id="00:55:15.840" class="transcript_line"> rest of it and my dad said well i&#039;m ravi muni ram of roth so very humble in all of his undertakings</div><div id="00:55:25.760" class="transcript_line"> yeah and so um there is a sense that because he was a pioneer in in education and community in</div><div id="00:55:35.680" class="transcript_line"> in cardiff there was nothing no one was comparable nobody was doing what he was doing</div><div id="00:55:40.880" class="transcript_line"> and yet he was very humble about his undertakings can you tell me um did he ever share his inspiration</div><div id="00:55:48.560" class="transcript_line"> or what drove him the ideas behind he could see we were having challenges racial challenges yeah he</div><div id="00:55:57.600" class="transcript_line"> could see there was a he injustice was the core of whatever he did injustice and unfairness he just</div><div id="00:56:04.480" class="transcript_line"> wanted the people to have the best opportunity they could i mean he he came he was born out of</div><div id="00:56:10.720" class="transcript_line"> that you see he had come through a system of colonialism where you know you weren&#039;t meant to</div><div id="00:56:18.000" class="transcript_line"> be in certain things if you weren&#039;t you know from the motherland you know you you as a as a</div><div id="00:56:25.600" class="transcript_line"> colonized person you knew your place there was certain in in the civil service in marisha&#039;s at</div><div id="00:56:31.600" class="transcript_line"> the time there was only a certain level the indigenous indians could ever rise to and um</div><div id="00:56:39.680" class="transcript_line"> you know one interesting fact and probably for another day you know because it&#039;s too much to</div><div id="00:56:45.440" class="transcript_line"> talk about is um the seeds if i it wouldn&#039;t be too uh grandiose for me to say that the seeds of</div><div id="00:56:54.000" class="transcript_line"> independence in marisha&#039;s were sown in my grandfather&#039;s house the prime minister</div><div id="00:57:00.080" class="transcript_line"> siwa sagurangulam used to come to my grant my mum remembers it as a girl having um siwa sagurangulam</div><div id="00:57:07.680" class="transcript_line"> at their house as a young lawyer because he came to my grandfather&#039;s house who was an experienced</div><div id="00:57:13.200" class="transcript_line"> lawyer as his mentor and the seeds for independence which was a peaceful bloodless independence</div><div id="00:57:21.440" class="transcript_line"> seeking a breakaway from colonial rule happened in 1967 and he became the first prime minister</div><div id="00:57:28.240" class="transcript_line"> of marisha&#039;s and this then gives me an insight into your father&#039;s thinking because it seems he</div><div id="00:57:35.040" class="transcript_line"> was very progressive and ahead of his time and very much embodied inclusion every time i went</div><div id="00:57:40.560" class="transcript_line"> into the parade there was everybody was welcome there was no other male female whatever your</div><div id="00:57:45.200" class="transcript_line"> religion even if you were right wing yeah you know even if you were left wing it made no</div><div id="00:57:49.520" class="transcript_line"> difference he had teachers and would you say that marisha&#039;s offered a model a different way of</div><div id="00:57:55.040" class="transcript_line"> thinking i think marisha&#039;s forms you as a person in terms of you know you perhaps you&#039;re a little</div><div id="00:58:00.640" class="transcript_line"> bit naive you know i still think you know that people from the colonies are because you you have</div><div id="00:58:06.080" class="transcript_line"> this view of britain and you have this view of life you think everyone thinks like you you think</div><div id="00:58:13.040" class="transcript_line"> everyone is going to be as welcoming as you and then the stark reality of not being the case</div><div id="00:58:21.680" class="transcript_line"> you know hits home but with with that i think the bottom in all of this is that he was an absolute</div><div id="00:58:31.840" class="transcript_line"> machine you know and absolutely determined to do the best he could for others to open doors like</div><div id="00:58:38.160" class="transcript_line"> the mbe he took that but did he ever use it for himself no way it was to open doors because you</div><div id="00:58:45.760" class="transcript_line"> put that after you and especially in the early 80s you have that after your name you get a piece</div><div id="00:58:50.640" class="transcript_line"> of correspondence back people pay attention to what you&#039;re saying now he never used it to feather</div><div id="00:58:57.040" class="transcript_line"> ravie moonram&#039;s nest or grow ravie moonram&#039;s empire he did it there we are let&#039;s push so and so into</div><div id="00:59:05.920" class="transcript_line"> that role so would you say that he did it for the parade and all the people that came to the parade</div><div id="00:59:12.720" class="transcript_line"> sorting out i think he did it for everyone that came across that door they didn&#039;t have to be</div><div id="00:59:17.920" class="transcript_line"> members of the parade but everyone you know the parade really extended to 36 richmond road that</div><div id="00:59:24.240" class="transcript_line"> was like a satellite of the parade because the bell never stopped ringing people would finish in</div><div id="00:59:29.280" class="transcript_line"> the parade at 10 up doing their function at about half past nine ten o&#039;clock at night they&#039;d lock up</div><div id="00:59:35.440" class="transcript_line"> then their meetings would go on and my dad would be home because he would eat his evening meal</div><div id="00:59:41.200" class="transcript_line"> watching news at 10 every night that&#039;s when he got time to sit down have his evening meal</div><div id="00:59:46.080" class="transcript_line"> he would come home you hear the key going here&#039;s footsteps come down the hall he&#039;d pour himself a</div><div id="00:59:51.840" class="transcript_line"> very small whiskey have that whilst his food was warming and sit down in the corner of the back</div><div id="00:59:57.760" class="transcript_line"> room in richmond road and watch the news at 10 every night and then usually very soon after that</div><div id="01:00:04.880" class="transcript_line"> the bell would ring or the phone would say oh ravi we need to see you or ravi bye that was usually</div><div id="01:00:10.720" class="transcript_line"> the one ravi bye or bye yeah we need to see you now now now desperately so need to see you we&#039;ve</div><div id="01:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> got a problem with so and so in our community well we&#039;ve got a problem with this problem with that</div><div id="01:00:21.600" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d never say no and then it&#039;d be the signing of the warrants for the police the police would come</div><div id="01:00:26.960" class="transcript_line"> at three because we were the you know they weren&#039;t doing it because he happened to be a</div><div id="01:00:32.080" class="transcript_line"> bloody good magistrate or anything like that it&#039;s because we were probably the first house on the</div><div id="01:00:36.960" class="transcript_line"> way out from the police station so three o&#039;clock in the morning he&#039;d be signing warrants for the</div><div id="01:00:41.680" class="transcript_line"> police and he would take it very seriously they would have to explain why they wanted a warrant</div><div id="01:00:46.080" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t just a rubber stamp quite often i&#039;d be up because i would hear the bell he was a magistrate</div><div id="01:00:51.680" class="transcript_line"> so they would have to get magistrate&#039;s signature to undertake a warrant to get a warrant to either</div><div id="01:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> go and arrest someone or to carry out a search if they were suspicious that something was going on</div><div id="01:01:03.040" class="transcript_line"> but they would have to so that&#039;s why we always had a bible or other religious book in our front</div><div id="01:01:08.880" class="transcript_line"> room they would have to swear that they were going to you know things were being done properly it</div><div id="01:01:13.920" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t just a case of going to ramming around his house and getting these things signed off it never</div><div id="01:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> happened and that&#039;s why he had such a a good relationship with the police you know he was</div><div id="01:01:23.280" class="transcript_line"> very well respected within the police community so i&#039;ve heard you mention quite a few roles so just</div><div id="01:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> in sequence can we hear your father&#039;s title for the parade was community education officer</div><div id="01:01:40.800" class="transcript_line"> and then

id="01:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> extracurricular to his day job he did all these things above and beyond his normal job so really</div><div id="01:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re talking about him wanting to improve the quality of life for people for people generally</div><div id="01:03:42.720" class="transcript_line"> and i think in particular it strikes me um people of the global majority who are marginalized yeah</div><div id="01:03:49.600" class="transcript_line"> yeah um and in precarious circumstances when they come to this country that may show the person like</div><div id="01:03:55.920" class="transcript_line"> you know i remember many christmas days we&#039;re sitting down you know we have that just us the</div><div id="01:04:00.720"

brother&#039;s nerves i loved it i absolutely loved it but i know he used to wind my brothers up a bit</div><div id="01:04:34.720" class="transcript_line"> why can&#039;t we just do things with us for a change you know why can&#039;t it just be us but uh we know</div><div id="01:04:41.760" class="transcript_line"> we used to get on with it never used to complain to the person who was there they were always made</div><div id="01:04:45.600" class="transcript_line"> to feel welcome but do you feel your family suffered as a result of your father&#039;s philanthropic</div><div id="01:04:51.600" class="transcript_line"> crimes without well not suffered i didn&#039;t suffer um neither did my brothers we didn&#039;t suffer at all</div><div id="01:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> we had immense freedom we didn&#039;t have the typical asian upbringing there were no expectations on us</div><div id="01:05:04.720" class="transcript_line"> to become lawyers doctors accountants it was none of that nonsense going on in the house you choose</div><div id="01:05:09.760" class="transcript_line"> what subjects you want to do you know it&#039;s as simple as that and you know if you want guidance</div><div id="01:05:15.840" class="transcript_line"> we weren&#039;t forced to i can never remember being forced to study or you must stay home and study</div><div id="01:05:22.560" class="transcript_line"> or you can&#039;t go to that disco or you can&#039;t see that girl it never happened it never happened or</div><div id="01:05:28.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re not going out with them because they&#039;re not from our community it&#039;s never happened um but</div><div id="01:05:35.280" class="transcript_line"> certainly my mum had a tough time of it from the point of view we very rarely she very rarely had</div><div id="01:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> holidays you know he was working flat out and the time he had holidays was when my brothers and</div><div id="01:05:48.800" class="transcript_line"> myself got a little bit older and we&#039;d started earning some money and we actually went down to</div><div id="01:05:53.760" class="transcript_line"> the travel agents travel agents what are they the guys that happened before online yes um went down</div><div id="01:06:00.240" class="transcript_line"> to the travel agents and uh booked a holiday for them and said right you&#039;re going and presenting</div><div id="01:06:05.760" class="transcript_line"> him with the tickets oh he would most put out with that why did you do that why you know i&#039;m</div><div id="01:06:11.360" class="transcript_line"> i only need a few days away but once he&#039;s away he loved it can you tell us when that was yeah it</div><div id="01:06:18.160" class="transcript_line"> was in the 80s definitely in the 80s our last family holiday was 1976 our last family holiday</div><div id="01:06:26.160" class="transcript_line"> but vin myself and my mum and dad not even my older brother because 76 he&#039;d gone to university</div><div id="01:06:32.080" class="transcript_line"> but my mum and dad that was our last one a family holiday and my dad actually took us to</div><div id="01:06:38.160" class="transcript_line"> paris we went on train you know we went we drove to dover and we went on the train</div><div id="01:06:45.440" class="transcript_line"> to paris had a few days in paris and we came back to london it was heatwave here it was stiflingly</div><div id="01:06:51.520" class="transcript_line"> hot everywhere it was unbelievable you know it was so so hot so for somebody who is clearly such</div><div id="01:07:00.880" class="transcript_line"> a huge personality and an absolute powerhouse committed to selfless service i find it i&#039;m curious</div><div id="01:07:09.840" class="transcript_line"> why there is no trace of ravim unaram if i was to google him or you know looking at any sort of</div><div id="01:07:15.760" class="transcript_line"> book around south wales or cardiff or educational pioneers can you comment on that in this message</div><div id="01:07:24.080" class="transcript_line"> you want to i would love to be able to comment on it and put some logic to it um but i think it&#039;s</div><div id="01:07:30.560" class="transcript_line"> for those who supposedly keep records of this city to look at themselves i have no idea why</div><div id="01:07:40.240" class="transcript_line"> such an important venue as the parade has been allowed to degenerate into what it has become</div><div id="01:07:48.800" class="transcript_line"> that no one seems to be concerned about that well a beautiful building full stop and secondly</div><div id="01:07:56.720" class="transcript_line"> what it stood for particularly at a time when the world is fragmenting what that building stood for</div><div id="01:08:04.320" class="transcript_line"> what that building stood for it opened people&#039;s minds to other ways of life other people&#039;s</div><div id="01:08:10.640" class="transcript_line"> viewpoints and that there is no recognition you know the recognition thing he wouldn&#039;t have given</div><div id="01:08:17.360" class="transcript_line"> a tuppence for it who are the people who recognize you anyway that that would have been his approach</div><div id="01:08:22.960" class="transcript_line"> he didn&#039;t care less about rewards he really didn&#039;t but i must say i i i can&#039;t believe there</div><div id="01:08:29.120" class="transcript_line"> is no record i mean you get um streets named after people who may have done some little thing</div><div id="01:08:36.960" class="transcript_line"> in cardiff or whatever you know and you think yeah well that&#039;s nice for them but there are</div><div id="01:08:44.160" class="transcript_line"> there are others in the city who have been sort of invisible i think of john reynolds former leader</div><div id="01:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> of the council but coming back to your father as an what i would consider to be an innocent hero</div><div id="01:08:56.480" class="transcript_line"> i know that he was a complete role model for me amongst many other things you know he&#039;s very</div><div id="01:09:02.480" class="transcript_line"> paternal towards me and actually enabled me to to view the world through a different lens</div><div id="01:09:11.440" class="transcript_line"> to view a world of through inclusion and equality which was very rare and in short supply in the</div><div id="01:09:18.800" class="transcript_line"> 1970s 80s 90s and even more so now so for me um he really was a trailblazer and one of the most</div><div id="01:09:26.880" class="transcript_line"> important figures in my life on so many levels you can say so you&#039;re more than welcome um</div><div id="01:09:35.680" class="transcript_line"> and i think that perhaps your father&#039;s humility because he didn&#039;t actually</div><div id="01:09:42.240" class="transcript_line"> talk brag about what was happening at the parade i don&#039;t think people actually understood or have</div><div id="01:09:48.960" class="transcript_line"> any sort of record and he never kept records i understand of what went on well i think he did</div><div id="01:09:55.120" class="transcript_line"> in in that it&#039;s here he kept the original documents of things i mean he very much kept the original</div><div id="01:10:00.800" class="transcript_line"> documents of things there&#039;s pure chance that i have the filing cabinet and the filing cabinet</div><div id="01:10:04.960" class="transcript_line"> literally moved from their old house in richmond road to here when my mum moved and no one&#039;s open</div><div id="01:10:10.800" class="transcript_line"> since today today is when i opened this filing cabinet and that would detail well it&#039;s coming</div><div id="01:10:16.560" class="transcript_line"> to going to the parade not only the parade but his university life his his job applications</div><div id="01:10:23.920" class="transcript_line"> after finishing university you know some of the most lowly jobs you can imagine that he should</div><div id="01:10:29.920" class="transcript_line"> have walked into not even getting an interview for you know it&#039;s just mindfully numbingly</div><div id="01:10:37.840" class="transcript_line"> numbingly unbelievable lab technicians jobs he would wipe the scientifically he could have wiped</div><div id="01:10:44.560" class="transcript_line"> the floor with them and there are letters of reference you know from his professor in cardiff</div><div id="01:10:49.680" class="transcript_line"> university when he finished his degree was finishing his degree he wanted him to stay on</div><div id="01:10:54.560" class="transcript_line"> and do a phd my dad didn&#039;t know many he couldn&#039;t do it he said no and professor asbray head of</div><div id="01:11:00.240" class="transcript_line"> botany at cardiff university wrote an open letter and said this man basically to power in parenthesis</div><div id="01:11:07.600" class="transcript_line"> i would say this man needs to be funded he really needs find it some way of giving cardiff university</div><div id="01:11:18.080" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t do it you know them being them and uh there was no one out there to do it and to ask</div><div id="01:11:25.760" class="transcript_line"> really bluntly then do you feel that um his identity his race was a big factor in this</div><div id="01:11:33.120" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s it&#039;s he would never say that he would never say that and i&#039;m not going to jump on that</div><div id="01:11:37.680" class="transcript_line"> i i i would imagine they had bearings on certain aspects of his life without a doubt i mean you&#039;d</div><div id="01:11:44.240" class="transcript_line"> be naive to think it didn&#039;t without a doubt the way he was treated you know not just within not</div><div id="01:11:51.440" class="transcript_line"> within not only within the indigenous population of cardiff but outside you know for example</div><div id="01:12:00.080" class="transcript_line"> he was working in the parade one night and um it&#039;s at the time when he was dealing with a lot of</div><div id="01:12:07.280" class="transcript_line"> iraqi and arab students coming in and this gentleman turned up and i think he was from</div><div id="01:12:15.120" class="transcript_line"> q8 and he was very smartly dressed and my dad was telling me and my dad was in the in the office and</div><div id="01:12:22.320" class="transcript_line"> he was wearing uh yeah what he&#039;s got on there you see that jacket and a jumper underneath so no tie</div><div id="01:12:28.800" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s just as he is there very casual you know in that that outfit there and the man said to him</div><div id="01:12:35.760" class="transcript_line"> where&#039;s your boss and my dad being my dad said or just wait a minute um if you come in here and sit</div><div id="01:12:43.840" class="transcript_line"> down i&#039;ll go and get him for you so what he made him do he made him do you know the building in</div><div id="01:12:50.960" class="transcript_line"> 28 parade is joined to cardiff high school field says a big basement that runs the length of the</div><div id="01:12:55.520" class="transcript_line"> building so my dad took him down into the basement made him walk the length of the corridor we just</div><div id="01:13:01.440" class="transcript_line"> have to go up here go up the stairs the other way walk back the other way then sat him down in his</div><div id="01:13:07.680" class="transcript_line"> my dad&#039;s office sat him down he said if you just wait here a minute i&#039;ll go and get him for you</div><div id="01:13:12.160" class="transcript_line"> he let him stew in there for about 10 minutes and he walked in and sat on the other side of the</div><div id="01:13:17.200" class="transcript_line"> desk and he said right what can i do for you and this is typical of your father&#039;s sense of humor</div><div id="01:13:25.040" class="transcript_line"> very cheeky and i think this possibly went over so many people because he was he was he was very</div><div id="01:13:30.640" class="transcript_line"> light-hearted but but he was never a victim he he would go out and you could see his his rapport</div><div id="01:13:38.080" class="transcript_line"> with teachers in schools you know and you&#039;d have that embarrassing moment when your dad&#039;s coming up</div><div id="01:13:43.920" class="transcript_line"> the drive you know because you don&#039;t want your dad&#039;s job to be where you go to school you know</div><div id="01:13:49.440" class="transcript_line"> he would often come to our wouldn&#039;t he to hoardian because we had our english as a second language</div><div id="01:13:54.720" class="transcript_line"> department there and the teachers there they absolutely loved him they absolutely and he</div><div id="01:14:00.480" class="transcript_line"> would come to the school under the pretense of watching myself and my brother playing rugby</div><div id="01:14:07.120" class="transcript_line"> oh no no no he never actually saw me play rugby his back would be to the pitch and there&#039;s a group</div><div id="01:14:13.760" class="transcript_line"> of these fellow teachers on some touchline over there laughing and joking and you&#039;re thinking</div><div id="01:14:19.760" class="transcript_line"> dad&#039;s watching you play rugby right it was a social life with these other teachers you know</div><div id="01:14:27.120" class="transcript_line"> and this is what i mean about not negatively affecting your family life you didn&#039;t take that</div><div id="01:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> oh no no no no no i i lived very much under the radar my older brother was pushing the boundaries</div><div id="01:14:39.520" class="transcript_line"> i let him get on with that because he was the first brother you know he he had the long hair and all</div><div id="01:14:44.800" class="transcript_line"> the rest of it and i let him take the flak i just did it quietly i used to sneak out late at night</div><div id="01:14:51.040" class="transcript_line"> you know very quietly my dad knew what was going on he said as new as as as long as i got home he</div><div id="01:14:56.640" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t care he didn&#039;t mind i told him i always told him where i was going usually to the students</div><div id="01:15:01.840" class="transcript_line"> i was still in school but i was going to the student union to watch bands i started doing that</div><div id="01:15:06.720" class="transcript_line"> at the age of 15 you know i disappear at about half past nine ten o&#039;clock at night go and watch</div><div id="01:15:12.560" class="transcript_line"> bands there and then roll home was it hard for your mom with your dad being away from home</div><div id="01:15:20.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah most of the day yeah i think she appreciates it now and later on in life but she feels robbed</div><div id="01:15:28.720" class="transcript_line"> she felt robbed at the time because normal people were doing things but you could never get my dad</div><div id="01:15:34.640" class="transcript_line"> to go out for a meal it would never happen you know it never happened if he went out for a meal</div><div id="01:15:39.760" class="transcript_line"> he would usually go know the people because usually it&#039;d be other italian restaurant or</div><div id="01:15:44.560" class="transcript_line"> indian restaurant so he&#039;d know the people running the restaurant they&#039;d make a big fess of him and</div><div id="01:15:48.880" class="transcript_line"> he didn&#039;t want that and he always used to say you know we&#039;d go out in an indian restaurant you know</div><div id="01:15:55.680" class="transcript_line"> occasionally and we&#039;d sit down and they&#039;d come out oh mr mrem what do you want to eat anything you</div><div id="01:16:01.280" class="transcript_line"> want he said oh just get me a just grill me a piece of lamb nothing else no sauce on it just</div><div id="01:16:06.240" class="transcript_line"> grill me a piece of meat on there and i have a small whiskey that&#039;s it i don&#039;t want anything else</div><div id="01:16:11.200" class="transcript_line"> and he would sit there we&#039;d have you know the full monte but he would never and you know trying to</div><div id="01:16:17.520" class="transcript_line"> arrange something you know to him to go out somewhere like my mum&#039;s birthday or his birthday</div><div id="01:16:23.440" class="transcript_line"> oh forget it his birthday but i do have a very lovely photograph of perhaps the last birthday</div><div

two things is going</div><div id="01:20:33.280" class="transcript_line"> to happen either you&#039;re going to go back and get it or you&#039;re going to be down there on the other</div><div id="01:20:38.240" class="transcript_line"> side anyway he stormed off came back and he said i don&#039;t see why i should do this in my country</div><div id="01:20:46.000" class="transcript_line">

class="transcript_line"> martial arts stuff oh it&#039;s amazing amazing so at the end of it my dad said to him would you</div><div id="01:21:19.120" class="transcript_line"> like to ask him to pick your rubbish up he&#039;s a korean but it is about perceptions and integration</div><div id="01:21:28.960" class="transcript_line"> and people breaking down barriers and people mixing those those exchange groups were fantastic</div><div id="01:21:35.760" class="transcript_line"> because you get people with a viewpoint you know their little view of say stuttgart or their little</div><div id="01:21:42.320" class="transcript_line"> view of nant they come over here they meet people with a view of kardif but they things change and</div><div id="01:21:49.280" class="transcript_line"> it does change people and i feel very sorry that we&#039;ve personally i feel very sorry that we seem</div><div id="01:21:56.400" class="transcript_line"> to have gone a little bit backwards in terms of all that integration that used to go on i think</div><div id="01:22:01.920" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re interested that your father understood the power of dialogue and communication without doubt</div><div id="01:22:08.800" class="transcript_line"> so coming back to the community groups i know that the ismaili uganda ugandan asians used</div><div id="01:22:16.240" class="transcript_line"> the building and the prudhya committee i think they were their first iteration was at the</div><div id="01:22:22.480" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s right yeah and that&#039;s still existing yes on isn&#039;t it the shrikachi diva patel samaj</div><div id="01:22:29.120" class="transcript_line"> they still using it they were using it until they had their center in grangetown</div><div id="01:22:33.200" class="transcript_line"> the india society rajagawals until they built the india center they all used to use i&#039;ve got</div><div id="01:22:39.280" class="transcript_line"> photographs of your mum and rajagwal at an event in the in the parade you know they they&#039;re looking</div><div id="01:22:47.120" class="transcript_line"> at some material someone came in and was selling material and you know a good old asian woman can&#039;t</div><div id="01:22:52.080" class="transcript_line"> afford a can&#039;t avoid a material sale so they all were and so there were also samali refugees that</div><div id="01:23:01.280" class="transcript_line"> used the parade in the 90s is that right yeah all sorts of refuge you know you had the vietnamese</div><div id="01:23:07.360" class="transcript_line"> refugees all and you know you look at the way the vietnamese community is integrated into cardiff</div><div id="01:23:15.680" class="transcript_line"> life and has done well for itself and it is that i think immigrants bring a new perspective on life</div><div id="01:23:23.200" class="transcript_line"> especially immigrants who&#039;ve been through a tough time they&#039;ve realized that you know they&#039;ve got an</div><div id="01:23:28.640" class="transcript_line"> opportunity to make their lives turn their lives around and given the right tools and the right</div><div id="01:23:35.760" class="transcript_line"> conditions they will flourish they will flourish it&#039;s when they&#039;re met with bigotry and hatred and</div><div id="01:23:43.840" class="transcript_line"> all the rest of it you know immigration is such a good thing look at america if it&#039;s allowed to</div><div id="01:23:51.840" class="transcript_line"> happen properly immigration is a marvelous thing</div><div id="01:23:57.840" class="transcript_line"> and i live what you&#039;re saying it&#039;s not just financially it&#039;s it&#039;s culturally what you learn</div><div id="01:24:04.480" class="transcript_line"> from other people what you learn from other people and their ways of life you know the gentleness</div><div id="01:24:12.240" class="transcript_line"> that comes along with so i i always was amazed how gentle the japanese people were we used to meet a</div><div id="01:24:18.880" class="transcript_line"> gentle civility to them to everything they did and some of the asian communities you know they</div><div id="01:24:24.880" class="transcript_line"> they have gentleness they weren&#039;t like us loud and brash they were nice people yeah i remember your</div><div id="01:24:32.720" class="transcript_line"> father recording a story of how the rastafarians used to use the basement in the 70s and but he</div><div id="01:24:37.920" class="transcript_line"> had to stop that because they were smoking weed and for the greater good he told them that they</div><div id="01:24:43.200" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t use it anymore because you know they were smoking the herb and that didn&#039;t go down</div><div id="01:24:49.680" class="transcript_line"> too well so i think your father well there was ruffled feathers i think he did ruffle feathers</div><div id="01:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> in and out of communities absolutely there were some some communities who thought he was in it</div><div id="01:24:59.200" class="transcript_line"> for himself i remember there was a community who some of whom attended my school who took a</div><div id="01:25:07.120" class="transcript_line"> delegation to the city hall to complain about him accusing him of favouritism towards other</div><div id="01:25:13.760" class="transcript_line"> communities and that&#039;s the last thing he would have done i mean there&#039;s a there&#039;s a shot somewhere</div><div id="01:25:20.880" class="transcript_line"> amongst all these photographs of him addressing a room full of people from and so-called community</div><div id="01:25:28.240" class="transcript_line"> leaders self-professed community leaders of all backgrounds in this room basically knocking their</div><div id="01:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> heads together and saying listen to you because they were supposed to be you know having this</div><div id="01:25:40.080" class="transcript_line"> meeting where they could thrash things out and talk about their differences and you know come</div><div id="01:25:44.320" class="transcript_line"> to agreement you know basically we&#039;re all batting you know we&#039;re all should be singing from the same</div><div id="01:25:50.240" class="transcript_line"> hymn sheet about development of kids and all the rest of it but now there were these little agendas</div><div id="01:25:55.280" class="transcript_line"> going on and he basically tore them a new one that day and a lot of those people who are now</div><div id="01:26:01.520" class="transcript_line"> so a lot of whom are not around anymore but some of those guys for years afterwards talked about</div><div id="01:26:06.480" class="transcript_line"> that night it literally was a sobering moment for them to be talked to like that and said</div><div id="01:26:11.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah we realize now what we need to do bringing them together</div><div id="01:26:19.920" class="transcript_line"> but uh yeah he did ruffle feathers and i&#039;m sure there were some people who thought</div><div id="01:26:24.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah uh he was having a go at uh because as i understood it weed was uh permissible into the</div><div id="01:26:31.920" class="transcript_line"> rastafarian communities as part of a religious ceremony but it couldn&#039;t happen in the parade</div><div id="01:26:39.040" class="transcript_line"> because the police would have been and for their good the police would have been on it like a ton</div><div id="01:26:43.440" class="transcript_line"> of bricks you know it wasn&#039;t as liberal as it is now and we&#039;re talking about ruffling feathers i</div><div id="01:26:51.280" class="transcript_line"> think he must have done that in education as well oh without a doubt i mean he was a thorn in the</div><div id="01:26:56.720" class="transcript_line"> side of authority and can you just unpack that please like why oh if i could i mean uh they were</div><div id="01:27:03.360" class="transcript_line"> telling me couldn&#039;t do something or that funding wasn&#039;t available he would fight tooth and nail</div><div id="01:27:09.280" class="transcript_line"> to get that funding or to secure a place for that particular person in a school when they were told</div><div id="01:27:15.440" class="transcript_line"> oh they&#039;re not going to mainstream school you know they should be educated somewhere else</div><div id="01:27:20.640" class="transcript_line"> or some headmaster had resisted but usually he had excellent relations with the headmasters it</div><div id="01:27:26.080" class="transcript_line"> was usually someone in the education office not at director level though because he always had a good</div><div id="01:27:32.240" class="transcript_line"> working relationship with the directors he cut through the crap he just yeah let&#039;s get this done</div><div id="01:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> very much about that but he yeah he ruffled feathers he wasn&#039;t an establishment person at all</div><div id="01:27:46.560" class="transcript_line"> um he didn&#039;t attend the right dinners wasn&#039;t into it he preferred to be home</div><div id="01:27:52.720" class="transcript_line"> very much preferred to be home and go socializing with the right people after work never happened</div><div id="01:27:58.720" class="transcript_line"> with his staff he loved his staff absolutely loved the people of the parade agnes keen margo</div><div id="01:28:05.440" class="transcript_line"> mike adlington um you know little rick collett oh these people were priceless to him you know</div><div id="01:28:12.800" class="transcript_line"> absolutely priceless herb jan riot how can i i have photographs of herb jan teaching they&#039;re</div><div id="01:28:20.880" class="transcript_line"> in this group here absolute legend and of course let&#039;s just move to retirement because at that</div><div id="01:28:29.600" class="transcript_line"> point moment in retirement and if you could just confirm the date the um the parade was then handed</div><div id="01:28:36.480" class="transcript_line"> over to a female muslim woman from outside of kardif can you tell me when that was that was</div><div id="01:28:42.400" class="transcript_line"> april 1993 yeah and that was the time your father retired yeah okay yeah he literally came home from</div><div id="01:28:50.240" class="transcript_line"> work and he was ill from that day and i think what he did he fell on his sword he um he saw the</div><div id="01:28:58.240" class="transcript_line"> writing was on the wall funding wise and he took it very personally he&#039;d seen the correspondence</div><div id="01:29:03.920" class="transcript_line"> he was involved with the exchange of the correspondence so he sacrificed himself</div><div id="01:29:08.880" class="transcript_line"> he literally sacrificed himself he went in and said i&#039;m retiring because he wanted to create</div><div id="01:29:14.080" class="transcript_line"> opportunities for the people coming through i don&#039;t quite understand that he saw the funding</div><div id="01:29:20.640" class="transcript_line"> problems and yeah well the uh the fun they were going to trim down on the staff in the parade</div><div id="01:29:28.320" class="transcript_line"> simple as question of numbers and he thought that um if he goes it opens opportunities he was 62</div><div id="01:29:39.680" class="transcript_line"> and but i think he he would have been happy at working without doubt but um what we tried to do</div><div id="01:29:48.080" class="transcript_line"> when he retired we we we were working towards this vinnum myself we created an office for him in</div><div id="01:29:53.840" class="transcript_line"> richmond road we thought oh you know you can do all this other stuff without the shackles of south</div><div id="01:29:59.200" class="transcript_line"> glomorgan on your back you know the stuff you know he loved being a jp magistrate loved sitting in</div><div id="01:30:04.880" class="transcript_line"> the courts absolutely loved it again that was an opportunity to exercise life you know real life</div><div id="01:30:12.720" class="transcript_line"> issues you know people coming across that call some of them you know not everyone&#039;s a sob story</div><div id="01:30:18.000" class="transcript_line"> if you can you deserve to go to prison you&#039;re going to go to prison or you deserve a custodial</div><div id="01:30:21.840" class="transcript_line"> sentence you&#039;re going to get a custodial sentence but some people need a break and it&#039;s recognizing</div><div id="01:30:27.120" class="transcript_line"> that and it&#039;s also about disseminating that to your fellow members on the bench you speak to</div><div id="01:30:32.320" class="transcript_line"> people who we sat with on the bench you know for 30 years later they thought yeah he was good so</div><div id="01:30:40.480" class="transcript_line"> another another word of his tools apart from being on the refuge he always says he always said though</div><div id="01:30:46.880" class="transcript_line"> he recognized you know he worked in a time where the chair of the bench when he first came on it</div><div id="01:30:52.240" class="transcript_line"> was a woman called hilda cohen jewish lady whose husband was um isaac cohen of leo abse and going</div><div id="01:31:00.240" class="transcript_line"> cardiff&#039;s biggest at that time cardiff&#039;s bigger north of him and they were left wing good old</div><div

it&#039;s people in in his youth who were big mentors to him</div><div id="01:31:53.760" class="transcript_line"> i feel that we have only touched on your father&#039;s life um and what i think would be fitting is that</div><div id="01:32:03.760" class="transcript_line"> is there anything that you could put together in a short phrase or something that just sums up</div><div id="01:32:12.880" class="transcript_line"> your experience of your father the parade and maybe what resilience means yeah oh</div><div id="01:32:19.680" class="transcript_line"> crim&#039;s gonna be difficult this um well resilience that was that embodied everything about him</div><div id="01:32:27.120" class="transcript_line"> absolute resilience was uh being told you can&#039;t do something being told you know these it&#039;s</div><div id="01:32:34.080" class="transcript_line"> against the odds do that well that&#039;s the worst thing you could have said to him he&#039;ll show you</div><div id="01:32:38.160" class="transcript_line"> like how it can be done and never give up on someone never give up on someone you know he</div><div id="01:32:45.760" class="transcript_line"> would always try every avenue to make that person&#039;s life make them see that they can have a better life</div><div id="01:32:55.360" class="transcript_line"> or improve their situation or do what they want to
