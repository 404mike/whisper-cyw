    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What do we picture when we think about the Holocaust? Who do we think of? Where do we</div><div id="00:00:11.320" class="transcript_line"> think of them? Do we think of Nazi storm troopers barking orders at groups of defenceless Jews</div><div id="00:00:19.920" class="transcript_line"> in German streets? Of men, women and children wearing yellow stars being beaten? Of broken</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> glass of Hitler and rallies at Nuremberg? Do we think of trains transporting victims,</div><div id="00:00:36.040" class="transcript_line"> families from their homes in central Europe to concentration camps and tree-lined thickets in</div><div id="00:00:42.240" class="transcript_line"> the East? Place names Bergen-Belsen, Treblinka, Dachau, Auschwitz-Birkenau. Barbed wire, wooden</div><div id="00:00:57.020" class="transcript_line"> huts and guard towers, places of death? Or do we think of heroic rescue? Of escape through enemy</div><div id="00:01:05.540" class="transcript_line"> lines? Of liberation, the resistance, the Warsaw uprising, the Kinder transport? Do we think of</div><div id="00:01:15.660" class="transcript_line"> Wales? Of Cardiff? Or Swansea? Or Abergella?</div><div id="00:01:39.500" class="transcript_line"> I knew where I was coming to in Wales because if you were under seven you had to have a home</div><div id="00:01:45.060" class="transcript_line"> to go to and I&#039;d got pictures which I&#039;ve still got of where I was going, the people, the husband</div><div id="00:01:52.860" class="transcript_line"> and wife and the grandfather and they had pictures of me. And then we got evacuated and we went to</div><div id="00:02:04.020" class="transcript_line"> Wales. While I was in Wales, in Cardiff, I went to the British Medical Association and said I was</div><div id="00:02:13.820" class="transcript_line"> here and I could do some work. So they sent me to Clwyn ap Ie hospital that was up in the Rhondda</div><div id="00:02:23.340" class="transcript_line"> Valley. We went to Llandudno, North Wales, a really good boarding house, but then we also had to</div><div id="00:02:34.020" class="transcript_line"> leave Llandudno, which became a protected area later on. Those three voices you just heard were</div><div id="00:02:40.900" class="transcript_line"> Renata Collins, Josephine Bruegel and Hans Albrecht. All of them fled their countries of birth,</div><div id="00:02:47.820" class="transcript_line"> Czechoslovakia and Austria, and became refugees in Wales. Each of them has a unique story,</div><div id="00:02:55.820" class="transcript_line"> sometimes uplifting, sometimes tragic, connecting the Holocaust to Wales. The Holocaust was one of</div><div id="00:03:06.460" class="transcript_line"> the defining moments of the 20th century and its effects were felt throughout the world,</div><div id="00:03:11.580" class="transcript_line"> including in Wales. Refugees from central Europe fled to Wales seeking sanctuary,</div><div id="00:03:18.380" class="transcript_line"> as did Holocaust survivors attempting to rebuild their lives in subsequent years. Welsh soldiers</div><div id="00:03:25.820" class="transcript_line"> and nurses were among the first to witness the horrors of the Nazi camps when they were liberated</div><div id="00:03:30.500" class="transcript_line"> at the end of the Second World War. In this podcast, we will explore how the Holocaust</div><div id="00:03:36.900" class="transcript_line"> impacted Wales. We will look at the stories of those who fled from Nazi tyranny to build</div><div id="00:03:42.940" class="transcript_line"> better lives for themselves and their families, and hear about the loved ones they had to leave</div><div id="00:03:48.140" class="transcript_line"> behind. We will learn how they have contributed to Welsh life, culturally, economically and</div><div id="00:03:55.220" class="transcript_line"> politically. The Holocaust did not just happen to other people in another place and time,</div><div id="00:04:01.500" class="transcript_line"> it is part of all of our history. This podcast has been created as part of Holocaust Resources</div><div id="00:04:11.900" class="transcript_line"> Wales, a project between the Centre for the Movement of People at Aberystwyth University</div><div id="00:04:16.740" class="transcript_line"> and the Jewish History Association of South Wales, and sponsored by the Association of Jewish</div><div id="00:04:22.620" class="transcript_line"> Refugees.</div></div></p>
