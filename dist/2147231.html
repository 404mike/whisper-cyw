class="transcript_line"> There was no hot water.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> No hot water.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The sun didn&#039;t hit us.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> No fridge.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> As she said already, no fridge.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> No freezer.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> There were no clothes.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They couldn&#039;t put the clothes out.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially in winter.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to make sure that they were in that room where the fire was on.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to make sure that they were in that room where the fire was on.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very hard.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She said obviously the generation like it would be.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The one after me, they got a much

little bit easy.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Fingers crossed hopefully for them.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely because you come in that early and lay a foundation for the next generations to be at ease in the way that they have it.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> When you came, you said that your life was very hard.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We had no children.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We were left behind.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the only ones who could do the work.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to work hard.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to work hard.</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But the children were doing the work.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no telephone.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to write letters.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to write letters.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You could understand some of the letters.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to wait for the letter.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Eight days to get there.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Eight days.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a telephone outside.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then later on, the pay phone.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Then slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Then obviously people started having telephones.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to book the call as well.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to book the call when we got our phone.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was not a direct call at some point.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no phone in the kitchen.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no telephone.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> There was only a cooker.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no microwave.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no kitchen.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no microwave.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There was only the cooker.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no reason to do anything.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no microwave.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no kitchen.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Small kitchen.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Small kitchen.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> People saw that.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They said, Pakistan is so bad.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, coming here.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh my God, we were so bad off in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We were so bad off at that time when we came here.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We were so bad off.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so embarrassed.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I think because you imagine things when you&#039;re young.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got this different picture of UK.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The life will be like this and that.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You watch movies.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different to reality.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially for working class people.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you miss the most then?</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> There might have been a lot anyway.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember missing?</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you miss a lot of things.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you miss the most?</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you miss the most?</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I miss my sister.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> She was sick.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> She said someone is ill if death happens.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We miss our sisters.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Our parents passed away.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We miss our country.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything is here.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Regardless, we are here actually.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But your own country is like when we say back home.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is back home, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> This is our house.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> This is what we lived.</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> More of our life.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But she did miss the most.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Her family.</div><div id="00:14:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The family system.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Love and care.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Also, they were very isolated.</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a bathroom and a bathroom outside.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, where are you taking me?</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so old.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Our life is very different.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Regardless what they talk about Pakistan media,</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> if I&#039;m honest, the life she is saying is much better in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> If you are middle class people, you have a big house</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and every bedroom has a bathroom.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So much luxury, you can have beds.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They have a social life as well.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Here it is much better.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum came and she was there.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad obviously worked in the shop.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He was from a good family.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I think when our parents came here to visit us,</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> my mum hated me seeing working and coming home</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and doing the cooking and all that.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that the same?</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Did your friends or family come over as well?</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> When they saw us, they saw us.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to do everything there.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They laughed a lot.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> When they told us to clean the house,</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I told them to clean the house.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We cleaned the toilets as well.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We cleaned the clothes, the dishes, the dishes.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They have made everything basically.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Here you have to do everything yourself.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And people do actually.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Not in a bad way they laugh.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They appreciate that they are better off there.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But we do believe as I already said,</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> where we are going to go, we will be there.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They came from Koshni.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> When they came, it was very hard.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Very tough and hard.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they come together?</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They came when they were 8 years old.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They were 8 years old.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Who was he?</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He came with his uncle.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite interesting.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He studied here.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He went back to Shantaroh for the first time.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Uncle came, her husband, sorry I just need to say uncle.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He passed away.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He came when he was 8 years old with his uncle.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was dad&#039;s brother.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in Newcastle.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He died.</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> This is how he was brought here when uncle was 8 years old.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He grew up here.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he went back to Pakistan to get married when she came here.</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Despite having those roots here,</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> like his uncle was here,</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> even still when he got married and brought her here,</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> still there were difficulties.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> As you mentioned roots,</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> what elements of the culture or the roots did you make an effort to preserve?</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned that you used to meet families there.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What are the things that you try to preserve?</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What are the things that you still try to preserve?</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether you find it here or not.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Or any other festival that you do.</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The same thing that we do.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Or do you do it the same way?</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Here we do it the right way.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We give food to the children.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We give food to the children.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We give food to the children.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We try to do it.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We give food to the children.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> On the weekend,</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> the parents will have grandchildren visiting all of them,</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> coming to one house.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an opportunity for all the brothers.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone gets married and they&#039;ve got their own houses.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They try to get together at one weekend to the parents&#039; house.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The children go there.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They go to the houses.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Even our children have been to Pakistan and they loved it there.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Even Zinia says to me,</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> why did you marry my dad?</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, sorry, it&#039;s too late now.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> 40 years ago.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just going to change the memory card on here.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;ve just got one more section.</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ll just bring that card in here now.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I have one more question.</div><div id="00:19:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just thinking about, as you mentioned,</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> you took your children to Pakistan as well.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Why was that important for them to be able to see home?</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> They asked you about your children.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they wanted to go.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did they want to go and see that our parents are there?</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> All the parents are there.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They want to see their home.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got their own houses.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Their dad passed away in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But even before that, they wanted to go and see their aunties and uncles,</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> which is mom&#039;s brother and sister.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Not all of them are in the UK.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s good for them to go and see their aunties, uncles, cousins, extended families,</div><div id="00:20:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and even the grave of grandparents.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And our dad is buried there as well.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they want to kind of connect to the roots as well.</div><div id="00:20:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They go to the village.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They want to see.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They pick up the animals there.</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very relaxing.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, when they do the cane, sugar cane,</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> they really love it.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like how the parents or grandparents have lived here.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice for them to know.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes the media doesn&#039;t kind of help.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is great, actually.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good break for them to go.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t go because they can&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s true, actually.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The people like, you know, they don&#039;t go to the village.</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s true, actually.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The people who are enjoying their life are in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> People sometimes say to me, go back.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my in-laws were here anyway, so I couldn&#039;t go back.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> If they had any house, I...</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to my daughter, what do we do?</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Do we sell probably somewhere, a stall, actually, in the middle of somewhere?</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody will give me a job.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the way they craft, you know.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I know there are NGOs and all that, but it&#039;s just hard.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, one thing I could say is I like, which I did not say,</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> there is the things we should follow, you know,</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> having like Christian, Muslims, respecting each other,</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> systems, you know, like with the benefit system.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It looks like they&#039;ve taken it from Christianity and Muslims,</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> that we were supposed to give the charity on our wealth and our belongings,</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and that money should be used for poor people, widows and all that.</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then also, you know, like how we stand in the queue,</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t corrupt, actually.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t give someone...</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The bills, yeah, it starts to build.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So these are the things that other countries, like my country,</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> like if you say Pakistan, has, if I&#039;m honest, actually,</div><div id="00:22:38.000" class="transcript_line"> the worst and the corrupt government in the past.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is where the poor is getting much poorer</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and rich is, it doesn&#039;t matter to them.</div><div id="00:22:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it&#039;s a great opportunity to build communities</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and for us to maintain like connections.</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And you mentioned earlier on about, yeah, one, definitely,</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> roots and stories and networks and communities.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So how, yeah, just to bring it in, how is Age Alive?</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you end up being involved in Age Alive?</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like stay within the four walls.</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not easy, especially as...</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She said she tries to keep herself alive,</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> despite she&#039;s got the condition.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Just to, but she said coming out to the group,</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> it does help us to share.</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s like it&#039;s their time, two, three hours,</div><div id="00:24:06.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s her time for herself being with the

class="transcript_line"> how many things you went to and how you felt good there?</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came there, I was there.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> When you go to St Mary&#039;s, what do you like there?</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The exercise, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no exercise here.</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of talking, and everyone was sitting in their bags.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s just sharing, sharing time, good time</div><div id="00:24:49.000" class="transcript_line"> with other people.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the word.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> A cup of tea, a cup of tea, top of a tea, and yeah, it&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice to gather, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think she likes that, so you&#039;re not on your own.</div><div id="00:25:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So coming to people and different local languages</div><div id="00:25:06.000" class="transcript_line"> is respecting each other and feel part of the group.</div><div id="00:25:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And why is that important for black, Asian, or ethnic groups</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> over 50, why is that?</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is it important for us to go out and go to groups</div><div id="00:25:22.000" class="transcript_line"> or go somewhere where we can be respected and welcomed?</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is it important?</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important because you think about it.</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re upset at home, you&#039;re isolated, you&#039;re lonely.</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the reason.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So it helps to deal with the isolation and loneliness.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> She said she does come to, she&#039;s only been for a couple of weeks ago,</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> but she did say that she&#039;s got children who are obviously grown up,</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> so she goes one day for one son, and then she&#039;ll go probably stay with,</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> which is like a family, but it&#039;s nice to be part of the group</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> and of the same kind of ages.</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s different, you know, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to be</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> in a group for a long time, but you&#039;re going to be in a group</div><div id="00:26:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and you don&#039;t feel like someone will say something to you</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ll be in different cultures.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that way?</div><div id="00:26:21.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t feel like that.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No, you&#039;re not in a group, right?</div><div id="00:26:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:26:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I think she feels comfortable that nobody will say anything</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> because of her color or because of how she dressed up</div><div id="00:26:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and what her background belief and you know, all that.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So she feels that because we are all different, but we are all human,</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> she feels that she doesn&#039;t have to experience any kind of,</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> generally she hasn&#039;t experienced much of racism,</div><div id="00:26:49.000" class="transcript_line"> but still being with the group, people from the levels,</div><div id="00:26:52.000" class="transcript_line"> we understand each other better and sharing things.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And speaking of sharing, is there any family heirlooms</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> or photographs or ornaments that you have kept as well?</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any family heirlooms that you can share with us</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> or have kept in your own hands?</div><div id="00:27:21.000"
