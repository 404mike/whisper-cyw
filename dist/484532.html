How did you go about it?</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes. What made you so successful as a carnival photographer?</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, what you have to remember is that in the days that I was doing the photography, I was doing it on film, which meant you had 36 frames per film.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the shot ratio that is good ones to bad ones ought to be really good.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, you&#039;re just wasting your time and your money.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So in these days with digital photography, of course, you can just delete and you don&#039;t lose the cash.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But what it made me do is be extremely cautious.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I could get a high hit ratio, good shots to bad shots, then it was an improvement.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And what I used to do, what I realized was that in order to get good pictures, you had to develop a relationship with the person being photographed instantly.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, obviously not absolutely instantly, but very quickly.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So as you moved around the carnival procession itself, you would develop an empathy, a sort of a relationship with the people you&#039;re taking photographs of.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And if they had a good relationship with you, you got a good photograph.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to frame it. That was it then.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that makes total sense.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And clearly as a as a formula, it worked because I say some of your images have been amazing.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But you supported Swicker and Cardiff Carnival in many different ways.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Like all volunteer groups, you know, were constituted and there were staff and there were project workers.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But behind the scenes, there&#039;s a vitally important level of management and governance.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The Board of Management and you&#039;ve been on Swicker Carnival&#039;s Board of Management for a long time.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And indeed, what you get to do before we talk about that in particular, perhaps you, you know, for the record, care to list the other arts organizations that you&#039;ve been able to to help in this way.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because this kind of help is invaluable and really does help organizations to to thrive.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well, Steve and I first met when I was introduced to the Board of Management of Cardiff Laboratory Theatre back in the 80s.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure exactly when.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And since then, I&#039;ve been become involved not only with Swicker, but with also with photo gallery and more recently, Lanova Hall Trust.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And as it happens, the Steiner School in North Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, I do these things. I&#039;m able to do things partly because I retired a long time ago and I have the time to do it.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But also, as many prospective retirees often feel, they&#039;re not sure what they&#039;re going to do in their lives after they stop working.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, what I&#039;ve discovered is you don&#039;t stop working.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing. You have more drama, if you like, in your life after you retire.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Calls on your time.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And calls, yes, but what you need. You really need it.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So from my point of view, I need Swicker as much as Swicker needs me because I need the the fascination of being involved.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s for other people to learn from, I guess.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So, but what I also would like to say is that my previous experience as before I retired was with the Civil Service working for the Welsh office over several decades.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> During which time I learned how to deal with problems or analyze them and articulate responses and and devise ways of solutions if we need them.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And which I found very useful when it comes to voluntary work with other organizations.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So much so that I find that that advantage I have of being an ex civil servant is very superior quality to many people because they haven&#039;t had that earlier experience.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very grateful to say that Swicker Carnival owes much to its board members past, present and future.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, for the record, I&#039;d like to thank them all unilaterally, but specifically since we&#039;re talking to Griff Taylor in particular.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Griff was on board in the very early days of Swicker and Cardiff Carnival&#039;s had many different formats, different parade routes, different outcomes.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You were there at what some people see the hailstene days as the mid 90s, when things really began to take off for the carnival.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The carnival camp would have been at Cattays Community Center, and we would have finished on the steps of the National Museum of Wales.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, give us some insight into what was it like from your perspective then? What was it like walking into Cattays Community Center?</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was one of the best experiences of all really because I think the carnival is not just the walking around part of the procession.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the process of making, which is for many of us and including me, one of the better parts of it.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The painting, the making of costumes and the learning the dance techniques, steps.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> All of that is part of the process, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I recall going into Cattays Community Center when it would be packed, hardly room for another elbow with people painting faces and learning to do things and samba practices and so on.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was vital. It was just wonderful.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t say more than that really.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> How about the end product having paraded through what was then the Civic Center?</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you recall the outcome, some of the finale type shows on the steps of the National Museum?</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> How were they in terms of spectacle?</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, as we spoke earlier, I was taking photographs often on that occasion.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d see the steps and see everything going on there.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it really was spectacular.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It was wonderful.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the, I do recall one of the problems which you had envisaged was getting rid of the crowds.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Once you stopped, what do you do?</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So that I do remember Kathy Weatherup, who may well be another one of the.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She has been interviewed. She&#039;s on the list.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s been interviewed.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Was able to get hold of the mic and explain to people how they should go home.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was starting to work. But she stood in there at a vital point.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s worth saying that those outcomes at the other steps of the National Museum of Wales would generate big family audiences who were entertained for,</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> well, perhaps for at least an hour afterwards, there would be choreographed songs and dances.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And indeed, the themed card of carnivals would have their their name picked out in fireworks on the portico above the National Museum of Wales.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Something that you&#039;d find hard to imagine happening now.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, once and quite rightly to make the building accessible, once those beautiful steps, which were like different landings or stages for us,</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> once, of course, they were broken up by, I think, four to six brass railings, then, of course, our stage disappeared.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The museum became more accessible.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, for one night of the year, we lost our stages, which is a shame.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yesterday, we heard from our principal funder, the Arts Council of Wales, that they intend that they will be withdrawing revenue funding.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s core support for the organisation from April onwards.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just wondering on an emotional level or whatever.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. What&#039;s your reaction to that?</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Or where are we in Wales now with public and community celebration?</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s your sort of snapshot view on that?</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Where are we going?</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Or where are we?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Where are we? Yes.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the future for coming together in large numbers and creating collectively?</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> If SWCCA is unable to fund itself, there won&#039;t be a carnival, which means there won&#039;t be a process and there won&#039;t be workshops prior to it.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The artists that were involved won&#039;t have an avenue to explore their talents, their artistic skills.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the people of the community won&#039;t have an opportunity to get involved in the dance, in the procession, in the making.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, as has happened in the past, there won&#039;t be an opportunity for people to discover their ability and their enjoyment, which can often become vocational.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know of dancers that have gone off to become professional dancers and artists that have become very successful professional artists.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> All of these things may die out. It will become more difficult at least.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s a crying shame to end on a somewhat downbeat note, but harsh realities often intervene, even in the wonderful world of SWCCA and carnival.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I just say for the record, Griff, it&#039;s been a pleasure talking.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, good.</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I sincerely hope all good things to you and many thanks indeed.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thank you.</div></div></p>
