    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hi, I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m in Holy Trinity Church, Flandernow, and I&#039;m speaking to people</div><div id="00:00:05.600" class="transcript_line"> during the longest yarn, and I&#039;m speaking to Sonia Bird. Sonia was born before the war and</div><div id="00:00:11.440" class="transcript_line"> she has some memories of the war and other memories of people that she knew during the war.</div><div id="00:00:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Sonia. So tell me a little bit about when you were born.</div><div id="00:00:20.160" class="transcript_line"> And I was born in 1941 in Staffordshire. I don&#039;t really have very memory and very real memories</div><div id="00:00:29.440" class="transcript_line"> of the actual war, except what my sister, who was six years old, told me. Apparently,</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> I spent a lot of the time doing, if there were any raids nearby, in a carricot underneath an oak table</div><div id="00:00:44.080" class="transcript_line"> down in the cellar of our house, which with hindsight you&#039;d think if we&#039;d been bombed,</div><div id="00:00:48.640" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d all have been buried, probably killed. I do vaguely remember playing in the snow in the garden</div><div id="00:00:55.040" class="transcript_line"> in the remains of an old Anderson shelter that my father and uncle had built for us.</div><div id="00:01:01.200" class="transcript_line"> And apparently we did actually spend a few hours there at times, but we felt safer in the house</div><div id="00:01:07.520" class="transcript_line"> down in the cellar. This is all being told to me by my sister. For what it&#039;s worth, I have an uncle,</div><div id="00:01:16.320" class="transcript_line"> had an uncle, who, to tell you a bit, my uncle. My mum told me about a time when</div><div id="00:01:24.080" class="transcript_line"> she remembered during the war when her brother, who was in the army as an engineer, he came home</div><div id="00:01:32.640" class="transcript_line"> and he used to give her sixpence to polish his boots. And apparently he didn&#039;t speak about the</div><div id="00:01:39.360" class="transcript_line"> war for years afterwards, but she gradually learned that he had been driving an ammunition lorry</div><div id="00:01:46.320" class="transcript_line"> to the front line and his friend, whom he&#039;d grown up with, gone through training college with,</div><div id="00:01:52.560" class="transcript_line"> was driving another one, more or less parallel to him. They came to a tree,</div><div id="00:01:57.280" class="transcript_line"> his uncle went one side and his friend went the other side and the friend hit a mine and exploded.</div><div id="00:02:03.200" class="transcript_line"> So that was what had upset him and he couldn&#039;t talk about it. It was just simply a</div><div id="00:02:08.240" class="transcript_line"> providence, a matter of luck, that he was the one that lived and the friend didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:13.280" class="transcript_line"> So when you hear about that, you know, it makes the head on the back of your neck stand up and</div><div id="00:02:18.400" class="transcript_line"> think how close the shape it was. His son was training as a glider pilot and he got his wings</div><div id="00:02:27.920" class="transcript_line"> or whatever the terminology was. The day before peace was declared, so he never actually had to</div><div id="00:02:35.920" class="transcript_line"> fly a glider to drop off people and other soldiers in France and then make his own way back,</div><div id="00:02:42.240" class="transcript_line"> which would have happened if it had been a few more days. My father wasn&#039;t called up because</div><div id="00:02:50.560" class="transcript_line"> at the time he was a sink man and he worked in a factory, still tube industries, I think it was</div><div id="00:02:58.400" class="transcript_line"> called, and they were making all the tubes that go in aeroplane engines, possibly spitfires.</div><div id="00:03:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And so his factory was always being searched for by the Nazi bombers, which worried my mother a lot.</div><div id="00:03:16.880" class="transcript_line"> She used to look over the fields towards where the factory was near Walsall and she saw this big glow</div><div id="00:03:25.760" class="transcript_line"> in the sky and she thought something dreadful has happened. She could tell it was a major fire.</div><div id="00:03:33.360" class="transcript_line"> It transpired that it was the date Coventry Cathedral was bombed. I have seen that since</div><div id="00:03:39.920" class="transcript_line"> and what a marvelous job it&#039;s been made of to rebuild it. My father didn&#039;t survive the war,</div><div id="00:03:49.600" class="transcript_line"> but he was a sick man and he died when he was only 53. I&#039;m trying to think of some more.</div><div id="00:03:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of anything else.</div><div id="00:04:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much Sonia. I think those are really wonderful memories. Thank you.</div></div></p>
