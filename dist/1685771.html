Most of them were Greek.</div><div id="00:04:44.200" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve got...</div><div id="00:04:45.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:04:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so we&#039;ve got plenty.</div><div id="00:04:49.200" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve seen something like that.</div><div id="00:04:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I gave it to him.</div><div id="00:04:53.200" class="transcript_line"> And all this was found in a skip.</div><div id="00:04:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, would you mind if at some point,</div><div id="00:04:58.200" class="transcript_line"> if we got to bring it, probably have a real free...</div><div id="00:05:01.200" class="transcript_line"> No, no, take it, you&#039;re welcome to.</div><div id="00:05:03.200" class="transcript_line"> So, especially even more than the one in the Hellenic.</div><div id="00:05:06.200" class="transcript_line"> So you see the name there?</div><div id="00:05:08.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:05:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Emdriolis, is it?</div><div id="00:05:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they were...</div><div id="00:05:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, since the month of the Hellenic Emdriolos.</div><div id="00:05:14.200" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re trying to, you know, very...</div><div id="00:05:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were all...</div><div id="00:05:17.200" class="transcript_line"> The Greeks had a lot to do with the docks.</div><div id="00:05:19.200" class="transcript_line"> At one stage, during the war, and just up until the 60s,</div><div id="00:05:24.200" class="transcript_line"> the shipping merchants who were selling supplies to the ships were Greek,</div><div id="00:05:30.200" class="transcript_line"> or Greek Syrians.</div><div id="00:05:32.200" class="transcript_line"> That was just someone walking past a skip.</div><div id="00:05:38.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen them pass the guidance, and it all took it with Florida Way,</div><div id="00:05:42.200" class="transcript_line"> and inside was hundreds of original invoices.</div><div id="00:05:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve still got a lot left.</div><div id="00:05:47.200" class="transcript_line"> And while I&#039;m going to do that, I&#039;m going to get a bit of time,</div><div id="00:05:50.200" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ll give them to the British Maritime Museum.</div><div id="00:05:53.200" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s something that&#039;s been going on free-war and after-war,</div><div id="00:05:56.200" class="transcript_line"> and you can see the difference in what I&#039;ve looked through them.</div><div id="00:05:59.200" class="transcript_line"> You can see the difference in what people were buying the ships from,</div><div id="00:06:02.200" class="transcript_line"> what we were coming in then, it was quiet.</div><div id="00:06:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can see the different phases.</div><div id="00:06:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:08.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very interesting.</div><div id="00:06:11.200" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s why he&#039;s back.</div><div id="00:06:13.200" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s in Greece now, but when he comes back in September,</div><div id="00:06:16.200" class="transcript_line"> he might want to take a look at these.</div><div id="00:06:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Which brings me to the next question, because I was going to ask,</div><div id="00:06:21.200" class="transcript_line"> do you have any photos of that time when you were little,</div><div id="00:06:26.200" class="transcript_line"> or maybe from your parents&#039; time?</div><div id="00:06:30.200" class="transcript_line"> I must have, at my mother&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:06:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:33.200" class="transcript_line"> To get her to take some embarrassing photographs.</div><div id="00:06:35.200" class="transcript_line"> No, you don&#039;t have to.</div><div id="00:06:37.200" class="transcript_line"> No, I will, I&#039;ll take some out.</div><div id="00:06:39.200" class="transcript_line"> We got some.</div><div id="00:06:40.200" class="transcript_line"> We got some in the 70s when we were at the house, we were in Runny.</div><div id="00:06:44.200" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got loads of them.</div><div id="00:06:46.200" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re just wondering, we want to see if we can find anything</div><div id="00:06:49.200" class="transcript_line"> to show what life was at that time, or around that time.</div><div id="00:06:53.200" class="transcript_line"> Any names that come to mind of other professions</div><div id="00:06:58.200" class="transcript_line"> that the Greeks were doing at that time?</div><div id="00:07:00.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Mike Atopaldi, who was one of the best panel beater sprayers here.</div><div id="00:07:07.200" class="transcript_line"> He was the best, he had to be the best.</div><div id="00:07:10.200" class="transcript_line"> He taught everyone here how to be a professional paint sprayer</div><div id="00:07:13.200" class="transcript_line"> and paint coach builder, they called it then.</div><div id="00:07:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Jimmy Exeteris, who&#039;s dead now sadly.</div><div id="00:07:19.200" class="transcript_line"> Again, that was another place, he had an S&amp;E Motors,</div><div id="00:07:24.200" class="transcript_line"> which was in Coltsdale Avenue, industrial estate, with his houses in now.</div><div id="00:07:29.200" class="transcript_line"> He got taught from Mike Atopaldi, he was a friend of my father&#039;s,</div><div id="00:07:35.200" class="transcript_line"> and I remember going in as a kid, my father hardly spoke English anyway,</div><div id="00:07:41.200" class="transcript_line"> so he was just mixed with the Greeks, it was just easier.</div><div id="00:07:45.200" class="transcript_line"> It was just easier, I don&#039;t know why, but Jimmy, Jimmy Exeteris,</div><div id="00:07:49.200" class="transcript_line"> his brother, of course, they had a little Greek cafe in Salisbury Road.</div><div id="00:07:58.200" class="transcript_line"> And it was plenty of Greeks.</div><div id="00:08:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;re looking at any kind, some people have told us about the shop owners,</div><div id="00:08:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Propertis, Spiro the boy now, his son, he&#039;s my age,</div><div id="00:08:16.200" class="transcript_line"> he runs the Fintans chip shops, well that started by,</div><div id="00:08:20.200" class="transcript_line"> it was all top, I think they were called Top Gun, the chip shops first,</div><div id="00:08:25.200" class="transcript_line"> actually the one in Wychurch, which was the original chip shop,</div><div id="00:08:29.200" class="transcript_line"> still got that name, the rest are Fintans now, and he&#039;s grown it,</div><div id="00:08:33.200" class="transcript_line"> and they have their convenience stores in, I think it was Heath Road.</div><div id="00:08:37.200" class="transcript_line"> So chip shops were all Greek or Italian when I was a kid?</div><div id="00:08:41.200" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:08:42.200" class="transcript_line"> All the shops were, if you want fish and chips, it was either Greek or Italian,</div><div id="00:08:49.200" class="transcript_line"> there was no, I mean City Road, Woodville Road, Cruz Road, it was all Greek.</div><div id="00:08:58.200" class="transcript_line"> It was all Greek, like it&#039;s turning back now all Greek.</div><div id="00:09:02.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it does, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:05.200" class="transcript_line"> The Athenian nightclub, it was a nightclub,</div><div id="00:09:08.200" class="transcript_line"> we were at Leipzig in the 80s, late 70s and 80s, and you know Ollie, Ollie Bus,</div><div id="00:09:18.200" class="transcript_line"> he was a partner there, so you need to ask him about that.</div><div id="00:09:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so I hadn&#039;t realised that he&#039;s been here for so long.</div><div id="00:09:26.200" class="transcript_line"> Ollie was best friends with my uncle, my mother&#039;s brother who sadly passed away</div><div id="00:09:32.200" class="transcript_line"> about eight years ago, they were like that, like a married couple,</div><div id="00:09:37.200" class="transcript_line"> but they were a married couple, they were very good friends,</div><div id="00:09:41.200" class="transcript_line"> they had businesses together, so Ollie couldn&#039;t feel you in the morning.</div><div id="00:09:45.200" class="transcript_line"> Ah, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:09:46.200" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;ll give you some really better mornings, and I know he&#039;s older than me.</div><div id="00:09:50.200" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s okay, we&#039;re just trying to start, looking for something to start with.</div><div id="00:09:54.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very good, because I was going to ask if you have anyone else that you think could,</div><div id="00:09:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if your parents are...</div><div id="00:10:01.200" class="transcript_line"> My parents, my mother probably do it, you&#039;d have to go and see her,</div><div id="00:10:03.200" class="transcript_line"> because she&#039;s old now, she&#039;s 80, and she&#039;s broke her hip,</div><div id="00:10:07.200" class="transcript_line"> so if you have, you could go up and see her, I&#039;ll speak to her.</div><div id="00:10:12.200" class="transcript_line"> If you wouldn&#039;t mind asking, I mean at the moment, if she&#039;s worried about me,</div><div id="00:10:16.200" class="transcript_line"> we can leave it until later.</div><div id="00:10:18.200" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s been in all through it, we didn&#039;t let him out, we locked him in, me and my brothers.</div><div id="00:10:24.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got two brothers, Christopher and Spero, older than me,</div><div id="00:10:28.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the youngest out of the three.</div><div id="00:10:30.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:10:31.200" class="transcript_line"> One&#039;s an engineer, and the other one had a barring call from until recently.</div><div id="00:10:37.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, right. Yeah, basically that&#039;s all, just asking for general information.</div><div id="00:10:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll let my mother know, she&#039;ll be happy for you to go up there.</div><div id="00:10:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:10:49.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m afraid you were food, but she&#039;ll be happy.</div><div id="00:10:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we wouldn&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:10:53.200" class="transcript_line"> She could really tell you more.</div><div id="00:10:55.200" class="transcript_line"> My father had a business when we were young.</div><div id="00:11:00.200" class="transcript_line"> He had a business, first of all, with my uncle, who sadly passed away at the time,</div><div id="00:11:04.200" class="transcript_line"> selling fish to all chip shops, mainly all Greek and Italian.</div><div id="00:11:08.200" class="transcript_line"> So he was a provider.</div><div id="00:11:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then when that, because we used to go up with him,</div><div id="00:11:12.200" class="transcript_line"> like 50 miles an hour to Grimsby, which is like eight hours away,</div><div id="00:11:18.200" class="transcript_line"> when you drive 50 miles an hour in an old shaky truck.</div><div id="00:11:21.200" class="transcript_line"> And then when my uncle died, he started doing the pita bread,</div><div id="00:11:24.200" class="transcript_line"> but obviously wasn&#039;t the pita square,</div><div id="00:11:26.200" class="transcript_line"> but the pita bread you buy in test schools,</div><div id="00:11:30.200" class="transcript_line"> the kebab houses, you know what Simo does?</div><div id="00:11:34.200" class="transcript_line"> My father did that, mobile.</div><div id="00:11:36.200" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d done that for years.</div><div id="00:11:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so you didn&#039;t have a shop where people would go?</div><div id="00:11:40.200" class="transcript_line"> No, no, he extended the house, and the house was full of freezers,</div><div id="00:11:44.200" class="transcript_line"> you know, for all the stock, AES, anything Greek, Latvia.</div><div id="00:11:48.200" class="transcript_line"> So you basically worked for him.</div><div id="00:11:50.200" class="transcript_line"> I worked for him, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:51.200" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to go, you know, you can work for your parents,</div><div id="00:11:54.200" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very hard.</div><div id="00:11:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:56.200" class="transcript_line"> And I never went to, you know, my brothers did.</div><div id="00:12:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted to escape.</div><div id="00:12:03.200" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to go to Greece as soon as I was old enough,</div><div id="00:12:05.200" class="transcript_line"> because we spent every, you know, we spent two months a year,</div><div id="00:12:08.200" class="transcript_line"> from as far as I remember, we always went to Athens.</div><div id="00:12:12.200" class="transcript_line"> So then when I was 17, I left, and I didn&#039;t come back until I was 25.</div><div id="00:12:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:12:19.200" class="transcript_line"> So I went DJing all around Europe, a lot of Greek islands.</div><div id="00:12:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Then my father then decided it was a good idea to open a nightclub</div><div id="00:12:27.200" class="transcript_line"> in Sanderini in 1988, I think it was.</div><div id="00:12:33.200" class="transcript_line"> I was about 19, 20 then.</div><div id="00:12:36.200" class="transcript_line"> After the year, I just said, again, you can work for your father,</div><div id="00:12:39.200" class="transcript_line"> especially not in a nightclub.</div><div id="00:12:41.200" class="transcript_line"> So I left and went to Corfu, and worked there for two seasons.</div><div id="00:12:45.200" class="transcript_line"> And then I went to Athens and worked in a club called the Hamam,</div><div id="00:12:50.200" class="transcript_line"> which was owned by a good friend of my father&#039;s, whose father was Turkish,</div><div id="00:12:55.200" class="transcript_line"> but was born here, and his mother was Greek, Paraskevas.</div><div id="00:12:59.200" class="transcript_line"> And now he&#039;s got a beautiful, one of the best seafood restaurants</div><div id="00:13:03.200" class="transcript_line"> in Sanderini, because his wife was from there.</div><div id="00:13:06.200" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so then I did that, and then I went to Italy in the winter, in Milan.</div><div id="00:13:13.200" class="transcript_line"> DJ there, then I go back to work, I worked in Crete.</div><div id="00:13:17.200" class="transcript_line"> How come you came back?</div><div id="00:13:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, I came back then, you know, it was time.</div><div id="00:13:20.200" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the family&#039;s here.</div><div id="00:13:21.200" class="transcript_line"> 24, 25.</div><div id="00:13:23.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s old for the DJ then, you know, you&#039;ve got a little,</div><div id="00:13:26.200" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like a footballer, you&#039;ve got a 10-year span.</div><div id="00:13:30.200" class="transcript_line"> I made some good money out of it, I came back, I left the garage,</div><div id="00:13:34.200" class="transcript_line"> which I&#039;ve still got.</div><div id="00:13:35.200" class="transcript_line"> And then, fortunately, I got involved with my friends,</div><div id="00:13:39.200" class="transcript_line"> and opened a restaurant.</div><div id="00:13:41.200" class="transcript_line"> We opened it in late November, and it went really well,</div><div id="00:13:45.200" class="transcript_line"> and then the story goes, everyone knows what the story is.</div><div id="00:13:48.200" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:13:50.200" class="transcript_line"> It was a hard year anyway, but you tried it.</div><div id="00:13:53.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we tried it, and we&#039;re still going.</div><div id="00:13:56.200" class="transcript_line"> Just about.</div><div id="00:13:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thank you very much for that.</div><div id="00:14:00.200" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div><div id="00:14:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
