    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Our next protocol is the stall. Once a man was lucky enough and he had trained, he would</div><div id="00:00:08.280" class="transcript_line"> have a stall of his own. The stall was part of what they called pillar and stall. The</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> man would take coal from the stall but leave a pillar. Usually a man&#039;s stall would be up</div><div id="00:00:20.680" class="transcript_line"> to 10 metres wide and the man would work that on his own or with a butty and get coal. When</div><div id="00:00:30.760" class="transcript_line"> the collier had got four foot of coal, that is four foot in by ten foot wide by four foot</div><div id="00:00:39.960" class="transcript_line"> high, he would then stop because he would have to support the area. Now he worked possibly four foot</div><div id="00:00:47.240" class="transcript_line"> of coal but he needed seven foot of room in his roadway so that the horse could get in with a</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> drum to take away his coal. So his next move would be to drill and fire the top and you see in front</div><div id="00:01:00.240" class="transcript_line"> of you a hole in the top where the guy has made a start. You would drill a series of holes, you</div><div id="00:01:08.600" class="transcript_line"> would then fire it down to the floor and the stones then would be packed as you see them to the left</div><div id="00:01:14.960" class="transcript_line"> and right to support the roof in the waste area. Depending on how much coal he got would</div><div id="00:01:23.440" class="transcript_line"> decide his wages. The man would only be paid for the coal that he cut and he would only be paid</div><div id="00:01:28.920" class="transcript_line"> for the large coal that he cut. Small coal didn&#039;t count, small coal was shoved into the gob or the</div><div id="00:01:34.600" class="transcript_line"> waste area and he was only paid for the large. He was also expected to erect his own supports,</div><div id="00:01:42.240" class="transcript_line"> he would be expected to lay his own rails.</div></div></p>
