    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I know who you are. Yes. But for the sake of record, can you tell me what is your name</div><div id="00:00:07.600" class="transcript_line"> and where were you born? Right, my name is Bhuanesh Napao and I was born in the lovely</div><div id="00:00:14.680" class="transcript_line"> island of Mauritius. What part of Mauritius? I was born in a town called Florial and Florial</div><div id="00:00:24.760" class="transcript_line"> is one of the rainiest part of Mauritius. Mauritius is a volcanic island so where we</div><div id="00:00:32.600" class="transcript_line"> live in Florial there&#039;s a tourist destination where you can actually see a volcanic hole.</div><div id="00:00:40.760" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about growing up in Florial. Is that how you pronounce it? Florial. It&#039;s like</div><div id="00:00:46.600" class="transcript_line"> butter but it&#039;s not. Oh yes it is isn&#039;t it? I never thought of that. So what was it like?</div><div id="00:00:52.840" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember? When I ask these questions feel free to give as much or as little detail</div><div id="00:00:57.320" class="transcript_line"> as you want. It&#039;s up to you and the purpose of those questions is just to help us try and</div><div id="00:01:02.760" class="transcript_line"> recollect things. We probably don&#039;t talk about much anymore. So yeah what was it like growing</div><div id="00:01:07.400" class="transcript_line"> up in Florial for you? For me it was a lovely experience, probably my best experience really.</div><div id="00:01:14.120" class="transcript_line"> I grew up with my grandparents in sugar cane fields and there were cows, there was chickens,</div><div id="00:01:21.240" class="transcript_line"> there was hens and then obviously having to come to London with all its buildings was a bit of a</div><div id="00:01:26.920" class="transcript_line"> shock. But growing up in Mauritius I really liked it. I remember my grandparents, it was like a barn</div><div id="00:01:35.480" class="transcript_line"> it seemed like from childhood because I came to this country when I was seven,</div><div id="00:01:40.120" class="transcript_line"> like the cows were behind us and we were sort of like sleeping like in a barn house. It had beds</div><div id="00:01:45.880" class="transcript_line"> in there so I really liked the smell of the cows and the cow dung because that&#039;s what I grew up with</div><div id="00:01:51.880" class="transcript_line"> so that was really nice. The reason why my grandparents looked after me because I had</div><div id="00:02:00.040" class="transcript_line"> one older brother and two older sister and one younger than me. So they came to this country</div><div id="00:02:07.640" class="transcript_line"> obviously to make a better living. I think I was about two when I was left with my grandparents</div><div id="00:02:14.360" class="transcript_line"> so they brought my brother over first, then my two sisters so we stayed with my</div><div id="00:02:21.720" class="transcript_line"> grandparents. But I just remember you know how free it was, having my little dress and running</div><div id="00:02:29.080" class="transcript_line"> barefooted you know and having all the nature, coconut and mango trees and all these lovely</div><div id="00:02:37.960" class="transcript_line"> things around you in the sea and seeing my grandad cutting down sugarcane, that was nice</div><div id="00:02:44.520" class="transcript_line"> and obviously eating the sugarcane, I loved it. Going to sugarcane factory and getting you know</div><div id="00:02:50.360" class="transcript_line"> everything was about sugarcane. So that was really nice and I remember my grandmother,</div><div id="00:02:57.480" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s the one that tended the cows so she would be milking the cows and would be drinking fresh</div><div id="00:03:04.600" class="transcript_line"> milk. When you come to this country and you drink the milk you think what am I drinking?</div><div id="00:03:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Because the milk was so fresh so we&#039;d have cow&#039;s curd milk, cheese you know and I remember she</div><div id="00:03:20.760" class="transcript_line"> used to walk the cows probably maybe to sell the milk or maybe sell the cow, I don&#039;t know where it</div><div id="00:03:26.600" class="transcript_line"> was but yeah that was nice just you know having my grandad sort of picking us up and giving us</div><div id="00:03:35.160" class="transcript_line"> milk and fresh eggs, fresh vegetables that were grown so yeah so I really miss all that.</div><div id="00:03:44.760" class="transcript_line"> So what age did you leave? So I came here, I should leave at the age of seven</div><div id="00:03:52.040" class="transcript_line"> and I remember you know everybody coming, they did show us pictures of my parents,</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> said this is your mom, this is your dad, you&#039;re going to go to London and I remember on the day</div><div id="00:04:03.960" class="transcript_line"> we were leaving I said I don&#039;t want to go and I ran into the sugarcane fields and they had to come</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> looking for me. I thought well where am I going, why are they taking me away from this place or the</div><div id="00:04:15.320" class="transcript_line"> people I love you know. Yeah and then when I did leave my parents came to meet us and I remember</div><div id="00:04:26.040" class="transcript_line"> you know she gave this apple and the apple looked huge and I thought I&#039;ve never seen a huge apple,</div><div id="00:04:31.320" class="transcript_line"> like it was a big red apple and we were eating it on the coach and I was looking out of the window</div><div id="00:04:38.040" class="transcript_line"> and the sky was grey, the building was grey, I couldn&#039;t see any palm trees, I couldn&#039;t see any</div><div id="00:04:45.560" class="transcript_line"> greenery so it was a bit of a shock for me but then when I did go to my parents house they</div><div id="00:04:52.120" class="transcript_line"> lived behind them, it wasn&#039;t like a railway station like the, I felt like the railway children</div><div id="00:04:58.520" class="transcript_line"> because they always had the train running across and we used to wave at the people but that&#039;s a,</div><div id="00:05:04.520" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s no longer a railway, it&#039;s now become like a nature reserve so it was nice to see some trees</div><div id="00:05:11.480" class="transcript_line"> at the back of the house so that was nice. So what do you remember of your childhood that</div><div id="00:05:18.920" class="transcript_line"> became a fond deep memory for you, how did you play, you know what things do you</div><div id="00:05:27.320" class="transcript_line"> talk about in terms of your childhood still to today? I think I always go back to Mauritius</div><div id="00:05:32.520" class="transcript_line"> actually because those were the fondest of my memories, like you know writing on slate</div><div id="00:05:40.360" class="transcript_line"> with in our pen and paper so my grandad had a shop as well so we wrote on slate in school and</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember sitting in school and outside were banana trees and if I&#039;d got bored I&#039;d look out</div><div id="00:05:56.760" class="transcript_line"> and I remember one day it was really raining and I&#039;m watching monkeys eating bananas, you know</div><div id="00:06:03.080" class="transcript_line"> I think nature is really fun for me, this is why what I do today is try and get people into nature</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> for them to promote their mental health and their well-being because I grew up in nature</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and I miss that and that&#039;s what I always strive to look for but in coming to London you know</div><div id="00:06:24.040" class="transcript_line"> that was nice as well because I was reunited with the family, I was with my mom, I was with my dad</div><div id="00:06:29.400" class="transcript_line"> getting to know them and you know he was quite strict so from my grandparents is very fond and</div><div id="00:06:36.840" class="transcript_line"> loving and that freedom and then suddenly you can&#039;t run around the house, the ceiling is going to</div><div id="00:06:41.960" class="transcript_line"> fall down you know all that sort of thing we&#039;re jumping on the bed you can&#039;t jump on the bed</div><div id="00:06:46.920" class="transcript_line"> you know and it was because we were on a high rise and one day the ceiling did fall</div><div id="00:06:52.680" class="transcript_line"> you know because the way the houses are built so it&#039;s always sort of like</div><div id="00:06:57.640" class="transcript_line"> you know thinking something&#039;s going to break or whatever</div><div id="00:07:01.080" class="transcript_line"> so yeah it was nice we used to sort of play rounders in the garden</div><div id="00:07:08.600" class="transcript_line"> so this is in the UK yeah so you had a garden yeah we had a garden</div><div id="00:07:13.560" class="transcript_line"> that was nice and again have to be careful when we&#039;re playing rounders and things you know</div><div id="00:07:19.240" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d be told oh you&#039;ve stepped on the flowers you stepped on this thing your ball&#039;s gone on the</div><div id="00:07:24.840" class="transcript_line"> vegetables or as in Mauritius you know we didn&#039;t have that we just sort of like just run freely</div><div id="00:07:33.320" class="transcript_line"> so do you have family traditions or celebrations that you continued at the young age yeah</div><div id="00:07:42.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah I remember Diwali because Diwali is like Christmas everything&#039;s lit up everybody put</div><div id="00:07:47.080" class="transcript_line"> lights we have these diva lamps that we just made out of clay pots and everybody puts that</div><div id="00:07:53.800" class="transcript_line"> outside their doorstep and rows and rows of them and I remember having another culture shop</div><div id="00:08:00.600" class="transcript_line"> when it was Diwali in London I was looking out the window like a little lost child and I was</div><div id="00:08:05.800" class="transcript_line"> thinking why is it so dark where&#039;s all the diva lamps where is it and it&#039;s only that I&#039;m slowly</div><div id="00:08:13.640" class="transcript_line"> accustomed to the culture and thinking oh they don&#039;t do it here so you do you know we do we do</div><div id="00:08:19.320" class="transcript_line"> have all these culture which isn&#039;t the same when you come to London so you&#039;re always trying to</div><div id="00:08:23.960" class="transcript_line"> gravitate towards cultural groups or go into a temple or a religious place where you can meet</div><div id="00:08:32.120" class="transcript_line"> other people of your own background so what how old were you when you arrived in London I was seven</div><div id="00:08:40.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah so it was a bit of a shock to see them seven is a unique age because the sevens like that</div><div id="00:08:45.080" class="transcript_line"> we are not really a teenager yeah still a child you&#039;ve not formed all your friendships yet</div><div id="00:08:50.760" class="transcript_line"> yeah so you&#039;ve probably seemed a bit alien yeah yeah okay so could you tell me about maybe um</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> what the household was like as you grew up like you know you talked about the roof caving in</div><div id="00:09:01.080" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t have to go into that detail but I mean what was like yeah what was home like what was</div><div id="00:09:05.480" class="transcript_line"> living with family it was nice you know we had um always you know my mum would always cook meals</div><div id="00:09:13.400" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d all sit around the table we always looked forward to that</div><div id="00:09:17.720" class="transcript_line"> I always liked sitting next to my dad you know we had this bench so I&#039;d sit next to him but I</div><div id="00:09:24.760" class="transcript_line"> remember one day I didn&#039;t want to eat and he would say you&#039;ve got to eat you&#039;ve got to eat and he&#039;s</div><div id="00:09:29.400" class="transcript_line"> forcing you to eat and I sort of like think I really don&#039;t want to eat you know um so you know</div><div id="00:09:36.200" class="transcript_line"> they were very caring very loving they wanted the best for us um my mum she was a seamstress</div><div id="00:09:43.240" class="transcript_line"> she used to go to a greek factory and make dresses so that was nice because we always</div><div id="00:09:48.760" class="transcript_line"> had pretty dresses to wear so I like that my dad was a jeweler and we&#039;d watch him melt gold at home</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and we had a fireplace so that was really nice to be by the fire melt the gold and watch him make</div><div id="00:10:01.080" class="transcript_line"> the gold so while he was working at home he used to educate us he used to do our maths and our</div><div id="00:10:07.240" class="transcript_line"> english and um you know and he&#039;d get really strict if you didn&#039;t get it right and I used to</div><div id="00:10:13.480" class="transcript_line"> get scared then I think oh I don&#039;t like education because he&#039;s sort of um making us read making us</div><div id="00:10:20.600" class="transcript_line"> do our maths and sometimes if I didn&#039;t want to do the work he was giving us I&#039;d say oh the teachers</div><div id="00:10:26.840" class="transcript_line"> has given us homework I&#039;ve got homework to do um I didn&#039;t like it then but as I got older I really</div><div id="00:10:35.880" class="transcript_line"> appreciate what you&#039;ve done for us educating us so yeah I remember while he&#039;s doing setting the</div><div id="00:10:42.600" class="transcript_line"> stones in the in the rings had to stand there and read my books you know it was Peter and Jane then</div><div id="00:10:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Peter and Jane went down the slide Peter and Jane you know the ladybird books that we don&#039;t have</div><div id="00:10:56.200" class="transcript_line"> so much now yeah so we&#039;re talking a little bit about cultures let&#039;s talk a bit about kind of um</div><div id="00:11:05.880" class="transcript_line"> he talks about food briefly um what kind of food did you eat yeah we would eat Mauritian food it was</div><div id="00:11:11.320" class="transcript_line"> always um but the british version of the morisian food no it would be traditional morisian yeah we</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t it was only later on in the years when we had our children that my parents started cooking</div><div id="00:11:23.800" class="transcript_line"> things like macaroni cheese or more sort of mingled in british and morisian but when it was just us</div><div id="00:11:31.640" class="transcript_line"> it was just typical morisian food all the time maybe I can&#039;t remember if I had roasted now I</div><div id="00:11:36.040" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t know but it was always morisian food and I love my morisian food so one of the typical</div><div id="00:11:41.640" class="transcript_line"> things is rugai which is made of tomato tomato and chili and thyme and because Mauritius was</div><div id="00:11:49.320" class="transcript_line"> colonized by the french and the portuguese and the spanish our food isn&#039;t typically and because we</div><div id="00:11:55.880" class="transcript_line"> came from india so our food is a mix of this of the european mediterranean with the indian</div><div id="00:12:05.320" class="transcript_line"> so that was nice and yeah because thyme is not a very indian spice is it no but we use that in</div><div id="00:12:11.960" class="transcript_line"> most of our cooking that&#039;s interesting time you said tomatoes and chili I think you said thyme</div><div id="00:12:16.520" class="transcript_line"> yeah thyme we put in our yeah so we like to grow our thyme to put in the interesting yeah</div><div id="00:12:23.960" class="transcript_line"> uh what was some of the best moments from your childhood of being you know being let&#039;s say under</div><div id="00:12:28.840" class="transcript_line"> the age of 16 are there any kind of really important moments of your childhood that you</div><div id="00:12:33.400" class="transcript_line"> really appreciate about your love deeply sure I think just being as a family you know being</div><div id="00:12:38.760" class="transcript_line"> having my brothers and sisters and I think what I miss because once everybody leaves the home they</div><div id="00:12:44.280" class="transcript_line"> get married have their own life you always miss your your siblings you know you think oh everybody&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:50.840" class="transcript_line"> got their own life and you&#039;ve got more responsibilities and it was just nice to be</div><div id="00:12:56.600" class="transcript_line"> you know as a family unit everybody together and sometimes it&#039;s sort of like um tears family apart</div><div id="00:13:03.400" class="transcript_line"> as well like people get a bit of separation um you know there&#039;s a downside of me having coming</div><div id="00:13:11.240" class="transcript_line"> to here and most of my family leaving them in london um you know my parents not really you know</div><div id="00:13:18.040" class="transcript_line"> especially my mother she sort of like thinks oh she&#039;s gone to wales you know she doesn&#039;t help</div><div id="00:13:22.200" class="transcript_line"> so much now because I&#039;m you know I&#039;m not in london so there&#039;s this sort of a little bit of resentment</div><div id="00:13:27.560" class="transcript_line"> there that I came here and I was very close with my younger sister um and that sort of that</div><div id="00:13:34.760" class="transcript_line"> separation affected her so yeah but you know that I think that&#039;s what I miss you know that</div><div id="00:13:41.720" class="transcript_line"> the family being together we used to have laughs you know and now you sort of like children have</div><div id="00:13:48.760" class="transcript_line"> grown up and you&#039;re kind of on your own and it&#039;s just the family being together is really important</div><div id="00:13:55.160" class="transcript_line"> you know the laughter and the culture</div><div id="00:14:02.920" class="transcript_line"> um do you think there&#039;s anything that made your family do you believe or what do you believe</div><div id="00:14:08.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah makes your family unique what makes it unique yeah your family unique um</div><div id="00:14:16.920" class="transcript_line"> I suppose your culture isn&#039;t it what how you where you come from your culture</div><div id="00:14:24.360" class="transcript_line"> because marusia is quite a small place yeah I don&#039;t know a lot of marushias no</div><div id="00:14:29.240" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s not many here from marusias no I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever met a lot of marushias</div><div id="00:14:33.880" class="transcript_line"> no I think so may may is from marusias if you haven&#039;t you interviewed her yet yeah may she&#039;s</div><div id="00:14:39.080" class="transcript_line"> on the list oh she hasn&#039;t been interviewed I&#039;ve interviewed her but yeah yeah she&#039;s from marusias</div><div id="00:14:44.520" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s not many people here from marusias but when I go to london</div><div id="00:14:48.200" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s a new year celebration and you know like um it&#039;s down in a hall I think</div><div id="00:14:52.760" class="transcript_line"> but marusias is so small and there&#039;s all this marician here what&#039;s happened to marusias is</div><div id="00:14:58.360" class="transcript_line"> that they won&#039;t come here but here in wales there isn&#039;t many yeah and I think the music</div><div id="00:15:06.360" class="transcript_line"> you know the sega music we have in marusias which is um comes from africa so it&#039;s a lot of</div><div id="00:15:13.480" class="transcript_line"> african drum beats because how it originated was that oh we were brought over like slaves to</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> work in marusias from india to come and we were brought over by the british large</div><div id="00:15:28.920" class="transcript_line"> and I remember my my grandad you know saying how racist they were then you know even though</div><div id="00:15:35.320" class="transcript_line"> marusias was a lot of um indian people there um the british did try to use us like slaves</div><div id="00:15:42.680" class="transcript_line"> so um yeah there was that discrimination I&#039;ve lost my train of thought there you did ask</div><div id="00:15:48.360" class="transcript_line"> what makes you unique and you&#039;re talking about music yeah the music how it originally yeah it&#039;s</div><div id="00:15:52.840" class="transcript_line"> called sega so um it&#039;s kind of like african beat so because they came from different from this</div><div id="00:15:59.560" class="transcript_line"> country treated like slave the african people the black people the um I think they they&#039;re the one</div><div id="00:16:05.320" class="transcript_line"> that had african beats they drink their ramen coke and their whiskey by the beach because they</div><div id="00:16:10.760" class="transcript_line"> were you know had to work so hard then they&#039;d have their music they drink and they just made</div><div id="00:16:15.720" class="transcript_line"> music out of you know spoon and the drink bottles they were and just tackled to the beat and then</div><div id="00:16:21.640" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s how it developed so that that makes it unique because sega is quite a unique um kind of</div><div id="00:16:28.840" class="transcript_line"> dance which is sort of african and indian mix and that&#039;s really nice it&#039;s sort of quite mixed culture</div><div id="00:16:35.720" class="transcript_line"> I feel I&#039;m not to look into that yeah and that&#039;s and I think that&#039;s what makes marusian people</div><div id="00:16:41.240" class="transcript_line"> really unique because you&#039;ve got um catholics muslims and hindus which make up the majority</div><div id="00:16:48.680" class="transcript_line"> of which I am that was I was born into a hindu family but in marusias we all get on</div><div id="00:16:55.720" class="transcript_line"> you know they we all help each other you know there&#039;s just no barriers we respect each religion</div><div id="00:17:03.720" class="transcript_line"> if your neighbor is a muslim or catholic you share things um but when you come here that you can see</div><div id="00:17:10.840" class="transcript_line"> division you know like sometimes I sort of because I&#039;m quite proactive in the community</div><div id="00:17:16.120" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes I&#039;ve helped different groups set up um and there was one indian group that I helped</div><div id="00:17:21.720" class="transcript_line"> and they thought well I&#039;m a true indian you&#039;re marusian and there&#039;s still that even though you&#039;re</div><div id="00:17:27.160" class="transcript_line"> the same religion there&#039;s all there&#039;s some kind of divide which I didn&#039;t feel in marusias forms</div><div id="00:17:35.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah okay so your early experiences in the uk you know um</div><div id="00:17:43.800" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s move on to your early teens you know before your 20s what was life like going through school</div><div id="00:17:53.160" class="transcript_line"> educate formal education yeah how does that like in the uk yeah it was good my dad was always sort</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> of like pushing for education um I liked education and why I used to always cut me</div><div id="00:18:06.360" class="transcript_line"> in top of the class and people used to like sitting next to me and try copying my marks</div><div id="00:18:12.520" class="transcript_line"> so um that was nice but what shocked me although I was coming top um I think that the teachers or</div><div id="00:18:18.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody had to mark papers and then they said I wasn&#039;t good my marks went down and I thought</div><div id="00:18:24.840" class="transcript_line"> when I used to be taught I come so I don&#039;t know if it was discrimination in the school</div><div id="00:18:30.520" class="transcript_line"> um and then um I think 16 17 when we have to leave school um the I remember deputy head</div><div id="00:18:38.120" class="transcript_line"> teacher calling me and said oh you&#039;re not capable of doing a levels and I was so disheartened</div><div id="00:18:45.320" class="transcript_line"> thinking when I used to get taught I used to like my science I was really good with science</div><div id="00:18:49.960" class="transcript_line"> and it just sort of like put a downer on things and I think I think I was 16 or something I left</div><div id="00:18:55.320" class="transcript_line"> school and then my sister was saying um I said what shall I do all I know my dad does jewellery</div><div id="00:19:01.480" class="transcript_line"> maybe I should go and work as a jeweler with him you know you always do what your parents are doing</div><div id="00:19:06.200" class="transcript_line"> so I thought my dad&#039;s saying oh he says there&#039;s little jobs there and I don&#039;t know if I really</div><div id="00:19:10.920" class="transcript_line"> want to do that um and then my sister said look um just go to college go to college um higher</div><div id="00:19:20.600" class="transcript_line"> education and I went to do that um I did fail my English a couple of times coming from Mauritius</div><div id="00:19:30.280" class="transcript_line"> so my English I had to do quite a few times and I remember the last time um I was running in I</div><div id="00:19:37.320" class="transcript_line"> was really late to do my English exam and the door was just about to shut I said</div><div id="00:19:44.120" class="transcript_line"> I need to get in to do my exam and I went in she let open the door let me in sit late and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:19:49.640" class="transcript_line"> the one I passed the one that I&#039;d nearly shut the door off nearly shut the door off so I passed my</div><div id="00:19:56.600" class="transcript_line"> English um I wasn&#039;t very good at maths I think is the way my dad taught it as well I thought um</div><div id="00:20:04.120" class="transcript_line"> but I did go on to do get on to do my O levels so I got that then I got my A levels I thought oh</div><div id="00:20:10.520" class="transcript_line"> on was it up now teacher I did do my A levels and then I went on to do a degree so I did</div><div id="00:20:17.240" class="transcript_line"> sociology and psychology um I majored in psychology and I did humanities so I&#039;m always</div><div id="00:20:26.200" class="transcript_line"> for humanitarian causes so how about on the social side then growing up how was that like making</div><div id="00:20:32.760" class="transcript_line"> friends breaking friends you know I think it was really hard because my parents coming to this</div><div id="00:20:38.760" class="transcript_line"> country they didn&#039;t trust other people they didn&#039;t you know we were in this with people</div><div id="00:20:44.920" class="transcript_line"> with different culture they weren&#039;t they weren&#039;t the same as us so they didn&#039;t want us coming they</div><div id="00:20:50.200" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t want them to come to our house and we couldn&#039;t go to their house maybe if they were</div><div id="00:20:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Mauritian or Caribbean um they can Turkish we had Turkish Greek if they were of ethnic minority then</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> they felt a bit more um trustworthy towards them because we were going through the same course</div><div id="00:21:09.960" class="transcript_line"> so we weren&#039;t really allowed friends so it was it was quite lonely because who became my friends</div><div id="00:21:17.240" class="transcript_line"> with my brothers and sisters we became friends so if we went to the cinema it was with my sisters</div><div id="00:21:23.240" class="transcript_line"> it was like here you go with your friends um so we weren&#039;t allowed to go clubbing you know it was</div><div id="00:21:30.200" class="transcript_line"> really really straight um yeah my friends were my sisters so that&#039;s why we were closed and not to</div><div id="00:21:36.760" class="transcript_line"> have that you miss it because they were your friends and then everybody goes in separate ways</div><div id="00:21:42.920" class="transcript_line"> get married have their children have their own life but I rebelled against that and I used to go</div><div id="00:21:51.880" class="transcript_line"> and see my friends they were my friends um and there was a Mauritian as well and a Caribbean</div><div id="00:21:59.320" class="transcript_line"> but the wife friend became my best friend her name was Elaine</div><div id="00:22:04.920" class="transcript_line"> so I used to go to her house and my sister said you need to get back home you need to and I</div><div id="00:22:09.640" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t listen because I wanted to be with friends so I&#039;d just stay out first but I would</div><div id="00:22:15.560" class="transcript_line"> get back home before my parents came yeah so how about um so this is all still in London yeah so</div><div id="00:22:27.240" class="transcript_line"> how about then the first move to Wales when you first saw Wales what was it like yeah so when I</div><div id="00:22:32.760" class="transcript_line"> came to Wales I felt more at home because I remember when I was in London I&#039;d always be</div><div id="00:22:38.280" class="transcript_line"> drawing mountains rivers palm trees so when I came to Wales and I saw nature I stopped drawing</div><div id="00:22:46.280" class="transcript_line"> that because I felt more at home I saw rivers I saw mountains um so I felt more at home in Wales</div><div id="00:22:53.800" class="transcript_line"> and I didn&#039;t like it at first again it did look grey and it was raining a lot so that put me off</div><div id="00:23:00.760" class="transcript_line"> but once I got to know Wales and I saw more of the nature I really started liking and felt more at</div><div id="00:23:08.120" class="transcript_line"> home and the kind of work that I did I worked with national parks so taking people out to the</div><div id="00:23:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Brecon&#039;s it was working with ethnic minorities and I remember that especially the Bangladesh</div><div id="00:23:19.880" class="transcript_line"> ladies say oh this is like home thanks for taking us here it feels like we feel we&#039;re like at home</div><div id="00:23:26.840" class="transcript_line"> so people really like nature so try and get as many people into national parks and countryside</div><div id="00:23:35.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah so that was nice coming into Wales what does Wales mean to you</div><div id="00:23:42.360" class="transcript_line"> I saw a lot of poverty in Wales compared to London you know um more there seemed to be more like a</div><div id="00:23:49.320" class="transcript_line"> community people really wanted to work towards a common goal and when I first started doing</div><div id="00:23:55.640" class="transcript_line"> community work I used to see the same faces the same proactive people doing the work</div><div id="00:24:03.480" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s widened you know but we&#039;re always we still have to we still gravitate towards</div><div id="00:24:09.960" class="transcript_line"> black and ethnic minorities and when we go and look when I go and look for work</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> um you know you don&#039;t get into mainstream you&#039;re always looking for work for as a bme worker</div><div id="00:24:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and we shouldn&#039;t have to do that um and I remember somebody saying oh you&#039;ll never get a job in the</div><div id="00:24:28.360" class="transcript_line"> council and I thought they&#039;re talking about becoming from London you know they take on people and</div><div id="00:24:34.920" class="transcript_line"> yeah it was true you try to get into a council job and you couldn&#039;t you couldn&#039;t get a job so I</div><div id="00:24:40.360" class="transcript_line"> thought I&#039;ll give up with the council and just go towards them working carrying on working with</div><div id="00:24:46.040" class="transcript_line"> bme groups but I um so I did I&#039;ve done a lot because I I was I had my two girls um and I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:24:54.840" class="transcript_line"> seen what it you know like children um whose parents went to work that they felt you know like</div><div id="00:25:02.120" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s the point of having children if you can&#039;t be there with them so um when I studied psychology</div><div id="00:25:08.440" class="transcript_line"> I did child deprivation um so for me I didn&#039;t want to be uh going to work I wanted to be a</div><div id="00:25:16.440" class="transcript_line"> mother who stayed at home be there for my children so I gave up my career to stay at home I did um</div><div id="00:25:24.840" class="transcript_line"> help my husband you know doing construction work so that I could be around the children</div><div id="00:25:30.600" class="transcript_line"> so that was really important for me just to be to be there for them and so the community work I do</div><div id="00:25:36.840" class="transcript_line"> is sort of like um really tailored around around the children so when I did the national park work</div><div id="00:25:43.960" class="transcript_line"> um I initiated that we take single parents who can&#039;t access to go out people like myself you know</div><div id="00:25:52.760" class="transcript_line"> we sort of like got children but we can&#039;t drive and we needed access to get to places so um I did</div><div id="00:26:00.920" class="transcript_line"> a lot of work around parents and children and whatever I did was tailored tailored around around</div><div id="00:26:06.760" class="transcript_line"> my children sounds like you&#039;ve tried to find a work balance yeah yeah that&#039;s fair enough</div><div id="00:26:13.480" class="transcript_line"> what have you done what do you feel you&#039;ve done to maintain links to your culture and your motherland</div><div id="00:26:18.200" class="transcript_line"> do you feel you have yeah I always sort of um I remember when I first came here um the school</div><div id="00:26:25.880" class="transcript_line"> sort of said you know can you do a Diwali celebration talk about Diwali so because there</div><div id="00:26:33.720" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t many Hindus when we came I think we were the only one one I think we&#039;re the only one actually</div><div id="00:26:39.880" class="transcript_line"> in the school where Pri and Sarita went and Cliver so they told me to come in and give a talk</div><div id="00:26:47.480" class="transcript_line"> and got the teachers to wear sari and I discussed and the children were really interested</div><div id="00:26:54.680" class="transcript_line"> so that that was really nice so I sort of did little things like that and you know school might</div><div id="00:26:59.640" class="transcript_line"> call me in and say come and give a Diwali talk um Raquel who&#039;s also in the age alive she&#039;d do</div><div id="00:27:06.280" class="transcript_line"> something around culture and I remember we did something about wearing um saris or whatever we</div><div id="00:27:12.520" class="transcript_line"> would wear in our culture so we did like a fashion show so I always maintained links with BME</div><div id="00:27:20.440" class="transcript_line"> activities that related to similar culture as mine you know with Indian food or music that sort</div><div id="00:27:29.320" class="transcript_line"> of thing so yeah I always felt comfortable but now it seems to be less than what we had before</div><div id="00:27:38.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we&#039;re not there&#039;s as much of that cultural</div><div id="00:27:43.960" class="transcript_line"> things that we did before like events it&#039;s really died down</div><div id="00:27:49.720" class="transcript_line"> and I think you just go through the process um and I think that&#039;s getting diluted with our children</div><div id="00:27:55.160" class="transcript_line"> as well you know like you want to keep maintain the culture some of them are growing apart from</div><div id="00:28:01.240" class="transcript_line"> me you know their friends are more mixed um there&#039;s interracial marriages and that sort</div><div id="00:28:08.040" class="transcript_line"> of thing going on so everybody&#039;s becoming more mixed whereas our generation we really wanted to</div><div id="00:28:14.520" class="transcript_line"> maintain so tell me about uh yeah the kind of food maritian food that you still talk about</div><div id="00:28:24.920" class="transcript_line"> the kind of food you still eat today oh right so cook maritian food is there you do have a favorite</div><div id="00:28:30.280" class="transcript_line"> dish do you have a favorite ingredient yes um well I would say ragai is one of them we cook ragai</div><div id="00:28:38.040" class="transcript_line"> but now it&#039;s sort of more um a mix of of the food because there&#039;s so many um</div><div id="00:28:44.360" class="transcript_line"> food out there there&#039;s so many cookery programming you want to try chinese food you want to try</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> thai so I think it&#039;s more world food now you know unless um I go back home or you know then</div><div id="00:28:59.400" class="transcript_line"> this gets back traditional again but once I&#039;m here I&#039;m finding it&#039;s more sort of um different types of</div><div id="00:29:07.240" class="transcript_line"> different types of food yeah you say about going back home do you going back home in in london</div><div id="00:29:13.640" class="transcript_line"> where my mum is and uh when we get together as a family again it&#039;s always maritian food</div><div id="00:29:21.800" class="transcript_line"> um I think it&#039;s getting the time here as well you know and um when you&#039;re cooking your own kind of</div><div id="00:29:30.360" class="transcript_line"> food it&#039;s having the time like we have things that it&#039;s called gato pima it&#039;s made out of lentils</div><div id="00:29:35.560" class="transcript_line"> so you need to grind it you&#039;ve got soak it um you know all that kind of thing then fry it&#039;s a bit</div><div id="00:29:42.200" class="transcript_line"> like falafel so it&#039;s it&#039;s the time yeah especially with the children not being there you&#039;re on your</div><div id="00:29:49.560" class="transcript_line"> own you know just don&#039;t just keep it simple and um unless there&#039;s a family thing then it&#039;s back to</div><div id="00:29:57.720" class="transcript_line"> the maritian food at weddings and things like that so how about for other areas of tradition</div><div id="00:30:03.720" class="transcript_line"> how about like spiritual practice and and um clothing do you do you do you look at using any</div><div id="00:30:12.840" class="transcript_line"> of those things anymore at all I think um living in ways you do and there&#039;s not many maritians or</div><div id="00:30:19.640" class="transcript_line"> many hindus um to to be able to wear that or go to weddings and things like that so I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:30:25.240" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s sort of like staying in the cupboard at the moment but um recently um my uncle who&#039;s</div><div id="00:30:32.520" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s an indian priest um he&#039;s also my godfather um he&#039;s opened up a mandir which is like a temple</div><div id="00:30:41.480" class="transcript_line"> here in newport and he opened that up in march so I&#039;ve started going to that now and that&#039;s really</div><div id="00:30:48.440" class="transcript_line"> nice because um you can start wearing some traditional clothes um and on saturday we&#039;re</div><div id="00:30:54.840" class="transcript_line"> going to do a black galba dance so there&#039;s going to be traditional music from our culture um and</div><div id="00:31:01.720" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s uh his guyanese um and we&#039;re maritian so there&#039;s a lot of guyanese people maritian people</div><div id="00:31:08.440" class="transcript_line"> who are hindus that come from bristol and london and birmingham and even from here the indians the</div><div id="00:31:15.160" class="transcript_line"> gurdwari they all come together and it&#039;s really colorful it&#039;s really nice so it does that once</div><div id="00:31:22.440" class="transcript_line"> a month so I&#039;m quite starting to do that now but usually um with hindus we just pray at home</div><div id="00:31:29.160" class="transcript_line"> our own spirituality we do meditation that&#039;s what I do anyway I do meditation and I&#039;ll just do my</div><div id="00:31:35.400" class="transcript_line"> um prayer at home I&#039;ve got a little book which is the Hanuman Jalisa he&#039;s supposed to be you know</div><div id="00:31:42.360" class="transcript_line"> like um praying um making impossible possible powerful um so and it&#039;s quite complex hinduism</div><div id="00:31:51.400" class="transcript_line"> because people believe we have many gods which we don&#039;t um a manifestation of our own being</div><div id="00:31:59.160" class="transcript_line"> of the personalities we have we have all these different personalities</div><div id="00:32:04.360" class="transcript_line"> and what hinduism did was that um to make people um understand or relate to something</div><div id="00:32:12.280" class="transcript_line"> they provided a manifestation of um you know if you were not feeling well you pray to this sort of</div><div id="00:32:20.440" class="transcript_line"> this sort of goddess to help you so you can relate to something because nobody knows what god is or</div><div id="00:32:26.280" class="transcript_line"> who god is what does god look like so they had to sort of like give them some sort of visual thing</div><div id="00:32:32.120" class="transcript_line"> to make it easier for them so it&#039;s not that there are many gods it&#039;s only one god we don&#039;t know you</div><div id="00:32:37.800" class="transcript_line"> know it&#039;s just one god that everybody prays to in different ways and what I quite like about hinduism</div><div id="00:32:45.000" class="transcript_line"> spirituality I can go to church I can go to the mosque god is there you know there&#039;s no</div><div id="00:32:51.080" class="transcript_line"> distinct I can go anywhere so as far as anything no that&#039;s cool that sounds great I mean as part</div><div id="00:32:58.200" class="transcript_line"> of this project the people&#039;s collection is a digital online collection uh which I think is</div><div id="00:33:04.280" class="transcript_line"> funded for 50 years so that&#039;s definitely existing for at least another 50 years say um but being</div><div id="00:33:11.880" class="transcript_line"> digital has access and ability to aggregate different types of material whether it&#039;s video</div><div id="00:33:17.720" class="transcript_line"> audio transcription do you have any heirlooms or mementos you would like to add to possible</div><div id="00:33:24.120" class="transcript_line"> that could be passports they could be old photographs it could be old uh letters it could be</div><div id="00:33:31.080" class="transcript_line"> anything that you feel you&#039;d want to add to tell the story of the niche so there would be things</div><div id="00:33:36.920" class="transcript_line"> like photographs really it&#039;s totally up to you it&#039;s just a way of you the medium is digital</div><div id="00:33:44.120" class="transcript_line"> and the people&#039;s collection allows us to do high quality scans restoration</div><div id="00:33:47.720" class="transcript_line"> video capturing that&#039;s part of the service they offer with cameras</div><div id="00:33:52.040" class="transcript_line"> if there is anything would you like to add anything should I put a yes against your name</div><div id="00:33:57.640" class="transcript_line"> I think photos are really good they are I think they always are and I was saying</div><div id="00:34:01.800" class="transcript_line"> well artifacts and things like that I was saying to the ladies earlier on was actually sadly</div><div id="00:34:08.920" class="transcript_line"> some of the most cherished things end up in a box within a box in a cupboard in a</div><div id="00:34:12.840" class="transcript_line"> whatever right and they don&#039;t come out till it&#039;s a bit too late and I always feel that&#039;s kind of</div><div id="00:34:18.760" class="transcript_line"> part of the issue sometimes in protecting these stories is actually sometimes we need to bring</div><div id="00:34:23.880" class="transcript_line"> these out to the fore and you know share them pass them on to generation do actively rather than</div><div id="00:34:30.680" class="transcript_line"> after the fact so I think that&#039;s what this project is quite interesting
