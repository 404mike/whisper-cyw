id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What did she say?</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she said don&#039;t go into school, but go to school at the same time and come home at the same time</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and pretend you&#039;ve been in school.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was a dirty, I had a pen, with the pen in it, the ink were, and I always had ink on my two fingers.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were supposed to be re-healing?</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and the pen with the nib you had to change with the wooden handle.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did it work?</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I put it in the ink then, just wrote like that then.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Always that was the traces that I had been to school.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, three days went by, I used to meet her and we had a penny to go to school</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and I used to go to Reese the Bakehouse then, it was a little corner grocery shop by the school,</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and get a bun, and I liked oxo.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So Jess ate the oxo, and I still love it now, the fresh bread roll.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d go down the park.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Which park was that?</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> In Cwdda, what&#039;s the name of the park?</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Pwjbach?</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> No, Pwjbach.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went down there, and we&#039;d be on the swings and Jess messing around all day, timed it,</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> as they&#039;d come out of school, we&#039;d get home.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And this particular day my grandmother said to me,</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s someone inside waiting to see you.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I thought to my mother, because she could only come up once a month to see me.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And oh, she said, I&#039;ve noticed these last few days Olive, your hands have been clean, there&#039;s no ink on them.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ve got to change my pen, Grandma.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to go and see who it is?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I went in, it was Mr Morris, the boardman.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the boardman?</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you didn&#039;t attend school, they&#039;d come round to check where you were and what was wrong with you.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he was sitting there.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, hello Olive, it&#039;s nice to see you, he said, they&#039;re missing you in school.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And I couldn&#039;t say I hadn&#039;t been to school, because it would be telling a lie.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know I&#039;d be punished with my grandmother.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t hit, never had to hit me, but I wasn&#039;t allowed out for a week.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I was allowed to sit in the window and watch all my friends play, but I wasn&#039;t allowed out.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course he questioned me why I hadn&#039;t been to school, and I&#039;d done the wrong thing by saying that,</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> well, if Thomas can mitch school, well I can.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve dealt with Thomas for a few times now, he said, and I don&#039;t like you befriending her with her habits.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She was a lovely girl. She never mitched after.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because her parents didn&#039;t know anything about it. Her sister covered for her every time.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And so from then on I had ink on my fingers.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my grandmother took me to school every day, stood in lines with me,</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and embarrassed me by taking me in the class and sitting with me until the teacher came and then redished her.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And met me coming home from school, coming out of school.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So I learnt my lesson. Three days out of my life I mitched school. Beth, I did love school.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And you talked about the pens, so what was the desk like?</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Much nicer than what they were now. I mean, you sat at a desk, individual desk we had,</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and the inkwell was on the top. You could lift the top to put your books in and whatever you had.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the inkwell was usually on the right hand side.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Was the seats connected to the front?</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no. They were in two bits, the ones we had.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Were they single desks?</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> A chair and single desks, yes.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Islwyn, you were in school when war broke out. Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like?</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> War broke out in September 1939 and I was seven years of age.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the Cliddwchd Junior School.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, after a few days there was talk of the war breaking out and the next thing we knew we were marching down street to the Pegen Office in Brook Street,</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> which is the Old and Unemployment Office, is where the new chapel now is built in Brook Street.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So, Gaby, you had daily gas mask drill while you were in school. Can you tell me a bit about that?</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> As soon as the war started we had these gas masks and every day then we were taught drills.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the drills was that the teacher would drill the whistle and they&#039;d put your gas mask on and the next part then you&#039;d dive underneath the desks.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The hands flat out underneath the drill. That was a drill.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;d get that for about two or three weeks until we knew that once that whistle went it was very important that we had to lie down, everybody, in the class.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But if it happened in the school yard in the junior school we&#039;d either have to lie down on the floors we were taught or if you had time you&#039;d run underneath the shelter.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And the girls up the top end of the school then would open the gate and all run down, which had happened not very often in the day, so two or three times.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You were issued with a gas mask and I gather you had to be taught how to...</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, the orders came now. We all go up to the school and the centre they would issue the gas masks in the school, adults and children.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother took me up, about ten I was, you know.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody now trying, this gas mask on and you couldn&#039;t see the face, you didn&#039;t know who was by your side, you know.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And you could, boom, boom, boom, noise, you couldn&#039;t talk. Everybody was fitted with a gas mask anyway.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you had to take it to school every day. First of all it came in a cardboard box, well that didn&#039;t last a week.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you had tin canisters and my mother bought me a tin canister and he put the gas mask in there, you know.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it lasted then. Everybody had a gas mask, the whole nation had a gas mask, that must have caused something, you know.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Cliddock Infant School and I went to Cliddock Junior School.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And my memory for me is going swimming in the Hope and Air Palace where Danny, if he didn&#039;t go in, he stuck this rope around you and he just tucked you in.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> St. Goswin.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember in the Cliddock Infant School there was a Welsh stream.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think his name was Mamie Williams taught them all.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And every one of those children who was taught in the Welsh stream passed this scholarship to go to St. Limerro Grammar.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And so she was a wonderful teacher, apparently. I was in Cliddock Junior School at the stream.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And my main thing to remember is that I sat next to Derek Begburn, the International.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I was going to school in St. Joseph&#039;s Convent.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Thinking that today it&#039;s Monner Park, the staircase, I thought it was enormous when I used to go up on my birthday to the Reverend Mother and we&#039;d have a sweet and lonely picture, you know.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a wonderful thing to do.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the first time the first person, one of the nuns, Sister Camilla&#039;s, and she came in and I was going up the stairs, because we had to dust the stairs sometimes with the carpets for the stairs.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was my turn probably to do that. And she came in and she took her habit off and nobody ever saw a nun without her hair, you know.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And she threw it in the air and she said, I passed my driving test.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yippee! And she said, Mary Davies, you didn&#039;t see that. You didn&#039;t see that!</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think of a fella coming back many years ago and he was a boarder there in the 50s with myself and he said, where&#039;s my sister Margaret Treaser?</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was in bed so he went in to see her. She said, what you doing now?</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;m a bodyguard. And she said, who are you a bodyguard for? He said, I&#039;m a bodyguard to Madonna. He was Madonna&#039;s bodyguard.</div></div></p>
