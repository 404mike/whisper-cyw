    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Ewan Lewis. The location of the interview is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And today&#039;s date is the 3rd of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Ewan, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Ewan Lewis. I-W-A-N-L-E-W-I-S.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> For the rest of this reminiscence, I will of course be referring to you as Jeeves.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> For that is your nickname. And everyone in the company knows and loves you as Jeeves.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is probably a good question to start with. Why are you called Jeeves?</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good question actually Steve. Spanned from, let&#039;s see, going back many years now in the school days.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a bunch of us, a bunch of guys who studied electronics.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of got to the point of, well, should we say I was a bit of a spoff in electronics.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing quite like what I am now.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, there was just a few random questions that were sort of brought on by the teacher.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody seemed to know the answer. And it was sort of passed down the line as you could imagine in a school environment.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Nudging the person to your left was the answer to number one.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of got to one of the guys, James I think it was, and he went, I don&#039;t know, ask Jeeves over there.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of stayed from there. I never had a nickname before moving through school or anything.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I took the fancy to Jeeves.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to say you&#039;re the only Jeeves I know of. Have you met any other in real life?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I know of no other Jeeves whatsoever.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a uniqueness to your Jeeve velocity which is all yours.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, quite.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, let&#039;s try and think back now to when we first met each other.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I can recall going down to Cardiff Bay, which obviously had been redeveloped.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And there in front of the New Wales Millennium Centre was a piece of ground, an area which we called the Oval Basin.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think its official name is Plas Roald Dahl.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You could be right.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. Most of us know it as the Oval Basin.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a basin and it&#039;s oval shaped.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite right.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s common parlance for you.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And to my joy and amazement, I saw a group of young people bocking.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was introduced to, I saw bocking.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What were you all up to?</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Last sunny Sunday afternoon?</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I ask myself this many, many, many times over what we were doing down there.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So, well, yeah, let&#039;s start from the start.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The reason we&#039;re bocking in its entirety is basically, if you can imagine the prosthetics that you see some of those Paralympians running with the blades,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s basically one of them, but for fully bodied people.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re a stilt in essence with a carbon fibre blade on the back that propels you nine, 10 foot up in the air and allows you to run 30 miles an hour by taking nine foot strides.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And my first, you know, the sheer movement and kinetic movement.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, here was a group of lads and I think one or two girls as well who were not really sort of taking like giant leaps as if they were on the moon.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;re doing somersaults, back somersaults, flips sideways.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> What were some of the moves that I would have seen?</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you would have seen some basic stuff.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, let&#039;s start with a jump in.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So a kanga hop.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Imagine a kangaroo jumping away.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s one of the basic things.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you evolve them into some stunts similar to that of skateboarding.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have a spring grab.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You do a split kick.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Star jumps would be another one.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then until you sort of get onto the more technical movements then of somersaults, back flips, jumping up and down big, huge blocks.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, just think of the sort of gymnastic things, stuff you&#039;d see on the spring floor or a trampoline.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose that&#039;s one way to describe it.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a trampoline on each foot.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, in Swicko and in Cardiff Carnival we&#039;ve had for a number of years, we&#039;ve had still performers, some of them professional, who then taught others to move around.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And whilst it gave us the height and sometimes if you got somebody moving on four stilts,</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, you had fun to play with in terms of costume.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t give us the levity.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you guys seem to be like sort of fleas on a God knows what, a diseased tramp.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You were bouncing around.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There was all this energy.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So somehow not only were you higher than everybody else because you&#039;re on stilts and you&#039;re raised up,</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> but as you say, you appear to have a couple of coil springs or springy old jacks you look like.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a revelation for me.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite important to go over and say hello.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I met the Bokkers, yourself and somebody else who was to feature heavily in the Cardiff Carnival Bocking story.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Your cohort, Dom, who I think we have to pay tribute to.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He can&#039;t be here today because he&#039;s celebrating his 21st birthday on route to New York, I believe.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, jammy person.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So, um, met yourself and the other Bokkers.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And at that time, besides doing the annual carnival, Swickr was trying to think how how we could develop carnivals and art form.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes in the history of the carnival, we have attempted, particularly when we had effectively a stage in front of the National Museum of Wales to tell a story of sorts.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went back to that idea and thought, like, how can we, with a smaller group of people, try and begin and tell stories through carnival arts, through the making the movement and by bringing on new and interesting art forms and cultural phenomena.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, Bocking fell into that, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It did. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It did. Yeah, well, and truly, I mean, it was it was something that I wasn&#039;t aware of, of you guys before you approached us.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, as you just explained, it was something that you&#039;d never seen before.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it did bring a certain sort of uniqueness to what it was.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, with the flow of everything, when we&#039;re up on stilts, not being able to stand still.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was always that constant sort of flow and movement when we sort of started to get into the carnival and Swickr with you guys, obviously,</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> along with all of the sort of costumes that we were wearing and the dressage and everything.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very unique sort of style.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think I believe.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The very first production was, of course, Dragons.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were trying to tell through our own sort of carnival prism, the story of the Merlin&#039;s prophecy of the eternal battle between the white Anglo-Saxon dragon.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Boo, his Celtic red dragon.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, you and fellow bockers featured in Dragon.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What are your memories of that?</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you still wake up screaming?</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, just for the record, we were all quite new to the actual bocking event or to the bocking sort of skill set.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was only a select few of us that could perform to the standards that you were looking for.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, I look back on it with with great memories, lots of fun.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a really good time.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a good sort of bonding session with not just us as the bockers, to which we sort of established over the last year or so, but with you guys as well, being part of something, being able to show our skills off with more people, with more crowds and venturing into different avenues that we never thought that we could possibly get into.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a tremendous sort of success for on, you know, a partnership between us as the bockers and yourself as Swicker, you know, just propelled us without no puns, you know, well and truly into the next stage.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The atmosphere.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the crowds always loved you guys on parade.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Carnival Theatre, we followed up.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Dragons with magic.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course you played a pivotal role in that magic.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The story of Dr.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> John D.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, who uses the myth of the 11th century discovery of the new world by Prince Maddock and who gets to play Prince Maddock on stills.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you care to tell us what you were dressed on?</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you had to, you had to, you had to, on jumping stills, on bocking stills, you had to move from North Wales right across the Atlantic to the new world, to America, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was quite fun.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was just us down to a tee really, getting from one space to another in the most exciting way possible, I think.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, on jumping stills, why not?</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Dressed in Welsh gear, so the Welsh flags, the vests, I think we had kilts on as well, going from one side, Wales, over to the other, to the new world, over to America to face off with the Indians, if I recall correctly.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Jumping around and performing and somersaulting and nearly landing on backsides a few times.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever fallen off, Jeeves?</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it a secret to falling off and not, because you&#039;re here, you&#039;re hailed, you&#039;re hearty, you didn&#039;t actually limp into the room.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I was quite one of the fortunate ones, I think.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I managed to get away, scaved only with bruises and cuts.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, right.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t get me wrong, you know, the sport did attract us dangers.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a few people that broke their legs, their collarbones, etc.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Don being one of them, breaking his collarbone.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> A few coccyxes along the way, if that&#039;s the correct word for plural of coccyx, I&#039;m not too sure.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> More than one coccyx?</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, more than one coccyx.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll go and look at that in the future.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, definitely, you know, it was definitely one of the extreme sports.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, it did draw us dangers.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So not only did you join us in our carnival theatre ventures, but of course, you and Dom in particular, I think you often used to lead parades when you were with us, or you were sort of like outriders, or you didn&#039;t have to stay with a section, did you?</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> As you say, you were about constant movement.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think it was a more of a scene or a, I don&#039;t know, let&#039;s see, a parade of such for us to run basically up and down the whole length of the carnival.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It can&#039;t tie us down to one place, you know what we like to do.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it brought a little bit of excitement to it because not only was obviously the general public viewing each section in a stage, but then sort of saw us, I suppose, as a bit of the jesters just running around making a muck.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you had that wild card feel about with you, which is that you didn&#039;t have to relate to one set of music or one group or one set of costumes.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No, definitely not.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You were like our guardians or our pioneers.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And how often you were at the front, I seem to remember, helping sort of, you know, almost like...</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> To clear the way, I think.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> To clear the way.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Move.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Bounce, bounce, bounce.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And also probably out in the front was the only place because this is, I mean, entirely to your credit, you and Dom, but even during the course of a parade, you would still find times.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And perhaps that&#039;s because you were out in the front and we had to stop for road closings and whatever.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember if we could clear a space of how much do you normally leave, about 50 meters or something like that?</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, something along that.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You could run up, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, yeah, we&#039;re there by the side of Howells.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s hundreds of people around.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the one I like.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why it stays with me because of the sound flash.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> How did it feel performing to that number of people in the middle of town during a parade on a sunny day?</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We did have them occasionally.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, living in Wales, surprisingly.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We create the atmosphere of, you know, and everything from the run up of the crowd going, ooh, to, you know, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What did it feel like?</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, before we even get to that bit, I mean, I think it&#039;s just worth to mention that we had a small group of us on that particular day.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there was about six of us.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d actually gone on holidays just before this parade and left it to my good friends to come up with a design for a costume for the lot of us.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I ended up coming back to the most flamboyant boiler suit ever, I believe,</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> with purple sequins and whatnot, courtesy of Adrian.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And but yeah, so anyway, with all of that on, looking slightly tanned as well from my holiday, going back to that moment, performing all the way up from I think it was from City Hall, making our way around the route, getting to that point of towels.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Enough was enough for me.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I needed to sit down and to have a bit of a break and it turned into a little spectacle, I think.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Masses of crowds around us and that small little corridor by howls.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, the atmosphere was just amazing because Dom was performing, ended up doing front flips over me, jumping with me stood up.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, that was me being nearly seven foot, probably seven and a half foot on stilts.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> With the stilts on.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, with the stilts on.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s tall anyway.</div><div id="00:13:55.000"

class="transcript_line"> The crowd just going nuts, obviously, because they could just see the, it doesn&#039;t matter how far away they were with us stood up at seven foot with Dom jumping nine foot up in the air.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It just attracted crowds of people.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the girls performing the sort of can-can dance and little sequence of other little tricks and whatnot.</div><div id="00:14:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just amazing.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And all it was was a little break.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it did.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It was our little break just to sort of have five.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The crowd went wild, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, proper full on cheering and

id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Is he not, you know, to build up the momentum?</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think at one point we even had the crowd do the sort of drum roll.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when it did happen, it was a big, massive cheer of like, whoa, it was amazing, amazing sort of atmosphere to be in.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then moving off then to the next bit.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:15:16.000"
