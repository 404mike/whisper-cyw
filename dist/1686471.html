    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for supporting this short project of</div><div id="00:00:10.280" class="transcript_line"> memories of people who lived and were from Butetown, Tiger Bay, the docks.</div><div id="00:00:20.240" class="transcript_line"> And I hope you find the time to listen to it fully.</div><div id="00:00:28.240" class="transcript_line"> This next one is from Dowd Suliman, part two.</div><div id="00:00:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Butetown is a community which could teach our governors how life should be.</div><div id="00:00:45.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, if they only took the way people lived in Butetown and put things together</div><div id="00:00:52.240" class="transcript_line"> and had things the same, I&#039;m sure the world would be a much better place.</div><div id="00:00:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had a tragedy happen, which shouldn&#039;t have happened, where the last man to be hanged in Wales</div><div id="00:01:06.240" class="transcript_line"> was a Somali guy who&#039;d come here and he&#039;d married a local girl and had a family.</div><div id="00:01:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And he was accused of murdering Mrs. Roberts.</div><div id="00:01:21.240" class="transcript_line"> She was an old Jewish lady that had a dashery shop and whatnot in Bute Street.</div><div id="00:01:30.240" class="transcript_line"> And he had nothing to do with it. He only went to her aid.</div><div id="00:01:34.240" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, the police came and arrested him, and as far as they were concerned, he didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:01:40.240" class="transcript_line"> And that was it. But years later, his children fought and fought and fought, and they managed to succeed.</div><div id="00:01:48.240" class="transcript_line"> And we had his grave opened up and his body was taken out of the prison and Shigside buried him at our section in Ely Cemetery.</div><div id="00:02:00.240" class="transcript_line"> And by then, they&#039;d exhausted that family because his wife and his children, they suffered dearly for what they went through.</div><div id="00:02:09.240" class="transcript_line"> And it was just an open and shut case as far as the police were concerned then.</div><div id="00:02:16.240" class="transcript_line"> I know they were different times. They didn&#039;t have the things that we have today to do their inquiries.</div><div id="00:02:22.240" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, it was, if you were someone of colour, they rode it through whatever they wanted and that was it.</div><div id="00:02:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was the problem, wasn&#039;t it? You know, all of the decision makers and the courts were outside of the bay.</div><div id="00:02:42.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, those people under the bridge effectively, under the railway bridge and across the canal, they decided.</div><div id="00:02:51.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I always say to people that whether they like it or not, without the bay, without the docks, without Bute Town, Cardiff would not be the capital of Wales.</div><div id="00:03:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Exactly, exactly. The area of Bute Town brought character to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:12.240" class="transcript_line"> And money.</div><div id="00:03:13.240" class="transcript_line"> And money, yes, exactly.</div><div id="00:03:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Without the docks and the seamen and the shipping company.</div><div id="00:03:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, exactly. And Bute Town&#039;s got to be recognised and should be proud of that factor, what the people of Bute Town did for Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:33.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think that over the years, no group has demonstrated more what becoming a citizen means of a country.</div><div id="00:03:44.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all of the merchants, you know, like my granddad and all the Yemeni and Somali people, they didn&#039;t come here asking for anything.</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> No, they were hard workers.</div><div id="00:03:57.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then they had their families and they made their families and their kids respectful and made them citizens of Wales.</div><div id="00:04:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right. Yeah, exactly.</div><div id="00:04:10.240" class="transcript_line"> And you know, in the old days on the ships, it wasn&#039;t like the ships today.</div><div id="00:04:15.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d have to go and buy their own bales of hay and whatnot to take on to sleep on, on the ship.</div><div id="00:04:23.240" class="transcript_line"> They had it really hard, you know, and their rations for food were, you know, the shipping companies didn&#039;t want to spend too much on them.</div><div id="00:04:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Life was very difficult on the ships in their days.</div><div id="00:04:37.240" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t. They were always paid a little bit less.</div><div id="00:04:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And the shipping companies loved them.</div><div id="00:04:46.240" class="transcript_line"> The Somalis and the Yemenis, they loved them because they would go on the ship.</div><div id="00:04:51.240" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d stay on until they were thrown off.</div><div id="00:04:56.240" class="transcript_line"> So there was none of this change in crews and whatnot.</div><div id="00:05:00.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they got on so well.</div><div id="00:05:03.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, the shipping companies, that&#039;s all they&#039;d use.</div><div id="00:05:07.240" class="transcript_line"> One company would use malaise, all malaise, you know, and they&#039;d have their own leader amongst them.</div><div id="00:05:14.240" class="transcript_line"> And any problems like the captain went to see their leader and he sorted any problems out that they had.</div><div id="00:05:22.240" class="transcript_line"> And more or less the same with the Somalis and the Yemenis.</div><div id="00:05:27.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d have somebody there who would act as their leader, like a spokesman, and they&#039;d take up any issues with the company or the company had come to them and say what they wasn&#039;t happy with and whatnot.</div><div id="00:05:42.240" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how life was.</div><div id="00:05:45.240" class="transcript_line"> They left their countries to come to look for a better way of life.</div><div id="00:05:51.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all they came for. They didn&#039;t come to steal anybody&#039;s job.</div><div id="00:05:55.240" class="transcript_line"> They were looking for a better life.</div><div id="00:05:57.240" class="transcript_line"> And the truth is they could have settled anywhere.</div><div id="00:06:00.240" class="transcript_line"> Anywhere.</div><div id="00:06:01.240" class="transcript_line"> And they chose the bay and barry for a reason.</div><div id="00:06:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, barry. Thompson Street and barry like this.</div><div id="00:06:09.240" class="transcript_line"> And like the bay, the minute the docks was running down, they knocked down everything that mattered.</div><div id="00:06:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all the history gone. Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Terrible.</div><div id="00:06:22.240" class="transcript_line"> And those people, they were lovely people.</div><div id="00:06:26.240" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when we used to go to barry from Tadi, all they fussed over us and, you know, we were given sweets and things and whatnot, which we wouldn&#039;t normally have.</div><div id="00:06:38.240" class="transcript_line"> And they treated us like we&#039;d come from miles and miles away.</div><div id="00:06:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how it was.</div><div id="00:06:46.240" class="transcript_line"> And the same in places when the shipping started to slack off, people started moving inland, you know, to Birmingham and Manchester and whatnot.</div><div id="00:06:55.240" class="transcript_line"> And the same up there. You know, when you went visiting, you were treated like something special.</div><div id="00:07:02.240" class="transcript_line"> So you always looked forward to go visiting in these other places.</div><div id="00:07:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the one thing that&#039;s kept though, and I mean, unlike another place that was linked to Cardiff and barry, South Shields.</div><div id="00:07:16.240" class="transcript_line"> South Shields, exactly. Which is where it shakes hate. Exactly the same thing.</div><div id="00:07:19.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. That&#039;s right. Yeah. They have exactly the same thing there. They have it tough up there.</div><div id="00:07:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Tougher than the people in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:07:29.240" class="transcript_line"> I think because they were more isolated. Cardiff was, the bay was a tighter community.</div><div id="00:07:35.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:07:36.240" class="transcript_line"> Always taught me they were more vulnerable. You could get to them.</div><div id="00:07:40.240" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t get to the bay. You know, the men on the bay could close it down.</div><div id="00:07:45.240" class="transcript_line"> The way it was situated. Yeah. Yeah, that&#039;s right. Exactly.</div><div id="00:07:51.240" class="transcript_line"> But some of those people, you know, the stories we&#039;ve heard about them in South Shields, they went through hell.</div><div id="00:07:58.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, all because of their color, because they came from somewhere other than England.</div><div id="00:08:06.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, but they stood their ground and whatnot.</div><div id="00:08:10.240" class="transcript_line"> And they managed to succeed and carry on with their lives and whatnot there.</div><div id="00:08:19.240" class="transcript_line"> And some of their women that they married, they would stand up. They were as good as a man.</div><div id="00:08:26.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d stand up and defend.</div><div id="00:08:28.240" class="transcript_line"> When people went to see, I know from sort of my gran, I mean, it was clear listening to her, women ran the family.</div><div id="00:08:37.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:39.240" class="transcript_line"> Everything. Women ran the family. And you were a fool to cross them.</div><div id="00:08:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Oh, yeah. That&#039;s true. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:49.240" class="transcript_line"> You had nine or ten kids. There&#039;s got to be something special about you.</div><div id="00:08:53.240" class="transcript_line"> They were good, honest people who just wanted a bit of justice.</div><div id="00:09:00.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, they wouldn&#039;t look into cause problems or anything. They just wanted fairness for everybody.</div><div id="00:09:08.240" class="transcript_line"> But they were strong-willed people, strong-willed women.</div><div id="00:09:13.240" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, they need to be remembered for what they were because they went through some tough time.</div><div id="00:09:20.240" class="transcript_line"> And people don&#039;t get, all of us have got a white grandmother or a white...</div><div id="00:09:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Exactly, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And they brought us up. They brought us up.</div><div id="00:09:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, when my mother married my dad, she was from the Runnery Valley.</div><div id="00:09:40.240" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, she had to come to Cardiff to work when she was 14.</div><div id="00:09:45.240" class="transcript_line"> And she worked in the infirmary and lived in there, the infirmary as well, before she met my dad.</div><div id="00:09:51.240" class="transcript_line"> And the people up there in Trinidad, they said, oh, the girl&#039;s gone crazy. She&#039;s married a heathen.</div><div id="00:10:00.240" class="transcript_line"> And this and that.</div><div id="00:10:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, during the war, we were lucky enough because of the ships coming in with everything.</div><div id="00:10:11.240" class="transcript_line"> We always had enough to get by.</div><div id="00:10:14.240" class="transcript_line"> And my dad, he used to send the parcel up to the Trinidad every month with things like butter, cheese, stuff you couldn&#039;t buy if you had the money, you know, and tobacco.</div><div id="00:10:29.240" class="transcript_line"> And then he was the best man in the world, you know.</div><div id="00:10:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:36.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:37.240" class="transcript_line"> Because no matter what they said, his wife, that was her family.</div><div id="00:10:42.240" class="transcript_line"> And family is all greeting.</div><div id="00:10:44.240" class="transcript_line"> But those women, they were special women. They were strong.</div><div id="00:10:48.240" class="transcript_line"> And they stood by their husbands and their family. And they, you know, they would be prepared to fight for them as well.</div><div id="00:10:55.240" class="transcript_line"> Which some of them had to do at times.</div><div id="00:10:58.240" class="transcript_line"> And they were special women.</div><div id="00:11:01.240" class="transcript_line"> And these women, they come from nowhere.</div><div id="00:11:04.240" class="transcript_line"> And they took up the language of their husbands.</div><div id="00:11:08.240" class="transcript_line"> And most of them spoke a second language.</div><div id="00:11:11.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, wherever their husbands come from, they learned the language of their husbands.</div><div id="00:11:19.240" class="transcript_line"> And they were very, very strong women, you know, to have done that.</div><div id="00:11:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I mean, it&#039;s a strange thing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:28.240" class="transcript_line"> What you know about where your dad came from and grandparents.</div><div id="00:11:34.240" class="transcript_line"> And what I know about where my granddad came from, that comes from my nan.</div><div id="00:11:40.240" class="transcript_line"> And you know, it was, she made sure I knew who he was and where he was from.</div><div id="00:11:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Exactly. Yeah. That&#039;s good. Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:55.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s, you need to remember the history and the people of those times, what they went through.</div><div id="00:12:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Because life must have been pretty tough for them, you know.</div><div id="00:12:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Although a lot of them were happy in the end, they succeeded.</div><div id="00:12:14.240" class="transcript_line"> They had nice families. They had nice homes.</div><div id="00:12:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And they had nothing to worry about.</div><div id="00:12:21.240" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t come, like you say, looking for trouble or anything.</div><div id="00:12:25.240" class="transcript_line"> They came looking to better their lives.</div><div id="00:12:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And even though they had families here, a lot of them still supported their families that they left behind.</div><div id="00:12:37.240" class="transcript_line"> And they would send them money and whatnot to help them make a little bit of a better life for themselves where they lived.</div><div id="00:12:46.240" class="transcript_line"> So it was good. I mean, my dad, when I was nine years old, my dad sent me out to the Yemen.</div><div id="00:12:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And in those days, we had to go by sea. There was no planes and nothing.</div><div id="00:12:57.240" class="transcript_line"> And we went out on one of the ships, the Uganda, and we were dropped off in Aden.</div><div id="00:13:06.240" class="transcript_line"> And from Aden, we made our way up into the Yemen.</div><div id="00:13:09.240" class="transcript_line"> Aden was a British protector at that time.</div><div id="00:13:13.240" class="transcript_line"> And I went out then. I stayed there for two years or more.</div><div id="00:13:19.240" class="transcript_line"> And what an experience that was.</div><div id="00:13:22.240" class="transcript_line"> I went, I mean, in the Yemen, away from Aden, inside the Yemen, it&#039;s a country which hasn&#039;t changed much since the beginning of time.</div><div id="00:13:32.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like going back 2,000 years in history. And it&#039;s still the same.</div><div id="00:13:36.240" class="transcript_line"> But it was a great experience for me because people treated me like I was a king there.</div><div id="00:13:42.240" class="transcript_line"> And my dad used to send me two pounds every month for pocket money.</div><div id="00:13:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And I couldn&#039;t spend that two pounds. I still had money left over at the end of the month.</div><div id="00:13:58.240" class="transcript_line"> And things were cheap. Things were honest and whatnot.</div><div id="00:14:04.240" class="transcript_line"> But even it&#039;s something the same, even in the Yemen today, the Yemen has changed.</div><div id="00:14:10.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve had these rich Saudis have taken a seat.</div><div id="00:14:16.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re trying to exploit the Yemen and the Emirates.</div><div id="00:14:21.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all trying to exploit the Yemen. But the Yemen will never change.</div><div id="00:14:26.240" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve had troubles before. And they&#039;ve got over them. And they&#039;ll survive this as well.</div><div id="00:14:33.240" class="transcript_line"> It must have been interesting for you seeing where your dad came from.</div><div id="00:14:39.240" class="transcript_line"> And maybe understanding what it must have been like when he was actually arriving in other places.</div><div id="00:14:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Suddenly there&#039;s all this busyness and the docks and...</div><div id="00:14:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, yeah. It made you think.</div><div id="00:14:56.240" class="transcript_line"> When I first got there, when we got into the Yemen, into the village where I stay, nobody spoke English.</div><div id="00:15:05.240" class="transcript_line"> So I sat there and thought, what have I done?</div><div id="00:15:12.240" class="transcript_line"> But people were so good and nice and comforting.</div><div id="00:15:20.240" class="transcript_line"> I thought I&#039;d better learn the language quick. I could speak a little bit then, but not a great deal.</div><div id="00:15:27.240" class="transcript_line"> And within six months I was away speaking.</div><div id="00:15:32.240" class="transcript_line"> And everybody loved one another. Then these things were different there.</div><div id="00:15:41.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to see these changes.</div><div id="00:15:47.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting though, isn&#039;t it? Because language... You think you&#039;re speaking the language until you arrive.</div><div id="00:15:55.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like somebody from Oxford arriving in the bay.</div><div id="00:16:03.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s phrases and things that people say that make no sense to an outsider.</div><div id="00:16:13.240" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s right. And that&#039;s our home.</div><div id="00:16:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, like I say, I spent 35 years traveling.</div><div id="00:16:22.240" class="transcript_line"> And one of the best feelings was when you came back on the train from London and you smelt the fish by the railway station.</div><div id="00:16:34.240" class="transcript_line"> And that smell identified with home.</div><div id="00:16:39.240" class="transcript_line"> And it was great. You were back here.</div><div id="00:16:44.240" class="transcript_line"> I was saying about language. A friend of mine says, what does that mean in Wales?</div><div id="00:16:49.240" class="transcript_line"> He said, what do you mean? He said, now in a minute.</div><div id="00:16:53.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, now in a minute.</div><div id="00:16:59.240" class="transcript_line"> And those little things won&#039;t be there.</div><div id="00:17:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right. Who&#039;s caught in this jacket?</div><div id="00:17:08.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t get it. We think it&#039;s funny too.</div><div id="00:17:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I&#039;ve taken a lot of your time up, man.</div><div id="00:17:20.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div><div id="00:17:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Let me ask you something, right.</div><div id="00:17:24.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re back to this imaginary person that&#039;s having a cup of coffee and they&#039;re looking at all of those new shops and restaurants.</div><div id="00:17:33.240" class="transcript_line"> And one thing they don&#039;t know is if they&#039;d have walked along those, you know, Bute Street and the other streets when they were, when we were kids, they&#039;d have smelt more food from around the world.</div><div id="00:17:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, yeah. They would have had the aromas of the different spices.</div><div id="00:17:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And the place was alive.</div><div id="00:17:56.240" class="transcript_line"> We used to eat from all the way around the world. We used to eat English food.</div><div id="00:18:00.240" class="transcript_line"> We used to eat Somali food.
