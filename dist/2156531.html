    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;re ready to go now. Today is Friday the 23rd of September. My name is Jill Willie</div><div id="00:00:14.700" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m at Habit Hardware talking to Mr John Jones, who has lived in this area all his</div><div id="00:00:22.400" class="transcript_line"> life. John, thank you very much for agreeing to have a chat with me. First of all, could</div><div id="00:00:28.760" class="transcript_line"> you just start with your year of birth, John, please? I was born on the 2nd of February, 1948.</div><div id="00:00:35.160" class="transcript_line"> And can you tell me where you were born? I was born in a bedroom at Upper Llanfadog. Can you tell</div><div id="00:00:44.640" class="transcript_line"> me exactly where Upper Llanfadog or Llanfadog Ichavis then, John? Well, as you go from Raider</div><div id="00:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> up the Allen Valley, you go past the Allen Valley Hotel and it&#039;s the next farm on your right,</div><div id="00:00:58.920" class="transcript_line"> about 300 yards away. Thank you. And what sort of facilities do you remember as you were growing</div><div id="00:01:07.440" class="transcript_line"> up? Things like running water and etc. Can you give me some details of that sort of thing? Well,</div><div id="00:01:14.440" class="transcript_line"> we had no electricity. The toilet was outside, about 50 yards away, and the water we had from</div><div id="00:01:25.200" class="transcript_line"> the spout. And my mother did all the washing and that out there by the brook. And a tin</div><div id="00:01:36.520" class="transcript_line"> bath brought into the back kitchen, perhaps twice a week, sometimes only once a week. And no</div><div id="00:01:45.800" class="transcript_line"> electricity, so we had these paraffin lamps that you had to pump up all the time when the pressure</div><div id="00:01:54.480" class="transcript_line"> dropped. I see. And how much work did you yourself do around the farm, John, as a young boy growing</div><div id="00:02:03.880" class="transcript_line"> up? I did quite a bit. When I attended Allen Village School, I used to milk a cow every morning</div><div id="00:02:14.580" class="transcript_line"> by hand because we sold milk round the Elan Village and that was my contribution. I milked</div><div id="00:02:21.880" class="transcript_line"> this one cow, who was my favourite, perched on a little stool and then I walked to the school</div><div id="00:02:29.680" class="transcript_line"> afterwards. And you actually got your water from where exactly, John? Well, between the house and</div><div id="00:02:38.840" class="transcript_line"> building at Llanfadog, there was a brook coming down and we had a spout and a little pool there</div><div id="00:02:46.280" class="transcript_line"> and that is where the water came from. But when I was about 10, we had it piped about 500 yards</div><div id="00:02:54.160" class="transcript_line"> from another well out in the field and that was wonderful spring water. And the only time I saw</div><div id="00:03:02.280" class="transcript_line"> that goat rye was in the hot summer of 1976. Indeed. And were your family born at and grew up in</div><div id="00:03:14.320" class="transcript_line"> Llanfadog up here? My father was born there and my mother was born at the Gunfant Laniere. Now,</div><div id="00:03:24.040" class="transcript_line"> what, we were a large family, John, in Llanfadog? Yes, we were. I was the fourth but there was a</div><div id="00:03:34.400" class="transcript_line"> baby loss between me and the sister above me. So we were five really and so there was five of us.</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But I was born a long time after. My two older sisters was 22 and 20 when I was born and two</div><div id="00:03:56.280" class="transcript_line"> of my three sisters were married with children. So I have nephews and nieces older than myself.</div><div id="00:04:02.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite unusual but of course it does happen. What sort of major events can you remember in the</div><div id="00:04:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Valley as you were growing up, John? Well, I suppose the first one was when the Queen came</div><div id="00:04:20.120" class="transcript_line"> with the Duke of Edinburgh in October 1952. I would have been four-year-old and I just remember</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> standing outside the hotel over on where the bicycle path is now with our flags and my sister,</div><div id="00:04:37.240" class="transcript_line"> Joan, was a waitress in the Ellen Valley and she waited on the Queen. Oh, what an accolade,</div><div id="00:04:44.160" class="transcript_line"> my word. And what places did you have to play in and to generally just explore in your Ellen</div><div id="00:04:53.920" class="transcript_line"> Valley area? On the farm. You had plenty of places. You had fields all around you but I think me and</div><div id="00:05:01.440" class="transcript_line"> my nephews enjoyed going down the brook to where it meets the River Ellen and we were catching</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> minnows there until I was old enough to have a rod and line and I loved fishing in those days.</div><div id="00:05:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Quite a lot of that goes on at the Ellen Valley, doesn&#039;t it? Right, now what memories do you have</div><div id="00:05:21.760" class="transcript_line"> of the big shearings that took place in the Ellen Valley, John? Oh, well, it was the highlight of</div><div id="00:05:29.760" class="transcript_line"> the year. You swap men with neighbouring farms so, you know, there might be thirty men would come to</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> your shearing and it was the day of the year. You started off with breakfast and then you had lunch</div><div id="00:05:48.920" class="transcript_line"> and tea and hopefully you finished about five o&#039;clock. And we had one hill which was up above</div><div id="00:05:55.960" class="transcript_line"> the Clarewyn Dam so them sheep had to be driven down on a two-day drive sort of thing to shear at</div><div id="00:06:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Uppel and Vaddard and then that night they were taken back up to the hen run and they went on from</div><div id="00:06:11.080" class="transcript_line"> there back to the hill next day. And shearing was a wonderful thing. As a boy the highlight was after</div><div id="00:06:19.960" class="transcript_line"> dinner we&#039;d have a game of football with all the younger men but what I remember there was four or</div><div id="00:06:28.440" class="transcript_line"> five old men sat outside the barn on a bench all day and all they were sitting down and talking</div><div id="00:06:36.120" class="transcript_line"> about tales and they seemed very old to me but when I think back they were probably only in their</div><div id="00:06:43.960" class="transcript_line"> late 60s, you know, but the way they dressed and that I thought they were a hundred. But I&#039;m sure</div><div id="00:06:52.440" class="transcript_line"> they had lots of interesting memories to share. Yes. So would you say that despite the rural locality</div><div id="00:06:59.400" class="transcript_line"> you had plenty to do and a very good social life you knew everyone? Oh yes I knew everyone</div><div id="00:07:06.920" class="transcript_line"> and as I&#039;ve got two nephews living behind the Ellen Valley Hotel the three of us sort of</div><div id="00:07:14.600" class="transcript_line"> played together most nights and played football in the field at Llanwaddug and later on when</div><div id="00:07:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham City police cadets came to Ellen Village they had goal posts put up on the green</div><div id="00:07:30.280" class="transcript_line"> so we used to go up there to play football and I&#039;ve seen us cycle down to Llanwathal to play</div><div id="00:07:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Boys of Llanwathal and everywhere we went we cycled and I was a founder member of Raider</div><div id="00:07:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Young Farmers and that started in 1963 and still we were old enough to drive</div><div id="00:07:55.480" class="transcript_line"> we went there on a push bike which was up in Bryntirion then they held their meetings.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bryntirion I understand is the then secondary school of the area, is that correct? Yes it was.</div><div id="00:08:10.120" class="transcript_line"> The only time I ever attended Bryntirion was to try my 11 plus.</div><div id="00:08:18.280" class="transcript_line"> Right we&#039;ll come on to that now then on to school life. Can you tell me</div><div id="00:08:25.800" class="transcript_line"> where you went to school and what age you were when you started John?</div><div id="00:08:31.240" class="transcript_line"> I went to Ellen Village Primary School at Easter 1953.</div><div id="00:08:40.840" class="transcript_line"> My birthday was February so I had just gone five and my sister Joan took me to school the first</div><div id="00:08:47.720" class="transcript_line"> morning and all the other pupils were stood in the entrance I think waiting the newcomer and</div><div id="00:08:57.800" class="transcript_line"> I was there till 1959 and I had many a happy time looking back in the Valley School.</div><div id="00:09:05.800" class="transcript_line"> We were never more than 20 pupils and I think when I left they were down to 12</div><div id="00:09:13.720" class="transcript_line"> and there was two teachers there the first teacher was Mrs. Jim Price or Mrs. Betty Price</div><div id="00:09:21.240" class="transcript_line"> and the senior teacher was Miss Chu.</div><div id="00:09:26.920" class="transcript_line"> I have heard those names.</div><div id="00:09:28.600" class="transcript_line"> Could I add one more thing? Please. The only thing I hated about the</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Valley School every June the Lord Mayor of Birmingham came down and we had the June tea</div><div id="00:09:44.760" class="transcript_line"> and of course the tea was nice I loved that but afterwards we had to perform on stage</div><div id="00:09:51.320" class="transcript_line"> and every year they seemed to have me to sing a solo and after that the Lady Mayoress presented</div><div id="00:09:58.520" class="transcript_line"> us all with a book for what we&#039;d done during the year if you&#039;ve done well you have the best books.</div><div id="00:10:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Right and am I right in thinking that the school at the Ellen Village was where the lodge is now?</div><div id="00:10:16.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes it was there was a school immediately above it when the works were going on but this new</div><div id="00:10:25.880" class="transcript_line"> school was built in 1909 and my mother went to the old school just above it but my father</div><div id="00:10:35.720" class="transcript_line"> was not allowed to go to that school because he was living in the Radnyshire side and he had to</div><div id="00:10:43.720" class="transcript_line"> walk three miles to come tie the school every day. So you yourself went to the Ellen Village</div><div id="00:10:52.200" class="transcript_line"> School but you were still in what was then Radnyshire weren&#039;t you so were there many other</div><div id="00:10:59.160" class="transcript_line"> children from Radnyshire in that school? No I think at the time I left there was just two of us</div><div id="00:11:07.800" class="transcript_line"> the other boy didn&#039;t try the 11 plus so he went straight to Brinturion there was three the same</div><div id="00:11:15.240" class="transcript_line"> age as me living on the Breckinshire side so they went to Bilth High School and they didn&#039;t have to</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> try the 11 plus I was the only one out of the five of us that had to try the 11 plus. And was that</div><div id="00:11:30.360" class="transcript_line"> because Radnyshire and Breckinshire being different authorities had decided different rules regarding</div><div id="00:11:36.520" class="transcript_line"> the 11 plus? Yes it has I mean it&#039;s different now you can go to any school but in them days it was</div><div id="00:11:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Radnyshire and Breckinshire and I only lived 200 yards from the River Ellen and if I&#039;d been the</div><div id="00:11:51.640" class="transcript_line"> other side I&#039;d have been in Breckinshire. And would not have had to take the the 11 plus I see.</div><div id="00:11:58.360" class="transcript_line"> Now having taken the 11 plus what school did you then go to John? I went to Landerinder Grammar</div><div id="00:12:04.680" class="transcript_line"> School in the first week of September 1959 when a school car driven by Mr Harrell Ashton from the</div><div id="00:12:14.040" class="transcript_line"> shop down opposite Jimmy Lloyd&#039;s yard drove me down to the bus and then we met the bus up by the</div><div id="00:12:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Smithfield in Radar and there was a boys bus and a girls bus. And how long were you at that school</div><div id="00:12:31.960" class="transcript_line"> traveling to and from then John? Well I left in 1963 because I&#039;d had a couple of run-ins with Mr</div><div id="00:12:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Howells headmaster and I told he said that I had to try my own levels and I said I&#039;ll show you and I left.</div><div id="00:12:53.960" class="transcript_line"> If you left right. John you must have seen quite a lot of changes in in the valley. Would you like</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> to talk a little bit about the development of the valley as you know it? Well I&#039;ve seen lots of</div><div id="00:13:09.720" class="transcript_line"> changes not for the better in my opinion. I you know although I&#039;m a proud Welshman,</div><div id="00:13:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham were very good landlords and they were good to the farmers and they would provide new</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> gates and hurdles and fencing material every year and then when it changed over to Welsh water</div><div id="00:13:32.360" class="transcript_line"> it was a downward spiral and I think the valley was much better in those days, much tidier.</div><div id="00:13:43.400" class="transcript_line"> You could fish from the Cabin Dam to Garrod Dee that railway line had two or three sheep in it</div><div id="00:13:49.560" class="transcript_line"> and it kept all the foliage down. Now it&#039;s just like a jungle and you can&#039;t fish one yard of it.</div><div id="00:13:57.880" class="transcript_line"> Very very unfortunate because fishing is really quite a prominent activity in our area isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Speaking about the livestock now how often did you actually come into Rhaerdyd to the market</div><div id="00:14:12.760" class="transcript_line"> or to any other market? Well I don&#039;t remember coming much. My father you know would bring</div><div id="00:14:20.280" class="transcript_line"> a cow or cow and calf or something occasionally to the mart and we&#039;d always sell our sail ews</div><div id="00:14:28.520" class="transcript_line"> in the autumn and we drove them down with two dogs and I sometimes walked in front and my father</div><div id="00:14:37.880" class="transcript_line"> behind and we never lost one. We always got them to the market and tied the dogs up there all day</div><div id="00:14:45.880" class="transcript_line"> and sold and one year the prices were poor so we didn&#039;t sell. I was about 16 at the time.</div><div id="00:14:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Anyway my father was getting on then and a car stopped when we were driving these sheep home</div><div id="00:15:04.600" class="transcript_line"> and he offered father a lift home and he said I&#039;ll leave my dog with you and as soon as father got in</div><div id="00:15:12.120" class="transcript_line"> the car the dog went back towards Rhaerdyd and unfortunately he got killed by a car and I got</div><div id="00:15:21.560" class="transcript_line"> the sheep home with my dog and then my sister Joan went back to Rhaerdyd in the van to look for this</div><div id="00:15:29.240" class="transcript_line"> dog and found him dead on the road and brought him back. Oh how unfortunate one that I&#039;m showing.</div><div id="00:15:36.840" class="transcript_line"> We took the sheep to the next fair and didn&#039;t do any better so we may as well have sold them on the</div><div id="00:15:44.040" class="transcript_line"> first fair. All memories of course Joan aren&#039;t they? Yes. Now if we could come back to the school I</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> believe you had some relatives that actually taught at that school John can you tell us a</div><div id="00:15:58.200" class="transcript_line"> little bit about that please? Well they didn&#039;t teach at that school they taught at the old school</div><div id="00:16:05.240" class="transcript_line"> up the cabin which is now under the water. I think they moved here in 1891</div><div id="00:16:14.200" class="transcript_line"> Elizabeth Abley and her sister Alice Ann Abley who became my grandmother. She married Evan Jones from</div><div id="00:16:23.640" class="transcript_line"> Uppalantalloch and they were brought here to teach English because they knew that the dams</div><div id="00:16:31.320" class="transcript_line"> was coming and there was a lot of English and Irish and Scots people moving into the area</div><div id="00:16:38.280" class="transcript_line"> so that was the end of the Welsh language in the Allen Valley school.</div><div id="00:16:45.640" class="transcript_line"> The demise of the Welsh language in the valley is something I&#039;d like to touch on now. Prior to that</div><div id="00:16:53.720" class="transcript_line"> your family would have been Welsh speakers presumably your ancestors. Yes. Do you actually</div><div id="00:17:00.360" class="transcript_line"> remember any of your family older relatives actually speaking Welsh as their day-to-day</div><div id="00:17:07.160" class="transcript_line"> language? Well my father could speak Welsh quite good but as he had an English mother there was</div><div id="00:17:15.160" class="transcript_line"> English spoke at home you know but his father was fluent Welsh and then on my mother&#039;s side the family</div><div id="00:17:24.680" class="transcript_line"> they were all fluent Welsh but you know they had died before I was sort of born so</div><div id="00:17:33.160" class="transcript_line"> and my grandfather and grandmother from the clean they were more English than Welsh because they were</div><div id="00:17:44.040" class="transcript_line"> both well one was brought up at the Gunfair and the other was born brought up at the Dunfan New</div><div id="00:17:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Bridge on Wye. I see and so was Welsh not taught at all then in either of those schools the the</div><div id="00:18:02.200" class="transcript_line"> old one you&#039;ve mentioned and the current one was Welsh not taught at all? No there was no Welsh in</div><div id="00:18:08.600" class="transcript_line"> school when I was there well we did the national anthem and that in Welsh but no it was all English.</div><div id="00:18:15.960" class="transcript_line"> I see and what about your grammar school days then in in Llandrindod did you learn Welsh there</div><div id="00:18:22.760" class="transcript_line"> at all? Yes when I went to Llandrindod I had the choice to either learn Welsh or French and I</div><div id="00:18:31.960" class="transcript_line"> was taught Welsh with a teacher called Annie Griffiths.</div><div id="00:18:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Right so sadly well there&#039;s a real resurgence now in learning Welsh of course but it&#039;s you know</div><div id="00:18:49.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a little sad. Yeah my two grandchildren now Arthur and Marnie are both in the Welsh unit.</div><div id="00:18:57.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a very good idea that&#039;s here in Raerdyr is it? Yes in yes in Brinterion which I&#039;m very</div><div id="00:19:04.440" class="transcript_line"> pleased about because I am very Welsh you know in my thoughts. Very commendable John I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:19:15.080" class="transcript_line"> John could we touch on pony trekking I understand you had quite an involvement in that in your</div><div id="00:19:20.840" class="transcript_line"> younger days. Yes I was on the pony trekking committee for many years they were called Raerdyr</div><div id="00:19:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Pony Trekking Association and Mr David Evans was the secretary and people like Kinsey Morgan</div><div id="00:19:37.400" class="transcript_line"> and Gerald Morgan were chairman and vice chairman and I was always interested in it probably because</div><div id="00:19:45.400" class="transcript_line"> every year a lot of pretty girls came along and I met one called Gina Day and after an on and off</div><div id="00:19:56.280" class="transcript_line"> romance for four years I married her and she is now still called Gina Jones but unfortunately</div><div id="00:20:04.360" class="transcript_line"> we got divorced but the trekking was a wonderful thing and I&#039;ve seen up to a hundred ponies going</div><div id="00:20:12.520" class="transcript_line"> out on a day you know terrific line of trekkers and they came from all over the well all over</div><div id="00:20:21.720" class="transcript_line"> Europe actually but in the end I was guide for two years and it was a much harder job then because</div><div id="00:20:31.880" class="transcript_line"> instead of having a trekker for a week who would pick up things you had day trekkers and half of</div><div id="00:20:39.800" class="transcript_line"> them couldn&#039;t ride and you couldn&#039;t go any faster than the slowest rider or the poorest rider and</div><div id="00:20:45.800" class="transcript_line"> some of you had to lead you know but I always found out that if anybody arrived on a motorbike</div><div id="00:20:54.280" class="transcript_line"> they could ride and was the balance was right I&#039;ve never seen a poor rider off a motorbike</div><div id="00:21:02.520" class="transcript_line"> using the same muscles I wouldn&#039;t I wouldn&#039;t doubt fine now John you&#039;ve spoken about</div><div id="00:21:09.080" class="transcript_line"> riding your bike a lot for recreation etc did you use horses as a means of transport</div><div id="00:21:17.320" class="transcript_line"> for getting around generally at all oh yes my father was always on horseback he used to do</div><div id="00:21:24.040" class="transcript_line"> all the gathering of sheep on horseback and I rode a horse a lot like I was probably riding</div><div
