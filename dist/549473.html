door,</div><div id="00:06:15.280" class="transcript_line"> and I said, I understand that you&#039;re looking for a new assistant,</div><div id="00:06:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and I have done some, I got some experience.</div><div id="00:06:22.680" class="transcript_line"> And she said, well, come and see me tomorrow,</div><div id="00:06:27.880" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ll do an interview, and we&#039;ll see how we go.</div><div id="00:06:31.480" class="transcript_line"> And I went along, and she interviewed me,</div><div id="00:06:34.480" class="transcript_line"> and she said, right, when can you start?</div><div id="00:06:37.080" class="transcript_line"> And I was actually earning, I think about £7.50 a week from £3,</div><div id="00:06:45.680" class="transcript_line"> and I couldn&#039;t believe my luck to get a job like that.</div><div id="00:06:50.880" class="transcript_line"> And it was such a lot of difference in those days.</div><div id="00:06:57.680" class="transcript_line"> So can you, were there lots of people in Barnecalfs that you knew?</div><div id="00:07:02.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when I went there, it actually employed,</div><div id="00:07:11.280" class="transcript_line"> if I explained to you that Polycalfs started up in 1940.</div><div id="00:07:18.480" class="transcript_line"> It was started up with, I believe it was Lordenafield,</div><div id="00:07:24.480" class="transcript_line"> through the war effort, and originally made uniforms for the troops.</div><div id="00:07:30.880" class="transcript_line"> It went, and I know that there were records kept from,</div><div id="00:07:45.080" class="transcript_line"> it was either 1939 or 1940, and those records were kept</div><div id="00:07:49.480" class="transcript_line"> of people who were actually employed there.</div><div id="00:07:52.280" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, I&#039;m talking, I went there 1961,</div><div id="00:07:58.480" class="transcript_line"> but those records were still there of people who were employed at that time.</div><div id="00:08:02.280" class="transcript_line"> So they had actually, and they were handwritten records,</div><div id="00:08:05.280" class="transcript_line"> and they were actually kept.</div><div id="00:08:09.480" class="transcript_line"> They then diversified, and they made, let me think now,</div><div id="00:08:15.880" class="transcript_line"> they used to do, they still made uniforms,</div><div id="00:08:21.280" class="transcript_line"> they made ladies&#039; clothing, they also did bedding.</div><div id="00:08:28.280" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, before the factory actually closed,</div><div id="00:08:33.080" class="transcript_line"> it was there, it then went into Berberys.</div><div id="00:08:35.880" class="transcript_line"> That was the way it went, but that was way after I finished,</div><div id="00:08:42.080" class="transcript_line"> because it was still Polycalfs when I went there.</div><div id="00:08:45.280" class="transcript_line"> They used to make a lot of men&#039;s suits and things like that,</div><div id="00:08:49.280" class="transcript_line"> and the factory itself was partitioned off into different sections.</div><div id="00:08:55.280" class="transcript_line"> I, let me think, I went, part of my job every day was to check everybody who,</div><div id="00:09:12.280" class="transcript_line"> every person on the shop floor had to have a clock card.</div><div id="00:09:17.280" class="transcript_line"> A clock card.</div><div id="00:09:19.280" class="transcript_line"> And throughout the factory there were clocks,</div><div id="00:09:22.280" class="transcript_line"> and in the morning when they came into work they clocked in,</div><div id="00:09:26.280" class="transcript_line"> and when they went out in the night or lunchtime, they clocked out.</div><div id="00:09:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Now those clock cards and the clocks themselves,</div><div id="00:09:37.280" class="transcript_line"> there must have been about ten stations, I would have said, throughout the factory,</div><div id="00:09:42.280" class="transcript_line"> and every day I checked those clock cards,</div><div id="00:09:46.280" class="transcript_line"> and I checked them for lateness,</div><div id="00:09:50.280" class="transcript_line"> and if someone was not there, then the clock cards were collected in.</div><div id="00:09:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Even sometimes if there were two reds, which meant that they were late,</div><div id="00:10:05.280" class="transcript_line"> they were collected in.</div><div id="00:10:07.280" class="transcript_line"> And then to get their clock card the following morning,</div><div id="00:10:10.280" class="transcript_line"> they had to come and see either the personnel officer or me,</div><div id="00:10:14.280" class="transcript_line"> and they had to tell, they had to give a reasonable explanation as to why they were late,</div><div id="00:10:19.280" class="transcript_line"> or why they were absent.</div><div id="00:10:21.280" class="transcript_line"> And very often I can remember Mrs Farmer,</div><div id="00:10:26.280" class="transcript_line"> who was the personnel officer, telling someone,</div><div id="00:10:29.280" class="transcript_line"> well I think it&#039;s about time you bought yourself a new alarm clock.</div><div id="00:10:33.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was really quite funny, the things that came out.</div><div id="00:10:39.280" class="transcript_line"> What would happen to them if they kept on?</div><div id="00:10:43.280" class="transcript_line"> They would be given a warning,</div><div id="00:10:45.280" class="transcript_line"> and if they, within a certain period, I can&#039;t really remember off hand,</div><div id="00:10:53.280" class="transcript_line"> but if it was within a reasonable amount of time,</div><div id="00:10:57.280" class="transcript_line"> and I got a feeling it was a month or six weeks or something like that,</div><div id="00:11:02.280" class="transcript_line"> and if they were late so many times, they were given a warning,</div><div id="00:11:06.280" class="transcript_line"> and then they were put off, they were made redundant.</div><div id="00:11:11.280" class="transcript_line"> If they couldn&#039;t give a reasonable explanation then,</div><div id="00:11:15.280" class="transcript_line"> because there was a big recruitment drive during that time,</div><div id="00:11:21.280" class="transcript_line"> and like I say, you were talking about 1800 girls that the factory employed.</div><div id="00:11:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, not all women, because most of them were pressers,</div><div id="00:11:37.280" class="transcript_line"> they were men, they were pattern cutters, most of them were men,</div><div id="00:11:43.280" class="transcript_line"> and there was a packing department, and that mostly consisted of men.</div><div id="00:11:49.280" class="transcript_line"> So there were a couple of hundred men, I would have said there, but mostly women.</div><div id="00:11:56.280" class="transcript_line"> So 1800 was the number of everybody working there?</div><div id="00:11:59.280" class="transcript_line"> Of everyone working there, yes.</div><div id="00:12:01.280" class="transcript_line"> So what percentage would you say were women?</div><div id="00:12:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, I would have said approximately 75%, three-quarters women,</div><div id="00:12:15.280" class="transcript_line"> because the office staff were mostly women as well.</div><div id="00:12:18.280" class="transcript_line"> The managers were men, as they would be, but most of the office staff,</div><div id="00:12:25.280" class="transcript_line"> and I can actually remember someone being taken on as a manager who was a woman,</div><div id="00:12:32.280" class="transcript_line"> and she was in the design department and of the bedding section,</div><div id="00:12:39.280" class="transcript_line"> but that was very unusual, especially in those days,</div><div id="00:12:44.280" class="transcript_line"> because women became supervisors, the foremen were usually men.</div><div id="00:12:53.280" class="transcript_line"> It was accepted practice in those days, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Women didn&#039;t really climb up the ladder, because they didn&#039;t get the chance.</div><div id="00:13:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Pretty low class ceiling, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:13:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very low class.</div><div id="00:13:08.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh great. Tell me then about the first day you entered the factory.</div><div id="00:13:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember what it was like?</div><div id="00:13:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Did you go straight on? I mean, did you go in the first few times you went there,</div><div id="00:13:24.280" class="transcript_line"> did you go on the factory floor?</div><div id="00:13:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well now the girl whose job I was taking over was leaving to have a baby,</div><div id="00:13:31.280" class="transcript_line"> so she was with me for two weeks, so she actually trained me, taught me all the job,</div><div id="00:13:38.280" class="transcript_line"> and then on the following week it was, we are off you go, you&#039;re on your own,</div><div id="00:13:46.280" class="transcript_line"> but I suppose it&#039;s one of those things you accepted and you fell into then, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:13:52.280" class="transcript_line"> You learnt as you went along, and a lot of it is experience as well.</div><div id="00:13:57.280" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs Farmer was a wonderful boss, she really was wonderful.</div><div id="00:14:03.280" class="transcript_line"> A lady who never had any children of her own, but was kind,</div><div id="00:14:10.280" class="transcript_line"> and she was known to be a very fair manager then as such,</div><div id="00:14:18.280" class="transcript_line"> because if any of the factory managers said anything about the girls,</div><div id="00:14:23.280" class="transcript_line"> she would have them up and she&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:14:25.280" class="transcript_line"> now you tell me your side of the story before anything was ever done.</div><div id="00:14:30.280" class="transcript_line"> And she taught me a lot I think, you know, over the years, it was quite surprising.</div><div id="00:14:36.280" class="transcript_line"> But while I was there...</div><div id="00:14:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, did the girls on the floor, they found her fair as well?</div><div id="00:14:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh very fair, oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:14:46.280" class="transcript_line"> How did you get on with the girls on the floor?</div><div id="00:14:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, mind, one of the funnies which I always remember was we had two nurses,</div><div id="00:14:59.280" class="transcript_line"> one was the sister and one was the nurse.</div><div id="00:15:02.280" class="transcript_line"> I was trying to remember, I think they were both, one was nursery&#039;s and one was sister&#039;s,</div><div id="00:15:08.280" class="transcript_line"> they both had the same surname, and the nurse was very little,</div><div id="00:15:15.280" class="transcript_line"> but she was a bossy boot, she was.</div><div id="00:15:18.280" class="transcript_line"> And throughout the middle of the factory, which was a very big building as such, were the toilets.</div><div id="00:15:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Now the girls every day, they weren&#039;t allowed to smoke on the factory floor,</div><div id="00:15:34.280" class="transcript_line"> but they were allowed to smoke in the toilets, so a lot of them would have a break,</div><div id="00:15:40.280" class="transcript_line"> and she would say to me, right, come on, off we go.</div><div id="00:15:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, what have I got to go to?</div><div id="00:15:47.280" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to come with these girls now and tell them to go downstairs, they&#039;ve had enough.</div><div id="00:15:52.280" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d be upstairs now and it was a whole area that you could walk through, very big,</div><div id="00:16:00.280" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d see the girls and they&#039;d be scuttling now, and they&#039;d be saying, oh, the nurse is coming.</div><div id="00:16:08.280" class="transcript_line"> You can imagine, and there&#039;d be rummlers in their hair, or somebody would be doing their nails,</div><div id="00:16:14.280" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d all be scuttering then.</div><div id="00:16:18.280" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d say, you&#039;ve got to tell them as well, and I used to go, oh, no nurse, not today.</div><div id="00:16:24.280" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d be behind her and I was a lot taller, and I&#039;d be making eyes at the girls and they&#039;d all be scuttering.</div><div id="00:16:32.280" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I got on quite well with them.</div><div id="00:16:39.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a different relationship in that quite often I was interviewing some of these girls first thing in the morning</div><div id="00:16:50.280" class="transcript_line"> because when Mrs Farmer, she became ill and she left me to do an awful lot of the things,</div><div id="00:16:59.280" class="transcript_line"> and I actually took charge of the office for about six months because she was ill</div><div id="00:17:05.280" class="transcript_line"> and I was just running the office as such.</div><div id="00:17:10.280" class="transcript_line"> So you can&#039;t discipline people and be best friends with them as well, can you? It&#039;s very difficult.</div><div id="00:17:19.280" class="transcript_line"> But I was friendly with some of them, and like I say, I&#039;m still friends with them today,</div><div id="00:17:28.280" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s fine. The two friends that I have that I&#039;m very friendly with now,</div><div id="00:17:34.280" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t actually know them that well when I worked in Palychof.</div><div id="00:17:40.280" class="transcript_line"> And they worked on the floor.</div><div id="00:17:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:44.280" class="transcript_line"> So did you find it hard to discipline people?</div><div id="00:17:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Very hard because I was only young myself, wasn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:17:52.280" class="transcript_line"> But when you have a manager standing behind you that tells you that you&#039;ve got to do it,</div><div id="00:17:59.280" class="transcript_line"> because what they used to do then was they knew that I was a bit inexperienced,</div><div id="00:18:04.280" class="transcript_line"> so they&#039;d come along and they&#039;d stand behind me, but it was I who had to do the discipline.</div><div id="00:18:09.280" class="transcript_line"> But you accept it as part of the job and you move on then, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:18:16.280" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:18:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Describe to me, you&#039;ve told me about, so you spent quite a bit of time on the factory floor.</div><div id="00:18:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did, yes.</div><div id="00:18:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Describe to me physically now what it was like, what it looked like, what it smelled like,</div><div id="00:18:35.280" class="transcript_line"> what the ambience was like.</div><div id="00:18:38.280" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say that there were any particular smells,</div><div id="00:18:43.280" class="transcript_line"> but each area had its own ambience, I suppose you would call it.</div><div id="00:18:52.280" class="transcript_line"> I was quite friendly with one of the clerks in the packing department,</div><div id="00:18:57.280" class="transcript_line"> so I used to spend some time and say good morning to a friend in the packing department.</div><div id="00:19:03.280" class="transcript_line"> That was where the men worked and that was where everything was packed</div><div id="00:19:07.280" class="transcript_line"> and went out of the factory.</div><div id="00:19:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Then you went further in and there were men who, mostly men, who did pressing.</div><div id="00:19:17.280" class="transcript_line"> There was then a small department where there were ladies and they did hand sewing.</div><div id="00:19:24.280" class="transcript_line"> And then there were the big, long aisles where the sewing machines were</div><div id="00:19:34.280" class="transcript_line"> and each one did, some of them were trousers, some of them were jackets,</div><div id="00:19:42.280" class="transcript_line"> some of them, there was a pattern department.</div><div id="00:19:47.280" class="transcript_line"> So everything was sectioned out basically.</div><div id="00:19:55.280" class="transcript_line"> The bedding department then went to a small factory</div><div id="00:20:06.280" class="transcript_line"> because they felt that there was more involved, bigger machines,</div><div id="00:20:17.280" class="transcript_line"> because they had big machines, and everything was done on a machine then.</div><div id="00:20:23.280" class="transcript_line"> They were machine embroidering on duvets and bed covers and things like that.</div><div id="00:20:37.280" class="transcript_line"> So where was that factory then?</div><div id="00:20:40.280" class="transcript_line"> That was alongside, but it was completely separate.</div><div id="00:20:44.280" class="transcript_line"> There was a manager run just that department then.</div><div id="00:20:48.280" class="transcript_line"> So did that mean that the factory got even bigger?</div><div id="00:20:52.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think it did.</div><div id="00:20:55.280" class="transcript_line"> They took more people on?</div><div id="00:20:57.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And there was a canteen and a very big canteen.</div><div id="00:21:02.280" class="transcript_line"> I remember the canteen manager.</div><div id="00:21:12.280" class="transcript_line"> I had a friend who worked as a cook in the canteen department</div><div id="00:21:19.280" class="transcript_line"> and I also remember they used to make beautiful cakes, these pineapple cakes,</div><div id="00:21:26.280" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve never ever tasted any pineapple cakes like those.</div><div id="00:21:30.280" class="transcript_line"> They were absolutely beautiful.</div><div id="00:21:33.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that kind of thing I think that you remember, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:21:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Talking about the canteen then, did everybody use the same canteen?</div><div id="00:21:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Let me think now.</div><div id="00:21:48.280" class="transcript_line"> There was a small part of it where the managers went,</div><div id="00:21:53.280" class="transcript_line"> but it was a really big canteen because they didn&#039;t stagger the lunch hour.</div><div id="00:22:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Everyone had a whole hour for lunch, so you had from 12 to 1 every day.</div><div id="00:22:13.280" class="transcript_line"> In the mornings there were approximately 40 buses that used to come into the factory to bring the people in.</div><div id="00:22:25.280" class="transcript_line"> At lunchtime there would be some buses because obviously if they were living further away they couldn&#039;t get there and back.</div><div id="00:22:32.280" class="transcript_line"> But there were a certain amount of buses that went as far as, I believe it was Astor and that kind of thing that they knew was accessible.</div><div id="00:22:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I would go home and have lunch and then come back on a factory bus.</div><div id="00:22:50.280" class="transcript_line"> Those buses were free.</div><div id="00:22:54.280" class="transcript_line"> Did they segregate in the canteen? Did everybody sit together except for the managers, you said?</div><div id="00:23:05.280" class="transcript_line"> There were tables and quite long tables, but I suppose it&#039;s like everything else.</div><div id="00:23:12.280" class="transcript_line"> If I sat, I sat with the girls from the offices because you sat with your friends and that was the way it worked, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:23:23.280" class="transcript_line"> You mixed, but only to a certain extent.</div><div id="00:23:28.280" class="transcript_line"> We used to play cards a lot in those days and play for money on a lunch time.</div><div id="00:23:36.280" class="transcript_line"> I can vividly remember that and there would be quite big arguments too if you weren&#039;t careful.</div><div id="00:23:44.280" class="transcript_line"> So what was the price of the food like? Was it reasonable?</div><div id="00:23:50.280" class="transcript_line"> It was very reasonable.</div><div id="00:23:52.280" class="transcript_line"> Was it subsidised, do you think?</div><div id="00:23:54.280" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was subsidised. I never understood it to be subsidised.</div><div id="00:24:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Did you still eat there most days, would you say?</div><div id="00:24:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally rather than most days.</div><div id="00:24:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally.</div><div id="00:24:17.280" class="transcript_line"> But then when I went there, like I say, it was about 1961, that canteen was used for a lot of things.</div><div id="00:24:29.280" class="transcript_line"> They used to have dances and things like that and the dances were held in the canteen.</div><div id="00:24:38.280" class="transcript_line"> They used to do, I remember there was workers playtime and they came there and they used to have entertainment and things even on a lunchtime for the workers.</div><div id="00:24:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Who arranged that then?</div><div id="00:25:02.280" class="transcript_line"> I believe that it was the canteen manager who did all that. He arranged that.</div><div id="00:25:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t ever remember anyone else saying that they had any hand in that.</div><div id="00:25:16.280" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t arranged by the factories then, was it? Was it encouraged by the factories?</div><div id="00:25:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Encouraged by the factories.</div><div id="00:25:26.280" class="transcript_line"> But not arranged by them?</div><div id="00:25:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, Mr Lawrence was a manager within the factory so quite probably when I think about it, possibly the food may have been subsidised to a certain extent as well.</div><div id="00:25:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Maybe not run at a profit even.</div><div id="00:25:45.280" class="transcript_line"> Because that I suppose was one of the things that you would look at if it was today.</div><div id="00:25:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Today they don&#039;t do anything unless there&#039;s profit involved do they?</div><div id="00:25:55.280" class="transcript_line"> But it certainly wasn&#039;t done for profit I don&#039;t think in those days.</div><div id="00:26:00.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember anyone ever saying anything about the canteen making money then as such.</div><div id="00:26:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Because all of the staff and everything else that were in the canteen were employed by the factory.</div><div id="00:26:16.280" class="transcript_line"> So, yes.</div><div id="00:26:20.280" class="transcript_line"> What about parties and Christmas do&#039;s?</div><div id="00:26:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, parties yes, Christmas do&#039;s yes.</div><div id="00:26:30.280" class="transcript_line"> Now, the day the factory finished, the girls were always, they always finished on a lunch, well the factory finished on a lunch time.</div><div id="00:26:44.280" class="transcript_line"> And I used to be quite gutted actually because they all used to go for lunch.</div><div id="00:26:51.280" class="transcript_line"> But they would never pay anyone their pay for them to go to lunch.</div><div id="00:27:02.280" class="transcript_line"> They had to come back by, I think it was either four o&#039;clock or five o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:27:07.280" class="transcript_line"> And they were handed, I mean in those days you didn&#039;t get money paid into the bank, you had a pay packet didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:27:15.280" class="transcript_line"> And everyone was given their pay packets when they came back in to fetch their pay.</div><div id="00:27:23.280" class="transcript_line"> If they didn&#039;t come back, they didn&#039;t have their pay.</div><div id="00:27:26.280" class="transcript_line"> It was kept then until after the holidays.</div><div id="00:27:31.280" class="transcript_line"> But, and you can imagine a lot of those girls were really, really the worst for wear.</div><div id="00:27:40.280" class="transcript_line"> And you can imagine that I can still see a lot of women and a few men.</div><div id="00:27:48.280" class="transcript_line"> And those poor men running for their lives down the factory because the women were saying,</div><div id="00:27:53.280" class="transcript_line"> I want to come back here and I want to give you a Christmas kiss.</div><div id="00:27:57.280" class="transcript_line"> You can just imagine that can&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:28:01.280" class="transcript_line"> But for myself, I used to have to then, when everyone had clocked out,</div><div id="00:28:08.280" class="transcript_line"> I would have to go and collect all the clock cards throughout the factory and sort them,</div><div id="00:28:15.280" class="transcript_line"> put them in number order and then book in whether they were late,</div><div id="00:28:21.280" class="transcript_line"> if they&#039;d been sick or whatever for that week.</div><div id="00:28:26.280" class="transcript_line"> And I was never, I was always the last one in the factory because it was something that I had to do before I was allowed to finish.</div><div id="00:28:37.280" class="transcript_line"> On Christmas Eve.</div><div id="00:28:39.280" class="transcript_line"> On Christmas Eve.</div><div id="00:28:40.280" class="transcript_line"> So they did the wages then, on Christmas Eve did they?</div><div id="00:28:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Usually, yes.</div><div id="00:28:46.280" class="transcript_line"> And were you involved in doing the wages?</div><div id="00:28:48.280" class="transcript_line"> No, I wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:28:49.280" class="transcript_line"> But you were involved in the hours and stuff like that?</div><div id="00:28:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:28:52.280" class="transcript_line"> And all the clock cards then that I had assembled and they were assembled, I think in numerical order,</div><div id="00:29:01.280" class="transcript_line"> but I would put them into bands and they went to, I think there were about eight, six or eight girls</div><div id="00:29:12.280" class="transcript_line"> in the wages department who worked out all the wages.</div><div id="00:29:16.280" class="transcript_line"> And the four men then, or the supervisors as such, would go and fetch their department&#039;s wages and pay them out.</div><div id="00:29:29.280" class="transcript_line"> So there was a handful of them and you couldn&#039;t enjoy them.</div><div id="00:29:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Where would they go then?</div><div id="00:29:37.280" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d go to the pubs.</div><div id="00:29:39.280" class="transcript_line"> The pubs.</div><div id="00:29:40.280" class="transcript_line"> The pubs and they&#039;d all go out for lunch.</div><div id="00:29:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:45.280" class="transcript_line"> In the day.</div><div id="00:29:46.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was either Christmas Eve or the day before maybe.</div><div id="00:29:49.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, I think it must have been about the Christmas Eve because they didn&#039;t in those days give you that much time off on a Christmas time, did they?</div><div id="00:29:58.280" class="transcript_line"> It would be like Christmas Eve, Boxing Day perhaps, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, anywhere back the following day.</div><div id="00:30:07.280" class="transcript_line"> What about, did they have a Christmas do anywhere then? Did you have a Christmas do?</div><div id="00:30:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to, they used to have a lot more in the factory than the girls in the offices ever did.</div><div id="00:30:20.280" class="transcript_line"> But we did have Christmas dos and this photograph that I&#039;ve got here is actually a Christmas do that was organised and was within the canteen.</div><div id="00:30:35.280" class="transcript_line"> But we also, I believe it was through the union because I know they were really involved in setting up a social club.</div><div id="00:30:51.280" class="transcript_line"> And this social club then was set up in, they bought an old vicarage and I was actually involved in doing a lot of the typing and things when the property was bought.</div><div id="00:31:04.280" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember being quite involved in that and I was allowed to go and do the typing for that because Mrs Farmer said that I was allowed.</div><div id="00:31:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:20.280" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:31:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Well we&#039;ll talk about that later on.</div><div id="00:31:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, right.</div><div id="00:31:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Because I know you&#039;ve got more to say about that as well.</div><div id="00:31:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:30.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll say, I&#039;ll say.</div><div id="00:31:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Now, what about the noise on the factory floor?</div><div id="00:31:36.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:31:38.280" class="transcript_line"> Noise, yes.</div><div id="00:31:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Was it noisy?</div><div id="00:31:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, quite noisy.</div><div id="00:31:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Noisy in that, but not loud noisy, but possibly more when the machines were going and the people were chattering.</div><div id="00:32:01.280" class="transcript_line"> They were allowed to talk.</div><div id="00:32:03.280" class="transcript_line"> And there was also, there was a tannoy system and there was always music being played on the tannoy system.</div><div id="00:32:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and nobody was ever stopped from talking because.</div><div id="00:32:18.280" class="transcript_line"> Did people used to sing as well?</div><div id="00:32:20.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:32:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Did you join in the singing?</div><div id="00:32:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh no.</div><div id="00:32:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh definitely not.</div><div id="00:32:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Why is that?</div><div id="00:32:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Because you were off your stuff or because.</div><div id="00:32:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, because I can&#039;t sing.</div><div id="00:32:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, quite, yes, they did used to sing, but I can&#039;t ever remember anyone having a wonderful voice anyway, but you would have a little chuckle as you passed them and they were singing.</div><div id="00:32:48.280" class="transcript_line"> But it was quite noisy and I don&#039;t think that because of the tannoy system and things going as well, I don&#039;t think that they talked more than they sang.</div><div id="00:33:04.280" class="transcript_line"> I think that was the way it went.</div><div id="00:33:08.280" class="transcript_line"> So it used to do these clocks.</div><div id="00:33:10.280" class="transcript_line"> What else did your working day entail of?</div><div id="00:33:13.280" class="transcript_line"> I know you used to do the pick up the clocks and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:33:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, well I would type letters.</div><div id="00:33:21.280" class="transcript_line"> I would.</div><div id="00:33:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Let me see.</div><div id="00:33:32.280" class="transcript_line"> I checked references, I interviewed late comers, I kept records for, there was a record card kept for each and every person who was employed.</div><div id="00:33:45.280" class="transcript_line"> So what was on the record card then?</div><div id="00:33:48.280" class="transcript_line"> There was an entry as to when they were employed, what they were doing, where they worked, if they were lit, if they&#039;d been reprimanded, there were all sorts of things and it was like an envelope then.</div><div id="00:34:13.280" class="transcript_line"> And if there was anything that needed to be kept, it was tucked into the envelope.</div><div id="00:34:18.280" class="transcript_line"> They checked references because very often girls would say, oh they were experienced and of course if they were experienced they got a better wage.</div><div id="00:34:28.280" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d check their references and if they weren&#039;t right, then their pay was knocked down.</div><div id="00:34:36.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was quite important.</div><div id="00:34:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to dismiss anybody yourself ever?</div><div id="00:34:50.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, a few times.</div><div id="00:34:53.280" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel about that?</div><div id="00:34:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, not good.</div><div id="00:35:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I felt that they were rather silly and I didn&#039;t feel responsible because it was their life that they were being silly about.</div><div id="00:35:16.280" class="transcript_line"> I vividly remember one particular girl who was employed in the office and she was actually stealing from other girls.</div><div id="00:35:24.280" class="transcript_line"> And you don&#039;t feel sorry for someone like that, you just feel that it&#039;s rather sad that they&#039;ve come from a tidy home and things and they&#039;ve still got to steal from friends.</div><div id="00:35:37.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just one of the facts of life, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:44.280" class="transcript_line"> So were you involved in writing references for people as well when they went to their employment?</div><div id="00:35:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:35:51.280" class="transcript_line"> More, I suppose, a pro-former type of thing and Mrs Farmer then would dictate letters to me and then as I got more experienced I would just do it myself type of thing because I knew what to do.</div><div id="00:36:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Because like I say it was more of a pro-former, they were employed and they were good workers and whatever.</div><div id="00:36:16.280" class="transcript_line"> You just go down that road then, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:36:20.280" class="transcript_line"> Was there anything that you did that you were really sorry you had to do over the years?</div><div id="00:36:29.280" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say sorry but quite frightened about.</div><div id="00:36:35.280" class="transcript_line"> I was asked or I was told by Mrs Farmer, we did sick visiting.</div><div id="00:36:44.280" class="transcript_line"> So we would go out sick visiting.</div><div id="00:36:49.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d get the chauffeur to take me so I&#039;d be off in the best car.</div><div id="00:37:01.280" class="transcript_line"> So who were you visiting on it?</div><div id="00:37:05.280" class="transcript_line"> The employees.</div><div id="00:37:07.280" class="transcript_line"> Who were sick?</div><div id="00:37:09.280" class="transcript_line"> There was one, once, twice, two particular people that I went to visit and one of them was in the mental hospital in Bridgend.</div><div id="00:37:22.280" class="transcript_line"> I was taking flowers and fruit for these people and they&#039;d been off quite a while.</div><div id="00:37:31.280" class="transcript_line"> But I can always remember going to the mental hospital.</div><div id="00:37:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Never ever been anywhere like that before because I was after all only 19, 20 years of age.</div><div id="00:37:46.280" class="transcript_line"> And being locked in a, well not so much locked in a room, but between each set of doors you went through,</div><div id="00:38:00.280" class="transcript_line"> you were locked in and seeing all these people all down the corridor.</div><div id="00:38:06.280" class="transcript_line"> And I was on my own and the blinking chauffeur said, no you&#039;re on your own, I&#039;m not coming in there with you.</div><div id="00:38:14.280" class="transcript_line"> And I said gee thanks, you know.</div><div id="00:38:17.280" class="transcript_line"> But I just, I didn&#039;t feel, well yes I was quite frightened I suppose at the time.</div><div id="00:38:25.280" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m very glad to come out of there and felt so sad for the person that was there.</div><div id="00:38:31.280" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think, I went a second time, I think it may have been to see the same lady,</div><div id="00:38:38.280" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t think she ever came back to work.</div><div id="00:38:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Sad, we had very big floods in parts of the Rhondda when I was working.</div><div id="00:38:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And we got heavily involved in helping a lot of our people because they were,</div><div id="00:39:05.280" class="transcript_line"> like we&#039;ve had now recently, they were flooded out.</div><div id="00:39:11.280" class="transcript_line"> And we had, I think I remember helping to make up parcels of food and everything else,</div><div id="00:39:23.280" class="transcript_line"> which was brought into the factory with the canteen.</div><div id="00:39:28.280" class="transcript_line"> And all these parcels of food were made up and taking them out to the people who had been flooded out,</div><div id="00:39:36.280" class="transcript_line"> that was hard, you know, because you feel you want to help people more</div><div id="00:39:42.280" class="transcript_line"> and you can&#039;t do more for one than you can for another then.</div><div id="00:39:46.280" class="transcript_line"> That I found quite hard.</div><div id="00:39:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Did that idea come from the top or from the management?</div><div id="00:39:58.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, this idea of, it sounds like quite a philanthropic thing.</div><div id="00:40:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I would have said it was quite probably from Mrs Farmer herself because she went to chapel.</div><div id="00:40:16.280" class="transcript_line"> She was quite a caring woman.</div><div id="00:40:23.280" class="transcript_line"> And yes, I suppose most of the managers and things and a lot of the girls on the factory floor,</div><div id="00:40:34.280" class="transcript_line"> and I do believe that they collected money and things for these people as well,</div><div id="00:40:39.280" class="transcript_line"> which was divided up and handed out.</div><div id="00:40:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Maybe it wasn&#039;t a lot, but it helped pay their wages because a lot of them couldn&#039;t come to work.</div><div id="00:40:50.280" class="transcript_line"> So it came from the workers and managers rather than from the bosses?</div><div id="00:40:55.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, quite possibly, but then it was, as far as I was aware, it was the managing director and that was the top.</div><div id="00:41:06.280" class="transcript_line"> As far as I was aware, there was no, I don&#039;t ever remember there being a fuss about owners coming around.</div><div id="00:41:15.280" class="transcript_line"> It was the managing director and he was the boss.</div><div id="00:41:19.280" class="transcript_line"> And who did you say that was?</div><div id="00:41:21.280" class="transcript_line"> He was a Mr Taylor.</div><div id="00:41:23.280" class="transcript_line"> And he was a very nice man.</div><div id="00:41:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Did he live locally?</div><div id="00:41:29.280" class="transcript_line"> I believe he lived in the Vale somewhere, but I can&#039;t remember anything else of that.</div><div id="00:41:41.280" class="transcript_line"> So do you think Polycov&#039;s was a good company to work for then?</div><div id="00:41:47.280" class="transcript_line"> In the early days, yes, I suppose they were.</div><div id="00:41:52.280" class="transcript_line"> They looked after the welfare very much of the girls because there was a surgery.</div><div id="00:42:03.280" class="transcript_line"> The doctor came a couple of times a week, so if the girls had any problems, the doctor was there, so they didn&#039;t have to go to the surgery.</div><div id="00:42:16.280" class="transcript_line"> What I particularly remember is when the smallpox outbreak was in the Rhondda, the factory, because there was an awful lot of worry within the valleys at that time,</div><div id="00:42:38.280" class="transcript_line"> because of course some of these people who had the smallpox were put into a hospital within the Rhondda.</div><div id="00:42:46.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember when that was?</div><div id="00:42:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, 1961.</div><div id="00:42:51.280" class="transcript_line"> They organised for everyone who wanted an immunisation against smallpox to come and have it done within the factory.</div><div id="00:43:05.280" class="transcript_line"> I was involved in doing these smallpox injections.</div><div id="00:43:11.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember, I think I was sticking plasters on everyone and helping.</div><div id="00:43:18.280" class="transcript_line"> The sister was doing one lot, the doctor was doing the other lot.</div><div id="00:43:23.280" class="transcript_line"> I remember the nurse&#039;s name now, her name was Nurse Howells.</div><div id="00:43:30.280" class="transcript_line"> I was saying to everybody, stop flapping!</div><div id="00:43:34.280" class="transcript_line"> I can also remember some of the girls, I can&#039;t have an injection like that in my arm, I have to have it in my leg.</div><div id="00:43:44.280" class="transcript_line"> People fainted.</div><div id="00:43:46.280" class="transcript_line"> You can imagine all this excitement because everyone had to leave their jobs and then come and coo and get these injections.</div><div id="00:43:55.280" class="transcript_line"> Records had to be kept as well because they had to make sure that they didn&#039;t give them to some of them twice,</div><div id="00:44:02.280" class="transcript_line"> because some of them would have had it twice if they could.</div><div id="00:44:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Anything for free!</div><div id="00:44:09.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was all done in the factory?</div><div id="00:44:13.280" class="transcript_line"> That was done within the factory.</div><div id="00:44:16.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was a huge procreate camp?</div><div id="00:44:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:44:21.280" class="transcript_line"> It took a lot of organisation.</div><div id="00:44:24.280" class="transcript_line"> We also had a problem with TB at one particular point.</div><div id="00:44:37.280" class="transcript_line"> I had a particular friend who worked in the factory and she hadn&#039;t been very well.</div><div id="00:44:45.280" class="transcript_line"> I went to the doctors and I remember saying to Mrs Farmer about it and she said,</div><div id="00:44:55.280" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if we can see if we can get the x-ray to do the TB here?</div><div id="00:45:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Which they did.</div><div id="00:45:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Everyone got an x-ray, most of the people within the factory.</div><div id="00:45:13.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was a big organisational thing as well.</div><div id="00:45:18.280" class="transcript_line"> It was found that we had, I think, about two dozen girls with TB.</div><div id="00:45:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Some of those girls actually were in hospital for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:45:37.280" class="transcript_line"> My friend was in hospital for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:45:40.280" class="transcript_line"> It was just at the beginning when they used to give penicillin for TB.</div><div id="00:45:49.280" class="transcript_line"> But they used to still keep them in hospital for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:45:54.280" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a problem and I remember going and taking fruit and flowers and things for quite a few of these girls.</div><div id="00:46:06.280" class="transcript_line"> So they wouldn&#039;t have known already about this problem?</div><div id="00:46:08.280" class="transcript_line"> No, they wouldn&#039;t have.</div><div id="00:46:10.280" class="transcript_line"> So were they all okay?</div><div id="00:46:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, I don&#039;t remember anyone dying.</div><div id="00:46:17.280" class="transcript_line"> But one friend that I have, that I&#039;m very friendly with in the village,</div><div id="00:46:25.280" class="transcript_line"> she is actually one of the girls who was in hospital and I know that Jane was in hospital for six months.</div><div id="00:46:34.280" class="transcript_line"> And they were some day longer.</div><div id="00:46:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Did polycops keep the jobs open for them?</div><div id="00:46:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they did. Yes, yes, yes. Most of the time, yes.</div><div id="00:46:50.280" class="transcript_line"> What would happen with sick pay in those days? Do you remember?</div><div id="00:46:56.280" class="transcript_line"> No sick pay. No sick pay.</div><div id="00:47:01.280" class="transcript_line"> No sick pay. I got sick pay. I got sick pay, but I couldn&#039;t tell you what.</div><div id="00:47:09.280" class="transcript_line"> But there wasn&#039;t any sick pay for people on the factory floor?</div><div id="00:47:12.280" class="transcript_line"> No sick pay for the people on the factory floor.</div><div id="00:47:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Why do you think there was a, why did they differentiate, do you think?</div><div id="00:47:21.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, maybe because it was, it would have been a very expensive outlay.</div><div id="00:47:33.280" class="transcript_line"> And maybe the factory didn&#039;t run on that kind of off scale, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:47:41.280" class="transcript_line"> It was accepted practice, wasn&#039;t it, in those days?</div><div id="00:47:46.280" class="transcript_line"> No, the managers got sick pay and things, I&#039;m positive of that.</div><div id="00:47:53.280" class="transcript_line"> But I can&#039;t actually remember, as far as I was concerned, being ill.</div><div id="00:48:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Because when you&#039;re young, most of the time anyway, in touch with, you&#039;re not ill as you are when you get older, are you?</div><div id="00:48:10.280" class="transcript_line"> But no, I don&#039;t remember anyone getting sick pay as such.</div><div id="00:48:17.280" class="transcript_line"> What was the position of, you know, did you get sick pay from the government?</div><div id="00:48:23.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:48:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, you had National Insurance, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:48:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Because when you were pregnant, you got 11 weeks maternity pay.</div><div id="00:48:42.280" class="transcript_line"> But not from the company?</div><div id="00:48:44.280" class="transcript_line"> But not from the company, no.</div><div id="00:48:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:48:48.280" class="transcript_line"> No, and as with today, they keep your job open and they pay you maternity pay and things within the way you&#039;re working.</div><div id="00:49:01.280" class="transcript_line"> But in those days they didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:49:03.280" class="transcript_line"> It was what you, the maternity pay you had was from the government and that was it.</div><div id="00:49:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of the differential in pay between men and women in the factory?</div><div id="00:49:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, definitely. Oh, definitely the men were paid.</div><div id="00:49:19.280" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be perhaps women working alongside the men and they would be paid less.</div><div id="00:49:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you know how much less?</div><div id="00:49:28.280" class="transcript_line"> No, not off the top of my head. I couldn&#039;t know. But I know they were paid less.</div><div id="00:49:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what happened when, were you there when the Equal Pay Act came?</div><div id="00:49:38.280" class="transcript_line"> No, no, that was 1975, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:49:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Was it 70?</div><div id="00:49:43.280" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, because I finished in 1964.</div><div id="00:49:51.280" class="transcript_line"> OK. And what was I going to say? Right, you told them about the union.</div><div id="00:49:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Now, there was an union in, they were members of the union.</div><div id="00:50:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a very strong union, yes.</div><div id="00:50:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Garment Workers?</div><div id="00:50:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Garment Workers Union, yes.</div><div id="00:50:05.280" class="transcript_line"> And were you a member of the union?</div><div id="00:50:07.280" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:50:08.280" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have an office union?</div><div id="00:50:10.280" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no office union.</div><div id="00:50:12.280" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel about that?</div><div id="00:50:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Never even thought about it.</div><div id="00:50:17.280" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t even suggested, I suppose, in those days. It was just accepted practice.</div><div id="00:50:25.280" class="transcript_line"> If you worked in an office, you didn&#039;t belong to a union.</div><div id="00:50:29.280" class="transcript_line"> I had quite a lot of dealings with the union, obviously, through the girls on the factory floor.</div><div id="00:50:37.280" class="transcript_line"> And always there was a...</div><div id="00:50:42.280" class="transcript_line"> How did those dealings go?</div><div id="00:50:45.280" class="transcript_line"> Always well.

You enjoyed it.</div><div id="01:01:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Was that in the chapel that was brought in?</div><div id="01:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a vicarage.</div><div id="01:01:34.280" class="transcript_line"> What happened to it?</div><div id="01:01:36.280" class="transcript_line"> The vicarage is still there but it&#039;s more or less derelict now.</div><div id="01:01:41.280" class="transcript_line"> It was way before Polycops finished.</div><div id="01:01:48.280" class="transcript_line"> I think they may have sold it even because it was actually owned by the people.</div><div id="01:01:58.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure it was because in those days the girls used to give to the social club.</div><div id="01:02:05.280" class="transcript_line"> They paid out of their wages.</div><div id="01:02:09.280" class="transcript_line"> We all did.</div><div id="01:02:12.280" class="transcript_line"> When we went to London, the social club paid for that trip because we were paying out of our wages for that.</div><div id="01:02:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Originally the premises were bought.</div><div id="01:02:31.280" class="transcript_line"> I believe they had a mortgage and whatever.</div><div id="01:02:35.280" class="transcript_line"> But it was paid out of the wages of the people within the factory.</div><div id="01:02:47.280" class="transcript_line"> What was the proportion of single women and married women who worked?</div><div id="01:02:57.280" class="transcript_line"> Were there a lot of married women working?</div><div id="01:03:00.280" class="transcript_line"> There were quite a lot of married women, yes.</div><div id="01:03:05.280" class="transcript_line"> My sister-in-law worked there for many years.</div><div id="01:03:12.280" class="transcript_line"> When you got pregnant, your job wasn&#039;t kept open for you.</div><div id="01:03:17.280" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t paid maternity pay or anything in those days so you had to finish.</div><div id="01:03:22.280" class="transcript_line"> But if you wanted to go back to work then and there was a job there, then they would give you a job.</div><div id="01:03:30.280" class="transcript_line"> It could quite possibly not be something that you&#039;d done before.</div><div id="01:03:35.280" class="transcript_line"> But so long as you were a machinist, you were offered the job.</div><div id="01:03:43.280" class="transcript_line"> But there was also a training department within the factory run by a lady called Kate, a single lady.</div><div id="01:03:55.280" class="transcript_line"> She trained all of the girls who came in to school, 15-year-olds.</div><div id="01:04:04.280" class="transcript_line"> She handled all those girls.</div><div id="01:04:09.280" class="transcript_line"> She handled it with a rod of iron.</div><div id="01:04:13.280" class="transcript_line"> They had to listen to what they were told.</div><div id="01:04:16.280" class="transcript_line"> Because of course it could be quite dangerous.</div><div id="01:04:20.280" class="transcript_line"> If you had a friend, as he was saying this Saturday because we were talking about it,</div><div id="01:04:26.280" class="transcript_line"> she said you weren&#039;t classed as a machinist until you&#039;d had a needle in your
