    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.640" class="transcript_line"> Of course, while at Lambeter, we moved there in late 1939,</div><div id="00:00:08.760" class="transcript_line"> and ultimately the Battle of Britain took place.</div><div id="00:00:12.360" class="transcript_line"> I was about, I think, at that time, getting on 16 or 17,</div><div id="00:00:17.480" class="transcript_line"> and we used to follow the course of the battle on the radio,</div><div id="00:00:22.200" class="transcript_line"> and I always remember a marvelous score by the RAF,</div><div id="00:00:28.160" class="transcript_line"> 183 aircraft, German aircraft, shot down,</div><div id="00:00:32.640" class="transcript_line"> which turned out to be a little on the high side,</div><div id="00:00:37.400" class="transcript_line"> but I remember all the boys were cheering</div><div id="00:00:41.840" class="transcript_line"> and were very chuffed at that happening.</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> 1940, I found myself stationed at Duxford</div><div id="00:00:55.600" class="transcript_line"> on the actual time of the Battle of Britain.</div><div id="00:01:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Duxford was in, I think it was known as Twelve Group,</div><div id="00:01:10.560" class="transcript_line"> which really looked after the air control of the Midlands, really,</div><div id="00:01:19.880" class="transcript_line"> but below it was Eleven Group,</div><div id="00:01:23.040" class="transcript_line"> and both were obviously in close relation.</div><div id="00:01:27.600" class="transcript_line"> The radio operator was at the back of the control room,</div><div id="00:01:33.080" class="transcript_line"> and the control room consisted of a plotting board</div><div id="00:01:38.920" class="transcript_line"> with WAF lady plotters, a senior RAF officer controller,</div><div id="00:01:48.120" class="transcript_line"> alongside him was an army officer,</div><div id="00:01:51.720" class="transcript_line"> and a good, great collection of a naval presence.</div><div id="00:01:57.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not too sure about that, but anyway, behind all this,</div><div id="00:02:04.760" class="transcript_line"> maintaining the air traffic conversation and recording it</div><div id="00:02:12.480" class="transcript_line"> were the radio operators.</div><div id="00:02:16.960" class="transcript_line"> I spent a couple of months, I think it was,</div><div id="00:02:23.960" class="transcript_line"> during the Battle of Britain.</div><div id="00:02:26.080" class="transcript_line"> I can remember dog fights up above,</div><div id="00:02:29.920" class="transcript_line"> and Duxford itself was bombed and damaged once or twice,</div><div id="00:02:39.280" class="transcript_line"> but I wouldn&#039;t have described it as being heavily bombed</div><div id="00:02:45.920" class="transcript_line"> as I was to experience later in my RAF career,</div><div id="00:02:53.720" class="transcript_line"> where I spent most of the war on a different branch</div><div id="00:03:01.360" class="transcript_line"> of radio operating on the island of Malta.</div><div id="00:03:09.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember the blitz very clearly, the Battle of Britain.</div><div id="00:03:14.720" class="transcript_line"> I saw dog fights occasionally overhead,</div><div id="00:03:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and then I was conscripted into the WAF</div><div id="00:03:25.640" class="transcript_line"> and started off at Horn Church in the Ops Room,</div><div id="00:03:30.680" class="transcript_line"> but it wasn&#039;t there long before the Ops Room was closed down</div><div id="00:03:34.640" class="transcript_line"> and we were all transferred to North Weald.</div><div id="00:03:38.160" class="transcript_line"> What were you doing at Horn Church?</div><div id="00:03:41.960" class="transcript_line"> I was a plotter.</div><div id="00:03:44.760" class="transcript_line"> And what does that mean?</div><div id="00:03:46.880" class="transcript_line"> You wore the headphones and you got a table, a plotting table,</div><div id="00:03:52.480" class="transcript_line"> and you had lots of little arrows of different colours,</div><div id="00:03:56.080" class="transcript_line"> and every five minutes they were changed.</div><div id="00:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> You plotted the position of the hostiles and the friendlies.</div><div id="00:04:03.760" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t do that for long</div><div id="00:04:09.200" class="transcript_line"> because they knew that I had drawing office experience,</div><div id="00:04:13.480" class="transcript_line"> and so I was asked to assist the draftsman,</div><div id="00:04:17.520" class="transcript_line"> who was a great one for playing table tennis</div><div id="00:04:21.280" class="transcript_line"> if anyone was off duty.</div><div id="00:04:23.480" class="transcript_line"> So I assisted him for a week and I was deemed responsible,</div><div id="00:04:29.520" class="transcript_line"> and he was posted overseas,</div><div id="00:04:31.920" class="transcript_line"> and I took over all the work of the drawing office.</div><div id="00:04:36.360" class="transcript_line"> But we weren&#039;t there for long when we were transferred</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> to North Weald.</div><div id="00:04:41.440" class="transcript_line"> The Ops Room there was a big country house called Blake Hill,</div><div id="00:04:45.440" class="transcript_line"> away from the airfield for obvious reasons.</div><div id="00:04:49.320" class="transcript_line"> And it looked like a big country farm.</div><div id="00:04:53.560" class="transcript_line"> There were cattle grazing in the fields,</div><div id="00:04:57.600" class="transcript_line"> and our huts were, well, it was called the rockery</div><div id="00:05:02.040" class="transcript_line"> because we were amongst the trees,</div><div id="00:05:03.920" class="transcript_line"> so we weren&#039;t really noticed from the air.</div><div id="00:05:07.640" class="transcript_line"> And the rooks used to roost in the tops of the trees,</div><div id="00:05:13.360" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s why we were called the rockery.</div><div id="00:05:16.080" class="transcript_line"> And it was very interesting work there.</div><div id="00:05:26.080" class="transcript_line"> The Battle of Burton, of course,</div><div id="00:05:27.720" class="transcript_line"> when the air war did get going,</div><div id="00:05:33.440" class="transcript_line"> we saw, I suppose, quite a lot of it in London.</div><div id="00:05:38.160" class="transcript_line"> And the coastal towns, like Cardiff, for instance,</div><div id="00:05:45.240" class="transcript_line"> was right in their sights.</div><div id="00:05:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it seemed in London,</div><div id="00:05:50.840" class="transcript_line"> we did get a lot of air activity there.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We could see the Germans coming over.</div><div id="00:05:56.680" class="transcript_line"> No, the first we saw of them,</div><div id="00:05:58.240" class="transcript_line"> because they used to come over at night.</div><div id="00:06:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And we knew they were Germans,</div><div id="00:06:04.640" class="transcript_line"> by the sounds of their engines.</div><div id="00:06:07.680" class="transcript_line"> But at the time,</div><div id="00:06:09.120" class="transcript_line"> there seemed to be no anti-aircraft activity at all.</div><div id="00:06:14.520" class="transcript_line"> And the people would be out in the streets saying,</div><div id="00:06:18.520" class="transcript_line"> where&#039;s the guns, where&#039;s the guns?</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were really bitter about it.</div><div id="00:06:26.440" class="transcript_line"> There was no opposition to these aircraft.</div><div id="00:06:29.240" class="transcript_line"> They were flying around.</div><div id="00:06:30.920" class="transcript_line"> But the thing was, it didn&#039;t drop any bombs.</div><div id="00:06:33.240" class="transcript_line"> They must&#039;ve been on reconnaissance, you see,</div><div id="00:06:38.080" class="transcript_line"> flying the job up.</div><div id="00:06:39.760" class="transcript_line"> And then suddenly, from being no air activity,</div><div id="00:06:46.120" class="transcript_line"> from somewhere they produced and set up,</div><div id="00:06:49.040" class="transcript_line"> terrific gun barrage.</div><div id="00:06:51.360" class="transcript_line"> And everybody was out in the street cheering the guns.</div><div id="00:06:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Not thinking of falling shrapnel from the shells,</div><div id="00:07:00.040" class="transcript_line"> which could&#039;ve killed you with certain,</div><div id="00:07:02.200" class="transcript_line"> certainly there were a lot of people killed</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> through falling shrapnel.</div><div id="00:07:08.280" class="transcript_line"> But it really put a new life into the people</div><div id="00:07:10.960" class="transcript_line"> that at last they&#039;ve started doing something about it.</div><div id="00:07:18.680" class="transcript_line"> And of course, being young and dull,</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I knew that every bomb dropped in Pembrokeshire,</div><div id="00:07:25.600" class="transcript_line"> because I used to go there and have a look at it,</div><div id="00:07:28.280" class="transcript_line"> and have a look, great nosy.</div><div id="00:07:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But one night in particular, they were dropping the bombs.</div><div id="00:07:34.640" class="transcript_line"> And I was standing outside the door as usual.</div><div id="00:07:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Most of the firemen were inside.</div><div id="00:07:43.400" class="transcript_line"> And I spotted this big parachute coming down.</div><div id="00:07:47.520" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh look, I said, there&#039;s a parachute coming down.</div><div id="00:07:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Next meant there was this almighty flash, purple and blue.</div><div id="00:07:56.720" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember like today,</div><div id="00:08:00.240" class="transcript_line"> it punched the blast, punched me in the chest.</div><div id="00:08:04.320" class="transcript_line"> I went flying backwards,</div><div id="00:08:06.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember no more after that.</div><div id="00:08:08.120" class="transcript_line"> But apparently the men said,</div><div id="00:08:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I went past him like a rocket into the fire station,</div><div id="00:08:15.080" class="transcript_line"> behind the fire engine, and finished up in the corner.</div><div id="00:08:19.640" class="transcript_line"> And of course, with all the stuff that was on the shelves,</div><div id="00:08:22.800" class="transcript_line"> it all came down on top of me,</div><div id="00:08:25.440" class="transcript_line"> and put some paint and all that.</div><div id="00:08:28.080" class="transcript_line"> But luckily none of them opened up.</div><div id="00:08:31.240" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t remember any more of it</div><div id="00:08:33.640" class="transcript_line"> until I woke up in the control room</div><div id="00:08:36.480" class="transcript_line"> on one of the camp beds,</div><div id="00:08:38.920" class="transcript_line"> and one of the telephone girls washing my mouth out</div><div id="00:08:43.480" class="transcript_line"> and my face, because there was so much dust everywhere.</div><div id="00:08:48.480" class="transcript_line"> I was nearly blinded with it.</div><div id="00:08:51.280" class="transcript_line"> And I got up, none the worse,</div><div id="00:08:53.200" class="transcript_line"> once I got on my feet, I was okay.</div></div></p>
