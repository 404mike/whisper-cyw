    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always been involved in communal activity, whether it be Jewish or non-Jewish.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always been active. So when my son Daniel was born and went to school, I was involved from the first year in the Parents Teachers Association.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And with my links obviously to the warehouse, I could give the school a more advantageous prices and they could buy it normally.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I became the social chair for quite a while and we used to do summer fates.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I also used to sell fireworks, so I started doing firework displays and I used to do the firework display at the local school.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was also then involved in the King Coydon Lakeside Festival, which brought the whole community together.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I worked with local councillors, other parents, volunteers, governors.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And when Daniel left Lakeside, one of the projects we&#039;d undertaken before he left was to convert a disused swimming pool into one of the first after-school clubs in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And we created Dragonflies. And Dragonflies I still think is thriving today.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an after-school club that allows parents who are working to drop their children off at school early, maybe from about seven quarters to eight, prior to school.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the workers would then pick up the children from school and keep them until five, six o&#039;clock at night when the parents finished work.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was an amazing facility ahead of its time. We were very much ahead of its time.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We actually got Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson to open it because new regulations had come in where we had to have all facilities to cater for disabled access.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And Tanni had just become a local Paralympian. And she was brought in.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Her family lived in the Heath and she came, she agreed to come and open the centre for us.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a great achievement. And I was still involved with the organisation and the running of that group even after five years after Daniel had left Lakeside and moved on to Cardiff High.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he moved on to Cardiff High, I was involved with the Parents Teacher Association there.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And up until this year, I mean Daniel&#039;s 34 now, so he left school when he was 18, 16 years later, some of the work that I used to do on a...not even work.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was one of the jobs I used to do as an MC, a Toastmaster. And I did it for friends and family, for events and I did it for the school prom.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So they decided to start a prom I think in about...when Daniel was in about Form 5, so about two years before he actually got up to the top of the school.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did the Toastmaster work for that. And then even after he had left, I carried on until last year doing that work on a voluntary basis.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I do it because it gave me the opportunity. I have a principle that if you can give back something from something you&#039;ve received from, it will help pay back what&#039;s been received.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So when Daniel was taking from the school his education and I was able to give back something back to the school, then I was always pleased to do so. So I&#039;ve always supported that.</div></div></p>
