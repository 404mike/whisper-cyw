    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the 21st of June 2019 and I&#039;m with Mrs. Elizabeth Lewis at her home in Rida.</div><div id="00:00:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had a previous chat but we&#039;ll just continue a little bit more.</div><div id="00:00:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Now Elizabeth, you grew up in Liverpool, Welsh parents, Welsh speaking, so how come you were</div><div id="00:00:22.080" class="transcript_line"> in Liverpool?</div><div id="00:00:23.080" class="transcript_line"> Why did you go there?</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, why did your parents go to Liverpool?</div><div id="00:00:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, my father was brought up in Liverpool.</div><div id="00:00:31.400" class="transcript_line"> His parents came from Anglesey so they brought up their children in Liverpool because he</div><div id="00:00:36.720" class="transcript_line"> came there to work as a builder.</div><div id="00:00:39.120" class="transcript_line"> There was no work in Anglesey at the time so they&#039;d be brought up in Liverpool but they</div><div id="00:00:44.360" class="transcript_line"> were all Welsh speaking.</div><div id="00:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And your mum also, she lived in Liverpool?</div><div id="00:00:49.960" class="transcript_line"> She went there to work really because there was no work around here.</div><div id="00:00:54.880" class="transcript_line"> Right, so Liverpool was a good meeting place as well as a good place to work then, yes.</div><div id="00:01:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And can you remember what part of Liverpool you actually grew up in?</div><div id="00:01:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Waver tree.</div><div id="00:01:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Waver tree.</div><div id="00:01:06.120" class="transcript_line"> It was near Sefton Park really, it was between the two.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s lovely that you were speaking Welsh and English in Liverpool, yes.</div><div id="00:01:16.480" class="transcript_line"> And then at a fairly early age you and your sister were evacuated to somewhere near Machynlleth.</div><div id="00:01:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:23.840" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel about that?</div><div id="00:01:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember much about that?</div><div id="00:01:26.320" class="transcript_line"> I thought we were quite excited to begin with, like a holiday, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:31.120" class="transcript_line"> I see, well something comes out of everything.</div><div id="00:01:33.120" class="transcript_line"> We like being in the country.</div><div id="00:01:36.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you did, yes.</div><div id="00:01:38.360" class="transcript_line"> It was very much a farming community there at Llylodglyn, is that what you called it?</div><div id="00:01:43.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Llylodglyn.</div><div id="00:01:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Small holdings and there were a couple of big farms as well.</div><div id="00:01:47.840" class="transcript_line"> A very rural area I would imagine.</div><div id="00:01:50.600" class="transcript_line"> Was that Montgomeryshire then?</div><div id="00:01:51.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Montgomeryshire, yes.</div><div id="00:01:53.960" class="transcript_line"> And was much Welsh spoken in that area?</div><div id="00:01:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was all Welsh really.</div><div id="00:01:58.240" class="transcript_line"> All Welsh.</div><div id="00:01:59.240" class="transcript_line"> You fitted in very nicely there, no language problems.</div><div id="00:02:01.720" class="transcript_line"> And now it&#039;s all English.</div><div id="00:02:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Things have changed haven&#039;t they, yes.</div><div id="00:02:06.440" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of things did you do, you and your sister, when you were at the Llylodglyn</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> farm?</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you involved with any household chores?</div><div id="00:02:16.920" class="transcript_line"> We were out more than we were in really.</div><div id="00:02:19.880" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d milk and feed the cows and clean out the pig and the hedges and things.</div><div id="00:02:26.480" class="transcript_line"> Always getting sticks for the fire because there was no other way of heating anything.</div><div id="00:02:30.160" class="transcript_line"> There was a wood near, we used to go up there and bring these branches down.</div><div id="00:02:35.160" class="transcript_line"> We always had to be sawing sticks every evening or something.</div><div id="00:02:38.280" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t allowed to be sit idle.</div><div id="00:02:39.760" class="transcript_line"> We had to be doing something.</div><div id="00:02:42.760" class="transcript_line"> It certainly sounds as though you weren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:44.720" class="transcript_line"> What about chores in the home, bread making etc.?</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was mostly my mother&#039;s made the bread and tarts and that.</div><div id="00:02:54.120" class="transcript_line"> And did you and your sister help with the bread making?</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to help.</div><div id="00:02:59.520" class="transcript_line"> And then of course the other two sisters were three years younger.</div><div id="00:03:03.480" class="transcript_line"> They were there as well.</div><div id="00:03:05.480" class="transcript_line"> It was a lot of work really.</div><div id="00:03:07.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure, so you must have used one of these old ovens.</div><div id="00:03:11.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had a big bread oven.</div><div id="00:03:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you help with the kneading of it?</div><div id="00:03:16.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, we did sometimes, not always, but we knew how to do it.</div><div id="00:03:21.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:03:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you make anything else?</div><div id="00:03:23.520" class="transcript_line"> Jam, cheese, butter, anything like that?</div><div id="00:03:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Butter, yes.</div><div id="00:03:26.720" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t make cheese, we made butter.</div><div id="00:03:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Is butter quite easy to make?</div><div id="00:03:32.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is really.</div><div id="00:03:35.600" class="transcript_line"> How long a process was that?</div><div id="00:03:37.080" class="transcript_line"> We were in a journey, it might take about 20 minutes or so.</div><div id="00:03:41.760" class="transcript_line"> And then we got it into shape after.</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Right, so you must have had a very happy time there really.</div><div id="00:03:51.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did really.</div><div id="00:03:52.480" class="transcript_line"> Although it was wartime.</div><div id="00:03:54.480" class="transcript_line"> We like being on the farm, we were quite excited about that.</div><div id="00:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> You certainly make a change from Liverpool&#039;s.</div><div id="00:04:01.800" class="transcript_line"> In fact they must have been really pleased in a way that you were there to be so useful.</div><div id="00:04:06.880" class="transcript_line"> Around the place.</div><div id="00:04:07.880" class="transcript_line"> It could be.</div><div id="00:04:08.880" class="transcript_line"> When you came to live in Kevin Kaido, when you married Alan, what type of farm was Kevin Kaido?</div><div id="00:04:18.880" class="transcript_line"> A mixed farm really.</div><div id="00:04:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Cattle and sheep.</div><div id="00:04:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Did you have many people helping you on the farm?</div><div id="00:04:26.880" class="transcript_line"> There were always a couple of men on them, working there as well.</div><div id="00:04:30.920" class="transcript_line"> Of course everything was so slow then, not like today, you pull a tractor and it whizzes around.</div><div id="00:04:36.920" class="transcript_line"> Things do take a bit longer then I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:04:40.920" class="transcript_line"> What sort of building was it?</div><div id="00:04:43.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard Kevin Kaido described it as a hall.</div><div id="00:04:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Was it a very big, spacious place?</div><div id="00:04:50.920" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t really that big I don&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:04:53.920" class="transcript_line"> The walls were so thick, deep, it looked bigger from the outside than when you went inside.</div><div id="00:04:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Have you been there?</div><div id="00:05:02.960" class="transcript_line"> I have, yes.</div><div id="00:05:03.960" class="transcript_line"> I do remember visiting you.</div><div id="00:05:05.960" class="transcript_line"> A long time ago.</div><div id="00:05:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you have many outhouses at all?</div><div id="00:05:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there were quite a few there.</div><div id="00:05:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Not as many as now of course.</div><div id="00:05:16.960" class="transcript_line"> How did your life on the farm change?</div><div id="00:05:19.960" class="transcript_line"> You said you probably didn&#039;t have very much in the way of mod cons to begin with.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t have electricity or anything like that.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember as soon as we had electricity, about a year after I was married,</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I had this whole world, I thought it was marvellous.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was so much easier then it had been before.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure, yes.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose shearing would have been a very busy time for you every year,</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> something to look forward to.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> How many people were involved with that sort of thing?</div><div id="00:05:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Between 20 and 30 I would think, roughly.</div><div id="00:05:56.040" class="transcript_line"> I did the hand shearing, it took quite a bit of time.</div><div id="00:06:00.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s wonderful to watch people shearing by hand, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:05.040" class="transcript_line"> Of course you&#039;d have to provide a meal for them, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And cider.</div><div id="00:06:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Cider, that sounds okay.</div><div id="00:06:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Did you have your own press there?</div><div id="00:06:16.040" class="transcript_line"> We had a bottle of cider there.</div><div id="00:06:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Did you make the cider?</div><div id="00:06:20.040" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:21.080" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Cider would be lovely, very thirst quenching, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:06:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:27.080" class="transcript_line"> Can you think of anything else that really was significant</div><div id="00:06:30.080" class="transcript_line"> in the way things changed in farming matters?</div><div id="00:06:34.080" class="transcript_line"> In the household?</div><div id="00:06:35.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, both really.</div><div id="00:06:37.080" class="transcript_line"> In the household, electricity was the biggest thing,</div><div id="00:06:39.080" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t washing the clothes and that.</div><div id="00:06:41.080" class="transcript_line"> It was so much easier to have electricity.</div><div id="00:06:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Before it was, I think, it was carbon gas and things like that,</div><div id="00:06:49.120" class="transcript_line"> but it was pretty hopeless, really.</div><div id="00:06:52.120" class="transcript_line"> You had to manage somehow.</div><div id="00:06:54.120" class="transcript_line"> But everybody was the same.</div><div id="00:06:57.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to imagine, really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Living without these things that we take.</div><div id="00:07:02.120" class="transcript_line"> It would be quite cold in the winter without central heating.</div><div id="00:07:05.120" class="transcript_line"> No central heating or anything.</div><div id="00:07:07.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:07:09.120" class="transcript_line"> So now your son farms, of course, Kevin Kaido.</div><div id="00:07:12.120" class="transcript_line"> How quickly does he get things like the shearing done?</div><div id="00:07:15.120" class="transcript_line"> All in a day now.</div><div id="00:07:16.120" class="transcript_line"> All in a day, with much help?</div><div id="00:07:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot.</div><div id="00:07:19.160" class="transcript_line"> It was just the two boys, Barry and my grandsons,</div><div id="00:07:23.160" class="transcript_line"> and Arlene, and one other boy.</div><div id="00:07:26.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:07:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Things have certainly changed, yes.</div><div id="00:07:31.160" class="transcript_line"> And so your grandchildren now,</div><div id="00:07:33.160" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve become Welsh speakers, I would imagine.</div><div id="00:07:36.160" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them have.</div><div id="00:07:38.160" class="transcript_line"> There are two of them teaching Welsh,</div><div id="00:07:41.160" class="transcript_line"> teaching in Breda, through the medium of Welsh.</div><div id="00:07:44.160" class="transcript_line"> And yet they hadn&#039;t been brought up Welsh.</div><div id="00:07:47.200" class="transcript_line"> And the other one, she&#039;s in Carmarthen now, she&#039;s married,</div><div id="00:07:50.200" class="transcript_line"> she was teaching through the medium of Welsh.</div><div id="00:07:53.200" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s surprising how they&#039;d learn to just go to school.</div><div id="00:07:57.200" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have it at home.</div><div id="00:07:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, things have certainly changed.</div><div id="00:08:01.200" class="transcript_line"> It looks as though we&#039;ve almost come full circle now with Welsh.</div><div id="00:08:05.200" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s more Welsh rap now than ever, I think,</div><div id="00:08:08.200" class="transcript_line"> than we had before.</div><div id="00:08:09.200" class="transcript_line"> I think so, everything has changed.</div><div id="00:08:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of it&#039;s all the speak Welsh now,</div><div id="00:08:13.200" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s only from going to school.</div><div id="00:08:15.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t have it at home.</div><div id="00:08:17.240" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re surprised at how much.</div><div id="00:08:19.240" class="transcript_line"> They were singing in Welsh on Wednesday.</div><div id="00:08:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Nursery children were in the...</div><div id="00:08:24.240" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the name?</div><div id="00:08:26.240" class="transcript_line"> The Maithrin, is it?</div><div id="00:08:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Some nursery, they were between one and four.</div><div id="00:08:31.240" class="transcript_line"> They came to the drop-in,</div><div id="00:08:33.240" class="transcript_line"> which we have after the Lutsen Club.</div><div id="00:08:36.240" class="transcript_line"> And they were all these little tuts,</div><div id="00:08:38.240" class="transcript_line"> and they were singing in Welsh.</div><div id="00:08:40.240" class="transcript_line"> That is lovely, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:42.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they were all full of beans.</div><div id="00:08:44.280" class="transcript_line"> They were all very young, and that&#039;s when you learn it.</div><div id="00:08:47.280" class="transcript_line"> All right, well, thank you very much for your time,</div><div id="00:08:50.280" class="transcript_line"> Elizabeth, and I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll meet again for another chat.</div><div id="00:08:54.280" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:08:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
