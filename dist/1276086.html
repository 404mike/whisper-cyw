    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is a timeline of the race riots in USA in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It is not a breakdown of all the events in 1919 in America.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll come back to that.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That timeline of events, the race riots, it became known as the Red Summer.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So let&#039;s just go through those events.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> February to May.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 8th of February, Georgia, Blakely.</div><div id="00:00:34.000"

id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And so was the loss of life, lynching, etc.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll be more descriptive about that when we look at individual events.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But in June 19, there was the 13th of June, Tennessee, in Memphis.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> On the

Then in July, it was a tragically busy month.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The 5th, Pennsylvania, Scranton.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 6th,

id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And Maryland, Baltimore.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If you look at the headlines for that time period,</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> the mourning world herald, mob in Omaha,</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Lynch&#039;s Negro Attempts to Hang Mayor Smith.</div><div id="00:04:01.000"

class="transcript_line"> at 5 o&#039;clock this afternoon.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> 3,000 mob will burn Negro.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in advance of the event.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Lynched by Florida mob, Negro&#039;s body riddled with bullets</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> found on tree by passes by Lake City, November 29th.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the American policy in 1919 hardly was likely</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> to encourage an end to these events.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> President Wilson saw Bolshevism as a mistake</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> that had to be resisted and corrected.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> He had two main priorities in 1919.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> One, to create what we now call the United Nations.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And two, to end the Iraq War.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He believed the revolution in Russia was worse than anything</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> represented by the Kaiser.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And that the Bolsheviks were, quote,</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> a group of men more cruel than the Tsar himself.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> A communist regime meant, according to Wilson,</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> government by terror, government by force,</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> not government by vote.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, it ruled by the poison of disorder,</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> the poison of revolt, the poison of the revolution.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> As a result, the poison of revolt, the poison of chaos.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, the president believed, the negation of everything</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> that is American and had to be opposed.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s step back to one of those remarks.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> The Bolsheviks were a group of men more cruel</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> than the Tsar himself.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s some admission, in case of who you&#039;re supporting.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby,</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> wrote that the US policy was based on the premise</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> that the present rulers of Russia do not rule</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> by the will or the consent of any considerable portion</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> of the Russian people.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The Bolsheviks had falsely seized power and were using,</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> quote, the machinery of government with savage oppression</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> to maintain themselves in power.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Moreover, the, quote, existing regime in Russia</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> is based upon the negation of every principle of honor</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and good faith and every usage and convention</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> underlying the whole structure of international law.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It was therefore not possible for the government</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> of the United States to recognize the present rulers of Russia.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Americans were involved in the Russian Civil War.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The North Russia Expeditionary Force,</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> also known as the Polar Bear Expedition,</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> sent approximately 8,000 personnel from the US Army,</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> including the 310th Engineers, the 339th Infantry,</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> the 337th Field Hospital, and its ambulance company.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Also the 167th and 168th Railroad Companies,</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> which were sent to Mermenst</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> to operate the Mermenst to Petrograd Line.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The US Navy sent the cruiser USS Olympia</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> during August and September,</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> including 53 personnel who were attached to British units.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Now Woodrow Wilson, the president,</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> said much about black people during the time.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It is important to know where he comes from.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a southern president.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> His family historically were involved in the Civil War</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> on the Confederate side.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> During his first time in office, he passed a law,</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> that was in 1912, the law was passed</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> making racial intermarriage a felony</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> in the District of Columbia, Washington.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> His new postmaster general also ordered</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> that his Washington offices be segregated</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> with the Treasury and Navy soon doing the same.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Suddenly photographs were required</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> for all applicants for federal jobs.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And when pressed by Black leaders, Wilson replied,</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> the purpose of these measures was to reduce the friction.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It is as far as possible from being a movement</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> against the Negroes.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I sincerely believe it to be in their interests.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the main organ of control in many people&#039;s view</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> was the FBI and the press.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> During the Chicago riots,</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> the press learned from the Department of Justice</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> officials that the international workers and Bolsheviks</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> were, quote, spreading propaganda to breed race hatred.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The FBI reported that leftist views</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> were winning converts in the Black community</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and that the NAACP was urging color people</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> to incest upon equality with white people</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and to resort to force if necessary.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> J. Edgar Hoover, who was a lower grade officer</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> at that time in the FBI,</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> analyzed the riots for the attorney general.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He blamed the July Washington, D.C. riots</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> on numerous assaults committed by Negroes upon white women.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> We, of course, heard this before.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> For the October event in Arkansas,</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> he blamed certain local agitation in a Negro lodge.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> A more general cause, he cited,</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> was propaganda of a radical nature.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He charged that socialists were feeding propaganda</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> to Black-owned magazines such as The Messenger,</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> which in turn aroused their Black leaders.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> On November 17, the attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> reported to Congress on the threat that anarchists</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and Bolsheviks posed to the government.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Identifying radicalism in the Black community</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and the open defiance Black leaders advocated</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> in response to racial violence in the summer&#039;s rioting.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It faulted the leadership of the Bolsheviks</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> for an ill-governed reaction towards race-riding.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> In all discussions of recent race riots against Blacks,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> there is reflected the note of pride</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> that a Negro has found himself, that he has fought back,</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> that never again will he tamely submit</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> to violence and intimidation.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It described the dangerous spirit of defiance</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and vengeance of work amongst Negroes.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, President Woodrow Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia,</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and he spent his early years in Augusta, Georgia, Columbia,</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and South Carolina.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So all across the United States in 1919,</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> there was a reign of terror against Black people,</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> the result in thousands of injured and dead people.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The war was a war of the people,</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and the war was a war of the people.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And as we move forward, we will tell the individual stories</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> of many of those cities and towns</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and the nature of the riots.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> This was the home of another nation</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> that saw the threat of Bolshevism and communism</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> as its major threat going forward.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> However, in America, the president saw Blacks</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> as being likely breeding grounds of the evil of revolution.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Rather than simply riots, victims of the white mob.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Jamie Baker, HDA Cardiff.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Please listen to the following poem.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> If We Must Die is the poem that makes me a poet</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> among colored Americans.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> If we must die, let it not be like hogs</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> hunted and penned in an igloo</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> making their mock at our accursed lot.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> If we must die, oh, let us nobly die</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> so that our precious blood may not be shed in vain.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Then even the monsters we defy</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> shall be constrained to honor us though dead.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, kinsmen, we must meet the common people</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> though far outnumbered, let us show us brave</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and for the thousand blows deal one death blow.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What though before us lies the open grave?</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Like men, we&#039;ll face the murderers cowardly pack</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> pressed to the wall, dying but fatally.</div></div></p>
