Very much. Everybody in motion.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an awful thing to say, I know.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But when you see France play England and France beat England,</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> your emotions end. Anybody that beat England would be here with all of you.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But, er, very, er, yes.

But every one of them that came along</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> was respected till they went north.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> When they went north, oh, God, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They were everything but the man.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But, er, you know, that was my thoughts on them then.</div></div></p>
