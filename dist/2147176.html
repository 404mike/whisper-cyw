class="transcript_line"> Pensioner.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had a lot of experience in my life.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the UK like?</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember in the 70s, 60s, 70s, what was UK like?</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like, when you think about the Newport, I can tell about the Newport, and a bit of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> This Newport was different altogether.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> This building started in 1974.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> 1974, they started this building.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> On

the King&#039;s Head Hotel is.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I know all Newport.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> The library built after, Kings were built after, and they...</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, Kings, what they done?</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They built in shops.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Long time ago there was a Tesco.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They knocked that down and they made in shops.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that, there&#039;s a Friar&#039;s Womb now.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Dublin was in there.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the... I mean, back in the 60s, 70s as well, there was more Asian people arriving?</div><div id="00:20:33.000" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t that many people.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> There were Pakistani people, but there was very few Bengalis.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Bengali families wasn&#039;t that much.</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of Pakistani people.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they was all from villages.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they... they was much older than me.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Like you can say my father&#039;s age, you know.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And they was all illiterate.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They couldn&#039;t speak.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> The wives couldn&#039;t speak English, not a word of English.</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And the men, they all worked in the factories.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a girl in factories and there was...</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> there was a crunch and something.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a battery factory with that transporter bridge on the other side of that.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lice shed.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a quite big factory, Spencer Wigs.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was different altogether.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> This one is all new.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But old one, I can just close my eyes and I could see what was there.</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I seen it with my own eyes.</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I saw it alteration.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they altering this one.</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They demolishing this one, putting a new stuff there.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They demolishing there, putting a new stuff there.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And like that River French wasn&#039;t there.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to have sand ships.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They come there and they empty all sand.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And people buy sand from there, you know, for the buildings.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve raised four children here, is that correct?</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so...</div><div id="00:22:34.000" class="transcript_line"> My children got children.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about what it&#039;s like to raise children here and how they connect to Pakistan.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Do they or how they?</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, it was alright.</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I didn&#039;t have many difficulties.</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was...</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> How I can say?</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I altered myself according to the culture.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Not in very advanced way, but where it was needed.</div><div id="00:23:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Where it was a good things, I adopted that.</div><div id="00:23:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t let adopt my kids the bad things.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t adopt the bad things.</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, to be a Muslim.</div><div id="00:23:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So you got to go accordingly, like my daughters, I had two daughters.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t let them go to westernize, not as now the English people are.</div><div id="00:23:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t let them, the way they close, the way they were.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t let them out like that in the evening.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there&#039;s a limit.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean...</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Mementos and heirlooms.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have mementos and heirlooms that exist from back then?</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Things that you prize.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t have to be a physical thing.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe it&#039;s a practice or a photograph.</div><div id="00:24:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have things that you maintained from Pakistan?</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go every year, normally see my family.</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came after that, my family went to live in Islamabad.</div><div id="00:24:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But Islamabad is a very modern city.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like here.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s nothing backward, nothing.</div><div id="00:24:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very, very advanced.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like London, you can say.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very advanced city.</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything is new.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a brand new city.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s becoming better and better all the time.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So I always went there.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> My kids went there.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So my children didn&#039;t have any bad experience from there.</div><div id="00:24:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They love to go and see the family.</div><div id="00:24:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my family is educated.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And they learned the good things, you know, nothing bad.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m proud of it.</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I fit there as good as what I fit here.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a type of integration.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Question is, do you have any photographs or memorabilia, letters, documents</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> that you may be happy to put in the People&#039;s Collection website?</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So the IGER is the People&#039;s Collection is a massive website</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> of stories of thousands of people that moved here from around the world</div><div id="00:25:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and different things.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And in amongst there, there&#039;ll be like a transcript of the interview,</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> some audio, maybe a picture of yourself.</div><div id="00:25:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have anything you may want to add to that?</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to see.</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I most probably have got some photographs, but not a very old one.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re probably in the 70s and 80s.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe like only those sort of photos, like with my kids,</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> or in a party, or in a house, or on birthdays, you know, something like that.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But nothing more than that.</div><div id="00:26:14.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you like to pass on to your children and grandchildren</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> that would sum up your life in the UK?</div><div id="00:26:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I have got eight grandchildren.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My one grandson, he&#039;s 27, and he&#039;s graduated.</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> He did a master two years ago in HR, and he works in London.</div><div id="00:26:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He works in Canadian E-Walk offices.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there something you would like to pass on to them, a message,</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> or if they come back to visit this interview in 20, 30 years,</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> anything you would like to say to them?</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I won&#039;t be here.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> This is why they were interviewing, anything you would like to say to them,</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> or mention to them?</div><div id="00:27:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My son, and my daughter, and my daughter is 23.</div><div id="00:27:23.000" class="transcript_line"> My daughter is 53.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> My son got four daughters, and my youngest son, he got just one boy, 19 years.</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there something else you would like to add to all this?</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And my husband is a very nice man, very, very nice man, religious and everything.</div><div id="00:28:06.000"
