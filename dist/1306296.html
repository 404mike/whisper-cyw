Chapter 23. Bolshevism. The thing the Allies feared.</div><div id="00:00:20.160" class="transcript_line"> The Russian Revolution was a period of political and social revolution across the territory</div><div id="00:00:26.280" class="transcript_line"> of the Russian Empire, commencing with the abolition of the monarchy in 1917 and concluding</div><div id="00:00:32.560" class="transcript_line"> in 1923 after the Bolshevik establishment of the Soviet Union, which included the national</div><div id="00:00:39.920" class="transcript_line"> states of Ukraine, Azerbaijan and others and the end of the civil war.</div><div id="00:00:49.120" class="transcript_line"> The final collapse of the Russian monarchy began during the First World War with the</div><div id="00:00:53.920" class="transcript_line"> February 1917 revolution that was focused in and around Petrograd, which is now St.</div><div id="00:01:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Petersburg, and at the time was the capital of Russia. This revolution erupted in the</div><div id="00:01:08.720" class="transcript_line"> context of Russia&#039;s major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of</div><div id="00:01:16.240" class="transcript_line"> the Russian army being ready to mutiny. In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:22.880" class="transcript_line"> parliament assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government.</div><div id="00:01:29.720" class="transcript_line"> This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy, even</div><div id="00:01:36.760" class="transcript_line"> though the monarchy had lost control. Grassroots community assemblies, called Soviets,</div><div id="00:01:44.760" class="transcript_line"> which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted</div><div id="00:01:50.920" class="transcript_line"> the Provisional Government to rule. But the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, gained</div><div id="00:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> substantial influence in the Soviets. Lenin campaigned for an immediate end of Russia&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:03.640" class="transcript_line"> participation in the war, granting land to the peasants and providing bread to the urban</div><div id="00:02:10.440" class="transcript_line"> workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany,</div><div id="00:02:16.240" class="transcript_line"> the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions used that to advance the revolution further.</div><div id="00:02:24.120" class="transcript_line"> The term Bolshevik, by the way, comes from the Russian word Bolshinsvo, which means majority.</div><div id="00:02:33.800" class="transcript_line"> The Bolsheviks ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks,</div><div id="00:02:39.800" class="transcript_line"> or Reds, came to power in Russia during the October Revolution phase of the Russian Revolution</div><div id="00:02:46.800" class="transcript_line"> in 1917, and they founded the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, RSFSR. The</div><div id="00:02:57.440" class="transcript_line"> derogatory terms we often now hear for workers come from the West&#039;s feeling about that group.</div><div id="00:03:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Terms such as Bolsheviks, workers, Reds, or Pinkos. The revolutions of 1917 to 1923 were</div><div id="00:03:17.600" class="transcript_line"> a revolutionary wave that included political unrest and revolts around the world, inspired</div><div id="00:03:24.920" class="transcript_line"> by the success of the Russian Revolution and the disorder created by the aftermath of World</div><div id="00:03:31.520" class="transcript_line"> War I. The uprisings were mainly socialist or anti-colonial in nature. Many attempted</div><div id="00:03:38.840" class="transcript_line"> socialist revolts failed to have a long-term impact. The Bolsheviks actively sought to</div><div id="00:03:45.720" class="transcript_line"> encourage and support these revolts, including active participation in the British trade</div><div id="00:03:52.840" class="transcript_line"> unions via the Communist Party. Many French soldiers mutinied in 1917 and refused to join</div><div id="00:04:02.440" class="transcript_line"> the enemy. In Bulgaria, many troops mutinied and the Bulgarian Tsar stepped down. Mass</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> strikes and mutinies occurred in Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburg Monarchy, and it</div><div id="00:04:17.280" class="transcript_line"> collapsed. In Germany, the November Revolution of 1918 threatened to overtake Germany, but</div><div id="00:04:24.080" class="transcript_line"> eventually failed because the army decided to support the government. The German army</div><div id="00:04:32.080" class="transcript_line"> faced various mass strikes. Greece succumbed to a coup d&#039;etat in 1922. Turkey experienced</div><div id="00:04:39.640" class="transcript_line"> a successful war of independence. Across the world, various other protests and revolts</div><div id="00:04:46.920" class="transcript_line"> occurred from the turmoil of World War I and the success of the Russian Revolution. In</div><div id="00:04:54.840" class="transcript_line"> the UK, the trade union, Triple Alliance, was a real concern for the British government.</div><div id="00:05:01.200" class="transcript_line"> They felt strongly that the unions were being affected by Bolsheviks within. Before the</div><div id="00:05:06.560" class="transcript_line"> war, the mines, railways, and docks had been privately owned, but in 1914, under a threat</div><div id="00:05:13.560" class="transcript_line"> of war, they were nationalized. This meant in 1919, the three most powerful groups of</div><div id="00:05:20.560" class="transcript_line"> workers, the Triple Alliance, were actually working for the state. These workers had</div><div id="00:05:28.560" class="transcript_line"> been receiving a bonus during the war and had increased their working hours, but the</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> wages were reduced in 1919. In February 1919, the three union leaders from the three main</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Triple Alliance groups, that&#039;s coal, rail, transport, and docks, were invited to attend</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Downing Street to have tea with Prime Minister Lloyd George. Strikes had doubled after the</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> war across all industries, including teaching, and the government could not be sure the army</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> would suppress action. After all, the army was not going to be able to suppress action.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The army itself had succumbed to various mutinies. According to the miners&#039; representative,</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> according to one of the delegates, Robert Smiley, which was confirmed by Aneurin Bevan,</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> the Prime Minister said the following to them,</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> His argument was simple and clear at a time when states were near collapse across Europe.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> If the unions won, the state and government would collapse. So would the Triple Alliance</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> be ready for a collapse of authority that meant they would effectively be in charge,</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> be the government? At that point, the leaders of the unions were made fully aware that if</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> they wanted Bolshevism, it was theirs. But this was not a vision they wanted. They were</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> simply negotiating for better conditions and wages, and their positions rested on their</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> relationship with government and employers. So they went back to their unions, not wanting</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> the government to collapse. The railway workers had demanded a strike by March. The railway</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> executive had refused the National Union of Railway Workers&#039; demands, prompting the union&#039;s</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> special general meeting, SGM, to express its quote, utmost disgust, unquote, and to vote</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> 43 to 19 to ask the Triple Alliance partners to make a decision.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The NUR leaders were not keen on this course of action, and together with the Trans War</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and miners union leaders decided against the national strike. Instead they met the Minister,</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Bonne Law, who made some concessions to the railwaymen, guaranteed working hours, minimum</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> rest period, and a weeks paid holiday. On the 27th of March, the NUR special general</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> meeting voted 41 to 19 not to go ahead with strikes because of progressing talks, a phrase</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> familiar to rail union members to this day. Those talks would continue for six months,</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> while the government prepared to defeat the inevitable strike, but the union leaders prepared</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> to avoid it rather than win it. Like the NUR, the miners federation let the government persuade</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> it to postpone action. Lloyd George appointed the Sankey Commission to investigate working</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> conditions and ownership of the coal industry, promising to implement its findings. After</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> a preliminary report on 20th of May, the Sankey report delivered its full verdict on 20th of</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> June, favoring nationalization, a 20% pay rise and one hour off the miners working day.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> A month later, the government had taken only one measure, announcing that the maximum time</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> that miners were to work underground would be cut from eight to seven hours. The miners</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> federation did not act, still trusting the government to honor the Sankey report, but</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> rank and file members were not so naive and patient. In mid July, an unofficial strike</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> spread from Kent and South Wales to Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, the Northeast and Scotland,</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but without the support of their union, who held strike funds, the strikes came to an</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> end in mid August. However, none of this helped black people because the unions wanted their</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> jobs and they were a useful target for disillusioned workers. One of the reasons there was not</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> enough work was the high number of strikes crippling an already damaging economy. The</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> relatively few jobs taken by black people would have made little difference to the high</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> level of post-war unemployment. However, the fear of them being radicalized was a different</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> matter for the government. For that reason, controlling them and removing them was something</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> the government was in favor of. The problem was the legislative position made that difficult.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They were British citizens, but in an environment where the press placed the blame fully upon</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> black people, the riots provided the smokescreen of public demand. This smokescreen would be</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> commonly used from 1919 onward by the British government.</div></div></p>
