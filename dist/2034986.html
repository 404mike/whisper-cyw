    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Music scene in the 70s in Newport. Newport was the place in Wales for music, not Cardiff,</div><div id="00:00:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Newport. In Newport we had many different clubs, local bands played in many pubs and</div><div id="00:00:36.040" class="transcript_line"> we travelled to different areas for different music. Like in the 70s was the time of festivals,</div><div id="00:00:44.520" class="transcript_line"> so we used to travel to different pop festivals, i.e. the Bath Blues Festival which is now</div><div id="00:00:51.240" class="transcript_line"> called Glastonbury. We used to travel every year on August Bank holiday to the free festival</div><div id="00:01:03.800" class="transcript_line"> in Windsor Park. The bands played there every year for nothing but Hawkewind.</div><div id="00:01:13.560" class="transcript_line"> To finance going to these festivals, I worked all through the winter and then soon as the</div><div id="00:01:20.600" class="transcript_line"> spring came and the festival started, I would leave my job and then go to a festival. I would</div><div id="00:01:30.360" class="transcript_line"> work farms picking potatoes, strawberries to make money come in so I could go to the next festival.</div><div id="00:01:38.040" class="transcript_line"> Another way of making money at festivals is we used to stay and clear up and you&#039;re going to pay</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> big money to clear up all the rubbish. This is what most people do. To get to festivals,</div><div id="00:01:55.320" class="transcript_line"> if you had the money you&#039;d go on a train or you would go on a coach and if you didn&#039;t really have</div><div id="00:02:02.360" class="transcript_line"> the money to spare to pay for your transport, we were all clubbed together and hired a van</div><div id="00:02:12.600" class="transcript_line"> or with a farm along the motorway.</div><div id="00:02:17.560" class="transcript_line"> What festivals were like at that time? Value for money. For Â£5 you could go the whole weekend</div><div id="00:02:26.840" class="transcript_line"> and see all the top bands in the world.</div><div id="00:02:31.560" class="transcript_line"> My wife&#039;s eyebrows just rose in surprise and you&#039;d have bands come in from all over the planet</div><div id="00:02:41.480" class="transcript_line"> for that festival. I actually seen the first live performance of Don McLean, American Pie</div><div id="00:02:52.280" class="transcript_line"> in a festival in Lincoln. At the same festival Monty Pythons played the stage.</div><div id="00:03:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Surprise visitors for the festival was Raquel Welsh and Princess Anne. They just come around</div><div id="00:03:11.960" class="transcript_line"> to have a look. They didn&#039;t really integrate into the crowd but they were there. At these festivals</div><div id="00:03:20.600" class="transcript_line"> you had venues for famous bands but you also had tents that played music for up and coming bands.</div><div id="00:03:36.200" class="transcript_line"> These places, as predicted in the 70s, was all about peace and love.</div><div id="00:03:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Not many had any violence. I recall the violent festival at Hyde Park which was a festival,</div><div id="00:03:53.480" class="transcript_line"> the Rolling Stones done, but it wasn&#039;t the crowd, it was Hell&#039;s Angels who were hired</div><div id="00:04:04.360" class="transcript_line"> to police the crowd and got drunk and started the violence.</div><div id="00:04:08.680" class="transcript_line"> My one regret of the 70s was I was going to see Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wights.</div><div id="00:04:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Me and a few friends, we paid the money and the guy who was going to drive us up there</div><div id="00:04:27.720" class="transcript_line"> never ever turned up with the band.</div><div id="00:04:30.920" class="transcript_line"> After his next festival Hendrix was dead.</div><div id="00:04:36.440" class="transcript_line"> During the 80s my attendance to festivals dwindled because this time I was married with a family</div><div id="00:04:45.800" class="transcript_line"> and the last big festival I attended was the 1986</div><div id="00:04:58.920" class="transcript_line"> Glastonbury Festival where I seen the Wailers minus Bob because he had a long day</div><div id="00:05:08.440" class="transcript_line"> and a few other things but I noticed the change from when I was younger,</div><div id="00:05:15.800" class="transcript_line"> mainly the present and a heavy present of police.</div><div id="00:05:21.880" class="transcript_line"> The organisation totally totally different and it was more of a money making scheme than</div><div id="00:05:33.880" class="transcript_line"> people getting together for the music.</div><div id="00:05:40.360" class="transcript_line"> If you want to note what one of the festivals I went to you can go online and see what the Lincoln</div><div id="00:05:50.600" class="transcript_line"> Festival was like in the 1970s. There are many many quotes from what I&#039;ve been like</div><div id="00:05:58.200" class="transcript_line"> and what I told my wife and when she read these quotes she said whatever everything you told me</div><div id="00:06:05.480" class="transcript_line"> about this festival is there from other people. We all went to the festivals together.</div><div id="00:06:13.640" class="transcript_line"> If you asked an old timer about the NFO in town it was a scrumpy restaurant</div><div id="00:06:22.760" class="transcript_line"> pub and we used to meet there and take off from there.</div><div id="00:06:31.720" class="transcript_line"> The festival the free festival at Windsor Park was a place that I always met my mate at the main</div><div id="00:06:42.280" class="transcript_line"> gates. I would not see him through the year but year after year I would bump into my mate Steve.</div><div id="00:06:52.920" class="transcript_line"> Because Newport was such an important place it was also the capital</div><div id="00:07:02.200" class="transcript_line"> of Britain for drugs so when we went to festivals and they found out we were from Newport</div><div id="00:07:09.400" class="transcript_line"> first words out of most people&#039;s mouth is what you sell it.</div><div id="00:07:14.440" class="transcript_line"> A friend of mine used to have what would you only describe in them days as an Arab tent</div><div id="00:07:23.880" class="transcript_line"> a red and white strike one. I used to point them in that direction and they were always full of people.</div><div id="00:07:39.400" class="transcript_line"> you</div></div></p>
