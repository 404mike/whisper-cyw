    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And just check it&#039;s going. So I have to start saying I&#039;m Marsha Mani and I&#039;m here today at</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Robertson. Robertson. Robert son. Pan Robert son and it is Thursday the 20th. 21st. Thursday the</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> 21st of March 2019. Thank you, Pam. Robert son. 35th anniversary of my father dying. Yes. Oh really?</div><div id="00:00:36.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just going to pop that there, Pam. Right. No, it&#039;s really helpful because this is going to</div><div id="00:00:43.280" class="transcript_line"> become an archive. Really helps if you could just give me your date of birth as well. So Pam,</div><div id="00:00:48.960" class="transcript_line"> can you tell me where are you born? In Cardiff. Yeah. Near Victoria Park. Yep. And I lived there</div><div id="00:00:57.120" class="transcript_line"> till my husband, well I went to Aberyst University for three years and then we got married and then</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> we lived in, I put the farm, flat-owned farm in Pennyland, not in Cardiff but Pennyland Baselake.</div><div id="00:01:18.880" class="transcript_line"> So you went to university you said? Yeah. Oh that was, so you were what in the 50s? 56. So was that</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> was that quite unusual then? I don&#039;t think so, no. No? What did you do at university? Agricultural</div><div id="00:01:34.640" class="transcript_line"> science followed by a postgraduate diploma in dairying. Okay. And it was in the dairy industry</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> then that I spent my working life. What were you doing? I was head of the laboratory. We had a big</div><div id="00:01:49.920" class="transcript_line"> milk processing plant here. I didn&#039;t know whether you knew that but um, no. Just you go to the end</div><div id="00:01:57.760" class="transcript_line"> of this lane turn right and there are new houses on your right. Yeah. And that&#039;s where the dairy</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> was, yes. And I was in charge of the laboratory. So was that the National Milk Marketing Board?</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no. That was United Dairies. Okay. And then my claim to fame, if I have one,</div><div id="00:02:17.760" class="transcript_line"> is that I made the first yogurt to be sold commercially in South Wales. You did? Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Because I went up to the head laboratory in London when they were experimenting with this stuff that</div><div id="00:02:31.040" class="transcript_line"> had come, actually from Bulgaria it came and I thought it was horrible. Well I still think</div><div id="00:02:36.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s horrible. I never touch yogurt now. And we made yogurt and then I came back to Marshfield and</div><div id="00:02:44.720" class="transcript_line"> we produced it there. And initially it was sold in Swansea, the first lot we made. The first lot</div><div id="00:02:52.400" class="transcript_line"> we made was 500 little of those third pint pots with a wide rim. And when I left there they were</div><div id="00:02:59.920" class="transcript_line"> doing 1500 a day. So yeah, that was where the yogurt came from originally. Here in Marshfields,</div><div id="00:03:08.400" class="transcript_line"> what year was this? 1961. That&#039;s incredible. And this was with, is it United Dairies?</div><div id="00:03:17.360" class="transcript_line"> Canberra and United Dairies that was, yes. Which is one of the outlets for United Dairies which</div><div id="00:03:23.200" class="transcript_line"> was the biggest then, the biggest company, milk company in the country. Yeah. So did you get a</div><div id="00:03:29.200" class="transcript_line"> claim at the time for doing that? No, just did as I was told. Oh we had some fun with that yogurt.</div><div id="00:03:38.480" class="transcript_line"> Anyway. What do you mean you had some fun with it? Because Muggins decided that if we could make</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> plain yogurt we could make strawberry yogurt. So I got strawberry syrup in and that was brown,</div><div id="00:03:54.880" class="transcript_line"> a horrible shade of brown. I used to call it calf shit brown.</div><div id="00:04:01.680" class="transcript_line"> And we got in lactose and we replaced the normal sugar with the lactose and this strawberry syrup</div><div id="00:04:08.400" class="transcript_line"> and it was horrible pale brown liquid. So I went to Tesco&#039;s which was in High Street in Newport</div><div id="00:04:15.120" class="transcript_line"> then and I bought up all the cochineal they had. And instead of adding it a drop at the time I</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> chucked the lot in and suddenly the colour of those candles was turned out like gold.</div><div id="00:04:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Chucking down the drain having got one of my staff to watch that the dairy man who didn&#039;t see me.</div><div id="00:04:32.880" class="transcript_line"> Start all over again, go to Tesco&#039;s for more cochineal but I&#039;d already bought it all so they</div><div id="00:04:38.320" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t have it. Up to Aster, got that cochineal and then I did add it a drop at the time till I</div><div id="00:04:44.320" class="transcript_line"> got the right colour. We had some fun with that yogurt. Oh dear, dear, dear. It was heated</div><div id="00:04:52.800" class="transcript_line"> in a big vat. It was a double lined big vat with hot water running in between the layers to heat it</div><div id="00:05:00.880" class="transcript_line"> up. And I turned on the steam one day to heat it up, went to do something, forgot all about it</div><div id="00:05:08.800" class="transcript_line"> and when I came back there&#039;s all this yogurt all bubbling in. Chuck that away and start again.</div><div id="00:05:15.280" class="transcript_line"> The things we did with that yogurt was hilarious. So when it was launched, do you remember when it</div><div id="00:05:20.400" class="transcript_line"> was launched? That would have been it in 1961. It went first to Swansea and then I don&#039;t know when</div><div id="00:05:28.560" class="transcript_line"> the supermarkets picked it up because in those days it was either plain yogurt which was quite</div><div id="00:05:35.280" class="transcript_line"> a clean taste but sharp. And then of course the yogurt that they make now doesn&#039;t bear any</div><div id="00:05:42.400" class="transcript_line"> relation to that at all. And I&#039;ve never eaten the stuff since because I&#039;ve had such a time</div><div id="00:05:50.800" class="transcript_line"> tasting every flipping batch that I don&#039;t want yogurt anymore. Never have yogurt. The only time</div><div id="00:05:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I have it is if I&#039;m actually giving it as a sweet. In fact I went to my friend and she had Tesco&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> finest raspberry yogurt and it was gorgeous. And I&#039;ve looked since and I can&#039;t find it in Tesco&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:11.600" class="transcript_line"> anywhere so I&#039;ve given up on that. I think I can live without yogurt. That&#039;s quite something though</div><div id="00:06:18.720" class="transcript_line"> actually I think that you were the first, you created the first yogurt in Wales. South Wales.</div><div id="00:06:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I don&#039;t know about North Wales. In Marshfields. Yeah. So was it a big unit,</div><div id="00:06:31.920" class="transcript_line"> was a big factory here? Oh massive, yeah a really massive milk factory. Yeah. Mainly bottled milk</div><div id="00:06:38.560" class="transcript_line"> and we used to send 30,000 gallons a day to London in milk tankers you know from the railway.</div><div id="00:06:44.960" class="transcript_line"> We had a little tanker that went back and forward filling these big tankers for the railway.</div><div id="00:06:49.600" class="transcript_line"> What from Newport? It would go from Newport? From Marshfield the siding was here. Yeah. And then it</div><div id="00:06:55.600" class="transcript_line"> just got hooked up to a goods train or something and ended up in London. Oh my goodness. So where</div><div id="00:07:01.840" class="transcript_line"> did all the milk come? Where did it start off? Nowadays they collect milk in big tankers</div><div id="00:07:09.840" class="transcript_line"> but in those days they were in churns and it was pretty well the whole of Monmouthshire and part</div><div id="00:07:16.400" class="transcript_line"> of Glamorgan. How many farmers would it have been? Around about between 50 and 60 farmers</div><div id="00:07:27.360" class="transcript_line"> and the milk used to come in in churns and that was it. And then it went into the</div><div id="00:07:34.080" class="transcript_line"> bin it was pasteurised and bottled. Gosh. So how many people were working there? Oh crumbs I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:45.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I had seven in the laboratory, three on the out.</div><div id="00:07:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Probably between 50 and 60. Yeah it would have been that&#039;s just a rough estimate because I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:07:58.560" class="transcript_line"> really never thought about how many were there. Yeah. So when did it close? Right.</div><div id="00:08:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh it&#039;s certainly more than 10 years ago. I don&#039;t know. Let&#039;s just say within the last three years</div><div id="00:08:19.680" class="transcript_line"> within the last 20 years that sort of time and then they built all the big houses. So that would</div><div id="00:08:25.600" class="transcript_line"> have been lots of dairy farmers. All their milk would have gone there and it would have been</div><div id="00:08:31.680" class="transcript_line"> processed there and then either gone into milk bottles. That&#039;s it. Sent to London or made into</div><div id="00:08:37.520" class="transcript_line"> products. The milk was sent in tankers to London but it went into bottles and the company had</div><div id="00:08:47.040" class="transcript_line"> depots or you know where the driver would take all the bottled milk and from there it went to the</div><div id="00:08:52.720" class="transcript_line"> milkman who in those days delivered it which they don&#039;t anymore. Yeah that&#039;s just an example</div><div id="00:08:59.920" class="transcript_line"> of something that&#039;s gone. Yeah oh yes. Yeah you&#039;re right nobody well very few people I think get milk</div><div id="00:09:06.160" class="transcript_line"> delivered. Yeah I do actually. Do you? Yeah I insist on supporting at the end of my road there</div><div id="00:09:11.840" class="transcript_line"> is a dairy. Ah right. And I want to support it. Fair enough yeah. Like I can you know. Oh yes. So what sort of place was it</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> like to work in? I enjoyed it. It was fine yeah. I was my own boss. I had to add all the power in the</div><div id="00:09:27.520" class="transcript_line"> world. If I didn&#039;t like what was happening I could just stop it all stop the bottling dead and</div><div id="00:09:33.280" class="transcript_line"> get to the cause of whatever was you know was happening. We had a chap who was a troubleshooter</div><div id="00:09:44.320" class="transcript_line"> and we had a woman rang up to say that there was half a mouse in a bottle of milk.</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> So if that had got into the papers so we sent this chap along and we sent him with a massive</div><div id="00:10:01.200" class="transcript_line"> crate of tin peaches and tin this and tin that and tin the other to take this lady and his</div><div id="00:10:08.160" class="transcript_line"> instruction was that even if he had to kill her he had to bring that bottle back with the mountain</div><div id="00:10:14.240" class="transcript_line"> because we didn&#039;t want her calling the public out. It was a good thing she did call us first. Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:18.720" class="transcript_line"> And anyway he did get the bottle out. There&#039;s the back half of this mouse with a long oh god</div><div id="00:10:26.080" class="transcript_line"> it was disgusting. What had happened was it must have been in the bottle before it was washed</div><div id="00:10:32.640" class="transcript_line"> and the washing didn&#039;t get it out of the bottle and then it got filled up with milk and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:10:36.560" class="transcript_line"> what happened. Poor woman what a thing to find. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d have been very happy. No. So</div><div id="00:10:44.720" class="transcript_line"> you would get hundreds of bottles thousands of bottles in every day. Yeah. So it was your job to</div><div id="00:10:51.360" class="transcript_line"> make sure everything was sterile and that&#039;s it and the chemical composition was right</div><div id="00:10:57.360" class="transcript_line"> and the bacterial composition was right. Yes. Yeah. We started at five in the morning and</div><div id="00:11:05.040" class="transcript_line"> went right through till about 10 at night in shifts. Yeah. Well the thing is I&#039;m thinking</div><div id="00:11:12.800" class="transcript_line"> from my perspective that&#039;s quite a responsible position for a woman in the early 60s.</div><div id="00:11:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it was. Yes. Were you a bit of a trailblazer? Oh yeah. I never thought of myself as a trailblazer</div><div id="00:11:29.440" class="transcript_line"> but yeah we had one man in our office. He was a student and he was in fact the son of one of</div><div id="00:11:37.360" class="transcript_line"> the princes in one of the minor African countries and he was a student here and we were short of</div><div id="00:11:45.200" class="transcript_line"> staff. Two of us had left on maternity leave and the man said the only one I can offer you that&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:53.760" class="transcript_line"> got a reasonable brain is, can&#039;t even remember his name, but anyway this chap he was wonderful. He</div><div id="00:11:59.520" class="transcript_line"> was really really lovely. Really? And in the end nobody was bothering so you used a pipette after</div><div id="00:12:04.640" class="transcript_line"> him or anything. He was just a really nice bloke. You don&#039;t remember what country he was from? No</div><div id="00:12:10.080" class="transcript_line"> it was a minor African country and I yeah but um I can&#039;t remember. I would have known at the time</div><div id="00:12:15.840" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t remember it now. Oh. Yep. So were you living in Marshfields when you were working?</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No I was living in Wychurch and I had a Vespa scooter and I used to get back and</div><div id="00:12:27.360" class="transcript_line"> forward on that. Did you? I had a car first. Yeah. No hang on which did I have? I had the Vespa</div><div id="00:12:33.440" class="transcript_line"> scooter first then the car yes. A big old Austin Devon. How far is Wychurch from here?</div><div id="00:12:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Outskirts of Cardiff. Um six eight miles I suppose.</div><div id="00:12:49.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lovely cup of tea thank you. Oh good. So were you married then when you were working?</div><div id="00:12:56.160" class="transcript_line"> I married in 1958 so it was in the middle of the yeah. So what did your husband think about you</div><div id="00:13:01.760" class="transcript_line"> working there? Oh he didn&#039;t worry. Didn&#039;t he? No. He had his tractor in his head cutter and he used</div><div id="00:13:08.160" class="transcript_line"> to go around oh first of all he used to start at five in the morning and drive a milk lorry just</div><div id="00:13:13.200" class="transcript_line"> for one delivery and then he&#039;d finish about ten and then get on his tractor and cut hedges and</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> ploughed fields and all the rest of it. Really? So how long were you here for? Um 19 married in 63.</div><div id="00:13:29.920" class="transcript_line"> We lived then in a house um it&#039;s on the same level as this but towards the main road. Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:38.560" class="transcript_line"> To Nunant and we moved there from then 81 um up to the farm and then moved down here eight years ago.</div><div id="00:13:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay so um so you and your husband you spent some of your married life here in this area?</div><div id="00:13:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes we did yes quite a lot of it actually all our kids were born there yeah. Oh really? So what</div><div id="00:14:00.080" class="transcript_line"> in Marshfields? Not Marshfield, Coyde-Curnew which is the next village along. I must have</div><div id="00:14:04.320" class="transcript_line"> passed through that yeah. Yeah. How do you pronounce it again Pam? Coyde-Curnew. Coyde-Curnew.</div><div id="00:14:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Curnews wood so whoever is it whoever Curnew was. As you as you came from Newport I presume along</div><div id="00:14:21.920" class="transcript_line"> the 848 yeah um you probably wouldn&#039;t notice but just before you get to Castleton um there&#039;s a car</div><div id="00:14:29.280" class="transcript_line"> car place on your left hand side selling cars. Yeah. That then was the garage where I worked.</div><div id="00:14:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Really? Yeah. After the dairy? Yeah. So you were at the dairy so that must have been quite a big</div><div id="00:14:41.360" class="transcript_line"> employer for the area was it? Yes but then I had my children so um and then by then we had um</div><div id="00:14:49.200" class="transcript_line"> we had 14 JCBs then my we kept adding JCBs um to do the work so I then was sort of full time</div><div id="00:14:58.480" class="transcript_line"> in the office and with the kids. Okay. Doing the invoicing and whatnot. And that was at Coyde-Curnew?</div><div id="00:15:04.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah that was yes. So what was it I mean imagine the place has been developed massively over the</div><div id="00:15:11.200" class="transcript_line"> last 20 30 years what was it like when you you first married and your children were young?</div><div id="00:15:16.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not much has happened in Newport where it&#039;s Cardiff that&#039;s done the expansion</div><div id="00:15:21.600" class="transcript_line"> and Newport&#039;s pretty well stayed the same but Cardiff have come right to the boundaries of</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> them between them and Newport. Yeah. And every time you go out there&#039;s more houses being built</div><div id="00:15:33.840" class="transcript_line"> there are a lot from you know now toward it all used to be green fields going to Cardiff but now</div><div id="00:15:39.120" class="transcript_line"> of course it&#039;s all houses. It&#039;s all been developed? Yeah. So when your children were young did you have</div><div id="00:15:45.280" class="transcript_line"> places to play in the fields and? Well this was it we we had um we lived right at the end of a lane</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> that only ended in our house so the kids could run wild in the fields which they did. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:59.920" class="transcript_line"> And then they they rigged up a swing with just a bar of wood that they sat on and from one of our</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> trees and they they made their own fun they were and um they will all say now that they they had a</div><div id="00:16:13.200" class="transcript_line"> marvelous childhood because they were so free when they went to school I had to teach them road sense</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;d never had it because we get in a car in you know it&#039;s at the house and drive somewhere</div><div id="00:16:25.360" class="transcript_line"> and they I had to teach them you know look right look left look right again and then walk across</div><div id="00:16:31.360" class="transcript_line"> the road. Really? Because they didn&#039;t and my daughter nearly got killed oh boy I went to meet</div><div id="00:16:37.040" class="transcript_line"> her from school and I was coming down the road and the school&#039;s the other side of the road she</div><div id="00:16:41.600" class="transcript_line"> was on the pavement she saw my van and she just shot out right in front of this woman in a in a</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> modest minor and she jammed on the base and she actually did touch Dawn but that was Dawn&#039;s fault</div><div id="00:16:55.360" class="transcript_line"> because Dawn sort of staggered and I thought she&#039;s going to be killed because I could see</div><div id="00:17:01.840" class="transcript_line"> this car coming up but uh awful thing but she survived. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Did you have</div><div id="00:17:08.320" class="transcript_line"> reams on your land then? Reams? Reams? You know were the water channels?</div><div id="00:17:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. The ditches yeah yeah. Did you have to maintain those? Uh no no we didn&#039;t we had to um</div><div id="00:17:25.120" class="transcript_line"> we had a stream that ran past our house but it was um so really no the reams were down here and</div><div id="00:17:31.440" class="transcript_line"> the stream ran into it yes no we didn&#039;t have to do any of that. So your husband had um or you both</div><div id="00:17:38.320" class="transcript_line"> had a JCB business? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. So and you&#039;ve built that up over several years? Yes and the</div><div id="00:17:44.400" class="transcript_line"> last big job we worked on was the Bute Town tunnels in Cardiff we had six JCBs on that right from the</div><div id="00:17:51.040" class="transcript_line"> time it started till the time it finished. So when would that have been Pam? Oh hang on let me think</div><div id="00:17:57.680" class="transcript_line"> let me think the 1990s Martin died in 98 it was before that in the 1980s I suppose and the start</div><div id="00:18:11.040" class="transcript_line"> of the 1990s yeah yeah yeah. That would have kept him busy for some time. Oh yeah yeah it was it was</div><div id="00:18:17.840" class="transcript_line"> a long job that one yes yeah yeah there were six JCBs on that all the time yeah. So he did work</div><div id="00:18:24.960" class="transcript_line"> he must have done work on other developments in oh yeah yeah all over the place yes yeah. So what</div><div id="00:18:31.600" class="transcript_line"> sort of stories did he have or did he come back and tell you you&#039;re telling me nothing really about</div><div id="00:18:37.360" class="transcript_line"> the boat? Oh that one when he went through the boat uh yeah that was before the JCBs either when we</div><div id="00:18:44.400" class="transcript_line"> were I think we were married then we&#039;re only just and he worked for a drainage board and I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:18:50.720" class="transcript_line"> whether you know the Six Bells pub in Peterson yeah and he passed there where the Rheene was</div><div id="00:18:57.440" class="transcript_line"> he dug through and it was like a canoe um and he dug right through it and the archaeologist came he</div><div id="00:19:05.840" class="transcript_line"> told his boss near archaeologists came out and had a look and decided it was very very old and they</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> wanted to get it right out but the owner of the farm wouldn&#039;t let them dig it out so I presume</div><div id="00:19:18.400" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s still there. Wow! Yeah so yeah but how old it was they really didn&#039;t know but it was very</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> very old yeah gosh it must have been really to be you know when it was yes yeah so your husband</div><div id="00:19:32.080" class="transcript_line"> worked for the drainage board yeah before we before we started out on our own yeah yeah so what sort</div><div id="00:19:37.120" class="transcript_line"> of jobs was he doing then? Oh he had a big excavator um and virtually just cleaning out the</div><div id="00:19:44.800" class="transcript_line"> all the between Cardiff and Newport and Newport and Chefstow and just cleaning out the the ditches</div><div id="00:19:52.320" class="transcript_line"> so the Rheene&#039;s.

Oh yeah yeah he rode a motorbike to work and his</div><div id="00:20:06.960" class="transcript_line"> his excavator it wasn&#039;t his it was what he worked for um that was parked the other side of Newport</div><div id="00:20:14.480" class="transcript_line"> every night and so he used to go across the you know Newport&#039;s transporter bridge he used to go</div><div id="00:20:19.200" class="transcript_line"> with his motorbike across there. Really? Yeah um that well that was being open very early in the</div><div id="00:20:26.560" class="transcript_line"> morning and in those days that&#039;s what it did was carry workmen but of course now it&#039;s just a tourist</div><div id="00:20:32.480" class="transcript_line"> attraction yeah. Oh god so he went across there on his motorbike? Yeah yep he rode his motorbike</div><div id="00:20:39.760" class="transcript_line"> everywhere and when he wasn&#039;t riding as I was. You really?

If you go up the Marshfield road and you&#039;ve got um a right hand bend before that bend there</div><div id="00:21:31.200" class="transcript_line"> was a pub called the balaclava and it was run by Ansells the brewers and behind the balaclava was a</div><div id="00:21:38.480" class="transcript_line"> big um distribution depot of Ansells and um then eventually got demolished um</div><div id="00:21:48.480" class="transcript_line"> we all went there one Christmas Eve from the dairy we went there lunchtime we got plastered</div><div id="00:21:54.160" class="transcript_line"> all of us and we came back down to the dairy and up in the laboratory we had one of the directors</div><div id="00:22:02.400" class="transcript_line"> Mr Rainer with us and he went into the laboratory and he

service</div><div id="00:22:46.800" class="transcript_line"> on a Sunday evening so i usually join the baptist for their service because they&#039;re just in you know</div><div id="00:22:51.920" class="transcript_line"> marshfield so are there any traditions or stories that are associated with this area um because</div><div id="00:23:01.200" class="transcript_line"> somebody told me something could go at roping so at the wedding you&#039;d have a rope across the entrance</div><div id="00:23:06.400" class="transcript_line"> oh i didn&#039;t know that yeah yeah i didn&#039;t know that um this lane was called market road in that</div><div id="00:23:13.280" class="transcript_line"> those days and if you go along this lane not far past here on the left hand side there&#039;s a derelict</div><div id="00:23:19.680" class="transcript_line"> building all with um sheets of um tin and whatnot and that was the market the cattle market before</div><div id="00:23:25.680" class="transcript_line"> they moved to newport really yeah yeah when was this um when i was working in the day so in the</div><div id="00:23:32.000" class="transcript_line"> 1950s so you remember market day here yeah yeah well what was that like it must have been very</div><div id="00:23:39.040" class="transcript_line"> traffic everywhere yes it was and um yeah i remember the market being here and then of course they</div><div id="00:23:45.760" class="transcript_line"> moved to newport and then very recently they&#039;re called well one last i don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:23:54.240" class="transcript_line"> 10 years i suppose um the cattle market closed and they&#039;ve got a big answer there now yeah yeah</div><div id="00:24:01.760" class="transcript_line"> so the big one there&#039;s one that raglan now isn&#039;t it yeah yeah that&#039;s where um the the business from</div><div id="00:24:08.320" class="transcript_line"> newport market moved to raglan yeah so so so there&#039;s a sidings here yeah so would cattle</div><div id="00:24:15.440" class="transcript_line"> and livestock come on no no no they&#039;d only come um come in trailers or horse boxes no so it was</div><div id="00:24:23.200" class="transcript_line"> it was only the milk that ever went from here so what sort of livestock came to market do you</div><div id="00:24:28.320" class="transcript_line"> remember oh cattle and sheep yep lots of cattle lots of sheep yeah do you remember the auction</div><div id="00:24:36.320" class="transcript_line"> ring was there an auction ring or they&#039;re just pens i didn&#039;t in that time have any i worked</div><div id="00:24:41.440" class="transcript_line"> with the dairy in that time and i didn&#039;t have any animals of my own so i really wasn&#039;t interested</div><div id="00:24:47.040" class="transcript_line"> and then of course when it moved to newport and then we used to sell our lambs through through</div><div id="00:24:51.680" class="transcript_line"> there and um yeah um and bought the odd ram or the odd you or whatever so i came i came along this</div><div id="00:25:00.640" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah so um so there is um there is like a big old barn there that&#039;s it</div><div id="00:25:07.360" class="transcript_line"> and that was that was a cattle market yes market yeah if you have an aerial photo on from google</div><div id="00:25:13.840" class="transcript_line"> earth you can see the marks where the pens were outside it oh gosh you can&#039;t from the ground</div><div id="00:25:19.600" class="transcript_line"> level but um one of my neighbors uh googled it and you it was amazing really prominent you could see</div><div id="00:25:28.400" class="transcript_line"> where the where the pens used to stand so was it all outside yeah apart from in apart from the</div><div id="00:25:34.640" class="transcript_line"> auction ring which was undercover yeah so on was market day one day a week or several days no one</div><div id="00:25:41.200" class="transcript_line"> day a week yeah do you remember what day um i don&#039;t remember it would probably been the same here</div><div id="00:25:46.800" class="transcript_line"> as it was in newport in newport it was wednesday so i would imagine it was probably wednesday here</div><div id="00:25:52.320" class="transcript_line"> so was it difficult to move for traffic and people and buses well it didn&#039;t um it didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:25:58.400" class="transcript_line"> affect me because i was in work before and i went to went home after the the livestock um and a lot</div><div id="00:26:06.560" class="transcript_line"> used to come from the what we call the low road so they were to come over the over the bridge and</div><div id="00:26:12.480" class="transcript_line"> you know before they got here and turned down the lane yeah yeah yeah oh that&#039;s so that&#039;s called</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> market lane colloquially it was yeah it isn&#039;t now everyone calls it team our lane but i always</div><div id="00:26:23.600" class="transcript_line"> knew it as market road really yeah that&#039;s fascinating when it got called team our i</div><div id="00:26:29.200" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t a clue not a clue any other places have got names at the local that are no i don&#039;t think</div><div id="00:26:36.960" class="transcript_line"> so the we in marshfield the first place you come to now is um pentune terrace and that was built</div><div id="00:26:44.320" class="transcript_line"> for the dairy workers when they first opened the dairy yeah and then we get to merrishfield</div><div id="00:26:50.480" class="transcript_line"> close again for dairy workers yeah yeah so when did the dairy open then i don&#039;t know i really don&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:57.520" class="transcript_line"> know um all i know was when i joined it the woman who was in charge of the lab before me had been</div><div id="00:27:07.040" class="transcript_line"> there 14 years so it would have been back into the 1940s and probably beyond then i really don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:27:15.200" class="transcript_line"> so it was a quite a you know big business oh it was big yes yes it was big yeah so did most people</div><div id="00:27:22.160" class="transcript_line"> who were there did they come locally or did they come further afield most of them were local yes</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and when we had snow i had land rover tires on the back of my car and it was my job to go down</div><div id="00:27:34.560" class="transcript_line"> and around the out outline buildings and bring the workers into work because mine was the only</div><div id="00:27:40.240" class="transcript_line"> vehicle that would go down there really yeah yeah that was the big snow in 1963 62 63 yeah</div><div id="00:27:50.000" class="transcript_line"> you even had snow here then oh crumbs yes we didn&#039;t have snow here yeah because it doesn&#039;t</div><div id="00:27:55.600" class="transcript_line"> i was told it it&#039;s very not very often you&#039;ll get snow no we had no snow this year and i don&#039;t think</div><div id="00:28:00.720" class="transcript_line"> we had any last year um but then the snow was packed on the main road on the a48 till march</div><div id="00:28:11.120" class="transcript_line"> and it was just packed snow that we were driving on all the time yeah yeah so what was it like</div><div id="00:28:16.240" class="transcript_line"> down here at marsh fields um much the same as the main road because it&#039;s you have quite heavy</div><div id="00:28:21.680" class="transcript_line"> traffic down here um but when you got down to the bottom there weren&#039;t many vehicles that could go</div><div id="00:28:28.240" class="transcript_line"> along the bottom road because that was pretty bad but my old car could do it she chugs through</div><div id="00:28:34.240" class="transcript_line"> anything yep trust so it so you had the dairy and you had the cattle market one time so was</div><div id="00:28:40.880" class="transcript_line"> there a finished shop and thing like that then yes we had we had the shop the same shop as in</div><div id="00:28:46.400" class="transcript_line"> marshfield now okay and it&#039;s been altered and extended and whatnot and it&#039;s a very good shop</div><div id="00:28:51.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah you could live out of that shop apart from fresh veg they keep potatoes in but no other</div><div id="00:28:57.280" class="transcript_line"> fresh veg yeah but other than they&#039;ve got a pharmacy the pharmacy and the post office in general</div><div id="00:29:04.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah oh yeah what about um flooding have you ever had flooding here flooding uh not here but when</div><div id="00:29:12.560" class="transcript_line"> we lived at tinnen ant as i say coy curnew when they built the motorway um 1966 they put all the</div><div id="00:29:22.080" class="transcript_line"> drainage from the construction into the stream that ran past our house and our house if you can</div><div id="00:29:30.480" class="transcript_line"> imagine our house was there and the stream used to come right around our house and in 1975 it was</div><div id="00:29:40.800" class="transcript_line"> they it had rained so much that the stream couldn&#039;t take it so instead of going around</div><div id="00:29:46.560" class="transcript_line"> our house it came straight through our house and we were flooded up to about the depth of other</div><div id="00:29:52.400" class="transcript_line"> not over our wellington about that much and the house would like that for oh crumbs probably a</div><div id="00:29:59.360" class="transcript_line"> week so what happened fortunately we we built we bought this old cottage and um converted it</div><div id="00:30:07.760" class="transcript_line"> ourselves and built on the kitchen and bathroom and my husband had had the the electric plugs</div><div id="00:30:14.800" class="transcript_line"> put at waist high instead of down so we were okay for electric you see because there&#039;s nothing</div><div id="00:30:20.800" class="transcript_line"> below that always we were we were wearing wellingtons in the in the house and then when</div><div id="00:30:27.520" class="transcript_line"> we went to bed you there&#039;s this rural wellingtons halfway up the stairs it was horrible it was</div><div id="00:30:33.680" class="transcript_line"> absolutely awful yeah did you get compensation um our house was insured and the contents and</div><div id="00:30:42.960" class="transcript_line"> everything fortunately with the company that my father worked for um and so we did we got the price</div><div id="00:30:50.720" class="transcript_line"> of a new carpet and what we actually did was had our carpet um uh hung up and and dried and put back</div><div id="00:30:57.440" class="transcript_line"> down again we steam cleaned it you know while it was hung up um and we had but we had the price of</div><div id="00:31:02.880" class="transcript_line"> a new carpet so we did quite well out of it actually and um the price of the furniture as well</div><div id="00:31:09.040" class="transcript_line"> which we simply dried and kept on using and so we we did make quite a couple of bobbies</div><div id="00:31:14.960" class="transcript_line"> i can&#039;t remember how much but it was but the motorway constructors they didn&#039;t say oh no no no no no</div><div id="00:31:22.960" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t want to know so you remember the area before the motorway went in yep what was it like</div><div id="00:31:30.960" class="transcript_line"> like it is now except for the motorway yeah it was just um i had some friends whose house</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> had to be demolished you know right in the path of it yeah yeah and we worked on that with the</div><div id="00:31:43.760" class="transcript_line"> jcbs for quite a long time yeah so so you had some friends whose house was um compulsory purchase</div><div id="00:31:51.680" class="transcript_line"> yeah so what was that like for them was it difficult i don&#039;t remember i know that they had to move and</div><div id="00:31:58.160" class="transcript_line"> they did move and i think the compensation they had was good um but i don&#039;t really remember much</div><div id="00:32:04.480" class="transcript_line"> about it except that their house was bang slap in them in the way yeah so was there any opposition</div><div id="00:32:11.520" class="transcript_line"> to the motorway going through i don&#039;t remember there being any opposition they may well have</div><div id="00:32:16.960" class="transcript_line"> been but i really don&#039;t think there was so your husband or your company worked on the motorway</div><div id="00:32:23.520" class="transcript_line"> yeah really yeah yes i can claim to have driven my car the wrong way on the motorway because i</div><div id="00:32:31.440" class="transcript_line"> i used to uh deliver fuel to them and whatnot on and pick up truck and then of course there&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:37.280" class="transcript_line"> no traffic anyway so i so i&#039;ve actually driven the wrong way down the m4 that&#039;s amazing yeah what</div><div id="00:32:44.800" class="transcript_line"> stretch um beyond cardiff and back then beyond newport through the tunnels i think back to the</div><div id="00:32:56.160" class="transcript_line"> cauldron in the next junction back god how long was your were you working on it for then</div><div id="00:33:02.960" class="transcript_line"> i mean i imagine there were lots of other oh yes yes and lots of others um oh crammed i don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:33:12.400" class="transcript_line"> probably about two years yeah massive job yeah it was it was massive yeah did they find anything</div><div id="00:33:19.920" class="transcript_line"> when they were doing the motorway don&#039;t think so no i don&#039;t think so if they did i didn&#039;t hear about</div><div id="00:33:27.360" class="transcript_line"> it so you were up there before it even opened oh yeah it was your job to deliver fuel yep</div><div id="00:33:35.760" class="transcript_line"> yeah that wasn&#039;t that was my thursday job no it wasn&#039;t that was my tuesday job yeah go around all</div><div id="00:33:42.560" class="transcript_line"> the sites collect all the time sheets from the drivers give them fuel on hydraulic oil if they</div><div id="00:33:47.680" class="transcript_line"> needed it carries a couple of spare wheels as well in case they needed it and that was my tuesday</div><div id="00:33:53.840" class="transcript_line"> job and my thursday job was to work out the wages and then friday deliver all the wages around the</div><div id="00:34:00.800" class="transcript_line"> sites along the motorway along well along everywhere up as far as brinmower all over the place wherever</div><div id="00:34:08.000" class="transcript_line"> they were working so presumably that was cash in little brown envelopes yes but but properly done</div><div id="00:34:14.720" class="transcript_line"> you know not not um uh cash in an envelope but proper wage slips it was all it was all correct</div><div id="00:34:21.040" class="transcript_line"> yes yeah everything was in a little brown envelope yeah with your wage slip in that&#039;s it but you</div><div id="00:34:25.920" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t get that ever now i don&#039;t suppose you would i don&#039;t know the last time i was ever paid</div><div id="00:34:30.960" class="transcript_line"> in cash for anything yeah you know you know with a with a wage slip yep so so you would have had to</div><div id="00:34:36.480" class="transcript_line"> go to a bank and get all the money out yes yes i drew the money out friday morning and took the</div><div id="00:34:42.240" class="transcript_line"> wages out friday afternoon no thursday afternoon i drew the money from the bank and then did the</div><div id="00:34:48.720" class="transcript_line"> wages early friday friday morning and because it was all done manually then you had the national</div><div id="00:34:54.880" class="transcript_line"> insurance tables and whatnot um and then set off around the site and deliver it so to get onto the</div><div id="00:35:02.320" class="transcript_line"> motorway before it was open did you have to have a special pass or anything like that no no there</div><div id="00:35:08.320" class="transcript_line"> empty entrances to the motorway you know when about every road junction you could have got on</div><div id="00:35:13.760" class="transcript_line"> or off the motorway so was it did he help make the tunnels the yeah oh yes we worked on the</div><div id="00:35:19.920" class="transcript_line"> bring grass tunnels yes and the boot town tunnels in cardiff yes crazy yeah so the insurance for the</div><div id="00:35:28.880" class="transcript_line"> boot town tunnels i am told but i i can&#039;t see that anyone would have made it up the insurance</div><div id="00:35:37.280" class="transcript_line"> the insurance premium allowed for 10 men to be killed on that project my god and my husband saw</div><div id="00:35:46.400" class="transcript_line"> one man killed he jumped on a dumper um what they did they cast the roof of the tunnel first</div><div id="00:35:54.640" class="transcript_line"> and then everything was down through holes in in the in the tunnel and they were big wide holes</div><div id="00:36:00.240" class="transcript_line"> you know half the size of this room and this man jumped on a dumper because it was in his way</div><div id="00:36:05.920" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t his dumper and the throttle stuck open and he went straight down the hole and was killed</div><div id="00:36:14.160" class="transcript_line"> the dumper turned over halfway down and squashed him they think if it had gone down solidly might</div><div

and if we made if we broke any bits of the diggers they could always repair it for us it was</div><div id="00:39:02.240" class="transcript_line"> what about did you was your husband or your business ever involved in making the seawall</div><div id="00:39:07.760" class="transcript_line"> oh yes before we got married um martin worked for the drainage board and um he did a lot of the</div><div id="00:39:16.720" class="transcript_line"> hiring the seawall and then with massive stones and then covering it in soil and grass and whatnot</div><div id="00:39:22.320" class="transcript_line"> yes yeah he did a lot of that yes because he&#039;s owned that seawall between me and between us</div><div id="00:39:29.600" class="transcript_line"> and getting flooded up to there i know it&#039;s quite a thought isn&#039;t it yeah we&#039;re below sea level here</div><div id="00:39:34.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah what about um uh do you ever think about that being below sea level or do you just</div><div id="00:39:41.360" class="transcript_line"> live with it don&#039;t ever think about it no what about um did did you or your husband ever go fishing</div><div id="00:39:50.080" class="transcript_line"> oh my husband fished yes he fished on the on the river y um up beyond usk</div><div id="00:39:57.600" class="transcript_line"> really yeah he salmon fished for salmon yeah yeah oh he loved fishing and i like an idiot</div><div id="00:40:05.280" class="transcript_line"> went with him one day he said why don&#039;t you come and i sat on that bank for hours and hours and</div><div id="00:40:11.920" class="transcript_line"> hours oh no i only did it once i never did it again so no fishing off the seawall or into the</div><div id="00:40:20.960" class="transcript_line"> reeds um they do fish from the seawall i believe um yeah apparently they have caught cod and</div><div id="00:40:28.880" class="transcript_line"> quite big fish off the seawall but i don&#039;t know who does it and um they also fish along this lane</div><div id="00:40:35.920" class="transcript_line"> oh really there&#039;s a massive fish in this rain and he&#039;s been caught hundreds of times</div><div id="00:40:40.560" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s about like that apparently i&#039;ve never seen him i only know what people are saying</div><div id="00:40:44.640" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s a massive fish and every time they catch him of course they throw him back and he&#039;s been</div><div id="00:40:48.960" class="transcript_line"> caught it seems that he enjoys being caught and then having the hook taken out his mouth and</div><div id="00:40:55.760" class="transcript_line"> chucked back in yes what&#039;s this ring called do you know no i don&#039;t um the one going down on down the</div><div id="00:41:02.880" class="transcript_line"> marshfield road is the broadway okay um but i don&#039;t know what this one is i don&#039;t think it&#039;s</div><div id="00:41:08.160" class="transcript_line"> got a lane a name yeah so they chuck the fish back in yeah yeah oh yes yeah i think he&#039;s a pike</div><div id="00:41:16.560" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s not um he&#039;s not a neatable fish anyway yeah no what about the seven bridge did we ever involved</div><div id="00:41:23.520" class="transcript_line"> in that uh we were involved in building the second seven bridge yeah yeah um on this side</div><div id="00:41:30.560" class="transcript_line"> of the river but doing the the just the ground work for the new preparatory for building the</div><div id="00:41:36.720" class="transcript_line"> bridge yeah i&#039;ve worked there for quite a long time yeah did they find anything there no</div><div id="00:41:44.800" class="transcript_line"> not as far as i know no unless they didn&#039;t didn&#039;t tell me so that was that&#039;s relatively recently</div><div id="00:41:51.600" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t it um yes because the old seven ridge was 1966 correct me because that was the year my</div><div id="00:41:59.200" class="transcript_line"> elder son was born yeah um so that was 1966 i don&#039;t know when they did this one um</div><div id="00:42:09.120" class="transcript_line"> probably the 1980s ish i don&#039;t know i don&#039;t either i would say 90s you could well be right the 90s</div><div id="00:42:17.920" class="transcript_line"> yes 90s yeah definitely 90s early 2000s maybe yeah we don&#039;t think of it as being new anymore</div><div id="00:42:23.680" class="transcript_line"> which we did in those days yes yeah yeah how long were they working on the bridge for then</div><div id="00:42:28.720" class="transcript_line"> well you know not not terribly long um it was a preparatory work to you know going over the</div><div id="00:42:35.200" class="transcript_line"> actual water yeah and um there&#039;s if you you go up approach to the bridge now on the left hand side</div><div id="00:42:44.240" class="transcript_line"> across the stretch of water is um a timber yard and i went there once i had to deliver something</div><div id="00:42:50.880" class="transcript_line"> there but i stopped it was fascinating that they were floating a section of the bridge down</div><div id="00:42:56.160" class="transcript_line"> the river and i stopped and what i couldn&#039;t say there all the time because of course it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:43:02.560" class="transcript_line"> a very fast operation they had yeah and i&#039;d love to have seen them hoisted up into place but i</div><div id="00:43:08.000" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t have the time yeah that would be a concrete cliff yes yeah that&#039;s incredible it was incredible</div><div id="00:43:15.280" class="transcript_line"> they lifted it up and yeah and then of course they tarmacked over it um it was only sort of</div><div id="00:43:20.080" class="transcript_line"> the framework of the bridge they did they&#039;ve tarmacked it once it was in place and they made</div><div id="00:43:24.960" class="transcript_line"> those in chapstow the the bits for the bridge yeah oh did they yeah i didn&#039;t know that and um</div><div id="00:43:32.000" class="transcript_line"> one of the you know we used to have a ferry across the river then yeah one of the ferries is i can&#039;t</div><div id="00:43:38.000" class="transcript_line"> remember which one my son did tell me because he saw it they&#039;re restoring one of the ferries</div><div id="00:43:43.840" class="transcript_line"> in chapstow are they yep i didn&#039;t know that either um and he he saw it anyway yeah and he</div><div id="00:43:52.400" class="transcript_line"> said they were well on with them so i presume they&#039;ll just have it at the museum i suppose</div><div id="00:43:57.440" class="transcript_line"> oh that&#039;d be interesting to find yeah it would did you ever go on it no oh we went on it yeah</div><div id="00:44:03.680" class="transcript_line"> when we when it was operational across the air oh yes what was that like it was okay but it</div><div id="00:44:09.680" class="transcript_line"> depended on the tide and sometimes you&#039;d wait four hours for the tide to be high enough to</div><div id="00:44:15.760" class="transcript_line"> really yeah and then we on my vespa scooter we did a we went on holiday down to Bournemouth and</div><div id="00:44:25.200" class="transcript_line"> that sort of area and when we came back when they went to put it on the ferry it skidded off the</div><div id="00:44:31.680" class="transcript_line"> ferry into the water glory me what your scooter my scooter yeah so everyone grabbed it and got it</div><div id="00:44:38.320" class="transcript_line"> back on and i was terrified that the engine wouldn&#039;t work because it had been under water but</div><div id="00:44:43.040" class="transcript_line"> when we got the other side thank goodness it was okay but we nearly lost it we really nearly lost</div><div id="00:44:49.120" class="transcript_line"> it i was lucky yeah the back we just skidded off there&#039;s quite a lot of mud on the ramp yeah</div><div id="00:44:55.040" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s got him and and we were driving and my husband was standing alongside it driving it up</div><div id="00:45:00.400" class="transcript_line"> onto the thing and the back we did shit into the water oh boy happy days i&#039;ve forgotten about that</div><div id="00:45:07.680" class="transcript_line"> see when i see pictures of it it looks completely open</div><div id="00:45:11.840" class="transcript_line"> what did you do when it was crossing was there somewhere you could sit inside</div><div id="00:45:18.160" class="transcript_line"> no no no no no you just stayed in your car but you had a motorbike well you stayed with your motorbike</div><div id="00:45:24.480" class="transcript_line"> fair enough you couldn&#039;t get in a motorbike i appreciate that we just stood there until</div><div id="00:45:29.120" class="transcript_line"> we got the other side only a couple of minutes and so it was because it looks very um oh it didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:45:35.920" class="transcript_line"> take long precarious um precarious would probably write but it was the way everybody crossed was on</div><div id="00:45:44.560" class="transcript_line"> the ferry yeah unless you want to go all up around cluster and come down again yeah yeah so we used</div><div id="00:45:50.880" class="transcript_line"> to yeah yes and then of course oh there&#039;s many a time that um we were in the queue to go on the</div><div id="00:46:00.400" class="transcript_line"> ferry and there&#039;d be only a couple of cars in front of us and by then the level of the water</div><div id="00:46:05.760" class="transcript_line"> would have dropped too much we had to sit there for four hours oh yeah and we did that a couple</div><div id="00:46:12.240" class="transcript_line"> of times sat for four hours oh i mean was there somewhere to have a cup of tea or an ice no no no</div><div id="00:46:18.960" class="transcript_line"> the other side there was yeah there was a cafe there and um and sort of a a shop as well yeah</div><div id="00:46:26.400" class="transcript_line"> and you could get a drink there and buy spice sweets and whatnot but not this side only the</div><div id="00:46:32.000" class="transcript_line"> other side yeah so just where exactly was the ferry where did it come in was it by it was where</div><div id="00:46:38.160" class="transcript_line"> at brook yeah it was under the old seven bridge okay okay the it was just a couple of yards either</div><div id="00:46:47.120" class="transcript_line"> side of the old seven bridge the ramp up yeah yeah do you remember when the first bridge opened</div><div id="00:46:54.480" class="transcript_line"> uh i remember it&#039;s 1966 and it was because i was expecting um hayden then and it was about</div><div id="00:47:04.960" class="transcript_line"> april time he was born in december but it was i was just expecting him when it came when it opened</div><div id="00:47:11.840" class="transcript_line"> that was the old one the new one i can&#039;t remember when it opened yeah now they&#039;ve taken the tolls</div><div id="00:47:17.360" class="transcript_line"> away i know it&#039;s fantastic yeah it didn&#039;t affect me because i got a blue badge anyway but um</div><div id="00:47:23.360" class="transcript_line"> so i didn&#039;t have to pay to cross the bridge anyway but you don&#039;t have to wait at the cold</div><div id="00:47:27.520" class="transcript_line"> deep booth oh we had to wait at the toll booth until you show show the badge and they took the</div><div id="00:47:32.880" class="transcript_line"> particulars and then let you go but now of course there&#039;s no no tolls at all now you&#039;ve got a lot of</div><div id="00:47:40.560" class="transcript_line"> stories pan haven&#039;t you i thought i just i never thought i never thought of that i i really didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:47:49.280" class="transcript_line"> know it&#039;s an interesting perspective though you know yeah the diggers and the yeah the big</div><div id="00:47:55.200" class="transcript_line"> infrastructure projects you&#039;re involved oh yeah and then um there&#039;s a big building in newport road</div><div id="00:48:02.560" class="transcript_line"> in cardiff um head and house and we did all the foundations for that and because it was such a big</div><div id="00:48:09.040" class="transcript_line"> building it had a very deep foundations yeah and we had to um dig ourselves onto a platform where</div><div id="00:48:17.200" class="transcript_line"> the digger could stand and then dig down a bit further and stand on that platform until we were</div><div id="00:48:22.560" class="transcript_line"> right at the the level where they wanted the the foundations to be why yeah gosh yep yes did you</div><div id="00:48:30.800" class="transcript_line"> ever operate a digger yourself a digger yeah only around the yard in you know when not not out on</div><div id="00:48:37.440" class="transcript_line"> site ever but if i could drive them around the yard if they wanted to move from here to there sort</div><div id="00:48:43.040" class="transcript_line"> of thing yeah yeah yeah so there are any other stories you&#039;d like to add i can&#039;t think of any</div><div id="00:48:50.080" class="transcript_line"> characters you met or no no our mp paul flin has died recently and um i was involved with him um</div><div id="00:49:07.360" class="transcript_line"> um on we had a yard building a yard down the bottom and when we moved out of there</div><div id="00:49:16.320" class="transcript_line"> the people who took it on rented it um but not from us from we rented it and they rented after</div><div id="00:49:23.840" class="transcript_line"> and they wanted to do something i can&#039;t even remember what it was but it was against the</div><div id="00:49:27.840" class="transcript_line"> planning laws anyway and i had to go to a meeting with paul flin and a lot of other interested</div><div id="00:49:35.440" class="transcript_line"> people and say my piece and that was it and a couple of years later there was something going</div><div
