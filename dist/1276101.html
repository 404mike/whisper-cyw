    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Chapter 7, Glasgow. General strikes, workers and tanks.</div><div id="00:00:05.600" class="transcript_line"> Strikes were also a massive problem for David Lloyd George in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:12.100" class="transcript_line"> Some of those strikes were very, very significant, but there was a great number of strikes.</div><div id="00:00:18.300" class="transcript_line"> The general strike in Glasgow started with racist violence.</div><div id="00:00:27.100" class="transcript_line"> On the 23rd of January, Emmanuel Shinwell, then leader of the Glasgow branch of the Seafarers Union</div><div id="00:00:34.800" class="transcript_line"> and chairman of the Gladdow Trades and Labour Council, told a meeting of 600 white merchant-sail Navy sailors</div><div id="00:00:42.600" class="transcript_line"> that the reason they were finding it hard to find work was because of cheap Chinese labour.</div><div id="00:00:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Later that day, sailors were waiting at the Mercantile Marine offices, hoping to sign on for a ship.</div><div id="00:00:55.800" class="transcript_line"> There was a large group of white sailors and about 30 Sierra Leone seamen.</div><div id="00:01:02.400" class="transcript_line"> This was the Brumelor riot, the first of the race riots in 2019.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The 30 Sierra Leone men were chased to 118 Brumelor Street, a lodging house,</div><div id="00:01:15.200" class="transcript_line"> where hundreds of merchant seamen attacked the house.</div><div id="00:01:19.500" class="transcript_line"> But the men fought back and two attackers were injured, one stabbed, one shot.</div><div id="00:01:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Sierra Leone seamen David Samuel and Tom Johnson were arrested for attempted murder.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> In an interview later, Shinwell blamed the black men for taking jobs.</div><div id="00:01:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Strikes were happening all over Glasgow, and on the 27th of January,</div><div id="00:01:43.100" class="transcript_line"> the strike committee decided to announce a general strike.</div><div id="00:01:47.400" class="transcript_line"> Flying pickets were sent to those places not yet on strike.</div><div id="00:01:52.900" class="transcript_line"> Many of those pickets were ex-servicemen, some still in army grey coats.</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> All of Clydeside was involved and miners in Stirlingshire.</div><div id="00:02:05.600" class="transcript_line"> At first, the police were used to intimidate the strikers and drive them off the streets.</div><div id="00:02:12.600" class="transcript_line"> But on Bloody Friday, January 31st, fighting broke out at a rally in George Square.</div><div id="00:02:20.400" class="transcript_line"> What sparked off the fight is unclear, although it&#039;s generally attributed to the police trying to stop a tram from being immobilised,</div><div id="00:02:28.700" class="transcript_line"> a technique that was being used by the strikers.</div><div id="00:02:32.100" class="transcript_line"> In any case, the police had orders to use their batons that day.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And if the tramway incident had not provided a justification for their attack, then another pretext would have been found.</div><div id="00:02:45.100" class="transcript_line"> Trade union leader Gallagher describes the attack.</div><div id="00:02:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Suddenly, without warning of any kind, a signal was given,</div><div id="00:02:52.200" class="transcript_line"> and the police made a savage and totally unexpected assault on the rear of the meeting,</div><div id="00:02:57.800" class="transcript_line"> smashing right and left with their batons, utterly regardless of whom or what they hit.</div><div id="00:03:03.500" class="transcript_line"> With brutal ferocity, they made their onslaught on defenceless workers.</div><div id="00:03:09.100" class="transcript_line"> But the police got more than they bargained for that day.</div><div id="00:03:11.700" class="transcript_line"> Pitch battles took place in the square and the surrounded streets.</div><div id="00:03:15.900" class="transcript_line"> Charge after charge by the police was driven off under a hail of bricks and bottles until the police were forced to retreat.</div><div id="00:03:28.500" class="transcript_line"> The government now sent in the army.</div><div id="00:03:31.500" class="transcript_line"> And literally, the government had hesitated to take this step because of fear of possible mutiny,</div><div id="00:03:36.900" class="transcript_line"> because the army itself was not properly under their control.</div><div id="00:03:43.100" class="transcript_line"> At a meeting of the War Cabinet held January 30th,</div><div id="00:03:47.100" class="transcript_line"> General Charles had pointed out in the pre-war years we had a well-disciplined and ignorant army,</div><div id="00:03:54.200" class="transcript_line"> whereas we now have an army educated and ill-disciplined.</div><div id="00:03:58.300" class="transcript_line"> An interesting quote.</div><div id="00:04:00.100" class="transcript_line"> But the defeat of the police put an end to the government&#039;s hesitation.</div><div id="00:04:03.900" class="transcript_line"> Thousands of troops, fully equipped, poured into Glasgow late on the night of Bloody Friday and early Saturday morning.</div><div id="00:04:11.800" class="transcript_line"> Accompanied by heavy munitions wagons, the general appearance of long columns of khaki-led men suggest that at least the government is in earnest in the measures to crush the new revolutionary spirit,</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> wrote the Glasgow Evening News.</div><div id="00:04:29.400" class="transcript_line"> Howitzers were positioned in the city chambers.</div><div id="00:04:33.200" class="transcript_line"> The cattle market was transformed into a tank depot.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Machine guns were posted on the top of hotels.</div><div id="00:04:41.500" class="transcript_line"> And the main post office and armed troops stood sentry outside power stations and patrolled the streets.</div><div id="00:04:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Apart from preparing new laws, the government also used the existing ones to carry out a decision made at the War Cabinet meeting of June 31st.</div><div id="00:05:04.200" class="transcript_line"> They arrested the strike leaders to weaken the strike movement.</div><div id="00:05:08.100" class="transcript_line"> The next day, union leaders Gallacher and Kirkwood were arrested while trying to stop the fighting in George Square.</div><div id="00:05:15.200" class="transcript_line"> And in the following days, the rioting was used as an excuse to pick up other leaders, including Shinwell.</div><div id="00:05:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Everett, the National Secretary of the Marxist-British Socialist Party, and Hopkins, Glasgow&#039;s Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.</div><div id="00:05:30.500" class="transcript_line"> The press, supporting the government, jumped on board.</div><div id="00:05:35.300" class="transcript_line"> The Glasgow Herald put the strike down to the clap-trap nonsense of Trotsky and the studious inculcation of the temper of revolt.</div><div id="00:05:45.700" class="transcript_line"> And described its leaders as a gang of political revolutionaries who have contrived to exploit the industrial weariness of Scottish workers, notorious rebels against the social order.</div><div id="00:06:01.100" class="transcript_line"> Terrorism on the Clyde proclaimed one headline in the Scotsman.</div><div id="00:06:05.700" class="transcript_line"> And Glasgow Bolshevism, disgraceful scenes, proclaimed another in the Evening News.</div><div id="00:06:13.500" class="transcript_line"> Over an article which claims the troops have been sent in to protect life and property from the rebel.</div><div id="00:06:21.300" class="transcript_line"> The Glasgow strike was broken and the strike leaders were all taken to court after tanks and howitzers in the main square and across Glasgow.</div><div id="00:06:39.100" class="transcript_line"> The central argument for the strike was the workers wanted a reduction not from 54 to 47 hours a week as the trade union congress had agreed with government, but down to a 40 hour week.</div><div id="00:06:59.800" class="transcript_line"> And the reason they wanted a 40 hour week was to ensure that more unemployed people would be in work.</div></div></p>
