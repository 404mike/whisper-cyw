    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think now we&#039;ll hear from Bill Williams about Black Diamond, as he remembers it.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh people of Black Diamond, some of the Welsh came from Nortonville in California,</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> where they had worked for the coal company, and then the coal company moved to Black Diamond, they continued working for them.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Some people came directly from Wales, some were from other parts of the country.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It is a natural thing for men who are familiar with coal mines to return to work in a coal mine.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s often said that once a miner, always a miner. I&#039;ll disapprove of that later in my talk.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh people were organizers of churches, lodges, labor unions, teams of baseball and football, and mine rescue teams.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They competed with teams of other mining towns.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The three churches prospered, and when one church had a social or bizarre, people from the other churches would attend.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They supported each other. Black Diamond was a happy town. The citizens were not all Welsh.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There were many people from other European countries, but they intermixed both in joy and sorrow.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There were accidents in the mine, and all citizens felt the loss.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I have spoken of Welsh being leaders who stood for the causes they believed were right.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I am thankful, and I know others are thankful, that the miners persisted at the start of the big union strike, which was in regard to wages.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The coal company brought in strikebreakers and guards to protect them, and they operated the mine while the union and the company worked out a plan to buy the miners&#039; homes because they were built on company property.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> This alone will demonstrate that there was no violence, even though some of their neighbors went back to work as strikebreakers.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if this condition could prevail today without violence. Things have changed.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The union and the miners built a new town about a mile west of Black Diamond and called it Morganville.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Now we are talking about the newcomers and the union miners on strike.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The miners had settled in their new houses, but the post office was in Black Diamond, so the former residents had to go back to Black Diamond to get their mail.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> This was always a reminder of where they used to live, but they endured it.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I mentioned to a man who lived there about the absence of violence, and he told me how near they came to violence.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The newcomers at Black Diamond decided that they were going to go down to Morganville and beat up on the union miners.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But one person up there who was sympathetic to the union miners went down and told the men what was planned.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So they got their hunting rifles and went out on the edge of town and got underneath a house and were ready if anything should happen.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And one Welshman walked out to meet them. He said, boys, I&#039;d like to talk to you.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;d advise you not to start any trouble because, he said, see this house underneath there? See those guns sticking out?</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I think you&#039;d better go back where you came from. And they turned around and went back to Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I have mentioned people who have been very prominent in Welsh activities.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I have not mentioned names of anything, there is one person that I would like to speak of, was Miss Jenny Edwards.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> At the celebration of March 1982 at Westminster Presbyterian Church, she gave a talk.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And as far as I could tell, it was all from memory. She didn&#039;t seem to refer to notes at all.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And she gave a wonderful description of the early mining days.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So eventually these miners who had moved out to Morganville went and found jobs at other places away from the mines.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they built, well, some of them moved to Seattle, some of them to Renton and other little towns.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And they either built new homes or lived in homes that were much better than the homes that they had lived in Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I must say, in their new homes they even had indoor toilets.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They proved that a coal miner&#039;s life was not for life. They could work successfully at other occupations.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;ve told you about the Welsh miners. You might wonder what eventually became of the Pacific Coast Coal Company.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They sold their seam ship line, the town of Black Diamond, 6,000 acres of land, and a new cement plant which they had in Seattle.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And the company went out of business.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> All of that I&#039;ve told you is in the new book that has just been published called Black Diamond Mining Memories.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It can be purchased at Black Diamond at the Black Diamond Museum.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You will find most everything there in the book except there&#039;s one thing I&#039;d like to mention that you won&#039;t find.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> My company wanted the bosses to work the miners hard.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were many who either got fired or left because they wouldn&#039;t mistreat the men working for them.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of those men was my dad. I wondered why dad wasn&#039;t a foreman. He was at one time.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And he pulled a one-man strike. He just didn&#039;t go to work.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The mine superintendent who knew him well because he lived just a block away went to dad and asked him what was wrong.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, well, I&#039;ll tell you. He says, I won&#039;t work those men the way they want me to.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, they&#039;re working hard under very dangerous conditions.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, well, all right. He says, I&#039;ll find you another job. So he did.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He found him a job as an operator of the water pumps to pump the water out of the mine.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t want you feeling sorry for the poor coal company.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> As the saying goes, so you shall reap. They lost everything. Thank you.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
