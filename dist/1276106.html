    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> 1919, Newtonian riots in the armed forces. This is chapter 6 of our series of short stories.</div><div id="00:00:09.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s part of a sequence where we&#039;re explaining what happened and what was going across the</div><div id="00:00:13.720" class="transcript_line"> desk of the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, in that 1918-1919 period. 1919</div><div id="00:00:24.400" class="transcript_line"> when the race riots occurred. But those issues began in 1918 on the Royal Navy when mutinies</div><div id="00:00:33.440" class="transcript_line"> occurred from November 1918 when and the crew of a cruiser in Libau, Lithuania refused to sail.</div><div id="00:00:42.920" class="transcript_line"> Similarly in the ports of Archangel and Mamansk, Navy crews were mutinying. In January 1919,</div><div id="00:00:53.040" class="transcript_line"> the Admiralty warned the British government, the Prime Minister, that sailors were trying to form</div><div id="00:00:58.120" class="transcript_line"> a trade union. The Royal Navy ships who were moored around Russia and in Mamansk in 1918 and</div><div id="00:01:10.440" class="transcript_line"> 1919 refused to sail, partly because they refused to go to war against the Bolsheviks. For the Navy,</div><div id="00:01:21.600" class="transcript_line"> the war was over. On the 13th of January 1919, the Royal Navy gunboat, the HMS Kill Bride,</div><div id="00:01:30.280" class="transcript_line"> moored in Milford Haven, experienced a mutiny. The crew refused to obey orders and even took</div><div id="00:01:39.360" class="transcript_line"> over the ship and flew the red flag instead of the Royal Navy ensign. January 1919 also saw Royal</div><div id="00:01:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Navy mutinies in Inver Gordon, Ross Scythe, Devonport and Portsmouth with crews refusing to</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> weigh anchor and sail for action. And the 645 ton gunboat, the HMS Sekela, when ordered to sail up</div><div id="00:02:06.560" class="transcript_line"> the river Davina, exposing itself to Bolshevik guns on the banks of the river, they refused to go.</div><div id="00:02:12.840" class="transcript_line"> The Admiral Cohen asked the Admiralty if Britain was actually at war with the Bolsheviks,</div><div id="00:02:19.320" class="transcript_line"> as war had not officially been declared, and was told yes. He then arrested five men from the</div><div id="00:02:26.440" class="transcript_line"> mutiny and sentenced to death. This was later commuted to five years in prison. The issues</div><div id="00:02:33.040" class="transcript_line"> were threefold and this was consistent across the armed forces. The men had had enough of war. They</div><div id="00:02:40.920" class="transcript_line"> were generally volunteers or conscripts and they wanted to return home. After all, their war had</div><div id="00:02:50.080" class="transcript_line"> been against Germany. Russia versus the Bolsheviks, who had taken over predominantly most of Russia</div><div id="00:02:57.880" class="transcript_line"> in the 1917 Civil War, the Navy and later the Army felt this was not their war. In fact,</div><div id="00:03:07.440" class="transcript_line"> many respected the Bolshevik cause. But the real problem for government came when soldier</div><div id="00:03:14.320" class="transcript_line"> mutiny started. At the start of 19 there was a wave of soldier mutinies at Southwick, Folkestone,</div><div id="00:03:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Dover, Osterley Park, Shortlands, Westrom Hill, Felixstowe, Grove Park, Shoreham, Bristol, Aldershot,</div><div id="00:03:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Kempton Park, Southampton, Maidstone, Blackpool, Park Royal, Chatham, Fairlop, Biggin Hill,</div><div id="00:03:38.160" class="transcript_line"> as well as several London railway stations where troops refused to embark trains for Russia and</div><div id="00:03:45.600" class="transcript_line"> France. And troops already in Calais and Archangel formed Soviets and made links with local struggles.</div><div id="00:03:53.640" class="transcript_line"> On the 3rd of January 1919, 12,000 soldiers blocked Folkestone Harbour and 2,000 marched in</div><div id="00:04:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Dover to the town hall. They were refusing to be sent back to France or to Russia. The common story</div><div id="00:04:12.240" class="transcript_line"> was they wanted to be demobilised. The war they signed up for was over. In London, 1,500 soldiers</div><div id="00:04:21.800" class="transcript_line"> marched on 10 Downing Street but unsurprisingly the Prime Minister David Lloyd George was out</div><div id="00:04:27.680" class="transcript_line"> when they arrived. In 1919 there were more than 50 soldier mutinies and 100,000 soldiers were</div><div id="00:04:36.200" class="transcript_line"> involved in those mutinies or as some of them called them strikes but in the armed forces.</div><div id="00:04:42.640" class="transcript_line"> Refusing to work is a mutiny. More than anything they wanted to go home and were tired of army</div><div id="00:04:50.880" class="transcript_line"> discipline. They were conscripts, they were volunteers. This was not a professional army</div><div id="00:04:57.760" class="transcript_line"> that we now see as normal. On the 23rd of January, over 5,000 soldiers arrived in Southampton Docks,</div><div id="00:05:06.200" class="transcript_line"> got off their ship to discover they were not going home. Instead the rumours started they</div><div id="00:05:12.120" class="transcript_line"> were going to Russia. They formed a soldiers union and mutinied. The army sent General Hugh</div><div id="00:05:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Trenchard to bring the situation to an end. This was an uncompromising man, former commander to</div><div id="00:05:24.280" class="transcript_line"> the Royal Flying Corps and later to be in charge of London&#039;s Metropolitan Police. His task was to</div><div id="00:05:30.480" class="transcript_line"> show all army conscripts mutiny would be dealt with in an uncompromising way. The mutiny and</div><div id="00:05:37.680" class="transcript_line"> soldiers wouldn&#039;t let him into the docks. He then brought in military police and 250 armed</div><div id="00:05:44.160" class="transcript_line"> soldiers from Portsmouth who were lined up in front of the mutineers with fixed bayonets and</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> ordered to cock rifles and instructed to fire on command. Trenchard was believed. All but a</div><div id="00:05:58.120" class="transcript_line"> hundred mutineers gave in and the hundred who did not were hosed down with ice-cold water from</div><div id="00:06:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Southampton Harbour and then arrested. In Calais on the 26th of January the men of the Army Ordnance</div><div id="00:06:14.560" class="transcript_line"> and Mechanical Transport Corps refused to obey orders. They joined with French dock workers to</div><div id="00:06:22.160" class="transcript_line"> bring the railways and shipping to a halt. Soldiers at Vendreux camp and women of the</div><div id="00:06:28.160" class="transcript_line"> nursing corps in Dunkirk marched to Calais to join the now created Soldiers&#039; Council.</div><div id="00:06:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Five thousand soldiers were waiting for ships to go back to Britain. They joined the strike and</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> soon the number was 30,000 armed forces members. Generals to Julian Bing were sent to stop the</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> mutiny. Unfortunately he arrived before the two divisions of soldiers who were supposed to</div><div id="00:06:57.240" class="transcript_line"> accompany him and when he met the soldiers the strikers took his car and replaced the limousine</div><div id="00:07:06.280" class="transcript_line"> with an army jeep. When the divisions arrived many were young and inexperienced. They talked to the</div><div id="00:07:14.160" class="transcript_line"> strikers and many changed sides. By now Bing had had enough and with the soldiers he had available</div><div id="00:07:20.640" class="transcript_line"> he set up machine gun posts around the camp and ordered surrender or death. He arrested four ring</div><div id="00:07:27.600" class="transcript_line"> leaders who he wanted to sentence to death but Winston Churchill, Minister of War, could not</div><div id="00:07:33.720" class="transcript_line"> remit risk martyrs so they were imprisoned instead. Now as I&#039;ve said that&#039;s over 50 mutinies,</div><div id="00:07:41.480" class="transcript_line"> a hundred thousand soldiers, massive disruption and even soldiers marching from Victoria Stafan</div><div id="00:07:48.960" class="transcript_line"> station with rifles at the slope ready down Whitehall. Churchill could see hundreds of them</div><div id="00:07:57.360" class="transcript_line"> marching past his window and he admitted later in a book that he was afraid. I remained in my room</div><div id="00:08:05.240" class="transcript_line"> a prey to anxiety. Yet unlike West Indian soldiers who were to mutiny in Taranto in Italy because</div><div id="00:08:15.360" class="transcript_line"> they were denied a wage increase because of their colour, no white soldier was shot for mutiny in</div><div id="00:08:21.560" class="transcript_line"> 1919. Those soldiers were to return to haunt black people in particular but to haunt Prime Minister</div><div id="00:08:35.240" class="transcript_line"> David Lloyd George later once they became ex-servicemen. But the problem for David Lloyd</div><div id="00:08:43.280" class="transcript_line"> George was he simply didn&#039;t have an army that was under his control and he had promised those</div><div id="00:08:52.580" class="transcript_line"> soldiers in the 1918 general election that he would demobilise them quickly. He was overruled</div><div id="00:09:02.360" class="transcript_line"> on that promise by a faction led by Winston Churchill but nonetheless the disillusionment</div><div id="00:09:09.400" class="transcript_line"> of the soldiers began.</div></div></p>
