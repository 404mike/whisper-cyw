class="transcript_line"> That is how I started interacting with the people.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I found people with different opinions from this country, from all over.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I just started my life again.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> My life was so nice.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m in the classroom again.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Seeing somebody teaching me.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I just started comparing my life with who I was the one who was teaching.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m the one who is somebody like a child.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We started like being told that the heart is under the table.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Those are the things I was teaching young and young children of the environment.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had to pass FIA.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to take it.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to respect what they are saying, what they are telling me.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Until they see that I&#039;m beyond that.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was telling the others, no.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t you see they go this, this and this.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You can put them in one word and it&#039;s called the funchers.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the teachers, anyhow we are teaching and you are telling us more than what you are teaching.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I told them, no.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was a teacher, they told me you don&#039;t belong here.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So they advised me to go to the next level.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So what I thought they did, they told me.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you do diploma in business?</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I told them yes.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did the diploma in business.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was all out of what I know.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s not my career.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I just do it.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I passed in 2012 and 2013.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is how my life started.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And from there, about a few months, I was removed from house to house, house to house.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had to bring my two children who were adult.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And they came and joined me.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> After that, regardless of my condition, because the cancer was too much for me.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it had spread to the tummy.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to put a condition.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I have a condition.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a stomach bug, which I&#039;m managing up to now.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And to the heart of that, I thought that I just want to go to school again.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when I applied for university.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And still I could not be a teacher.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt that it&#039;s too much for me.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I told them I just want to do something to do with the community.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Something whereby mix with the community.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I need to, because I was a special need teacher back in my country.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to do some things to do with vulnerable people.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That is when I was offered to do health and social care management.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I did my first degree.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I passed very well.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And to come outside is not the way I expected.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no job like that.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to do care jobs, support workers.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I felt it&#039;s okay, because in my church, I was helping those old children, old women.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I could go to their cups, sit down, start eating with them, give them company, chatting.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt that I&#039;m doing something to the community.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And the student, the support worker.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then that is how I started mixing, seeing life have changed.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Then all of a sudden, my mind again told me, I knew you were a teacher.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt that, yes, I was a teacher.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They told me you can&#039;t do the classroom setting unless you do masters in something.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They asked me, which area are you in Kenya?</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I told them I was dealing with children with autism.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was offered a place again to do the masters in additional needs.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I did my one year masters and I passed.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I started volunteering in a classroom setting.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I felt it is not what I wanted.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I left it.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I started working with the community as a support worker.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes care.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that is my life here now.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I got this one, the project.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That is how I found that we have changed because I&#039;m doing this, I&#039;m mixing with people.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I am giving to the community.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Before I was like fraught when I gained nothing.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I first started with courage, I mixed with people.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We talked, I gained years, I gained years, I gained years.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And now I build that myself.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I am in a level where I am not afraid of anybody.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I can approach anybody.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I am given a chance to approach people.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because things have changed.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Good story.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you be able to tell me a bit about what home means to you now?</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My home.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Although there is upside down.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because not because I&#039;m not somebody with a system, economic, everything, which is affecting everybody.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> To call a home again is not a home to me.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Because back in my country, a home meant that I could go to my garden, pick some food, milk my cows, have my own fresh things.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But nowadays I study in my house and see it&#039;s not anymore like the way it was.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Even it achieved from how I came in this country.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit hard.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And now as a single mom, bringing the two young adults is not easy.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in my country, although it has not achieved, you could say stop and they can stop.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Nowadays as a single mom, if you tell them to stop, they have their right to do what they want.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you are at home, you don&#039;t know how you react, how they react because of the system in here.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a home, but on the other side you have to put the boundaries to call it a home.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to use your own techniques.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> How old are you, Jody?</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> One is 20.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The only girl is 25.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boy is 29 now.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But I have two more back in Africa.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> One is 39, the other one is 35.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, big family.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a big family.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had it called too because some are here, some are not.</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> How often do you go back at all?</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The first time we went was about 12.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> After 12 years in this country, I went in two years ago to see them.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I came back.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I lost two of my sisters.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to go back.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and just recently I lost another one here, my sister.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry to hear that.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing all of that really generously.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder, can you tell me a bit about a place or a time in your life that is important to you?</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s when my children join me when I was sick.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was waiting for another operation.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve gone like five operations.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that one was so hard.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They came in.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And after two months, I was told I will have another major operation.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So my daughter was 14 by then.</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But she was there for me.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My son was there for me.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Comparing with previous when I came here, I had nobody.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew nobody.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed in the hospital, depending on the hospital food, depending on whoever will spread the mercy.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There is someone who is from this country.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But my children came in.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> My first operation was at least, even if I lose my life, my children are here with me.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So that operation I was told it can be 50-50.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was true.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And so when it was done, it started to add wheel out.</div><div id="00:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I became very sick.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember my daughter with me.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to find a way of hiding her because they didn&#039;t expect what they saw.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So they just get away from this food somewhere.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was told that I will go another emergency.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> After three days, I was told I will go another major emergency.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They had the first man&#039;s tumor, but it didn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So they told me we have to take him back to the hospital and put the man&#039;s tumor back.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s not working.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And you are getting worse.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was told inform your family.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But don&#039;t tell your daughter because it will not be easier.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It is 50-50.</div><div id="00:17:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know whether we will succeed.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I was operated, when I was operated, when I wake up, I found myself back with the bath.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, what is happening to me?</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing is working for you.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But now this will be permanent.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t need to risk again.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told them, yeah, I&#039;m happy.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It saved my life.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m happy.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m happy.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> My family is here.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I can tell them and they can pass the nursing before.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> If I die, there&#039;s some people to send the nursing.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The most important, why I&#039;m saying this, that one was Muslim or happiest day or something which made me happy.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my family was there when I needed them.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing that.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you want to tell me about that time in your life?</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything else.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if you would like to tell me about your childhood or growing up in Kenya.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> All I can remember, I was born in 1965.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And we are family of ten, seven girls, three boys.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But now all have gone.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We are left with two of us, the girls, and two boys.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So we are three girls and two boys now.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I grew up in a village whereby we would do a lot of work fetching water, fetching firewood, a village life.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I grew up with my siblings, the one who I lost last year.</div><div id="00:19:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I was not, we are seven.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the third from the last.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the fourth from the last.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Soon I have lost two other me.</div><div id="00:19:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And I lost two.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So five of them have gone.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So four of them have gone.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I went to school back in 1974.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to primary school.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We could carry them.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother was a business woman.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And we could take the bananas, you know, bananas.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So before we go to school, we had to take the bananas to the town city center.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> All of us, each with one, each with one, leave them there.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mom, because she was having a problem with her legs, she could go and sell during the day.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to, we are taking every day and go to school.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then in the evening we could fetch firewood, we could fetch water.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a happy life because it&#039;s you and your children and you&#039;re sharing everything.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Like the way I remember when we were in a museum and somebody talked about sitting in the waterfront.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s somebody who said about sitting.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We were talking, we were discussing sitting down.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you were sitting improperly, your mom could throw something to you.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You knew that it was fun and everything.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And our parents were communicating by hitting you.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Not like now.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I finished my primary school that way.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The secondary school I went to, unfortunately I went to a day school.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to do the same thing, helping my mom to take some stuff to the market, going back to school, coming in the evening.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The worker is waiting for you, fetching firewood.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> If there is anything to do, fetching water, doing all sorts of things, then you sleep the same thing, getting this yourself.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then after that, after my secondary school, I just do some like kashiwaka before I get married.</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married and I got my children.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I get married whereby it&#039;s not that it was yet time, but because others are doing that, my age meeting, I get married.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married that day.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not a first marriage.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just for me, just because my friend is doing it.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody to, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So nobody forced me to do it.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got my four children.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that, that is how the life started.</div><div id="00:22:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I went through the college, through as a teacher, my career, I went through a lot.</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But the thing is, I could not go back to my parents.</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Whenever I go back to my parents, I was told, you have to go back.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Marriage was very respected by them.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Your parents, you stay two, three days to tell you have to go back.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They come, they will see you have to go back.</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Every time you go, you have to go back.</div><div id="00:23:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Until I found that enough is enough.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to take my children.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe they will join me later.</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe somebody will take care of them.</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I left them and I made my decision to come to the UK.</div><div id="00:23:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So that is how my life was.</div><div id="00:23:31.000" class="transcript_line"> A bit of the beat of my life.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing all of that.</div><div id="00:23:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if you could tell me about a, you have told me about one important moment with your children coming to be with you.</div><div id="00:23:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there another maybe a magic moment when something changed for you?</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:23:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Here in the UK?</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That can be, it can also be previously.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It can be any time in your life.</div><div id="00:24:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Just something that felt magic, that felt something was changing.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> To me, let me say, as I said before, I had no voice.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But after mixing with people, after talking with people, like here in Bowser, it gave me more confidence.</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> When I started this project, this is my first project.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I started it like very low.</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what to do.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I was like, where am I?</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> What is this?</div><div id="00:24:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I had been doing a lot of projects during my courses and during my whatever, it&#039;s not like this one.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> This is my first one to work for it for money.</div><div id="00:24:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So, but there is a time I can say that I feel that I have the confidence to speak.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a confidence to say, no, I can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:25:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a confidence to say this, I&#039;m doing the project to tell some people when I say that it&#039;s succeeding,</div><div id="00:25:11.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s that I&#039;m getting what is going on.</div><div id="00:25:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I have the courage to tell people I&#039;m doing a project.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told some people, some people try to, if you go to Bowser or Google, see their jobs, if it&#039;s something to do the project, pick it.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not a big, big, big thing.</div><div id="00:25:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something you can do it.</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that moment make me feel that I&#039;m somebody I can talk.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel even now, that is why I&#039;m talking to you in a corner.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And before I was like, no, but now I can face anybody.</div><div id="00:25:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I can talk to any group.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Before I was tiptoeing to come to Bowser, now I open the door.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s my right to be open the door for me.</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m doing something, you see.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> This is some of the magic.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> This is like a magic to me.</div><div id="00:26:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can face another one and another project.</div><div id="00:26:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I feel that I had told people apply, some applied and got the jobs.</div><div id="00:26:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, not in the project, but in some failures.</div><div id="00:26:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they are seeing this, it&#039;s not something they can be able to do.</div><div id="00:26:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m telling them, don&#039;t sit there.</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Go, try, they will help you.</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like magic to me.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a magic.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:26:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That does really sound magical.</div><div id="00:26:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell me about your hopes for the future?</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> What are your hopes for the future?</div><div id="00:26:52.000" class="transcript_line"> One, I have no permanent job.</div><div id="00:26:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something I was doing on a piece of paper last night in my house.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, where am I heading?</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So in future, unless I volunteer, I don&#039;t feel like I can do any stressful job.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I just want to do like volunteering things.</div><div id="00:27:13.000" class="transcript_line"> If I don&#039;t get something for myself, I think I have done enough.</div><div id="00:27:20.000" class="transcript_line"> In my country, I worked for 18 years as a teacher.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I have so much in my head with the children.</div><div id="00:27:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Here I&#039;m working with the grown-up, vulnerable people.</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes too much for me, but I feel I&#039;m passionate about it.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel I have to do it.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But in future, I just want to have something just for me,</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> but to do with vulnerable people, but not somebody and offer me to tell them that it&#039;s a deadline.</div><div id="00:27:56.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a deadline.</div><div id="00:27:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There I need my peace of life and something I can do with two or three people.</div><div id="00:28:06.000" class="transcript_line"> If at all I don&#039;t get the council to give me just three vulnerable people,</div><div id="00:28:11.000" class="transcript_line"> old, either old or those with disabilities, and sit with them in their houses, house accommodation.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Sit with them.</div><div id="00:28:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Do paperwork for them.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Me, myself, send it to the council, say this one, do the care plan, everything, assessment.</div><div id="00:28:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In future, it will be something like that.</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> If it will not work, I give it to somebody else, but I know I have something which is going on.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it that you&#039;d like to have your own organization or company?</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a company.</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a company.</div><div id="00:28:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Just for accommodation, accommodated living, supported living.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Wherever I get in, find them, they are here.</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We talk, they want to go somewhere, that sort of things.</div><div id="00:29:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Or a house with just three old women, you know, and some people who would like to be, just to sit with them.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We meet, we talk, we do the various things.</div><div id="00:29:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Word, pencil, everything, things like that.</div><div id="00:29:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d like to support them in their accommodation?</div><div id="00:29:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Sounds great.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that is it.</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> In future, not in future, that&#039;s why I say that.</div><div id="00:29:41.000" class="transcript_line"> My time is like, happy now.</div><div id="00:29:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s something which I&#039;m thinking of now.</div><div id="00:29:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You said you want like your peace of life, you know, peaceful times.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that helps you to feel at peace that you enjoy doing?</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> How does you feel peaceful?</div><div id="00:30:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Gardening.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> In my house, I plant my own vegetables.</div><div id="00:30:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s most of the time in my compound.</div><div id="00:30:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Then from there, I either walk and wait for...</div><div id="00:30:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I walk and I like walking.</div><div id="00:30:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In the bushes, I hear the birds sound, those things.</div><div id="00:30:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t like mixing with so many people.</div><div id="00:30:25.000" class="transcript_line"> For one reason is the coordination.</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> My coordination, if I sit for a long time with the people in a group, I have to tell them,</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> if you hear my sound, my tummy making, this, that, I have the coordination.</div><div id="00:30:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want that.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I say that.</div><div id="00:30:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Just one or two or three, we may tell them, I have this.</div><div id="00:30:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If you hear something, it&#039;s my stomach.</div><div id="00:30:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But a logical is very hard to explain.</div><div id="00:30:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a great idea for the future.</div><div id="00:31:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So is there anything else you&#039;d like to tell me or share that you feel is important for</div><div id="00:31:08.000" class="transcript_line"> people to know about you and your life?</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything important.</div><div id="00:31:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that you&#039;d like to tell us about your life that you think is</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> important for people to know, to have on this record of your life?</div><div id="00:31:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to tell us?</div><div id="00:31:27.000" class="transcript_line"> To take each other at a time.</div><div id="00:31:36.000" class="transcript_line"> People should not, that&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I always say that.</div><div id="00:31:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Take that day you are there.</div><div id="00:31:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You either do something for yourself or for the people.</div><div id="00:31:50.000" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t do something for yourself, do it for the people.</div><div id="00:31:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s something which will be remembered in future and say, yes, Annie did this for</div><div id="00:32:01.000" class="transcript_line"> us.</div><div id="00:32:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you feel there is something which is inside, you take it out.</div><div id="00:32:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Let people know.</div><div id="00:32:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that is it.</div><div id="00:32:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:32:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s it for the questions for the interview.</div><div id="00:32:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought now we could just go over the museum visits again.</div><div id="00:32:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you wanted to tell any of those stories again or add anything, you know, what are</div><div id="00:32:29.000" class="transcript_line"> the things you saw?</div><div id="00:32:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What are the memories you had?</div><div id="00:32:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d love to just make sure we&#039;ve got that properly on the audio.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> When we are visiting the museum for the first time at Waterfront, you know, I was saying</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> that like I am going there to take the women to see the museum.</div><div id="00:32:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when we went there, I was like, oh, so even me, there is some things I&#039;m learning</div><div id="00:32:54.000" class="transcript_line"> from there.</div><div id="00:32:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I started to get the interest of the museum.</div><div id="00:32:59.000" class="transcript_line"> What is there?</div><div id="00:33:01.000" class="transcript_line"> What is happening?</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the lady started telling about the things, I became more and more interested.</div><div id="00:33:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The first thing which caught my eyes is the typewriter.</div><div id="00:33:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When I saw that typewriter, it gave me a memory back in my ears when I finished secondary</div><div id="00:33:24.000" class="transcript_line"> school.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember when I finished my secondary school, the first thing I told my parents</div><div id="00:33:33.000" class="transcript_line"> that I want to be a secretary.</div><div id="00:33:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I went to a college called Peteyman in Nairobi.</div><div id="00:33:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I went there and I was enrolled.</div><div id="00:33:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I saw that computer, I remember the ones we are using, they were using some ink</div><div id="00:33:52.000" class="transcript_line"> long, long time ago.</div><div id="00:33:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That is about 20 or 30, that is about 45 years ago.</div><div id="00:34:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They were using the ink.</div><div id="00:34:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And that gave me a nice memory.</div><div id="00:34:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I was going to Nairobi Street.</div><div id="00:34:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Nairobi is the capital city of Kenya.</div><div id="00:34:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The way I was going to the street, just to type, it was making some noise.</div><div id="00:34:19.000" class="transcript_line"> All your type in here.</div><div id="00:34:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That gave me a very nice memory.</div><div id="00:34:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, so I can then see something like this here in the UK.</div><div id="00:34:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember asking you whether this is the same Peteyman, whether it&#039;s the same in</div><div id="00:34:36.000" class="transcript_line"> my country, Nairobi.</div><div id="00:34:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And you give me the feedback and you told me it&#039;s the same.</div><div id="00:34:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And that thing has made me proud that I started 45 years ago and now I can see it somewhere.</div><div id="00:34:50.000" class="transcript_line"> In Kenya, they were disposing of it.</div><div id="00:34:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t get them.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You won&#039;t see them anywhere.</div><div id="00:34:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was happy to see that one.</div><div id="00:34:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That is the Waterfront Museum.</div><div id="00:35:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a bit more about how it felt to type on it?</div><div id="00:35:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What did it feel like?</div><div id="00:35:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Just wait for this noise to stop now.</div><div id="00:35:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, it&#039;s very noisy here today, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:12.000" class="transcript_line"> A ton of noise.</div><div id="00:35:14.000" class="transcript_line"> The one which was here, all the way I was doing it back then.</div><div id="00:35:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The one you could remember?</div><div id="00:35:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was nice because even when you are in a very, very low mood, you know it was making</div><div id="00:35:37.000" class="transcript_line"> very, I have told you it was making that noise.</div><div id="00:35:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That, that, that, that.</div><div id="00:35:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s like giving you some, even if you come home and you feel that, when you</div><div id="00:35:49.000" class="transcript_line"> come home to the college and you feel that you cannot do it, the way everybody was doing</div><div id="00:35:54.000" class="transcript_line"> it is you are making fun of each other.</div><div id="00:35:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a keyboard, you know?</div><div id="00:35:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that gave me a memory of the happiness, gave you back your sense, gave you back your</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> happiness.</div><div id="00:36:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was nice.</div><div id="00:36:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is why when I saw it here I felt that, yeah, it&#039;s something which can give</div><div id="00:36:13.000" class="transcript_line"> me the memories of my country and my childhood, not childhood really, that youthiness.</div><div id="00:36:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that you&#039;d be feeling youthful?</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:36:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What else did you see that sparked memories for you?</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, waterfront.</div><div id="00:36:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Waterfront museum in Soansea.</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> There is also a locomotive.</div><div id="00:36:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:36:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we are told that you are using the solar.</div><div id="00:36:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I remember I asked them what happens if they, like in our house, back in Kenya,</div><div id="00:36:54.000" class="transcript_line"> if we put the solar and there is no light, I mean there is no sun, we are in darkness,</div><div id="00:37:00.000" class="transcript_line"> although it&#039;s not fully darkness, you cannot see enough light because they are using the</div><div id="00:37:06.000" class="transcript_line"> solar with the sunlight they see.</div><div id="00:37:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was thinking about it because they say that it was, you can go and Google about it</div><div id="00:37:16.000" class="transcript_line"> that in the, that Soansea, it is here, but I can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:37:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It is in my phone.</div><div id="00:37:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:25.000" class="transcript_line"> This one.</div><div id="00:37:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, yeah.</div><div id="00:37:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you see?</div><div id="00:37:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you have solar in Kenya?</div><div id="00:37:35.000" class="transcript_line"> For the houses, for the light.</div><div id="00:37:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Before there was electricity, we are using solar.</div><div id="00:37:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I was thinking about this thing.</div><div id="00:37:44.000" class="transcript_line"> If it was using solar to go all the way, what about if there is a, like I was asking if</div><div id="00:37:50.000" class="transcript_line"> it is like the one we are using in Kenya and there is no sun that day, so we are using</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> the light firewood to see through.</div><div id="00:37:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What about this one?</div><div id="00:37:59.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s on the way and it stops, what will happen?</div><div id="00:38:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Will it be the end of the journey?</div><div id="00:38:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:38:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I need something to know more about it.</div><div id="00:38:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t get in, but tell me what will happen.</div><div id="00:38:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But then this is like, I just compared to the journey with women who come to the bowser.</div><div id="00:38:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When coming from their country, they feel that it&#039;s taking me, I was like, it&#039;s the end</div><div id="00:38:29.000" class="transcript_line"> of me.</div><div id="00:38:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I have to start all over again.</div><div id="00:38:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them came to seek the relief to the bowser, but they started their life again,</div><div id="00:38:38.000" class="transcript_line"> though up and down.</div><div id="00:38:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They finally go to where they are supposed to be, through bowser.</div><div id="00:38:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So they, from the darkness to the light again.</div><div id="00:38:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The same thing is with this one.</div><div id="00:38:51.000" class="transcript_line"> If it stops, there must be something because there is a lot of technologies in this country.</div><div id="00:38:57.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a way to go through to the other side.</div><div id="00:39:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was thinking of comparing that to it.</div><div id="00:39:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lovely metaphor.</div><div id="00:39:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a beautiful metaphor you&#039;re saying that there&#039;s always more sunlight coming.</div><div id="00:39:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they use the solar system.</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So you think bowser is like the solar power?</div><div id="00:39:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s like the solar power to where it is.</div><div id="00:39:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Not really, but yeah, it is because the women come here thinking that outside there, they</div><div id="00:39:29.000" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t think that their life will be the same.</div><div id="00:39:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe some of them going to the next of our ends, FGM, all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:39:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But then they come to bowser, they met that faces, that people who cared for them, that</div><div id="00:39:43.000" class="transcript_line"> people you tell them what to do.</div><div id="00:39:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You can get the money, you can seek the work, you can do this.</div><div id="00:39:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And their life starts again.</div><div id="00:39:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Until then they leave the bowser and start their life in a bright way, you see.</div><div id="00:39:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like this anyway, because it can stop anywhere.</div><div id="00:40:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they do their technology and they can start again.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:40:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really beautiful.</div><div id="00:40:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for that.</div><div id="00:40:11.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great because a lot of people would walk past that and they wouldn&#039;t really think</div><div id="00:40:17.000" class="transcript_line"> about it.</div><div id="00:40:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s not using the petrol rapper.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You can learn it.</div><div id="00:40:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They have to use some things of which I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:40:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But to me it&#039;s a solar system.</div><div id="00:40:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Something which is telling me it&#039;s to do with the nature, is it?</div><div id="00:40:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Solar power.</div><div id="00:40:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Solar power.</div><div id="00:40:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So it absorbs the rays of the sunlight.</div><div id="00:40:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they have little cells, little cells that can absorb that and convert the UV rays</div><div id="00:40:47.000" class="transcript_line"> into electricity.</div><div id="00:40:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how it works.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:40:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It needs the sun rays.</div><div id="00:40:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it needs the sun rays, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s no sun rays somewhere.</div><div id="00:40:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It stores it.</div><div id="00:40:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:40:59.000" class="transcript_line"> What will happen is it will store the energy.</div><div id="00:41:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Or if it&#039;s quite sort of basic technology, it will just run on what it has.</div><div id="00:41:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So for example, if it&#039;s not sunny that day, it won&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:41:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of bigger technologies, they&#039;ll have the ability to store it.</div><div id="00:41:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:41:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But your metaphor still works because what you&#039;re saying is that even if the sunlight</div><div id="00:41:25.000" class="transcript_line"> runs out, it always comes back.</div><div id="00:41:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always a new beginning.</div><div id="00:41:29.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always hope.</div><div id="00:41:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And places like Baozhou provide that hope and that sun ray.</div><div id="00:41:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That is it.</div><div id="00:41:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:41:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:41:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I love that.</div><div id="00:41:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything else from the museum?</div><div id="00:41:43.000" class="transcript_line"> From museum, that was a typewriter from there.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> There is another one in this one from the St. Fagans, I think.</div><div id="00:41:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:41:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s St. Fagans.</div><div id="00:41:58.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the type of fire we use.</div><div id="00:42:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, can I see?</div><div id="00:42:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, from the bakery.</div><div id="00:42:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, when I saw this, I just remember how I was baking for my children.</div><div id="00:42:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of the food we could call for rich people.</div><div id="00:42:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was a teacher, students were coming to eat in my house, and they thought the chapati.</div><div id="00:42:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You have heard of chapati?</div><div id="00:42:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The flat bread?</div><div id="00:42:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The flat bread was for the rich people, the teachers.</div><div id="00:42:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The only people, the rich people, they can&#039;t cook that one.</div><div id="00:42:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was so expensive.</div><div id="00:42:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And this one, I was baking.</div><div id="00:42:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I was rolling.</div><div id="00:42:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I was doing the balls and keeping them.</div><div id="00:42:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was counting.</div><div id="00:42:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I have four children.</div><div id="00:42:53.000" class="transcript_line"> This is for my four children.</div><div id="00:42:55.000" class="transcript_line"> This is for to take to school for the children who will not be having some food.</div><div id="00:43:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is to keep for the morning.</div><div id="00:43:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So this one, the way they put the balls, it&#039;s not here.</div><div id="00:43:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not showing.</div><div id="00:43:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I printed one.</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There are some balls here.</div><div id="00:43:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We were counting when cooking.</div><div id="00:43:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The dough?</div><div id="00:43:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The dough, yeah.</div><div id="00:43:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We were counting when cooking.</div><div id="00:43:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You should make sure the dough will come back five, according to the children, they have 111, and to give out like five, 111.</div><div id="00:43:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So this one, it made me of how I was doing it.</div><div id="00:43:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It was some memories which gave me.</div><div id="00:43:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I can see those children now which I was giving there because they were so poor.</div><div id="00:43:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Now they are the people with so many big, big things back in Kenya.</div><div id="00:43:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t go to secular school.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t need to go to secular school.</div><div id="00:43:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Their parents had no money, but they needed to do the business to make them people.</div><div id="00:43:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They are very, very rich.</div><div id="00:44:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I saw this, I was like, maybe I should do the bit so that it can fit for my children.</div><div id="00:44:08.000" class="transcript_line"> If I see it&#039;s not fit, I started moving some of the dough from here, here, here, here to make another dough so that when cooking, it will be enough for the children.</div><div id="00:44:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But if I got Kenya, those are the people I can see.</div><div id="00:44:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Even they are doing better than me.</div><div id="00:44:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you mean that you would have a ball and then you&#039;d split it and just make it go farther?</div><div id="00:44:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So you would call it a dough ball?</div><div id="00:44:39.000" class="transcript_line"> A dough ball, those balls.</div><div id="00:44:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to cut it again until I get that round.</div><div id="00:44:44.000" class="transcript_line"> If I do it, if I lift it, it will be small.</div><div id="00:44:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody will have a piece, a piece, a piece, a piece.</div><div id="00:44:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So why was chapati so expensive?</div><div id="00:44:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I always thought that that was sort of an affordable food.</div><div id="00:44:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Why was chapati so expensive?</div><div id="00:44:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s because by then it was for the rich people.</div><div id="00:45:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very expensive.</div><div id="00:45:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if you hear the smell from afar, the poor children from the poor families could just pass by your house, up and up, up and down, until you tell them to come for the piece.</div><div id="00:45:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It was for even us to get when we were growing.</div><div id="00:45:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a magic.</div><div id="00:45:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was very expensive.</div><div id="00:45:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very expensive.</div><div id="00:45:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The wheat, the flour.</div><div id="00:45:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the flour, yeah.</div><div id="00:45:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And is there any kind of fat in it as well, like a butter or an oil?</div><div id="00:45:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Oil, we cook with oil.</div><div id="00:45:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We fry with oil in the pan.</div><div id="00:45:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go and see how.</div><div id="00:45:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If you see them go out to cook chapati, you will see it.</div><div id="00:45:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very nice.</div><div id="00:45:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know I don&#039;t do it because if you do it, the wheat here is not like the wheat we are growing back in our country.</div><div id="00:45:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to be careful if you have cancer, genes, you need to be very careful with some of the things.</div><div id="00:46:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But some of the foods?</div><div id="00:46:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the things like wheat, processed meat, like sausages, bacon.</div><div id="00:46:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, those things are not good for the cancer patient.</div><div id="00:46:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, those are the kind of things I was told to keep away.</div><div id="00:46:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Interesting.</div><div id="00:46:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a housemate, I used to have a housemate from Tanzania, she would make chapati.</div><div id="00:46:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yeah, they know how to do it.</div><div id="00:46:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really good.</div><div id="00:46:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Really good with curries and everything.</div><div id="00:46:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this is the commandant.</div><div id="00:46:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I just closed this bridge for a purpose.</div><div id="00:46:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This bridge was there from the museum building to go to where our bus was.</div><div id="00:46:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We closed the bridge.</div><div id="00:46:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking about it and I had to call somebody from very far to take me a photo.</div><div id="00:47:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking about the, I thought about how we close out, how we were ready to come into my commandant.</div><div id="00:47:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, we were very late, so we didn&#039;t go back in the commandant, you remember?</div><div id="00:47:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of stuff which went on in the morning, then in the evening we had not much to talk about in commandant, if you remember very well.</div><div id="00:47:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I was closing this bridge, I just looked under the water.</div><div id="00:47:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You see that there was enough, there was not much in that building, it&#039;s just to do the wool.</div><div id="00:47:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But it gave me a memory of the skirt.</div><div id="00:47:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I, I, the, by then the wool is that, if a girl happened to wear a woolen, you are so expensive.</div><div id="00:47:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So we are going to various centers.</div><div id="00:47:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We went like this here, we call them charity.</div><div id="00:48:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Ours was not a charity, it was like somewhere nearby, close come from various outside the Kenya,</div><div id="00:48:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were put somewhere, people buy and sell it to the other people.</div><div id="00:48:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So the center charity here.</div><div id="00:48:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were taken every Saturday to check whether we would get a woolen.</div><div id="00:48:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know where we are coming from.</div><div id="00:48:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I saw that skirt, I remembered the first time I bought a woolen, it was my, I went to face my boyfriend,</div><div id="00:48:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was so happy because I&#039;m wearing a woolen and whatever.</div><div id="00:48:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when my mum, my mum discovered that I went to see the boyfriend, I was in the second school,</div><div id="00:48:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was beaten and beaten and my mother threw the woolen, that woolen skirt away and told me you never wear it again.</div><div id="00:48:54.000" class="transcript_line"> When I saw that, that woolen again in the command, and I was like, this give me a memory.</div><div id="00:49:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to see my boyfriend, my mother beat me and threw my woolen again.</div><div id="00:49:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Though I cannot get that one, it gave me that memory center.</div><div id="00:49:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:49:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking about this earlier.</div><div id="00:49:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking about when you told that story, you know, we were all laughing because it was so the idea of you being in a sort of dusty,</div><div id="00:49:25.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, Nairobi street with these woolen skirts, you know, going around.</div><div id="00:49:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it was, yeah.</div><div id="00:49:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And because it is woolen, somebody was like, woolen skirt, woolen skirt.</div><div id="00:49:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And that one is not like the nowadays whereby men are attracted by seeing something, sort something.</div><div id="00:49:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, by our time, it&#039;s the kind of dress, it&#039;s woolen, even if it is dirty, the fit is very nice, you see.</div><div id="00:49:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So it strikes me as a mixed memory because then you said your mum, your mother was physically, hurt you physically.</div><div id="00:50:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So our parents were very strict.</div><div id="00:50:12.000" class="transcript_line"> In comparing with the woolen nowadays, it was, it was a, this spring was there, but not anymore.</div><div id="00:50:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I told you when we, when we started the inter-internet, a home, you have to put a bridge, call it a home when you are with the youth or dealing with youth.</div><div id="00:50:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, you know, it can be, you can lose your home anytime.</div><div id="00:50:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Anytime you try to strike, he call the police.</div><div id="00:50:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what you call the police, you see, and you might lose your children.</div><div id="00:50:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So you have to, there is a bridge whereby you can close and where you cannot close.</div><div id="00:50:59.000" class="transcript_line"> In our days, our, my mum threw my skirt away just because it&#039;s the one which attracted the man to, yeah, because it was expensive, it was woolen, it was, yeah, by then.</div><div id="00:51:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Why do you think wool was so attract, was so, you know, why was wool sexy?</div><div id="00:51:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Why was wool...</div><div id="00:51:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, it&#039;s like fashion.</div><div id="00:51:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fashion, the way you see something in fashion, but in the next few years, it&#039;s same.</div><div id="00:51:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so woolen was on fashion back when I was growing, woolen, it was very uncommon to find an woolen skirt, woolen things, yeah.</div><div id="00:51:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was fashionable at that time.</div><div id="00:51:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it very hot to wear it?</div><div id="00:51:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hot, but regardless, even when it&#039;s hot, you could wear it to tell people you are wearing an woolen, hot or woolen skirt.</div><div id="00:51:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is the most thing we could wear to go and get, go to our boyfriend.</div><div id="00:52:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very expensive, but...</div><div id="00:52:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you wanted to share?</div><div id="00:52:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Nordic Weavers. Nordic Weavers gave me a...</div><div id="00:52:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:52:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You know the Sreti Museum?</div><div id="00:52:21.000" class="transcript_line"> The Sreti Museum was marvelous, it was nice.</div><div id="00:52:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The man who was doing the Sreti, there, they told us the rocks or whatever they called them, it came from there, all allowed somewhere there.</div><div id="00:52:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought when I went outside, I looked at the hill somewhere, this one.</div><div id="00:52:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I was thinking about my life.</div><div id="00:52:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I looked at it, the edge, and the man told us these things come from there.</div><div id="00:52:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was, I just was like, believing he was copying the...</div><div id="00:53:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That thing. He got it like, surplus, you know, because when you get a log, it&#039;s a, it&#039;s a, it&#039;s something which you cannot admire, the log, according to me.</div><div id="00:53:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But that man, the way he was cutting it, he was making some things with very beautiful, he shaped that log, the logs and the, the logs, and it was so, it looks something very nice.</div><div id="00:53:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I, I thought about it, about the life I started.</div><div id="00:53:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I started my life when I was very hungry.</div><div id="00:53:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I was like, a log.</div><div id="00:53:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody put my life like, nobody could admire me, admire me, nobody could like, you know, because I was so mistress.</div><div id="00:53:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I came to UK.</div><div id="00:54:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I, you know, I had to run away and come to UK.</div><div id="00:54:07.000" class="transcript_line"> With that shape.</div><div id="00:54:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had to put myself in it.</div><div id="00:54:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I got the problems, I started like, I started the, I had cancer.</div><div id="00:54:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was operated.</div><div id="00:54:25.000" class="transcript_line"> By that, I was thinking about it.</div><div id="00:54:29.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came out from the museum, I was thinking about it.</div><div id="00:54:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to take me a photo of what it feels like to me.</div><div id="00:54:37.000" class="transcript_line"> My life, the way here, this is logs.</div><div id="00:54:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They are shapeless.</div><div id="00:54:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I could see that life, that it&#039;s my life, this is the life I, it was like.</div><div id="00:54:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Then somebody came back in man.</div><div id="00:54:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The logs was taken and the man started shaping and shaped something very nice.</div><div id="00:54:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I had the stomach, I remembered that.</div><div id="00:55:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Although what I went through in my life, it didn&#039;t take my heart.</div><div id="00:55:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I was given a heart.</div><div id="00:55:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, I see this didn&#039;t break my heart.</div><div id="00:55:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so beautiful.</div><div id="00:55:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing that.</div><div id="00:55:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone really loved those, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:55:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was a really powerful gesture, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:55:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was.</div><div id="00:55:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And the man doing it, you know.</div><div id="00:55:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes can be shaped and they can be like logs.</div><div id="00:55:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And somebody can put it together.</div><div id="00:55:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Shape, you can see, you&#039;re doing it like that.</div><div id="00:55:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But once you are given like this, I was like.</div><div id="00:55:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I look at the logs, where they see that the logs come from locally.</div><div id="00:55:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I could see those logs.</div><div id="00:55:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they take the logs, they shape them and, you know, it was so lovely.</div><div id="00:55:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that is it.</div><div id="00:55:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, amazing.</div></div></p>
