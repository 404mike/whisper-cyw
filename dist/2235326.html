    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So morning, Mandy, I&#039;m Chris and I&#039;m a volunteer here and I understand you&#039;re a volunteer too.</div><div id="00:00:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Yep, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:00:10.440" class="transcript_line"> So perhaps you&#039;d like to tell us, I&#039;ve got to say that the date is the 15th of November</div><div id="00:00:19.200" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s 11.30 and it&#039;s a beautiful morning.</div><div id="00:00:22.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s absolutely beautiful and stunning.</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so lovely to be able to have such a beautiful place to come to and I feel really lucky that</div><div id="00:00:29.320" class="transcript_line"> I literally live around the corner.</div><div id="00:00:31.400" class="transcript_line"> I can just walk here to come here to visit and something I&#039;ve done since I&#039;ve actually</div><div id="00:00:37.960" class="transcript_line"> lived in Kingcoyd.</div><div id="00:00:40.240" class="transcript_line"> So that was 1982, moved to Kingcoyd and yeah, so I come up from then.</div><div id="00:00:47.680" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s your first memories of the reservoir?</div><div id="00:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Literally walking the dogs.</div><div id="00:00:52.560" class="transcript_line"> I had three dogs, I had two Yorkshire Terriers and a Great Dane and used to come up here</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> regularly to walk well.</div><div id="00:00:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you weren&#039;t meant to bring your dogs around here, but we did come through the fence</div><div id="00:01:04.200" class="transcript_line"> and come up and it was, I suppose in those days you were classed as really quite wild</div><div id="00:01:10.480" class="transcript_line"> because the grass was just long, you didn&#039;t have all the paths, it was just, you just</div><div id="00:01:15.280" class="transcript_line"> come up here and walked and you saw a few people fishing and other people walking the</div><div id="00:01:19.360" class="transcript_line"> dogs and people walking.</div><div id="00:01:20.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was very completely different to what it is now.</div><div id="00:01:25.200" class="transcript_line"> So when you first started, was the reservoir still open to the public?</div><div id="00:01:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, you could come up here.</div><div id="00:01:31.960" class="transcript_line"> The main entrance was obviously here by where the cafe and the buildings are now, but obviously</div><div id="00:01:37.960" class="transcript_line"> because I lived over on the other side, on Kingcoyd&#039;s side, it just used to go through</div><div id="00:01:42.920" class="transcript_line"> the parks, through Riespenne Park and then comes literally through the hedges and through</div><div id="00:01:47.520" class="transcript_line"> the fencing and come up there and so come up all year round.</div><div id="00:01:51.260" class="transcript_line"> So it was an unofficial hole in the fence, was it?</div><div id="00:01:53.920" class="transcript_line"> An unofficial hole in the fence, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:56.120" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d come up, yeah, I worked, I worked in the NHS and sometimes it was really quite</div><div id="00:02:01.840" class="transcript_line"> stressful and then you finish work and literally you&#039;d just come up here and sit.</div><div id="00:02:05.880" class="transcript_line"> And I often come up, just sit on the bank, just sit up here in the evening, you know,</div><div id="00:02:10.480" class="transcript_line"> bring the dogs or whatever and just come and sit and think, oh, how lovely it is to be</div><div id="00:02:14.240" class="transcript_line"> able to come out and just relax and have that time out.</div><div id="00:02:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it was...</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And were dogs officially allowed on there?</div><div id="00:02:23.120" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think... no, no, no.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I think occasionally they&#039;d have like a warden coming around, I think they would sort of</div><div id="00:02:29.520" class="transcript_line"> say, no, your dog&#039;s up here, but you know, a lot of people did and I think as long as</div><div id="00:02:34.600" class="transcript_line"> they were up ahead.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you were coming, there was fishing going on and sailing?</div><div id="00:02:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, I&#039;ve got a friend, because I walked up here recently with her and she used to</div><div id="00:02:44.160" class="transcript_line"> come fly fishing up here and she said, oh, crikey, I&#039;m coming up here fly fishing.</div><div id="00:02:49.560" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:50.880" class="transcript_line"> My brother used to do a lot of fishing, but I don&#039;t think he actually came up here and</div><div id="00:02:54.080" class="transcript_line"> fished, but yeah.</div><div id="00:02:56.760" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve been here since and or in your house since 1982.</div><div id="00:03:00.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:01.360" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve seen a lot of changes over this site of years.</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> So can you remember when when it got closed?</div><div id="00:03:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can remember the date, but just talking to Richard earlier on, it was 2005 when it</div><div id="00:03:14.680" class="transcript_line"> was closed.</div><div id="00:03:15.320" class="transcript_line"> And I have to say, we&#039;re quite devastated we couldn&#039;t come up here from, as I say,</div><div id="00:03:19.600" class="transcript_line"> times I&#039;ve come here before, I mean, it&#039;s covered in the snow, the kids come up with</div><div id="00:03:23.800" class="transcript_line"> their sledges and they&#039;d be going down on the slopes.</div><div id="00:03:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was lovely.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the biggest memories I have really is coming up here as my son got his GCSE</div><div id="00:03:33.320" class="transcript_line"> results at the Cardiff High and he wouldn&#039;t open the envelope.</div><div id="00:03:37.480" class="transcript_line"> And he was so worried about opening the envelope that we literally came up here.</div><div id="00:03:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I said, I know where we go.</div><div id="00:03:43.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to set the reservoir.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We sat on the bank.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, whatever the results are, it doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:03:48.800" class="transcript_line"> I says, we&#039;re just sit there and open them up there.</div><div id="00:03:51.640" class="transcript_line"> So we literally came up, sat on the, you know, on the on the line of reservoir and opened</div><div id="00:03:58.200" class="transcript_line"> his results on the end.</div><div id="00:04:00.520" class="transcript_line"> They were very good. All very good.</div><div id="00:04:02.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. He stayed on to the A levels and yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:05.680" class="transcript_line"> But that was a real lasting memory of sitting sitting up here, opening, opening the in those</div><div id="00:04:11.480" class="transcript_line"> days, the brown envelope with all the results.</div><div id="00:04:14.080" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:04:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:16.040" class="transcript_line"> So did once it was closed, was there any way of getting into the site itself?</div><div id="00:04:22.760" class="transcript_line"> No, because they, they barred it or they put all the, it was like a wire net in it.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> First of all, I can remember the first people that took it over.</div><div id="00:04:31.840" class="transcript_line"> It was all wired and just closed off.</div><div id="00:04:34.600" class="transcript_line"> And then they, then they started draining the, the Lanish and reservoir, which.</div><div id="00:04:38.800" class="transcript_line"> So you remember seeing it empty?</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> Did see it empty?</div><div id="00:04:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Did, where did we come through?</div><div id="00:04:46.280" class="transcript_line"> We did actually come up here when it was empty.</div><div id="00:04:49.080" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember how we got in, but we did get in.</div><div id="00:04:51.240" class="transcript_line"> So I know I come up here with my son, he&#039;s older than and again, was probably wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:04:56.800" class="transcript_line"> official, but I think we actually came in, probably walked through the fields because</div><div id="00:05:02.440" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of walking up.</div><div id="00:05:03.320" class="transcript_line"> You can go up to Liz Vane, can&#039;t you walk all through the fields and so on.</div><div id="00:05:05.960" class="transcript_line"> And probably got in through somewhere and come in because he did say that point, I</div><div id="00:05:10.760" class="transcript_line"> think he had a drone.</div><div id="00:05:11.480" class="transcript_line"> He said, I really must bring my drone up here and photograph it empty and film it</div><div id="00:05:17.280" class="transcript_line"> empty.</div><div id="00:05:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we actually did, but yeah, it did come in a few times, but it was, it</div><div id="00:05:21.560" class="transcript_line"> was awful to see it empty.</div><div id="00:05:23.280" class="transcript_line"> It was, it was very, very sad and the worry that they were going to build on it.</div><div id="00:05:27.920" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I did get involved with RAG.</div><div id="00:05:30.080" class="transcript_line"> I say I was working at the time, so I probably didn&#039;t have loads and loads of</div><div id="00:05:35.640" class="transcript_line"> time, but obviously was involved with the newsletter, subscribed and sort of put</div><div id="00:05:41.240" class="transcript_line"> money in into all the guys that were really working hard to save it and did some of</div><div id="00:05:46.320" class="transcript_line"> the sponsored walks.</div><div id="00:05:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Did you get involved in the deliveries as well for the leaflets?</div><div id="00:05:51.440" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t get in that, but I had stickers in my house, stickers on the car and</div><div id="00:05:57.240" class="transcript_line"> then we did the walks and stuff.</div><div id="00:05:58.920" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so involved in that and yeah, I can&#039;t believe how long it took really to</div><div id="00:06:04.520" class="transcript_line"> get it all stopped.</div><div id="00:06:06.440" class="transcript_line"> But it was good.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was stopped.</div><div id="00:06:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:07.960" class="transcript_line"> How many you can&#039;t deny that.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But you played a part and you must have some quite strong emotions really about</div><div id="00:06:17.720" class="transcript_line"> the fact that where we are today is just, it&#039;s completely different.</div><div id="00:06:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I love it now, but I have to say when I first saw the plans and they wanted to</div><div id="00:06:26.880" class="transcript_line"> put a building on here and all the rest of it, when I saw it, I wasn&#039;t keen</div><div id="00:06:33.360" class="transcript_line"> because I just remember it being so wild and so just, and I thought, I don&#039;t need</div><div id="00:06:37.760" class="transcript_line"> another Rothes Park.</div><div id="00:06:39.160" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got Rothes Park.</div><div id="00:06:40.720" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got all those facilities and I&#039;m thinking, do we want that?</div><div id="00:06:47.960" class="transcript_line"> And that was something I really didn&#039;t feel we needed.</div><div id="00:06:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I know lots of people would, but I didn&#039;t personally, I liked the idea of it being</div><div id="00:06:57.280" class="transcript_line"> much, much more sort of like wild and just free to just come and walk around.</div><div id="00:07:01.960" class="transcript_line"> But I have to say now the way it&#039;s been done, I think it&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:07:05.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, I love dogs.</div><div id="00:07:06.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got family dogs.</div><div id="00:07:07.920" class="transcript_line"> I am actually glad that you can&#039;t have a dog up here.</div><div id="00:07:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:10.920" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m glad that it&#039;s restricted.</div><div id="00:07:12.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no bikes and you know, and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:07:16.640" class="transcript_line"> So if you do come up here, it&#039;s much more, it&#039;s much more relaxed and calm to come</div><div id="00:07:22.280" class="transcript_line"> up here and we love the water.</div><div id="00:07:24.360" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been on the water.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been on the, on the big motherboards, the family, and we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:07:30.280" class="transcript_line"> absolutely had absolutely way a lot of time out there.</div><div id="00:07:34.360" class="transcript_line"> And just swimming up here with my sons.</div><div id="00:07:37.800" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been in the water as well.</div><div id="00:07:39.200" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been in the water of Utah.</div><div id="00:07:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, it&#039;s definitely in the water.</div><div id="00:07:42.320" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so that part of it absolutely loved now.</div><div id="00:07:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:46.440" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, so obviously got involved in becoming a volunteer now that I&#039;m retired</div><div id="00:07:51.480" class="transcript_line"> and yeah, come up here a lot just for a walk and hope to do some more volunteering</div><div id="00:07:57.280" class="transcript_line"> going forward, you know, different things.</div><div id="00:07:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:08:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ll stop it there.</div><div id="00:08:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:08:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Fine.</div><div id="00:08:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:08:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
