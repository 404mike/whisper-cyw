Her house was full of antiques and I loved them, especially the dresser, grandfather clock and settle.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one item that had stayed in my memory and it was a large framed picture on the wall of a little boy being questioned by a round head soldier about the whereabouts of his father, a cavalier.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was of course, and When Did You Last See Your Father, which was painted by WF Eames in 1878.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Lewis was great too, he would come up to our house for a bath once a week and we would wait for him to get into it, fetch the stool from the kitchen and tap on the window above the door.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t see anything, it was covered in steam.
