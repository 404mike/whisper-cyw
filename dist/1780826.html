with Margaret</div><div id="00:00:05.460" class="transcript_line"> Prosser and I can&#039;t see the name of your farm.</div><div id="00:00:08.220" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the name of the farm?</div><div id="00:00:09.220" class="transcript_line"> Croynant.</div><div id="00:00:10.220" class="transcript_line"> C-R-Y-N-A-N-G.</div><div id="00:00:11.220" class="transcript_line"> Croynant Farm and it&#039;s Rudry.</div><div id="00:00:14.220" class="transcript_line"> Rudry?</div><div id="00:00:15.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:16.220" class="transcript_line"> Near Cuffilly.</div><div id="00:00:17.220" class="transcript_line"> Near Cuffilly.</div><div id="00:00:18.220" class="transcript_line"> I thought we were near Cuffilly.</div><div id="00:00:19.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:20.220" class="transcript_line"> And it is Friday, September the 6th, 2019.</div><div id="00:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m just going to pop that down there.</div><div id="00:00:26.760" class="transcript_line"> When we were coming over the hill I could see, I thought, are we near Cuffilly?</div><div id="00:00:30.120" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:00:31.120" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t think we were that close.</div><div id="00:00:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you came up this road here.</div><div id="00:00:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:35.120" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re looking across there.</div><div id="00:00:37.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a different perspective because it&#039;s gorgeous looking across the levels there,</div><div id="00:00:40.360" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:41.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes it is.</div><div id="00:00:42.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:00:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And then when you get on the top there you can see Clevedon Pier.</div><div id="00:00:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:00:48.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:00:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I might have to come back when it&#039;s a clearer day.</div><div id="00:00:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:00:55.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not so clear today.</div><div id="00:00:56.120" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we&#039;ve had a rain this morning and that makes it more limited, won&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Have you met Marjorie Neale?</div><div id="00:01:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ve met Marjorie.</div><div id="00:01:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:01:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Are you related to her?</div><div id="00:01:07.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, we&#039;re great friends.</div><div id="00:01:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:01:09.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re from a young farmer&#039;s days.</div><div id="00:01:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh crikey.</div><div id="00:01:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:01:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, everyone&#039;s, it&#039;s so lovely.</div><div id="00:01:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Everyone, I have to say Margaret, everyone I&#039;ve met have been just adorable and so open</div><div id="00:01:20.120" class="transcript_line"> and welcoming.</div><div id="00:01:21.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just so lovely.</div><div id="00:01:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:23.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not so much easier.</div><div id="00:01:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Because Marjorie was born there on the moors.</div><div id="00:01:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:29.120" class="transcript_line"> She was born there.</div><div id="00:01:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Would you know Steph Davis?</div><div id="00:01:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what&#039;s her maiden name?</div><div id="00:01:36.120" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of her maiden name now.</div><div id="00:01:40.120" class="transcript_line"> She was born at Lower Newton House, I think.</div><div id="00:01:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Stephanie.</div><div id="00:01:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Stephanie.</div><div id="00:01:46.120" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of her name now.</div><div id="00:01:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll think of it.</div><div id="00:01:52.120" class="transcript_line"> But I wonder if we can just start off, if you could just tell us when you were born</div><div id="00:01:57.120" class="transcript_line"> and where you were born.</div><div id="00:01:59.120" class="transcript_line"> I was born at 31 Herbert Avenue, Riska.</div><div id="00:02:04.120" class="transcript_line"> As I say, my mother was a farmer&#039;s daughter and my father worked in the steelworks, you</div><div id="00:02:11.120" class="transcript_line"> know.</div><div id="00:02:12.120" class="transcript_line"> And we moved from there then to Park Places, Riska.</div><div id="00:02:16.120" class="transcript_line"> And we lived there for quite a few years.</div><div id="00:02:19.120" class="transcript_line"> And then we moved from there then and took the farm at Langhorst.</div><div id="00:02:23.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was 19...</div><div id="00:02:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, 1946, 47.</div><div id="00:02:29.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:02:32.120" class="transcript_line"> And then I moved back down then to Sluson in 1956 when I married Dewan.</div><div id="00:02:39.120" class="transcript_line"> So what was your father&#039;s name?</div><div id="00:02:41.120" class="transcript_line"> William Benjamin Thomas.</div><div id="00:02:43.120" class="transcript_line"> And your mother?</div><div id="00:02:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Minnie Harris.</div><div id="00:02:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:02:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Minnie.</div><div id="00:02:47.120" class="transcript_line"> So your father worked in the steelworks?</div><div id="00:02:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Where?</div><div id="00:02:51.120" class="transcript_line"> In Pontymester Steelworks, which is not there at the moment.</div><div id="00:02:53.120" class="transcript_line"> That was taken down some years ago.</div><div id="00:02:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Was that in Newport?</div><div id="00:02:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Riska.</div><div id="00:02:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Pontymester Riska.</div><div id="00:03:00.120" class="transcript_line"> So he wasn&#039;t a farmer at all?</div><div id="00:03:03.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> And then he had his sister, Evelyn Mary Thomas.</div><div id="00:03:08.120" class="transcript_line"> And she was 44 years in Riska at a radio in a natural gas shop.</div><div id="00:03:14.120" class="transcript_line"> And then his other sister, Auntie Phyllis, Phyllis Thomas, she was a teacher.</div><div id="00:03:19.120" class="transcript_line"> And up in Abercarne.</div><div id="00:03:22.120" class="transcript_line"> And they lived in...</div><div id="00:03:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ve got to think of the name of the place now.</div><div id="00:03:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, that&#039;s terrible.</div><div id="00:03:31.120" class="transcript_line"> They lived in Woodland Drive in Rogerstone.</div><div id="00:03:35.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether you know that area, do you?</div><div id="00:03:37.120" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:03:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Riska at all?</div><div id="00:03:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Not very well at all, though.</div><div id="00:03:40.120" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t?</div><div id="00:03:41.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, you go up through Woodland Drive, Rogerstone, up to Riska.</div><div id="00:03:43.120" class="transcript_line"> And then of course you carry on up the valley then.</div><div id="00:03:45.120" class="transcript_line"> So your mother was from a farming background?</div><div id="00:03:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> And where was she from?</div><div id="00:03:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Newhouse Farm, Pontyg, near Pontypool.</div><div id="00:03:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:03:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Well Newin it was, really.</div><div id="00:03:54.120" class="transcript_line"> So how did she meet your father?</div><div id="00:03:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Well I think my grandparents on my mother&#039;s side, father&#039;s side, lived in Newin.</div><div id="00:04:05.120" class="transcript_line"> And I think my dad used to go back and forth, you know, to see them.</div><div id="00:04:08.120" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how they met, I suppose.</div><div id="00:04:10.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s funny how people do meet, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:12.120" class="transcript_line"> So your father had to learn how to be a farmer then, seemingly.</div><div id="00:04:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he was always interested.</div><div id="00:04:17.120" class="transcript_line"> His cousin used to keep the Mardie Farm, Corkoonoo, just below the Corkoonoo Golf Course.</div><div id="00:04:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:24.120" class="transcript_line"> And he spent a lot of time there.</div><div id="00:04:26.120" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s, you know, he really got fed up with the, as the saying is, the stewardess.</div><div id="00:04:32.120" class="transcript_line"> So he thought they&#039;d branch out and they had this farming land course then.</div><div id="00:04:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And we took that over Lock, Stock and Barrel.</div><div id="00:04:38.120" class="transcript_line"> When they say Lock, Stock and Barrel, we took over the stock and rented the farm there.</div><div id="00:04:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:04:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Land course.</div><div id="00:04:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And I liked land course very much.</div><div id="00:04:49.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d look out for the door and we could see the Pentagon.</div><div id="00:04:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he had?</div><div id="00:04:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:54.120" class="transcript_line"> And 1947 was a winter.</div><div id="00:04:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, terrible.</div><div id="00:04:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it really?</div><div id="00:04:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, shocking, yes.</div><div id="00:04:58.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean we had tremendous snow.</div><div id="00:05:00.120" class="transcript_line"> The milk didn&#039;t go from there with the lorry for over a week.</div><div id="00:05:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:05:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Because we were snowed up.</div><div id="00:05:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a camp of Italians at Bulk.</div><div id="00:05:12.120" class="transcript_line"> And there was another, the Germans in, Italian, German soldiers in Brecon.</div><div id="00:05:20.120" class="transcript_line"> And they cut through really.</div><div id="00:05:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:05:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was, it was horrendous.</div><div id="00:05:26.120" class="transcript_line"> So, and then I used to go to school in Brecon then from Land Gorse.</div><div id="00:05:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Walk up to the hill.</div><div id="00:05:32.120" class="transcript_line"> I used to hate school.</div><div id="00:05:34.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d rather be home.</div><div id="00:05:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Doing the work there.</div><div id="00:05:37.120" class="transcript_line"> And I used to, I was a cyclist sometimes, but I&#039;d walk at the times and I used to really</div><div id="00:05:42.120" class="transcript_line"> dode-lune out.</div><div id="00:05:43.120" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;d hear the train coming around from Talga to Brecon and stop at the Land</div><div id="00:05:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Gorse Halt.</div><div id="00:05:48.120" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d try to, but no, I never got there.</div><div id="00:05:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Then I came home.</div><div id="00:05:51.120" class="transcript_line"> And then my father said, look, you cannot do this, you see.</div><div id="00:05:54.120" class="transcript_line"> You must, you have got to go to school.</div><div id="00:05:56.120" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, I don&#039;t like school.</div><div id="00:05:58.120" class="transcript_line"> So I left when I was 15.</div><div id="00:06:00.120" class="transcript_line"> So that was my story of schooling in Brecon.</div><div id="00:06:04.120" class="transcript_line"> How old were you when your family moved down here?</div><div id="00:06:08.120" class="transcript_line"> When I say here, over there?</div><div id="00:06:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, to Berry Hill.</div><div id="00:06:12.120" class="transcript_line"> So where is Berry Hill?</div><div id="00:06:14.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on the main road.</div><div id="00:06:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Go through Castleton.</div><div id="00:06:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:17.120" class="transcript_line"> To Newport.</div><div id="00:06:18.120" class="transcript_line"> And before you get down to where there&#039;s a big walk over a bridge.</div><div id="00:06:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s on the right-hand side.</div><div id="00:06:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:06:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Before you get there.</div><div id="00:06:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:28.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not there now.</div><div id="00:06:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Is it gone?</div><div id="00:06:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Is it all gone?</div><div id="00:06:31.120" class="transcript_line"> No, the farm is still there.</div><div id="00:06:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Pick your own.</div><div id="00:06:33.120" class="transcript_line"> But they haven&#039;t done that for some time now.</div><div id="00:06:37.120" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a bungalow that&#039;s built next to it, which the person that took over after</div><div id="00:06:43.120" class="transcript_line"> my mother and father finished, he was there for some time.</div><div id="00:06:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, actually, who was there was Robert Peel.</div><div id="00:06:49.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, Robert Peel, this is his grandson, but his name is Robert.</div><div id="00:06:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:06:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:06:56.120" class="transcript_line"> So why did your parents move from Langorce?</div><div id="00:06:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Why did they come here?</div><div id="00:07:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, because, well, it was a bit bigger farm, and we liked this area more because my parents,</div><div id="00:07:07.120" class="transcript_line"> well, my father, particularly, moved from this area.</div><div id="00:07:09.120" class="transcript_line"> And as I say, his cousin used to farm the farm down below, so there&#039;s quite a lot of,</div><div id="00:07:15.120" class="transcript_line"> you know, over there with them.</div><div id="00:07:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And then, so did your parents move to Slough&#039;s Farm, or was that you?</div><div id="00:07:22.120" class="transcript_line"> No, I moved to Slough&#039;s Farm.</div><div id="00:07:24.120" class="transcript_line"> I married from Berryhill, and married Dylwyn from Slough&#039;s Farm.</div><div id="00:07:28.120" class="transcript_line"> So how did you meet Dylwyn?</div><div id="00:07:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Young Farmers.</div><div id="00:07:30.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite a, it&#039;s quite a matamorial place, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Young Farmers, that we used to belong to.</div><div id="00:07:38.120" class="transcript_line"> So was it very active then, Young Farmers?</div><div id="00:07:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were, yes.</div><div id="00:07:42.120" class="transcript_line"> St. Maren&#039;s Young Farmers, it went under.</div><div id="00:07:45.120" class="transcript_line"> But I did belong to the Llynsefad and Young Farmers in Bracken, or Langorce, when I was there.</div><div id="00:07:50.120" class="transcript_line"> And, yes, we were quite active, you know.</div><div id="00:07:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to have some fun, different, go to different shows and so forth, you know.</div><div id="00:07:58.120" class="transcript_line"> But, oh yes, it&#039;s quite a matamorial place, the Young Farmers, I think.</div><div id="00:08:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:08:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:05.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard that so many times, people who&#039;ve met through, it must be an informal marriage bureau.</div><div id="00:08:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Crikey.</div><div id="00:08:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:08:14.120" class="transcript_line"> So you met Dylwyn, and then he was already living at...</div><div id="00:08:18.120" class="transcript_line"> He was born down Slough&#039;s.</div><div id="00:08:19.120" class="transcript_line"> He was born there.</div><div id="00:08:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:08:21.120" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s got two sisters.</div><div id="00:08:23.120" class="transcript_line"> One is Betty, which is two years younger, older.</div><div id="00:08:26.120" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s living in Gloucester.</div><div id="00:08:29.120" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s 19 now.</div><div id="00:08:30.120" class="transcript_line"> And then the other sister lived at...</div><div id="00:08:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you see who met Derek?</div><div id="00:08:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, Derek&#039;s mother was his sister to Dylwyn.</div><div id="00:08:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay.</div><div id="00:08:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Doreen.</div><div id="00:08:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:41.120" class="transcript_line"> She died...</div><div id="00:08:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she wasn&#039;t very old.</div><div id="00:08:43.120" class="transcript_line"> She was quite good cancer bad.</div><div id="00:08:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:08:45.120" class="transcript_line"> And very sad it was.</div><div id="00:08:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why Derek...</div><div id="00:08:48.120" class="transcript_line"> So how have we met?</div><div id="00:08:49.120" class="transcript_line"> How did you come to meet Derek, excuse me, ask it?</div><div id="00:08:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, Derek and Andrew were both through John Souther, who worked for the drainage board.</div><div id="00:08:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:08:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he&#039;s a chap that goes round cleaning them and talking to all the landowners and</div><div id="00:09:04.120" class="transcript_line"> stuff.</div><div id="00:09:05.120" class="transcript_line"> So John introduced me to...</div><div id="00:09:06.120" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;ve got to speak to Derek and Andrew Prosser.</div><div id="00:09:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:09:10.120" class="transcript_line"> So that...</div><div id="00:09:11.120" class="transcript_line"> And then that&#039;s why I&#039;m here now.</div><div id="00:09:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Very grateful to him.</div><div id="00:09:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, my father Prosser, he was on the drainage board, and he was supposed to lend us different</div><div id="00:09:19.120" class="transcript_line"> meetings and that, you know.</div><div id="00:09:20.120" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s, um, Dew Wynne&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:09:23.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s her.</div><div id="00:09:24.120" class="transcript_line"> So what was his full name?</div><div id="00:09:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford.</div><div id="00:09:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford Prosser.</div><div id="00:09:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford Prosser.</div><div id="00:09:28.120" class="transcript_line"> So what...</div><div id="00:09:29.120" class="transcript_line"> And his wife was living at Lansoy.</div><div id="00:09:30.120" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know what they met.</div><div id="00:09:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Um, let me see, I think, I think Dew Wynne&#039;s father had a housekeeper.</div><div id="00:09:40.120" class="transcript_line"> And then, um, my mother-in-law Marjorie, she was Marjorie, she came down to meet her.</div><div id="00:09:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And then they seemed to get friendly and then they married, you see.</div><div id="00:09:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Lansoy.</div><div id="00:09:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Lansoy at the side desk.</div><div id="00:09:56.120" class="transcript_line"> So what was, um, sorry, what was his name?</div><div id="00:09:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford.</div><div id="00:10:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford.</div><div id="00:10:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Wynneford.</div><div id="00:10:02.120" class="transcript_line"> So he was on the drainage board, you see.</div><div id="00:10:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:04.120" class="transcript_line"> And Dew Wynne was on the drainage board.</div><div id="00:10:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m getting confused.</div><div id="00:10:07.120" class="transcript_line"> So Wynneford is Dew Wynne&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:10:09.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:10:10.120" class="transcript_line"> So Wynneford was on the drainage board.</div><div id="00:10:12.120" class="transcript_line"> So what can you tell me about Dew Wynne&#039;s parents on the farm?</div><div id="00:10:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, Dew Wynne&#039;s dad, Wynneford, has got a brother, I&#039;ll show you photographs of</div><div id="00:10:25.120" class="transcript_line"> them afterwards.</div><div id="00:10:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Campbell Prosser, he was a barrister-in-law.</div><div id="00:10:29.120" class="transcript_line"> And he was out abroad for a long time, Singapore.</div><div id="00:10:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:10:33.120" class="transcript_line"> And then he had a sister, which I&#039;ve got the photograph, the whole family&#039;s up there,</div><div id="00:10:37.120" class="transcript_line"> you can see later on.</div><div id="00:10:39.120" class="transcript_line"> And then he had a sister that lived in Cardiff Road.</div><div id="00:10:46.120" class="transcript_line"> And then, you see Campbell.</div><div id="00:10:51.120" class="transcript_line"> And then there was Dew Wynne who was killed in the war, first World War.</div><div id="00:10:55.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was Wynneford.</div><div id="00:10:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ll have to, I can show you the photograph.</div><div id="00:11:02.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on the wall, so it&#039;s easy for you to have a look at it on the wall, really.</div><div id="00:11:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So that was, that was Dew Wynne&#039;s father&#039;s side, you see.</div><div id="00:11:10.120" class="transcript_line"> And they had butcher shops in Cardiff, Clifton Street.</div><div id="00:11:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:15.120" class="transcript_line"> There was a big butchery in there.</div><div id="00:11:16.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was their business, more or less, you know.</div><div id="00:11:19.120" class="transcript_line"> So, butchery shop.</div><div id="00:11:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Butcher shop.</div><div id="00:11:23.120" class="transcript_line"> So when did the farm come into the...</div><div id="00:11:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, Wynneford, he wasn&#039;t keen on the butchery shop, so he went farming then.</div><div id="00:11:31.120" class="transcript_line"> So he took over, took sluice and rented sluice.</div><div id="00:11:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:11:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, the milk.</div><div id="00:11:37.120" class="transcript_line"> And then they used to have a milk round with a milk van and everything.</div><div id="00:11:41.120" class="transcript_line"> And Dew Wynne used to go occasionally when his father had a meeting up in London, but</div><div id="00:11:45.120" class="transcript_line"> he wasn&#039;t so keen on the milk round.</div><div id="00:11:50.120" class="transcript_line"> But he used to do it when his father had to go to London for meetings with the drainage</div><div id="00:11:54.120" class="transcript_line"> port and that, you know.</div><div id="00:11:55.120" class="transcript_line"> So why did they have meetings in London?</div><div id="00:11:58.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, really.</div><div id="00:12:01.120" class="transcript_line"> And of course they used to have the meetings out at Magad, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:12:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:06.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the place.</div><div id="00:12:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Is it Magad?</div><div id="00:12:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Magad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:09.120" class="transcript_line"> They used to have the...</div><div id="00:12:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Nash.</div><div id="00:12:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Nash, rather.</div><div id="00:12:12.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:12:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Pie Corner.</div><div id="00:12:14.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, Pie Corner.</div><div id="00:12:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Nash.</div><div id="00:12:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:18.120" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:12:19.120" class="transcript_line"> So was it always a dairy farm then, the sluice farm?</div><div id="00:12:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:12:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they had cows and everything.</div><div id="00:12:26.120" class="transcript_line"> And sheep.</div><div id="00:12:27.120" class="transcript_line"> And then we moved up here later.</div><div id="00:12:31.120" class="transcript_line"> And then they moved there, but then they went out to the cows.</div><div id="00:12:34.120" class="transcript_line"> And so the Andros only got the sheep at the moment.</div><div id="00:12:37.120" class="transcript_line"> So then you met Dilwyn.</div><div id="00:12:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Three young farmers.</div><div id="00:12:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Three young farmers.</div><div id="00:12:42.120" class="transcript_line"> And so where did you marry, actually?</div><div id="00:12:46.120" class="transcript_line"> In Coorkean O&#039;Church.</div><div id="00:12:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did you?</div><div id="00:12:48.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a dear little church, yes.</div><div id="00:12:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:50.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a house now that&#039;s been turned into...</div><div id="00:12:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Coorkean...</div><div id="00:12:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know...</div><div id="00:12:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know the main one I said about with this article is you&#039;re turned down for Coorkean</div><div id="00:13:00.120" class="transcript_line"> O&#039;Church for the golf course.</div><div id="00:13:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:02.120" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just before you get to the golf course.</div><div id="00:13:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Or just after the golf course, sorry.</div><div id="00:13:05.120" class="transcript_line"> On the right.</div><div id="00:13:06.120" class="transcript_line"> On the left-hand side you&#039;ve got a little lane up to the church.</div><div id="00:13:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:13:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been to the church.</div><div id="00:13:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t think...</div><div id="00:13:13.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a house now.</div><div id="00:13:14.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s...</div><div id="00:13:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it a chapel then?</div><div id="00:13:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Or was it a chapel?</div><div id="00:13:17.120" class="transcript_line"> No, a church.</div><div id="00:13:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:13:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Coorkean O&#039;Church.</div><div id="00:13:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I have to go back that way afterwards.</div><div id="00:13:21.120" class="transcript_line"> I might go and have a look.</div><div id="00:13:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:13:23.120" class="transcript_line"> I had no idea.</div><div id="00:13:24.120" class="transcript_line"> And I think there&#039;s three or four houses there.</div><div id="00:13:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Because there was a farm next to it but they&#039;ve gone into homesteads, you see.</div><div id="00:13:32.120" class="transcript_line"> So then, so did you then start your married life at Soos Farm?</div><div id="00:13:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:37.120" class="transcript_line"> You moved in with your in-laws?</div><div id="00:13:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:40.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, they moved, they built a house.</div><div id="00:13:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you see the house on the side there?</div><div id="00:13:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:44.120" class="transcript_line"> They built that.</div><div id="00:13:45.120" class="transcript_line"> And then we went into the farmhouse and they built that and went into there.</div><div id="00:13:50.120" class="transcript_line"> So this would have been, what, the mid-50s?</div><div id="00:13:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, 57.</div><div id="00:13:53.120" class="transcript_line"> 57?</div><div id="00:13:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:55.120" class="transcript_line"> So, erm, so what was the farm doing then?</div><div id="00:13:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it...</div><div id="00:13:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Er, milk.</div><div id="00:14:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Milk.</div><div id="00:14:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Milk and milk round.</div><div id="00:14:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they&#039;d fill the bottles, you know, and wash the bottles in and in the little</div><div id="00:14:06.120" class="transcript_line"> shed that was there.</div><div id="00:14:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:08.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s erm...</div><div id="00:14:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think I&#039;ve got a photograph here.</div><div id="00:14:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Excuse me.</div><div id="00:14:13.120" class="transcript_line"> How many cows did you have, Margaret?</div><div id="00:14:16.120" class="transcript_line"> How many cows did you have?</div><div id="00:14:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Er, well not like they&#039;ve got today, they&#039;ve got hundreds today, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:14:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:23.120" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve really been 125.</div><div id="00:14:24.120" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s still...</div><div id="00:14:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Which is quite, you know, big for those days, I suppose, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Nice to get a photograph here, I think, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:14:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:33.120" class="transcript_line"> And that wasn&#039;t all hand-milked, was it?</div><div id="00:14:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Was that all milked by hand?</div><div id="00:14:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was years ago and then they went in with the machines then, you know.</div><div id="00:14:45.120" class="transcript_line"> This is a photograph of Slough&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:14:48.120" class="transcript_line"> This was before 1963.</div><div id="00:14:51.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where it was when I used to live there, you see.</div><div id="00:14:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, crikey.</div><div id="00:14:55.120" class="transcript_line"> There was a milk van right there.</div><div id="00:14:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:57.120" class="transcript_line"> A dairy there where they used to wash the bottles.</div><div id="00:15:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Cows used to go into there.</div><div id="00:15:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And then this was the garden.</div><div id="00:15:04.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Anne&#039;s got a beautiful garden down there now.</div><div id="00:15:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:15:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And then there was just a shed where we kept chickens.</div><div id="00:15:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Erm, so it all altered, of course, because all this is buildings, you know.</div><div id="00:15:14.120" class="transcript_line"> This has all changed, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:15:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all definitely.</div><div id="00:15:16.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s all built up.</div><div id="00:15:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Very rural then.</div><div id="00:15:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:15:20.120" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:15:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Crikey.</div><div id="00:15:22.120" class="transcript_line"> And then in this wheelchair, which was his own, that&#039;s where they built the house.</div><div id="00:15:26.120" class="transcript_line"> You can see Wyvern.</div><div id="00:15:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:15:28.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, they built that there.</div><div id="00:15:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Did they build that because Dilwyn was getting married?</div><div id="00:15:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:15:34.120" class="transcript_line"> They built that to go in there.</div><div id="00:15:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And erm, oh, but I was only thinking the other day.</div><div id="00:15:40.120" class="transcript_line"> I think it was about 90.</div><div id="00:15:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ve forgotten the money.</div><div id="00:15:44.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure I was thinking about how much it cost the other day.</div><div id="00:15:48.120" class="transcript_line"> The bridge cost me more to get across the reed to get to the house than the house, I think.</div><div id="00:15:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:15:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:15:55.120" class="transcript_line"> You forget about that, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:15:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you do.</div><div id="00:15:57.120" class="transcript_line"> You have to get across the reed.</div><div id="00:15:58.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:15:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:16:00.120" class="transcript_line"> So what were your first impressions when you moved down there and started married life?</div><div id="00:16:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Erm, well, I used to go back and forth there before we were actually married, you know,</div><div id="00:16:08.120" class="transcript_line"> and have supper and things with Mother-in-law and that.</div><div id="00:16:12.120" class="transcript_line"> And erm, yes, well I liked it very much because we had ground with Berry Hill.</div><div id="00:16:18.120" class="transcript_line"> We had two fields on the moors, as we call them.</div><div id="00:16:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yes.</div><div id="00:16:22.120" class="transcript_line"> We rented those and erm, so it wasn&#039;t any different for me really, you know.</div><div id="00:16:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:29.120" class="transcript_line"> And then of course we used to go to Young Farmers there.</div><div id="00:16:31.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to Young Farmers Club in St Melons.</div><div id="00:16:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:16:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:16:35.120" class="transcript_line"> In the chapel there, I used to hold the Young Farmers meetings.</div><div id="00:16:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:38.120" class="transcript_line"> But erm, oh yes.</div><div id="00:16:39.120" class="transcript_line"> So I enjoyed life.</div><div id="00:16:40.120" class="transcript_line"> So you were a farmer&#039;s wife.</div><div id="00:16:41.120" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve spoken to lots of farmers and erm, so as a farmer&#039;s wife, would you, would you</div><div id="00:16:49.120" class="transcript_line"> have been aware of and concerned with all the reams and the maintenance and stuff?</div><div id="00:16:54.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I guess what I&#039;m trying to ask is, was there very much a clear, this was what</div><div id="00:16:59.120" class="transcript_line"> the woman did and this is what the men did, or was it all mixed up?</div><div id="00:17:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Well I think, I used to enjoy going out and feeding calves and things and that, you know.</div><div id="00:17:10.120" class="transcript_line"> And then when I was born, we used to put him in the plan, put him in the corner of the</div><div id="00:17:14.120" class="transcript_line"> milking shed and he&#039;d be sat there, you know, watching the cows coming in and out and all</div><div id="00:17:19.120" class="transcript_line"> that.</div><div id="00:17:20.120" class="transcript_line"> And before we had a parlour that was, the milking parlour type of thing, you know, where</div><div id="00:17:24.120" class="transcript_line"> you could get up and in and mushing.</div><div id="00:17:26.120" class="transcript_line"> But erm, yeah, I&#039;ve always been, I&#039;ve always been interested outside.</div><div id="00:17:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to spend quite a bit of time before we went to Langhorst with my grandparents</div><div id="00:17:35.120" class="transcript_line"> at Newhouse Farm, Pantague.</div><div id="00:17:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:39.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, just go out there and stay when I was a little tot, you know.</div><div id="00:17:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Put me on the bus and you put my aunt with me, me and you in.</div><div id="00:17:46.120" class="transcript_line"> How lovely.</div><div id="00:17:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:48.120" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever get involved in the bottling of milk down there?</div><div id="00:17:51.120" class="transcript_line"> I used to have sometimes, and that helped, erm, my father probably used to, you know,</div><div id="00:17:56.120" class="transcript_line"> mostly he&#039;d do that.</div><div id="00:17:57.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have to come back off the road.</div><div id="00:17:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And then wash the bottles and get them ready then to fill up the next morning.</div><div id="00:18:04.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s, erm, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:18:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I&#039;ve had a very enjoyable life really.</div><div id="00:18:11.120" class="transcript_line"> You can tell that, it shows in your face.</div><div id="00:18:13.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:18:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it does.</div><div id="00:18:15.120" class="transcript_line"> What about the poultry?</div><div id="00:18:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Was that an important part of the family?</div><div id="00:18:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to sell eggs on the milk farm quite a lot, you know.</div><div id="00:18:23.120" class="transcript_line"> And then if there was any surplus eggs then, I used to bring them to the husband brothers</div><div id="00:18:28.120" class="transcript_line"> who used to have, erm, well, I don&#039;t know, what do you call it, an egg centre that they</div><div id="00:18:36.120" class="transcript_line"> would have eggs and then they&#039;d take them out on different rounds.</div><div id="00:18:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Where were the husband brothers based?</div><div id="00:18:41.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, erm, Lisbon.</div><div id="00:18:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:18:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:18:45.120" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s all different now altogether.</div><div id="00:18:47.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, places change, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:18:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Well it&#039;s interesting, look at the new photograph, because you must have seen enormous change</div><div id="00:18:55.120" class="transcript_line"> in your lifetime down there.</div><div id="00:18:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yeah, especially now, more buildings up for stock and everything, you know.</div><div id="00:19:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And, erm, I mean I used to try and keep it well clean, tidy and all this business.</div><div id="00:19:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And we used to have a boy living in then, you see.</div><div id="00:19:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:19:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, you know the, erm, excuse me, you know the kitchen.</div><div id="00:19:15.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going for the back door, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:19:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s the dining room, the kitchen for every day.</div><div id="00:19:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s the kitchen, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:19:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s the other room.</div><div id="00:19:24.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to have a boy living in there.</div><div id="00:19:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:19:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, and he had his bed in there and there was a stove in the corner.</div><div id="00:19:30.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to have for the fire and he had an armchair.</div><div id="00:19:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:34.120" class="transcript_line"> He always ate with us.</div><div id="00:19:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And, erm, yes, so we always had a boy living in.</div><div id="00:19:39.120" class="transcript_line"> And who was he?</div><div id="00:19:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it a series of people or?</div><div id="00:19:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Erm, well yes, different, we had a few from St. Brides that didn&#039;t live in, they came</div><div id="00:19:48.120" class="transcript_line"> back and forth, which is, you know, from Cocoonia.</div><div id="00:19:52.120" class="transcript_line"> But a couple of, they actually lived in there, you know, with us and they&#039;d eat with us and</div><div id="00:19:57.120" class="transcript_line"> all this business, you know.</div><div id="00:19:58.120" class="transcript_line"> But, erm, I mean he had a television, well not a television, a wireless one, but he did</div><div id="00:20:03.120" class="transcript_line"> have a television towards the end.</div><div id="00:20:05.120" class="transcript_line"> And, erm, yes, we always had a boy living in.</div><div id="00:20:08.120" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the farm could support that, whereas it would be difficult to do that today, wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:20:13.120" class="transcript_line"> it?</div><div id="00:20:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Well I suppose, yes, it&#039;s different, it&#039;s the different ideas today, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:20:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Different world today, really.</div><div id="00:20:21.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a strange lot to really be farming, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:20:24.120" class="transcript_line"> But did you have sheep then?</div><div id="00:20:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had some sheep, yeah, pet lambs and something, you know, feed those and, yes,</div><div id="00:20:32.120" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember how many sheep, we didn&#039;t have so many sheep as well, no, naturally,</div><div id="00:20:36.120" class="transcript_line"> because we had the dairying as well, you see.</div><div id="00:20:39.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, erm, yes, oh yes, I&#039;ve enjoyed my life up until now.</div><div id="00:20:47.120" class="transcript_line"> So Antem used to go up onto the seawall and bring the sheep in on ponies.</div><div id="00:20:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever get involved with that?</div><div id="00:20:54.120" class="transcript_line"> No, not really, no, no.</div><div id="00:20:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;d put sheep over on the seawall and then, erm, Doreen, Derek&#039;s father, Philip,</div><div id="00:21:04.120" class="transcript_line"> would come over and he&#039;d have this horse and a little trap thing, you know, and they&#039;d</div><div id="00:21:09.120" class="transcript_line"> sit in there and then they&#039;d go up then to get onto the horse and to bring the sheep</div><div id="00:21:13.120" class="transcript_line"> up and all this business, you know.</div><div id="00:21:15.120" class="transcript_line"> And then one day, erm, I don&#039;t know what happened, but anyhow, the pony started kicking</div><div id="00:21:20.120" class="transcript_line"> the bottom of the possum and of course got out of the, out of the showers and left these</div><div id="00:21:25.120" class="transcript_line"> four or five of them and the possum went backwards while it was suffering.</div><div id="00:21:30.120" class="transcript_line"> What, backwards down the slope?</div><div id="00:21:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, it went back, it went back, back, you know.</div><div id="00:21:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see, because the horse had gone.</div><div id="00:21:36.120" class="transcript_line"> There were the showers hanging over them.</div><div id="00:21:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Were they OK?</div><div id="00:21:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were all right and the dog jumped out a bit quick and the dog was in as well.</div><div id="00:21:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, OK, yeah, they used to come over every Sunday and go down and see the sheep and all</div><div id="00:21:49.120" class="transcript_line"> sorts of those, I don&#039;t know, pretty much.</div><div id="00:21:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Because the sheep used to graze on the other side of it.</div><div id="00:21:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, hmm, hmm.</div><div id="00:21:56.120" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:21:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Until, like, erm, the tide used to come in so far, you know.</div><div id="00:22:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:02.120" class="transcript_line"> But they hired the, erm, I think they hired the bank then.</div><div id="00:22:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Erm, yes, they did hire it because of course the sea, the water was coming, the sea was</div><div id="00:22:12.120" class="transcript_line"> getting in higher, wasn&#039;t it, you know.</div><div id="00:22:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;re very close to the seawall there, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:22:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, it&#039;s only the field really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:22:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:20.120" class="transcript_line"> The field across.</div><div id="00:22:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever experience the water coming over?</div><div id="00:22:22.120" class="transcript_line"> You see it sometimes if it was very rough, just splashing up a bit, you know.</div><div id="00:22:27.120" class="transcript_line"> But, erm, you know, I never had the thought in mind of thinking, oh gosh, I hope it doesn&#039;t</div><div id="00:22:33.120" class="transcript_line"> come over there.</div><div id="00:22:34.120" class="transcript_line"> I never thought of that.</div><div id="00:22:35.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Which I suppose it does.</div><div id="00:22:37.120" class="transcript_line"> It has, well, it has in some places over the years, hasn&#039;t it, you see.</div><div id="00:22:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever use the shore where the sheet grates?</div><div id="00:22:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Is there like a picnic spot when you had children when they were little?</div><div id="00:22:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to go over there and, erm, like, a lot of the, have you been over there?</div><div id="00:22:52.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been over there, of course.</div><div id="00:22:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:22:55.120" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t been over there for years really, so I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like.</div><div id="00:22:58.120" class="transcript_line"> But we used to have little, little, what&#039;s the name of the water coming in?</div><div id="00:23:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Where there&#039;s been bits and digits.</div><div id="00:23:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, like rivulets.</div><div id="00:23:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:23:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:23:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yes, we used to go over there with our neighbours.</div><div id="00:23:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Edinsons Neckardt Farm, Slough&#039;s Farm that would be.</div><div id="00:23:13.120" class="transcript_line"> The one just on the side of the road.</div><div id="00:23:15.120" class="transcript_line"> And, yes, we&#039;d go over there for picnics and, er, yeah, we used to have a, you know, now</div><div id="00:23:20.120" class="transcript_line"> and again have a good time.</div><div id="00:23:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it, was it, erm, er, was there a real sense of community there then?</div><div id="00:23:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Er, down the village, yeah, erm, even the village itself.</div><div id="00:23:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, because those, those opposite the hall, those are all built, you see, erm, because</div><div id="00:23:41.120" class="transcript_line"> when I went down there first there was no houses there then, you know, so they&#039;d been</div><div id="00:23:45.120" class="transcript_line"> built and at the back of the hall is a little cul-de-sac.</div><div id="00:23:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:49.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the council houses further over.</div><div id="00:23:52.120" class="transcript_line"> They were, they were there when I went down.</div><div id="00:23:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:23:55.120" class="transcript_line"> And different houses had been built around there, you know.</div><div id="00:23:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh it&#039;s nice to live, I&#039;ve been, I&#039;m quite upset really because WI had been a</div><div id="00:24:03.120" class="transcript_line"> member for 62 years down there.</div><div id="00:24:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Have you?</div><div id="00:24:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:24:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And, er, I used to take my mother-in-law because she didn&#039;t drive, Deryn&#039;s mother</div><div id="00:24:10.120" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t drive.</div><div id="00:24:11.120" class="transcript_line"> So, and then after lunch we&#039;d go down on the, er, the second Tuesday of the month, I used</div><div id="00:24:17.120" class="transcript_line"> to pick her up and we&#039;d go down, because she was president at that time, and there was</div><div id="00:24:21.120" class="transcript_line"> the back, the old black stove, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve seen the old black stove, it was</div><div id="00:24:26.120" class="transcript_line"> like that.</div><div id="00:24:27.120" class="transcript_line"> In the village hall?</div><div id="00:24:28.120" class="transcript_line"> In the village hall.</div><div id="00:24:29.120" class="transcript_line"> And then put the chairs and tables up, and then go back then and I&#039;d pick her up then</div><div id="00:24:34.120" class="transcript_line"> at the tea then to go to WI.</div><div id="00:24:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And, er, yes we did that for years.</div><div id="00:24:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Erm, and then I used to have the milk van then, I had the milk van for a couple of,</div><div id="00:24:43.120" class="transcript_line"> oh for about a week or more in the afternoons, to go to, er, a place in Bremne to get a</div><div id="00:24:49.120" class="transcript_line"> sanding machine.</div><div id="00:24:50.120" class="transcript_line"> And, er, put in the back there and come, and then redo the floor, you know, sand, get the</div><div id="00:24:55.120" class="transcript_line"> floor all nice and, well, slim you know.</div><div id="00:24:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:24:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we&#039;ve had some good times down there.</div><div id="00:24:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Really good times.</div><div id="00:25:00.120" class="transcript_line"> So somebody was telling me that St. Price WI used to have a canning machine.</div><div id="00:25:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know about that?</div><div id="00:25:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, and Mother Prosser had it.</div><div id="00:25:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Now where it is I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:25:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because we used to put fruit into our own canning.</div><div id="00:25:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Hmm, hmm.</div><div id="00:25:16.120" class="transcript_line"> I wonder where it is, er, now I, I&#039;ve forgotten about that.</div><div id="00:25:21.120" class="transcript_line"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div id="00:25:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, now I wonder where that is.</div><div id="00:25:29.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got me thinking now.</div><div id="00:25:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha.</div><div id="00:25:32.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be trying to explore where it is.</div><div id="00:25:34.120" class="transcript_line"> So would they, would the WI rent it out, or would they take it out to people and say,</div><div id="00:25:39.120" class="transcript_line"> do the canning for people?</div><div id="00:25:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Er, I couldn&#039;t, I wouldn&#039;t, I can&#039;t say that.</div><div id="00:25:44.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, erm, I know we used to borrow it and do our own.</div><div id="00:25:48.120" class="transcript_line"> At least Mother Prosser did more than I did, but I&#039;d give a hand, you know.</div><div id="00:25:52.120" class="transcript_line"> But erm, that&#039;s interesting how you brought up that canning machine.</div><div id="00:25:56.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not going to bother you now.</div><div id="00:25:57.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be worried about that.</div><div id="00:25:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha.</div><div id="00:25:59.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d be lovely if it&#039;s still around somewhere.</div><div id="00:26:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it would, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:04.120" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s still going, the St. Brides WI?</div><div id="00:26:07.120" class="transcript_line"> St. Brides, no, no, it&#039;s folded up a long time ago.</div><div id="00:26:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:26:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:26:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s a shame.</div><div id="00:26:13.120" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of the people from there now come to Peterstone, and this is why I&#039;m rather</div><div id="00:26:17.120" class="transcript_line"> upset that Peterstone is talking about folding up.</div><div id="00:26:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:26:21.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the secretary, she&#039;s moving away down to Swansea, well that&#039;s why I&#039;m there.</div><div id="00:26:26.120" class="transcript_line"> The president, she did say that she&#039;d do it for another two years.</div><div id="00:26:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, the two years has come up now, and no one else wants to take the responsibility.</div><div id="00:26:35.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s such a shame.</div><div id="00:26:36.120" class="transcript_line"> It is a shame.</div><div id="00:26:37.120" class="transcript_line"> It is a shame.</div><div id="00:26:38.120" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been going how long?</div><div id="00:26:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve been down there 62 years.</div><div id="00:26:42.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s phenomenal, Margaret.</div><div id="00:26:44.120" class="transcript_line"> And it was on a long time before that.</div><div id="00:26:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:26:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s sad really.</div><div id="00:26:48.120" class="transcript_line"> How many members have you got down there?</div><div id="00:26:50.120" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s, from St. Brides area, around Asda, where people live, I expect there&#039;s 14 people</div><div id="00:27:00.120" class="transcript_line"> come from that area.</div><div id="00:27:02.120" class="transcript_line"> And it seems such a shame that, you know, no one will take it on.</div><div id="00:27:07.120" class="transcript_line"> After all that time?</div><div id="00:27:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:27:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Because I was president for about seven years after Mother Pross has given it up, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:27:15.120" class="transcript_line"> know how long she was.</div><div id="00:27:16.120" class="transcript_line"> But no, it&#039;s quite sad.</div><div id="00:27:18.120" class="transcript_line"> I was quite upset about it really.</div><div id="00:27:21.120" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m hoping that I might join Kevin Madley, Michael Stoneman, which is nearer.</div><div id="00:27:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:29.120" class="transcript_line"> But the distance didn&#039;t make any difference to me.</div><div id="00:27:32.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a longevity though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Winds and weathers.</div><div id="00:27:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Pick up a couple of ladies from Ashfield on the way down.</div><div id="00:27:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how sweet.</div><div id="00:27:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you just enjoy it.</div><div id="00:27:40.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how it goes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:42.120" class="transcript_line"> So you said Mother Pross used to can fruit.</div><div id="00:27:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Where did her fruit come from?</div><div id="00:27:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, she had, we had plum trees.</div><div id="00:27:53.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, we had trees, we had plum trees and we had a couple of trees around here.</div><div id="00:27:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Plum trees and things.</div><div id="00:28:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And well, that was our garden then.</div><div id="00:28:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:03.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, and then we&#039;d have beans and stuff like that, you know, to roast it.</div><div id="00:28:09.120" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I&#039;ve forgotten about that canning machine.</div><div id="00:28:14.120" class="transcript_line"> So what was the process then?</div><div id="00:28:16.120" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d pick the fruit and then wash it?</div><div id="00:28:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:19.120" class="transcript_line"> And then make a syrup.</div><div id="00:28:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:21.120" class="transcript_line"> And then put it in the tins.</div><div id="00:28:23.120" class="transcript_line"> And then with the machine you&#039;d seal it all.</div><div id="00:28:26.120" class="transcript_line"> And that would be a tinned fruit.</div><div id="00:28:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, and that would last all the winter?</div><div id="00:28:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, if you know, you make as much as you can, you know, or we could.</div><div id="00:28:35.120" class="transcript_line"> And yes, gosh, I&#039;m glad you thought about the canning machine.</div><div id="00:28:39.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got me worried now.</div><div id="00:28:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s come up a few times, you see.</div><div id="00:28:43.120" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, I&#039;m curious.</div><div id="00:28:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:45.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never heard of a canning machine before.</div><div id="00:28:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And that St. Bride&#039;s WI has a canning machine.</div><div id="00:28:50.120" class="transcript_line"> It just sounds really resourceful to me.</div><div id="00:28:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:28:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:28:56.120" class="transcript_line"> I wonder where that is now.</div><div id="00:28:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Did the WI, because in the past the WI has been absolutely fantastic at recording local people and their memories,</div><div id="00:29:07.120" class="transcript_line"> did the St. Bride&#039;s WI ever do anything like that?</div><div id="00:29:11.120" class="transcript_line"> No, they folded up, as I said, and a couple of them came from there then, which are a few more now,</div><div id="00:29:17.120" class="transcript_line"> because the president it is now, she lives in one of the houses by our stairs.</div><div id="00:29:22.120" class="transcript_line"> And of course a couple of her friends have come as well.</div><div id="00:29:26.120" class="transcript_line"> As I say, I was quite upset last week when I knew it was going to fold up.</div><div id="00:29:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that is upsetting.</div><div id="00:29:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is.</div><div id="00:29:33.120" class="transcript_line"> But there we are, people are not interested.</div><div id="00:29:35.120" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t force people to be.</div><div id="00:29:38.120" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:29:39.120" class="transcript_line"> You can try and encourage.</div><div id="00:29:43.120" class="transcript_line"> So as a young woman, a young wife, was it part of one&#039;s social life, the WI?</div><div id="00:29:49.120" class="transcript_line"> It was, really.</div><div id="00:29:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I went up to London for the two AGMs.</div><div id="00:29:56.120" class="transcript_line"> The WI was something that you did as a young wife, and you have continued to do for a long time.</div><div id="00:30:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:30:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I enjoyed WI.</div><div id="00:30:07.120" class="transcript_line"> I went to London to the AGM on two occasions, which is up at the Albert Hall,</div><div id="00:30:13.120" class="transcript_line"> and that was very interesting, where they come from all over the country.</div><div id="00:30:17.120" class="transcript_line"> It has gone back a bit.</div><div id="00:30:20.120" class="transcript_line"> But you know, what struck me about down on the moors there,</div><div id="00:30:25.120" class="transcript_line"> that it&#039;s quite a different landscape, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:30:27.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s flat, all the water courses.</div><div id="00:30:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:30:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Was that a challenge in some way?</div><div id="00:30:32.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether you were a friend, because there&#039;s people living in the church now,</div><div id="00:30:37.120" class="transcript_line"> the church was, and on about, what, what am I, five foot, am I five foot or nothing?</div><div id="00:30:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Except about, well, I should know the possible, where the Greek flood was.</div><div id="00:30:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:30:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and the bank, you can see the bank, now we&#039;re one of the fields of one of the farms up,</div><div id="00:30:56.120" class="transcript_line"> as you go down the road a bit.</div><div id="00:30:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, I think I&#039;m right in saying, the water more or less came up nearly up to Cattleden.</div><div id="00:31:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was, yeah, because it goes down, doesn&#039;t it, apparently?</div><div id="00:31:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, it&#039;s very low, very low.</div><div id="00:31:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever experience flooding there?</div><div id="00:31:13.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, the rains would fill up quite a bit, you know, but no, no,</div><div id="00:31:18.120" class="transcript_line"> we never had any flooding as such, no.</div><div id="00:31:20.120" class="transcript_line"> What was it like having young children around those things, though, was it ever a worry?</div><div id="00:31:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, now the neighbours on that farm down to, what&#039;s the farm then,</div><div id="00:31:31.120" class="transcript_line"> they lost a child that drowned in the water.</div><div id="00:31:36.120" class="transcript_line"> And also, instant brides, the child drowned in some brides in the rain.</div><div id="00:31:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:31:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, but I suppose you get,</div><div id="00:31:46.120" class="transcript_line"> I suppose if you&#039;re born down there, you get used to it.</div><div id="00:31:50.120" class="transcript_line"> I know the one that came down, the one further on down the road,</div><div id="00:31:54.120" class="transcript_line"> was from London, came down to see the sister,</div><div id="00:31:58.120" class="transcript_line"> came down and brought the little one, of course, went down the steps and down to the rain there,</div><div id="00:32:03.120" class="transcript_line"> you know, which is very sad, very sad.</div><div id="00:32:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, that&#039;s so sad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:32:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Terrible, terrible. Yes, but...</div><div id="00:32:10.120" class="transcript_line"> When you first went to Sleuth&#039;s Farm, was there electricity and stuff?</div><div id="00:32:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when I lived in Langorce, we had no electricity.</div><div id="00:32:20.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:32:21.120" class="transcript_line"> I got the Aladdin lamp there, the hanging Aladdin lamp,</div><div id="00:32:24.120" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve got a little table lamp that&#039;s in there, that&#039;s with oil,</div><div id="00:32:28.120" class="transcript_line"> and we didn&#039;t have any hot water, cold water or anything like that.</div><div id="00:32:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Can you talk about the winter of 47? What was the winter of 62, 63 like?</div><div id="00:32:38.120" class="transcript_line"> I was down here then, of course.</div><div id="00:32:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, here?</div><div id="00:32:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, it was bad then.</div><div id="00:32:43.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to go up to Castleton with the tractor</div><div id="00:32:47.120" class="transcript_line"> to have the lorry to come down, you know, to bring it down.</div><div id="00:32:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:32:52.120" class="transcript_line"> And then in the evenings, a couple of the locals there, the youngsters,</div><div id="00:32:57.120" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d take me down the six-pouse on a big boat, drag it down the road, you know.</div><div id="00:33:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, we had quite a lot of snow. Yes, yes, yes, but we had more when we were in Langorce.</div><div id="00:33:10.120" class="transcript_line"> I remember seeing on Penavan, down one of the crevices in June, there was still snow.</div><div id="00:33:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Really? My goodness. I can see that now.</div><div id="00:33:19.120" class="transcript_line"> It went on and on and on, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:33:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it did, it did.</div><div id="00:33:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Did anyone ever go skating on the Reens or anything like that?</div><div id="00:33:25.120" class="transcript_line"> On the lake. Oh, sorry, on Langorce Lake they used to go, but I mean,</div><div id="00:33:30.120" class="transcript_line"> well, it was frozen over and a motorbike went across, and it&#039;s never known before.</div><div id="00:33:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:33:36.120" class="transcript_line"> It went across the other side.</div><div id="00:33:37.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div id="00:33:39.120" class="transcript_line"> I think they did. Yes, I should say, but many did freeze, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:33:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:44.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s just, and yeah, we used to go, we used to go and,</div><div id="00:33:49.120" class="transcript_line"> a crowd of us were really into Langorce, we used to take one of these little boats.</div><div id="00:33:53.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to go down to the other side of Langorce, Langasty, and I don&#039;t know, even with Langorce.</div><div id="00:34:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And if you look across there, there&#039;s a little hole, about three feet from the end of the river,</div><div id="00:34:05.120" class="transcript_line"> and Langorce, and we used to go across there to dances,</div><div id="00:34:10.120" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d take one of these skiff boats, you know, and we used to row across there.</div><div id="00:34:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you really?</div><div id="00:34:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:17.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite some distance.</div><div id="00:34:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was really, back when you were younger, I noticed distance too.</div><div id="00:34:22.120" class="transcript_line"> I wonder now.</div><div id="00:34:23.120" class="transcript_line"> And we used to tether it there and walk up these two or three years, go to the dance,</div><div id="00:34:28.120" class="transcript_line"> come back, then and row back.</div><div id="00:34:30.120" class="transcript_line"> My goodness, imagine if my daughter was doing that, I&#039;d be, you know,</div><div id="00:34:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, or what we used to do.</div><div id="00:34:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Or what we used to do.</div><div id="00:34:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, what we used to do then, years ago, when we were young.</div><div id="00:34:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the, did you ever help with haymaking as a young farmer&#039;s wife?</div><div id="00:34:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, dry the tractor perhaps and that, you know, the baling.</div><div id="00:34:50.120" class="transcript_line"> And of course, we had a photograph, I don&#039;t know, I might have got a photograph here,</div><div id="00:34:56.120" class="transcript_line"> where, excuse me.</div><div id="00:34:59.120" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s this prize here then, Margaret?</div><div id="00:35:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, this is when I was first lady chairman of St. Mannon&#039;s show.</div><div id="00:35:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Now, that was a big show, someone said to me.</div><div id="00:35:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, oh it was lovely, oh yes, fair play, it was.</div><div id="00:35:14.120" class="transcript_line"> I look forward to St. Mannon&#039;s show.</div><div id="00:35:18.120" class="transcript_line"> So is it a very strong farming community?</div><div id="00:35:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Is it a very close-knit farming community?</div><div id="00:35:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think so, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:35:26.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, we do a lot of things together.</div><div id="00:35:28.120" class="transcript_line"> We had two donkeys and this donkey down Slose and then we put her in foal</div><div id="00:35:36.120" class="transcript_line"> and oh, you&#039;ve never seen such sweet things when this little one came.</div><div id="00:35:40.120" class="transcript_line"> I think the whole village came down to see it.</div><div id="00:35:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:35:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, just the deal thing.</div><div id="00:35:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Someone told me that farmers kept donkeys because they were good luck.</div><div id="00:35:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, they were, a lot of people had donkeys with a cattle.</div><div id="00:35:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Hmm, I&#039;ve never heard that before.</div><div id="00:35:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s, oh there&#039;s the, I spent it this hand,</div><div id="00:36:01.120" class="transcript_line"> little one, Tangle.</div><div id="00:36:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:36:04.120" class="transcript_line"> This was in 1955 when I saw my sheep and I bought the little sports car.</div><div id="00:36:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Is that you?</div><div id="00:36:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, that&#039;s not me, that&#039;s my mother and my aunt, but that&#039;s the little car I bought.</div><div id="00:36:14.120" class="transcript_line"> You bought it?</div><div id="00:36:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I saw the sheep and I bought the little car.</div><div id="00:36:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I think that&#039;s so impressive.</div><div id="00:36:20.120" class="transcript_line"> That must have been very unusual for a young woman there.</div><div id="00:36:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, we used to have some fun, we used to go following the hounds.</div><div id="00:36:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:36:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, on the top there and yeah, and then one day walking back to the car and here comes the local policeman with a steering wheel in his hand.</div><div id="00:36:37.120" class="transcript_line"> He took the steering wheel off.</div><div id="00:36:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:36:40.120" class="transcript_line"> I went to Blackpool in that and back.</div><div id="00:36:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness, you and me, what sort of car is it?</div><div id="00:36:46.120" class="transcript_line"> It was built up among the Singer, it was a Singer engine.</div><div id="00:36:51.120" class="transcript_line"> I am so impressed with you.</div><div id="00:36:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:36:55.120" class="transcript_line"> And then you followed the hounds down on the moors?</div><div id="00:36:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:36:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Derek was telling me about that.</div><div id="00:37:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, the Shrediga Hunt.</div><div id="00:37:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so where would you go?</div><div id="00:37:04.120" class="transcript_line"> And the Shrediga Hunt was based in Beyslech, but it&#039;s all been built on now.</div><div id="00:37:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:37:12.120" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;ve gone up to Gelligeir, the hounds up there.</div><div id="00:37:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:17.120" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean, we use them if we have dead stock or something.</div><div id="00:37:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:22.120" class="transcript_line"> We pay so much a year for them to pick it up, to take it up to the year, us, them, you know.</div><div id="00:37:26.120" class="transcript_line"> But then you would follow them in your car, would you?</div><div id="00:37:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:29.120" class="transcript_line"> And who would you do that with?</div><div id="00:37:30.120" class="transcript_line"> On the top of Penelan, I don&#039;t know, Penelan.</div><div id="00:37:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Up there, we&#039;d be up there.</div><div id="00:37:34.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s like an orchard there.</div><div id="00:37:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, we used to have trees.</div><div id="00:37:39.120" class="transcript_line"> So did you get apples off those as well?</div><div id="00:37:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, apples and pears.</div><div id="00:37:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever make cider from them?</div><div id="00:37:45.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no, but we used to can them.</div><div id="00:37:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Can them?</div><div id="00:37:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, that&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:37:49.120" class="transcript_line"> So where was the orchard then?</div><div id="00:37:51.120" class="transcript_line"> This was my...</div><div id="00:37:52.120" class="transcript_line"> So where was the orchard here?</div><div id="00:37:54.120" class="transcript_line"> There.</div><div id="00:37:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="00:37:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:37:58.120" class="transcript_line"> And this was my garden out by here.</div><div id="00:38:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Ah.</div><div id="00:38:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have horses on your farm?</div><div id="00:38:04.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:38:05.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:38:06.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:38:07.120" class="transcript_line"> No, just the two donkeys.</div><div id="00:38:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we did...</div><div id="00:38:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh, that&#039;s me when I was...</div><div id="00:38:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I shouldn&#039;t be showing you this.</div><div id="00:38:12.120" class="transcript_line"> This is 1951.</div><div id="00:38:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, please do.</div><div id="00:38:14.120" class="transcript_line"> I presented Langhorst in Breckenshire.</div><div id="00:38:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:38:19.120" class="transcript_line"> So when it was haymaking, would you have had to make all the lunches for everyone coming</div><div id="00:38:24.120" class="transcript_line"> in who was helping with the haymaking?</div><div id="00:38:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, usually in the evening I&#039;d cook ham, potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:38:30.120" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d come in at supper time.</div><div id="00:38:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Not so much in the daytime.</div><div id="00:38:34.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they&#039;d have someone to eat sandwiches or something.</div><div id="00:38:36.120" class="transcript_line"> But I used to cook dinner in the evening for them to come in.</div><div id="00:38:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and they&#039;d come back.</div><div id="00:38:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had a lovely life really.</div><div id="00:38:44.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was me.</div><div id="00:38:45.120" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever... you were probably then too young to have ever thatched hay ricks then</div><div id="00:38:50.120" class="transcript_line"> and stuff?</div><div id="00:38:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, I&#039;ve seen them then.</div><div id="00:38:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Have you?</div><div id="00:38:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:38:56.120" class="transcript_line"> When I was up, my grandparents, they used to do it there.</div><div id="00:38:59.120" class="transcript_line"> But of course we&#039;ve always had the bands and of course the bales now, but we used to do</div><div id="00:39:04.120" class="transcript_line"> small bales.</div><div id="00:39:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:39:06.120" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a certain amount of small bales now, if I remember rightly.</div><div id="00:39:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s the round ones now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:39:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, of course.</div><div id="00:39:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the big round ones.</div><div id="00:39:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, all times have altered.</div><div id="00:39:17.120" class="transcript_line"> So was there any... there&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask and I&#039;ve forgotten to ask</div><div id="00:39:21.120" class="transcript_line"> everybody else, but was there... excuse me... any food or meals?</div><div id="00:39:29.120" class="transcript_line"> So for example, my parents are Irish and a traditional meal we would have would be boiled</div><div id="00:39:37.120" class="transcript_line"> ham, parsley sauce and something called chump, which was potatoes and onions and cabbage.</div><div id="00:39:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:39:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything on the moors that was traditional like that?</div><div id="00:39:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Any particular dishes or...?</div><div id="00:39:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I used to always boil ham.</div><div id="00:39:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:39:52.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, I liked boiled ham and potatoes and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:39:56.120" class="transcript_line"> No, I suppose... I think it&#039;s a thing that&#039;s a farmhouse meal, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:40:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So, ham, potatoes, peas, parsley sauce, you know, that type of thing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:40:12.120" class="transcript_line"> So you would always be in the kitchen providing food for people working on the farm?</div><div id="00:40:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:40:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:40:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I used to go out and feed the children with chicken in there, feed the poultry and</div><div id="00:40:27.120" class="transcript_line"> all that.</div><div id="00:40:28.120" class="transcript_line"> But yes, they&#039;d come in then about 10, 11 o&#039;clock and then they&#039;d sit down at the supper and</div><div id="00:40:35.120" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d go about 12 o&#039;clock, 1 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:40:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:40:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:40:40.120" class="transcript_line"> I used to enjoy the hay making.</div><div id="00:40:41.120" class="transcript_line"> The harvest time used to be lovely.</div><div id="00:40:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Why was it... why did you like it?</div><div id="00:40:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Because it was just a...</div><div id="00:40:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think... well, me too.</div><div id="00:40:49.120" class="transcript_line"> They used to come in and have a rest and then, you know, we&#039;d go hauling the bales and all</div><div id="00:40:54.120" class="transcript_line"> this business, you know, the loose hay years ago.</div><div id="00:40:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:58.120" class="transcript_line"> I thought I had a photograph here of... I haven&#039;t got one.</div><div id="00:41:01.120" class="transcript_line"> I thought I had a photograph here of the...</div><div id="00:41:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what was it?</div><div id="00:41:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember any of the people who used to work for the drainage board that used to</div><div id="00:41:10.120" class="transcript_line"> come round and clear the reams and stuff?</div><div id="00:41:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, what was his name?</div><div id="00:41:18.120" class="transcript_line"> I can see him now.</div><div id="00:41:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:41:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they&#039;re looking to meet in a moment.</div><div id="00:41:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he was just slashed over the long-handled hook.</div><div id="00:41:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, do you remember that?</div><div id="00:41:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Down the Broadway.</div><div id="00:41:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Down the Broadway particularly.</div><div id="00:41:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:41:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, the one that has died now, a couple of months ago.</div><div id="00:41:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:41:45.120" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of the other gentleman.</div><div id="00:41:51.120" class="transcript_line"> I can see him now doing it, you know.</div><div id="00:41:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s silly, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:41:56.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll come to you.</div><div id="00:41:58.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll come.</div><div id="00:41:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And so Dilwyn was on the drainage board?</div><div id="00:42:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Dilwyn was on the drainage board and his father was before him.</div><div id="00:42:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So what did that mean?</div><div id="00:42:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Did it mean just, you know, was it an important role?</div><div id="00:42:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose it controlled the reams and everything really, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:42:16.120" class="transcript_line"> The drainage board more or less, you know, to see that they were cut and the reeds were</div><div id="00:42:22.120" class="transcript_line"> cut and everything from off the sides.</div><div id="00:42:26.120" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose control the gates, it opened out opposite the bottom of the Broadway.</div><div id="00:42:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:42:34.120" class="transcript_line"> The gates, it&#039;s all automatic now, you see.</div><div id="00:42:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all changed.</div><div id="00:42:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Years ago it used to have you be done more or less by hands, you know.</div><div id="00:42:41.120" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s the most, very interesting really.</div><div id="00:42:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Very interesting, aren&#039;t they, in different things?</div><div id="00:42:48.120" class="transcript_line"> I think so.</div><div id="00:42:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s fascinating actually.</div><div id="00:42:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:42:51.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very different.</div><div id="00:42:52.120" class="transcript_line"> What about fish?</div><div id="00:42:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever get eels in the ream?</div><div id="00:42:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, down the bottom of the sluice, you know.</div><div id="00:43:01.120" class="transcript_line"> You used to have eels out of there.</div><div id="00:43:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:43:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:43:05.120" class="transcript_line"> What, you used to cook them?</div><div id="00:43:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I used to live in Eel.</div><div id="00:43:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:43:09.120" class="transcript_line"> So how did you catch them and cook them?</div><div id="00:43:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you catch them with a rod and put them on the end of it, you know, catch them like</div><div id="00:43:19.120" class="transcript_line"> that.</div><div id="00:43:20.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d put them back in there.</div><div id="00:43:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:22.120" class="transcript_line"> So as, you know, they&#039;d have fresh water, so you&#039;d kill them and eat them.</div><div id="00:43:27.120" class="transcript_line"> How long would you do it?</div><div id="00:43:28.120" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t, he wouldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:43:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh no.</div><div id="00:43:30.120" class="transcript_line"> But you would keep them in the fresh bucket for a few days, fresh with water?</div><div id="00:43:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, change of water for a day or two so as they get the, well, the earthy stuff.</div><div id="00:43:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise you&#039;d be eating earth.</div><div id="00:43:41.120" class="transcript_line"> So you would do that?</div><div id="00:43:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:43:44.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:45.120" class="transcript_line"> And then you would skin it?</div><div id="00:43:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:48.120" class="transcript_line"> And then cook it, fry it in the frying pan, chop it up bits.</div><div id="00:43:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:43:51.120" class="transcript_line"> But they were very keen.</div><div id="00:43:52.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I enjoy anything.</div><div id="00:43:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Or everything put it that way.</div><div id="00:43:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:56.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not, plus even my food I enjoy a lot.</div><div id="00:43:59.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good free source of food though.</div><div id="00:44:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is, yes.</div><div id="00:44:02.120" class="transcript_line"> What about elders?</div><div id="00:44:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Was that something anyone ever had down there?</div><div id="00:44:06.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:44:07.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:44:08.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:44:09.120" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:44:10.120" class="transcript_line"> On the bottom end of the drive of the bus, you have them down there.</div><div id="00:44:16.120" class="transcript_line"> I need to get them up through the, you know, up the piers you get them in the bus.</div><div id="00:44:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:44:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Pretty.</div><div id="00:44:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:44:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Crikey.</div><div id="00:44:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, it&#039;s, it&#039;s fascinating really, you know, when you think back what you&#039;ve seen</div><div id="00:44:32.120" class="transcript_line"> and done.</div><div id="00:44:33.120" class="transcript_line"> What about church?</div><div id="00:44:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Did your family ever go to church, you know, when you were down living on?</div><div id="00:44:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I used to go to St. Peter&#039;s Church, which is the big church in the village.</div><div id="00:44:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:41.120" class="transcript_line"> But of course that closed.</div><div id="00:44:42.120" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a house now, person.</div><div id="00:44:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Is that something the whole family would go to?</div><div id="00:44:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Sunday morning we used to try and go to church on a Sunday evening.</div><div id="00:44:52.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Father Prosser was a church warden there.</div><div id="00:44:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Was he?</div><div id="00:44:56.120" class="transcript_line"> His father.</div><div id="00:44:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, he was a big churchman.</div><div id="00:44:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Was he?</div><div id="00:45:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, and Mother used to go, Mother Prosser used to go.</div><div id="00:45:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And they were occasionally, and they were married, they were married in Peterstone Church.</div><div id="00:45:08.120" class="transcript_line"> But of course it closed then, a little while after.</div><div id="00:45:13.120" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a house now, people&#039;s got it as a house.</div><div id="00:45:17.120" class="transcript_line"> They were

while.</div><div id="00:47:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Dennis and Billy Mitch used to call him.</div><div id="00:47:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And they reckoned that if the airplanes were coming over during the war,</div><div id="00:48:04.120" class="transcript_line"> because that was when he was there during the war,</div><div id="00:48:07.120" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d

id="00:48:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, something about that...</div><div id="00:48:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it St. Brides, or was it somewhere else there?</div><div id="00:48:36.120" class="transcript_line"> I might be wrong, but on the Sunday, the pubs used to be closed in Wales.</div><div id="00:48:41.120" class="transcript_line"> This is when the border was

id="00:56:19.200" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:56:20.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s life, I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:56:21.200" class="transcript_line"> It is, I suppose.</div><div id="00:56:22.200" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s so many of them now, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:56:24.840" class="transcript_line"> So do you know, you go towards Cardiff and Rumley from where it lives now.</div><div id="00:56:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:56:30.080" class="transcript_line"> And, I mean, when you first arrived, was that just agricultural land?</div><div id="00:56:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, all just fields.</div><div id="00:56:37.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard for me to imagine.</div><div id="00:56:39.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:56:40.080" class="transcript_line"> And, of course, there&#039;s the KLG, which is a bit firm opposite, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:56:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:48.080" class="transcript_line"> Doing motor things.</div><div id="00:56:49.080" class="transcript_line"> But, oh yes, it was all, it&#039;s most unfortunate.</div><div id="00:56:53.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there&#039;s a little house there as you go down towards the caravan site, on the right-hand</div><div id="00:56:59.600" class="transcript_line"> side, he was the coalman, Mrs Sadler.</div><div id="00:57:02.520" class="transcript_line"> And I look at it now and I think to myself, oh, if he came back and saw us, yeah, he&#039;d</div><div id="00:57:09.120" class="transcript_line"> be very, very upset about it, you know.</div><div id="00:57:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:12.320" class="transcript_line"> He was the coalman.</div><div id="00:57:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:57:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So he delivered the coal?</div><div id="00:57:15.320" class="transcript_line"> He delivered the coal, yes, he had the bags of coal.</div><div id="00:57:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:57:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Mrs Sadler, his son is still alive and he lives in Rumley.</div><div id="00:57:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen him for some time, actually.</div><div id="00:57:26.600" class="transcript_line"> But as the house was, it was immaculate, you know.</div><div id="00:57:29.600" class="transcript_line"> But as it is now, the slates are gone and it&#039;s a mess.</div><div id="00:57:34.600" class="transcript_line"> It breaks his heart.</div><div id="00:57:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember a nurse, I&#039;m sure it was Nurse Cox, she was the midwife?</div><div id="00:57:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:57:43.600" class="transcript_line"> Now, she lived on the top of Pendle Land, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:57:46.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:57:47.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, there were two cottages there and I&#039;m very friendly with Betty Stevens, her name</div><div id="00:57:53.600" class="transcript_line"> is now, she was Betty Bridge.</div><div id="00:57:55.600" class="transcript_line"> She lived in there, one of those and her brother and those were of course away gone.</div><div id="00:58:02.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Nurse Cox.</div><div id="00:58:04.600" class="transcript_line"> And there was another nurse, she lived up there too, because Nurse Cox moved down to</div><div id="00:58:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Castleton.</div><div id="00:58:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:58:10.600" class="transcript_line"> On the left-hand side, as you go down off the main road.</div><div id="00:58:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, she used to go round delivering the babies.</div><div id="00:58:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, did she deliver Andrew and your daughter?</div><div id="00:58:20.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I went into Glossop.</div><div id="00:58:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did you?</div><div id="00:58:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I went to Glossop test.</div><div id="00:58:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:26.600" class="transcript_line"> I just said it with both of them actually.</div><div id="00:58:29.600" class="transcript_line"> But, yes, you bring back memories for me as well.</div><div id="00:58:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well I met her...</div><div id="00:58:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose we got hedge rows here, where as down there there&#039;s the greens.</div><div id="00:58:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Ah, yeah.</div><div id="00:58:42.600" class="transcript_line"> You know, but not really I suppose, no.</div><div id="00:58:45.600" class="transcript_line"> No, the grass is green.</div><div id="00:58:47.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:58:48.600" class="transcript_line"> And you drove a tractor from early on?</div><div id="00:58:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:58:53.600" class="transcript_line"> I drove, when we moved from Langorse down to Berry Hill, and Ferguson, Ferguson, 25,</div><div id="00:59:01.600" class="transcript_line"> excuse me, I did three journeys from Langorse down to Berry Hill, and took me four and a</div><div id="00:59:07.600" class="transcript_line"> half hours.</div><div id="00:59:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:59:09.600" class="transcript_line"> With the trailer behind with implements and stuff, brought them down to Berry Hill Farm.</div><div id="00:59:13.600" class="transcript_line"> And, and then when I was going back, do you know the way, do you know Pontypool area at</div><div id="00:59:19.600" class="transcript_line"> which, you know...</div><div id="00:59:20.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been to Pontymoil recently.</div><div id="00:59:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Pontymoil?</div><div id="00:59:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, yeah.</div><div id="00:59:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, when you go, it wasn&#039;t the new road then, because we wouldn&#039;t have been able to</div><div id="00:59:28.600" class="transcript_line"> go on the new road anyway.</div><div id="00:59:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Now, we wouldn&#039;t be able to go on the motorway, you know, with the tractor, the same then.</div><div id="00:59:35.600" class="transcript_line"> And I used to go down past the horse and jockey on the bottom, and I used to go down the</div><div id="00:59:40.600" class="transcript_line"> hill and knock it out of gear, and go down that hill like the crappers.</div><div id="00:59:44.600" class="transcript_line"> And I often think, well what if something came across the road?</div><div id="00:59:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t have the truck.</div><div id="00:59:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:59:49.600" class="transcript_line"> You do things when you&#039;re young, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:59:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:52.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I did three journeys that.</div><div id="00:59:55.600" class="transcript_line"> I brought the plough up and I brought a big trailer up with implements on.</div><div id="00:59:59.600" class="transcript_line"> And, yes, it took me four and a half hours.</div><div id="01:00:02.600" class="transcript_line"> And were you the only child?</div><div id="01:00:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:00:05.600" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t even got a cousin.</div><div id="01:00:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:00:08.600" class="transcript_line"> No, but my two aunts didn&#039;t marry.</div><div id="01:00:10.600" class="transcript_line"> My one aunt did marry, but we didn&#039;t have any family.</div><div id="01:00:13.600" class="transcript_line"> And then my uncle, he married.</div><div id="01:00:15.600" class="transcript_line"> He did.</div></div></p>
