come to go up there for my tenth birthday on my own.</div><div id="00:05:03.840" class="transcript_line"> But I can always remember coming out of them houses and crossing the road to the

row of houses.</div><div id="00:05:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a lot of new houses up there now that we haven&#039;t been up there for years.</div><div id="00:05:47.840" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a lot of new houses.</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> But they lived...the old cottages where they lived, where...</div><div id="00:05:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:54.840" class="transcript_line"> My dad lived as a young boy.</div><div id="00:05:56.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all still there, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:05:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they&#039;re all still there with everybody.</div><div id="00:06:00.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve had a bit done to them, you know, one thing or another.</div><div id="00:06:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Was the pumping station noisy then?</div><div id="00:06:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:06:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Bump, bump, bump, bump.</div><div id="00:06:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:12.840" class="transcript_line"> But of course, it&#039;s like any other noise.</div><div id="00:06:14.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like when you hear the...</div><div id="00:06:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Not about the trains going along here.</div><div id="00:06:18.840" class="transcript_line"> When you first come here, you hear the trains.</div><div id="00:06:22.840" class="transcript_line"> After a while, you don&#039;t hear them.</div><div id="00:06:24.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:25.840" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t hear them.</div><div id="00:06:26.840" class="transcript_line"> So when did you move to Rocket then?</div><div id="00:06:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, the house in Subbrooke.</div><div id="00:06:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Where did everyone sleep?</div><div id="00:06:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:06:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Where did everyone sleep in Subbrooke?</div><div id="00:06:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:35.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:36.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:37.840" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s how they lived years ago.</div><div id="00:06:39.840" class="transcript_line"> You got married and then you lived with your mother and father, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, Mam got married to Dad and they had nowhere to live,</div><div id="00:06:50.840" class="transcript_line"> so they had to live with their father, which was my grandchild,</div><div id="00:06:54.840" class="transcript_line"> because Vic was already there and then he married Rosa</div><div id="00:06:57.840" class="transcript_line"> and they were all there together.</div><div id="00:07:00.840" class="transcript_line"> But Rose and Vic had two children after,</div><div id="00:07:05.840" class="transcript_line"> but Mam had already moved to Rocket then before they had them.</div><div id="00:07:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Mam was married before Vic and Rosa.</div><div id="00:07:13.840" class="transcript_line"> So where did your parents marry, do you know?</div><div id="00:07:18.840" class="transcript_line"> In Portscrew.</div><div id="00:07:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Portscrew.</div><div id="00:07:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Portscrew it.</div><div id="00:07:21.840" class="transcript_line"> And you know it snowed?</div><div

account.</div><div id="00:07:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Not as we know.</div><div id="00:07:38.840" class="transcript_line"> My dad

class="transcript_line"> But that was quite unusual.</div><div id="00:08:02.840" class="transcript_line"> And they thought it had snow, quite a bit of snow in there.</div><div id="00:08:06.840" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t remember it.</div><div id="00:08:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t know if they could get to the church.</div><div id="00:08:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Mam didn&#039;t know if she was going to be able to get that to Portscrew</div><div id="00:08:13.840" class="transcript_line"> it to the church because of the snow.</div><div

that firm that took over the railways?</div><div id="00:10:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Beecham&#039;s?</div><div id="00:10:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Was it Beecham&#039;s?</div><div

Sudbrook I explained, did he?</div><div id="00:11:19.840" class="transcript_line"> So do you know how he got into the railway?</div><div id="00:11:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know how that happened?</div><div id="00:11:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, I suppose that&#039;s work.</div><div id="00:11:26.840" class="transcript_line"> There was, it was only, that seemed to be the only work around here.</div><div id="00:11:30.840" class="transcript_line"> There weren&#039;t many houses, look.</div><div id="00:11:32.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:11:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going to say, where we&#039;re sitting now, this was a field.</div><div id="00:11:37.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when we first moved to Brogget, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And we used to have, that&#039;s why I&#039;ve got so many brambles coming up in my garden,</div><div id="00:11:48.840" class="transcript_line"> that old gutsy Gleed had a white horse, there&#039;s somebody&#039;s cat out there,</div><div id="00:11:57.840" class="transcript_line"> had a white horse and he used to keep them in this field.</div><div id="00:12:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Old gutsy Gleed, that&#039;s what we used to call him, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:12:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Because he used to go around with vegetables and one thing and another and all.</div><div id="00:12:09.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll say on there he&#039;s gutsy Gleed.</div><div id="00:12:11.840" class="transcript_line"> What, selling them?</div><div id="00:12:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Ah, selling them.</div><div id="00:12:14.840" class="transcript_line"> And this was all fields all the way down to the seawall?</div><div id="00:12:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, good, this was all fields, all fields everywhere.</div><div id="00:12:20.840" class="transcript_line"> There weren&#039;t many houses here when we came here.</div><div id="00:12:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Where I&#039;m living now on the main roads, when I was a kid, that was tennis courts, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:29.840" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say.</div><div id="00:12:30.840" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing there at all.</div><div id="00:12:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:12:32.840" class="transcript_line"> When we&#039;d go up into Mam&#039;s bedroom, which had a bay window,</div><div id="00:12:36.840" class="transcript_line"> there was all fields in at the back of there and there was a tennis court,</div><div id="00:12:40.840" class="transcript_line"> we used to watch them playing tennis.</div><div id="00:12:42.840" class="transcript_line"> And then the other fields and all.</div><div id="00:12:45.840" class="transcript_line"> So it really felt like you were in the countryside here.</div><div id="00:12:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, we was in the country, we couldn&#039;t be anymore in the country, from what we was.</div><div id="00:12:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Could we?</div><div id="00:12:54.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we used to watch them playing tennis.</div><div id="00:12:57.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember they used to go up to play tennis as well then, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:13:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember moving here then?</div><div id="00:13:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Me? No, I was born here.</div><div id="00:13:07.840" class="transcript_line"> We were born here, yes.</div><div id="00:13:09.840" class="transcript_line"> This was me and Ivy that was born in Suffolk.</div><div id="00:13:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, no, I was born here.</div><div id="00:13:14.840" class="transcript_line"> I was born, well, not here, on the main road.</div><div id="00:13:17.840" class="transcript_line"> At home? Were you born at home, both of you?</div><div id="00:13:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah, no one recalling in those days, was there?</div><div id="00:13:26.840" class="transcript_line"> No maternity hospital said.</div><div id="00:13:28.840" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s another thing we were talking about.</div><div id="00:13:33.840" class="transcript_line"> We were always going down memory lane because we were at the age when we&#039;d go down memory lane.</div><div id="00:13:38.840" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:13:40.840" class="transcript_line"> And we were saying, when we were going to school,</div><div id="00:13:46.840" class="transcript_line"> that we played Wippentop and Marbles and hooplats all down the main road where you would see the cars going and going and going and going.</div><div id="00:13:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Now, we used to go down there, we used to play Marbles going to school.</div><div id="00:14:02.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d never see a car, would we?</div><div id="00:14:04.840" class="transcript_line"> No cars?</div><div id="00:14:05.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no cars.</div><div id="00:14:06.840" class="transcript_line"> And the market then used to be there and then you&#039;d have a load of cows come up.</div><div id="00:14:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the market near the Rocket Hotel?</div><div id="00:14:13.840" class="transcript_line"> The market was right by the side of the school.</div><div id="00:14:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the market was...</div><div id="00:14:17.840" class="transcript_line"> By the Rocket?</div><div id="00:14:18.840" class="transcript_line"> With the little bungalows.</div><div id="00:14:21.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, the turning down to the church.</div><div id="00:14:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Where them bungalows are, that was the market.</div><div id="00:14:26.840" class="transcript_line"> That was the market.</div><div id="00:14:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And you remember that?</div><div id="00:14:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I remember going over the market, going head over heels over the baths.</div><div id="00:14:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and the kids.</div><div id="00:14:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:36.840" class="transcript_line"> You could see it all, but there was a school, there was a little class, a little road.</div><div id="00:14:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d go up on the baths and have a look at the cows being weighed and you name it.</div><div id="00:14:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:14:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And then they used to, the ones that were left that were sold, the cows and one thing or another,</div><div id="00:14:54.840" class="transcript_line"> they were left down... where did Lisa live?</div><div id="00:14:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Station Road?</div><div id="00:15:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:01.840" class="transcript_line"> There was like pens there.</div><div id="00:15:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:04.840" class="transcript_line"> And they used to leave the cows in there and they used to be picked up by the train.</div><div id="00:15:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:15:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Who was looking after them?</div><div id="00:15:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, everybody fend for theirself, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:15:15.840" class="transcript_line"> I suppose somebody must have fed them, but they waited until a proper train came to pick</div><div id="00:15:21.840" class="transcript_line"> them up and off they went.</div><div id="00:15:24.840" class="transcript_line"> The cows used to come up there then, didn&#039;t they, go on the train to go through the tunnel?</div><div id="00:15:29.840" class="transcript_line"> The cows?</div><div id="00:15:30.840" class="transcript_line"> The cows, yes, go through the tunnel.</div><div id="00:15:33.840" class="transcript_line"> The cars?</div><div id="00:15:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Cars, yes, go through the tunnel.</div><div id="00:15:36.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to put them all on the tracks and then they used to take them through the tunnel.</div><div id="00:15:40.840" class="transcript_line"> What, you mean for people driving cars?</div><div id="00:15:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Not cars to be sold.</div><div id="00:15:46.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, people going on holidays and all that.</div><div id="00:15:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:15:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Because otherwise they had to go all up clusters and round seats.</div><div id="00:15:53.840" class="transcript_line"> At the station.</div><div id="00:15:54.840" class="transcript_line"> They had to go through the tunnel.</div><div id="00:15:55.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, at the station.</div><div id="00:15:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:58.840" class="transcript_line"> You could stand there and watch them chaining your car onto the thing and then you&#039;d get</div><div id="00:16:05.840" class="transcript_line"> on the train and your car would come...</div><div id="00:16:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Coming behind you on the tracks?</div><div id="00:16:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Were they just open trailers then?</div><div id="00:16:12.840" class="transcript_line"> The cars were?</div><div id="00:16:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:14.840" class="transcript_line"> The cars were on open trailers.</div><div id="00:16:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, like open, you know, just put them on and chained them on the lot of the things.</div><div id="00:16:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:16:23.840" class="transcript_line"> So did the drivers sit in the car or did they go...</div><div id="00:16:26.840" class="transcript_line"> No, they went in the car in the train.</div><div id="00:16:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:16:31.840" class="transcript_line"> As far as I remember, they went in the train.</div><div id="00:16:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember the cars going.</div><div id="00:16:35.840" class="transcript_line"> So as children, you would go down and watch that walk across the fields?</div><div id="00:16:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Crikey, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:43.840" class="transcript_line"> But another thing, we used to always have a turntable here to turn the engines around.</div><div id="00:16:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Which they have only got in...</div><div id="00:16:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, what have they ever got?</div><div id="00:16:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Anymore now, have they, wonder?</div><div id="00:17:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:17:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Have they got any anywhere now?</div><div id="00:17:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Nothing down there now, nothing.</div><div id="00:17:05.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I know not down there, but any part of the country, I mean.</div><div id="00:17:09.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:17:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Probably at one of these steam engine enthusiastic places.</div><div id="00:17:14.840" class="transcript_line"> They must have something to turn something.</div><div id="00:17:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:18.840" class="transcript_line"> But there, we&#039;d have the steam engines turning around.</div><div id="00:17:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Go up on?</div><div id="00:17:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Go up on.</div><div id="00:17:24.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d go along where I&#039;d lived over in Woodland View.</div><div id="00:17:29.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a railway line from down the bottom of there, right along, under an archway, and</div><div id="00:17:41.840" class="transcript_line"> get down to the moors then, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:17:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Down to the moors.</div><div id="00:17:46.840" class="transcript_line"> And that line used to go up to Ifton Quarry.</div><div id="00:17:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Ifton Quarry was in full swing then, you know, and Big Pool there, one there, and people,</div><div id="00:18:01.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, used to wave their lorries, go in there and wave their lorries.</div><div id="00:18:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I was only thinking the other day, the girl, Earl, used to work in the office there, didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:18:12.840" class="transcript_line"> she?</div><div id="00:18:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:14.840" class="transcript_line"> What was her surname?</div><div id="00:18:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Hey, you know we were trying to think of somebody&#039;s name the other day?</div><div id="00:18:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Tyler.</div><div id="00:18:21.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, when&#039;s one of them?</div><div id="00:18:23.840" class="transcript_line"> No, well, no, it&#039;s gone again, tell them, getting bloody old candy away.</div><div id="00:18:28.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve really forgotten them.</div><div id="00:18:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know when you&#039;re, so they built houses especially for the rail men here today?</div><div id="00:18:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, railway houses.</div><div id="00:18:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Is that because the Seven Junction was becoming, you know, a busy place?</div><div id="00:18:46.840" class="transcript_line"> It was the main, yeah, there was all the big yards there.</div><div id="00:18:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:50.840" class="transcript_line"> But Terry worked there when he left school, he was a runner doing all the, just to worry</div><div id="00:18:55.840" class="transcript_line"> about him, because he&#039;d have to, as the trains come, trucks come running down, Terry had</div><div id="00:19:01.840" class="transcript_line"> to unhook them with a pole, you know, and I was always worrying in case he slipped and</div><div id="00:19:07.840" class="transcript_line"> went under because the trucks were moving.</div><div id="00:19:09.840" class="transcript_line"> He said it was a dangerous job.</div><div id="00:19:10.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, yes.</div><div id="00:19:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And he said there was one man here who&#039;d lost both his legs, somebody he used to work</div><div id="00:19:15.840" class="transcript_line"> with.</div><div id="00:19:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:18.840" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite a dangerous place.</div><div id="00:19:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a very dangerous place.</div><div id="00:19:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:19:23.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was massive, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:19:24.840" class="transcript_line"> And that was all we got.</div><div id="00:19:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Now, at one time we had a restaurant and all along that station, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:19:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, the train.</div><div id="00:19:30.840" class="transcript_line"> As I said, I&#039;d been looking for the piece of paper, because I knew I had a piece of</div><div id="00:19:35.840" class="transcript_line"> paper, the full size of the Argus, gone brown naturally through age, and there&#039;s the rocket</div><div id="00:19:47.840" class="transcript_line"> station, all walking up where you could walk up, go along and then come down.</div><div id="00:19:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:19:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And then there was another booking office where in the winter you had a nice fire in</div><div id="00:20:00.840" class="transcript_line"> there that you could go and sit in there and open fire.</div><div id="00:20:04.840" class="transcript_line"> A waiting room?</div><div id="00:20:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, a coal fire, yeah.</div><div id="00:20:08.840" class="transcript_line"> And well, we...</div><div id="00:20:11.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a waiting room?</div><div id="00:20:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s right, and then there was the...</div><div id="00:20:16.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, over the other side there was this little tea place.</div><div id="00:20:19.840" class="transcript_line"> What was their names, them two ginger ladies?</div><div id="00:20:22.840" class="transcript_line"> There was another singer, we seem to have forgotten what their names are.</div><div id="00:20:26.840" class="transcript_line"> They lived by the Bake House, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:20:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:30.840" class="transcript_line"> What the hell was their names?</div><div id="00:20:31.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember, no.</div><div id="00:20:32.840" class="transcript_line"> The proper...</div><div id="00:20:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Two sisters, all maids, they was something.</div><div id="00:20:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Two old maids sisters.</div><div id="00:20:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Used to run the restaurant.</div><div id="00:20:38.840" class="transcript_line"> And they used to know you could get the odd bun and a cup of tea and one thing and another.</div><div id="00:20:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Nowhere to go and sit inside.</div><div id="00:20:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:20:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Just a, you know, just an ordinary little shed place.</div><div id="00:20:50.840" class="transcript_line"> So was it quite an old fashioned station then, Rugget?</div><div id="00:20:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:55.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a busy station, because of the cars going over and all that, you know.</div><div id="00:21:00.840" class="transcript_line"> The cattle coming in.</div><div id="00:21:01.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a very busy station.</div><div id="00:21:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when you had the Queen stop in your wands.</div><div id="00:21:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;ve heard stories about the Queen stop in your wands.</div><div id="00:21:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she stopped in the sidings at Butchkiewicz.</div><div id="00:21:12.840" class="transcript_line"> That was when she stopped in the sidings.</div><div id="00:21:14.840" class="transcript_line"> But do you remember when they, Maddie, dolled all the toilets up in the station thinking</div><div id="00:21:23.840" class="transcript_line"> just in case she got a cut shot.</div><div id="00:21:26.840" class="transcript_line"> But then just in case, you know, they, you know, they just sweep the floors when everybody&#039;s</div><div id="00:21:31.840" class="transcript_line"> coming.</div><div id="00:21:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, they&#039;d done all the same to the toilet and all, just in case.</div><div id="00:21:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Just in case her ladyship wanted, as if she would mind, as if she wouldn&#039;t have one on</div><div id="00:21:42.840" class="transcript_line"> her, on the train, on the Royal Train, you know.</div><div id="00:21:45.840" class="transcript_line"> She used to sleep overnight, didn&#039;t she, on the sidings.</div><div id="00:21:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:21:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Butchkiewicz, it was well known, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:21:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Well known that was, a stopping place.</div><div id="00:21:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:21:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, to us local people, not to strangers.</div><div id="00:21:58.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:21:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Because it was down the siding.</div><div id="00:22:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:02.840" class="transcript_line"> And they always, when they were coming from London or anywhere and going down the car,</div><div id="00:22:05.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d from front to down, they&#039;d back in there in Portskiewicz for the night.</div><div id="00:22:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And then, and that&#039;s when we were kids, going over to the bridge down over here, because</div><div id="00:22:22.840" class="transcript_line"> the train wouldn&#039;t be picking up much speed and they would be coming under the bridge,</div><div id="00:22:28.840" class="transcript_line"> the Royal Train, you know.</div><div id="00:22:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:22:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Because kids used to be down there, you know, like kids are.</div><div id="00:22:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever see anyone?</div><div id="00:22:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Not really.</div><div id="00:22:39.840" class="transcript_line"> On the train?</div><div id="00:22:40.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember seeing anybody.</div><div id="00:22:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Because by the time they were there, they were inside, I expect they might be having</div><div id="00:22:47.840" class="transcript_line"> their breakfast or anything.</div><div id="00:22:49.840" class="transcript_line"> But nobody would go up to the sidings and knock on the door and things like that.</div><div id="00:22:53.840" class="transcript_line"> But of course, there wasn&#039;t all this terrorists and nothing like that.</div><div id="00:22:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Everything, the railway men knew that was there.</div><div id="00:23:01.840" class="transcript_line"> We knew they were there, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:23:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course, they had their guards around, they naturally were there.</div><div id="00:23:08.840" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t, well, no, it wasn&#039;t all on bloody telly.</div><div id="00:23:13.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re staying at Portskiewicz for the weekend.</div><div id="00:23:16.840" class="transcript_line"> There was no telly then.</div><div id="00:23:18.840" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s what I said, there was nothing.</div><div id="00:23:20.840" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have no telly when we were kids.</div><div id="00:23:22.840" class="transcript_line"> They just backed up there quietly and backed down and went on to wherever they were going.</div><div id="00:23:29.840" class="transcript_line"> So you remember that as children that they used to?</div><div id="00:23:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:23:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, oh.</div><div id="00:23:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember him backing up into Portskiewicz, the Queen.</div><div id="00:23:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course, I mean, it was steam then and trains were slow.</div><div id="00:23:44.840" class="transcript_line"> So they had to stop you overnight from London because it took them all day to get down here.</div><div id="00:23:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:50.840" class="transcript_line"> So your father was a steam engine driver.</div><div id="00:23:53.840" class="transcript_line"> So did he ever talk much about his work?</div><div id="00:23:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Was he away a lot or would he be away a lot?</div><div id="00:24:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, he never talked, I think it&#039;s because he had five girls, if you know what.</div><div id="00:24:04.840" class="transcript_line"> If he had boys, he might have been a little different.</div><div id="00:24:07.840" class="transcript_line"> But he had just had girls and that.</div><div id="00:24:11.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another thing I remember, can you remember that?</div><div id="00:24:15.840" class="transcript_line"> When you worked on the railway, you had cheap coal a lot.</div><div id="00:24:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:24:22.840" class="transcript_line"> You had fires and all that.</div><div id="00:24:26.840" class="transcript_line"> But you had to put your name down when you wanted a ton of coal.</div><div id="00:24:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And it doesn&#039;t matter, he could be away on Double Home, he could be anywhere.</div><div id="00:24:39.840" class="transcript_line"> And this ton of coal would come and be dumped out on the road.</div><div id="00:24:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to see it dumped out today.</div><div id="00:24:45.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d go down with the god.</div><div id="00:24:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Dumped on the road.</div><div id="00:24:49.840" class="transcript_line"> So that means to say...</div><div id="00:24:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:24:52.840" class="transcript_line"> You had to shovel it on the coal looms.</div><div id="00:24:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And us kids used to have to get this coal and put it in the coal looms in buckets and one thing and another off the road.</div><div id="00:25:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Other than that, well, we had to.</div><div id="00:25:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:06.840" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t stay on the road.</div><div id="00:25:08.840" class="transcript_line"> So where was the cottage? Where was it?</div><div id="00:25:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Was it by the station?</div><div id="00:25:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, nowhere else.</div><div id="00:25:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Where we lived.</div><div id="00:25:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, just on the corner of the road.</div><div id="00:25:18.840" class="transcript_line"> On the main road.</div><div id="00:25:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Was it opposite the Roggett there?</div><div id="00:25:23.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s some railway cottages along there, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:25:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, we didn&#039;t do...</div><div id="00:25:26.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. Just up here, no.</div><div id="00:25:28.840" class="transcript_line"> The cottage you were thinking of, what Terry told you, is that&#039;s where I lived.</div><div id="00:25:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:25:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I&#039;m getting confused now.</div><div id="00:25:37.840" class="transcript_line"> When we lived as kids, it was on the main road.</div><div id="00:25:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Ah, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:41.840" class="transcript_line"> South Grover&#039;s coal then, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:44.840" class="transcript_line"> When we were married, first married, and Terry was a baby, that&#039;s where we lived in the little cottage.</div><div id="00:25:49.840" class="transcript_line"> So would many of your friends, when you were young, would many of them have been children of railway workers?</div><div id="00:25:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve spent a lot of them, Lord.</div><div id="00:25:58.840" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them, Lord.</div><div id="00:25:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a lot of them, because...</div><div id="00:26:00.840" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re only thinking of Edna.</div><div id="00:26:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Other than the railway houses, there was only Ifton Road, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:26:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there were a lot of many.</div><div id="00:26:07.840" class="transcript_line"> And that was called Ifton then, not Roggett. That was Ifton on its own.</div><div id="00:26:11.840" class="transcript_line"> That main road going up there to the club.</div><div id="00:26:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:14.840" class="transcript_line"> And then all it was, it was railway houses, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:26:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Until they built after you and your council and...</div><div id="00:26:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very few houses. All this.</div><div id="00:26:21.840" class="transcript_line"> I can... Dad used to, when we lived up on the main road there, we had a fairy cycle.</div><div id="00:26:28.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t suppose the kids have ever seen one, have they?</div><div id="00:26:31.840" class="transcript_line"> No, what&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:26:32.840" class="transcript_line"> A fairy cycle?</div><div id="00:26:33.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s like a miniature bike, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:37.840" class="transcript_line"> About that high, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:39.840" class="transcript_line"> And Dad used to put us on to learn to ride.</div><div id="00:26:45.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d sit on it, and then he&#039;d give us a push, because there was no traffic about nothing.</div><div id="00:26:52.840" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d go like hell down that road, and then up over the bloody pavement down there into the field,</div><div id="00:26:59.840" class="transcript_line"> and let me fall ass off her head, but we...</div><div id="00:27:02.840" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s the way you learn to drive, to bloody ride your bike.</div><div id="00:27:06.840" class="transcript_line"> You never see a fairy cycle now, do you?</div><div id="00:27:09.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:27:10.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a miniature... you know, you get a fattened, you know, the fath-in bike and all that.</div><div id="00:27:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I just do like that one minute.</div><div id="00:27:20.840" class="transcript_line"> This was a miniature bike.</div><div id="00:27:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think, with a big front wheel, and then goes down to a little one at the back.</div><div id="00:27:26.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a penny fath-in, that is.</div><div id="00:27:28.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a penny fath-in bike.</div><div id="00:27:29.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, this was just an ordinary, like, two wheels on the bike, and he used to put us on to learn to ride.</div><div id="00:27:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And he used to put us on there.</div><div id="00:27:36.840" class="transcript_line"> I can remember having a little three-wheeler.</div><div id="00:27:39.840" class="transcript_line"> I can remember having my little three-wheeler.</div><div id="00:27:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I had to.</div><div id="00:27:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because as I said, I was eight years, and eight years is quite a lot.</div><div id="00:27:48.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a big difference, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:27:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:27:51.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, not many kids.</div><div id="00:27:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So what was it like growing up here then?</div><div id="00:27:56.840" class="transcript_line"> It was rural, there wasn&#039;t much traffic.</div><div id="00:27:59.840" class="transcript_line"> So you describe it as the moors.</div><div id="00:28:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Some people call it the levels, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:28:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:05.840" class="transcript_line"> But what was special about this place as children?</div><div id="00:28:08.840" class="transcript_line"> What was it like to grow up here?</div><div id="00:28:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, ten times better than what it is today, I can tell you that for a start.</div><div id="00:28:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:28:16.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to spend most of our time, when we were young, we&#039;d be down the moors, messing around.</div><div id="00:28:24.840" class="transcript_line"> In the water, and a couple of jam sandwich, and then the holidays, we&#039;d be down there all day.</div><div id="00:28:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:29.840" class="transcript_line"> At the woods, then we&#039;d be open, because we had access to all the woods, and one thing or another.</div><div id="00:28:36.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go up there with a gang, perhaps three or four, five, six, seven, it was all according to who you were friends with at the time.</div><div id="00:28:44.840" class="transcript_line"> And make house in the woods, and as you said, take a bit of bread and jam up with our own, Bob&#039;s your uncle.</div><div id="00:28:52.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be out all day.</div><div id="00:28:53.840" class="transcript_line"> You made your own fun.</div><div id="00:28:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;d go up there all day.</div><div id="00:28:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Following the owens, that&#039;s right up there with the fox and owens when they were going.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Or cut the flowers out of the woods and one thing and another.</div><div id="00:29:46.840" class="transcript_line"> And they were harmless enough.</div><div id="00:29:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And they were lovely, one day you could go up there and they&#039;d talk to you and yeah,</div><div id="00:29:53.840" class="transcript_line"> nothing like today.</div><div id="00:29:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we used to find, which you can&#039;t do today, you know, because, but we used, well we always</div><div id="00:30:00.840" class="transcript_line"> have plenty to do, we never.</div><div id="00:30:02.840" class="transcript_line"> As soon as we come in from school.</div><div id="00:30:04.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, today, they&#039;ve got to spend money, haven&#039;t they, today?</div><div id="00:30:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got to be spending money.</div><div id="00:30:08.840" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t do anything else other than spending money or flickering their fingers, do they?</div><div id="00:30:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:14.840" class="transcript_line"> As soon as we come in from school, we&#039;d go straight out, wouldn&#039;t we, and play marbles</div><div id="00:30:19.840" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d be talking.</div><div id="00:30:20.840" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say, but you know, just playing.</div><div id="00:30:23.840" class="transcript_line"> You might not believe it, but we only, where Iris was saying, where she was in that little</div><div id="00:30:29.840" class="transcript_line"> house on the side by the school, the school wasn&#039;t all that big.</div><div id="00:30:34.840" class="transcript_line"> But all of us was taught there from infants until we left at 14.</div><div id="00:30:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:42.840" class="transcript_line"> And now going up there to.</div><div id="00:30:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Only four classrooms.</div><div id="00:30:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Right, and they&#039;d all be in the same, you know.</div><div id="00:30:48.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d all know each other very well, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:30:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were all in the college.</div><div id="00:30:53.840" class="transcript_line"> The boys used to have carpentry, not carpentry, out in the garden.</div><div id="00:31:00.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to, a bit of, what do they call that then, the gardening, I&#039;d say.</div><div id="00:31:06.840" class="transcript_line"> And we used to do sewing or knitting or something, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:11.840" class="transcript_line"> But everything was all combined, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:31:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:16.840" class="transcript_line"> But opposite the school.</div><div id="00:31:17.840" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have no separate teacher for, the one teacher taught us all day, whatever it was.</div><div id="00:31:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there&#039;s a photo in that, in that cardigan book I got in there.</div><div id="00:31:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever see the cardigan book?</div><div id="00:31:34.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:31:35.840" class="transcript_line"> I got several books with all this in them.</div><div id="00:31:39.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll show you, I got a photo of my school&#039;s thing.</div><div id="00:31:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:31:47.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m in the cardigan book and.</div><div id="00:31:50.840" class="transcript_line"> When the evacuees came.</div><div id="00:31:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:54.840" class="transcript_line"> There were so many who couldn&#039;t, couldn&#039;t got to school.</div><div id="00:31:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:58.840" class="transcript_line"> So we used, one week we went in the morning and the evacuees went in the afternoon, and</div><div id="00:32:03.840" class="transcript_line"> then the following week, and vice versa.</div><div id="00:32:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:32:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Where did these evacuees come from, do you know?</div><div id="00:32:09.840" class="transcript_line"> All from London and all that, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:11.840" class="transcript_line"> We had loads of evacuees here.</div><div id="00:32:13.840" class="transcript_line"> And where were they staying?</div><div id="00:32:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Where were they staying?</div><div id="00:32:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Where were they living?</div><div id="00:32:17.840" class="transcript_line"> All in people&#039;s houses.</div><div id="00:32:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:19.840" class="transcript_line"> But we couldn&#039;t have them because we had too many, you know, three bedrooms and it was</div><div id="00:32:23.840" class="transcript_line"> five of us, you know.</div><div id="00:32:24.840" class="transcript_line"> So what was it like as a child receiving all these people into your community?</div><div id="00:32:29.840" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:32:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were all right.</div><div id="00:32:31.840" class="transcript_line"> We got on all right with them.</div><div id="00:32:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you play with them?</div><div id="00:32:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:39.840" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever play on the reams or anything like that?</div><div id="00:32:43.840" class="transcript_line"> On the reams, on the waterways?</div><div id="00:32:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Were they part of your playground and?</div><div id="00:32:48.840" class="transcript_line"> What, down the moors?</div><div id="00:32:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:50.840" class="transcript_line"> You mean, oh yeah, we spent half our life down the moors.</div><div id="00:32:53.840" class="transcript_line"> What did you do down there?</div><div id="00:32:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, we just used to sit around talking and...</div><div id="00:32:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, looking for...</div><div id="00:33:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, we&#039;d stay down the moor all day.</div><div id="00:33:02.840" class="transcript_line"> We were looking for crabs and you name it, we were looking for it.</div><div id="00:33:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was along the waterways.</div><div id="00:33:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go fishing or swimming there?</div><div id="00:33:12.840" class="transcript_line"> No, it was a bit too mucky for that.</div><div id="00:33:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Muck, one net.</div><div id="00:33:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:19.840" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:33:20.840" class="transcript_line"> All about, you know, on, beyond the sea wall, the estuary, did you ever go swimming there</div><div id="00:33:28.840" class="transcript_line"> or walking out after the tide?</div><div id="00:33:30.840" class="transcript_line"> None of us could swim.</div><div id="00:33:32.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:33.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:34.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to go out, well, we never, but my grandchild...</div><div id="00:33:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Used to go out the bedwinds fishing.</div><div id="00:33:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:33:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I mean, you used to go out getting cockles.</div><div id="00:33:44.840" class="transcript_line"> You had to be very careful because it was like a patch of sand right out in the water.</div><div id="00:33:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:50.840" class="transcript_line"> But when the tide came in, it came in quickly and it came round this way at the same time.</div><div id="00:33:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:33:55.840" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d get trapped on the bedwinds.</div><div id="00:33:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:57.840" class="transcript_line"> You had to know the tide.</div><div id="00:33:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:59.840" class="transcript_line"> And I walked back before it came.</div><div id="00:34:01.840" class="transcript_line"> And he knew the tide?</div><div id="00:34:02.840" class="transcript_line"> He used to go out there fishing.</div><div id="00:34:04.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to help him make his nets.</div><div id="00:34:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:34:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;d stab them up on the...</div><div id="00:34:10.840" class="transcript_line"> This is where you are now.</div><div id="00:34:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:13.840" class="transcript_line"> I was on the...</div><div id="00:34:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:34:15.840" class="transcript_line"> On 9th Street there.</div><div id="00:34:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Crossways, I think it&#039;s a crossway.</div><div id="00:34:17.840" class="transcript_line"> That was a new road years ago.</div><div id="00:34:18.840" class="transcript_line"> This was a new road years ago.</div><div id="00:34:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Where did you help make the nets then?</div><div id="00:34:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Where did you do that?</div><div id="00:34:21.840" class="transcript_line"> My granda and granda used to do that.</div><div id="00:34:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Is it?</div><div id="00:34:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t see very well.</div><div id="00:34:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s have a look.</div><div id="00:34:28.840" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s our class and there&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:34:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:34:30.840" class="transcript_line"> I got none there.</div><div id="00:34:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Look because they...</div><div id="00:34:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s old boss Baker, you&#039;re who was there.</div><div id="00:34:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:34.840" class="transcript_line"> That I know.</div><div id="00:34:35.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s his daughter.</div><div id="00:34:36.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got all their names here.</div><div id="00:34:37.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s his mother.</div><div id="00:34:38.840" class="transcript_line"> That is her.</div><div id="00:34:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:40.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:34:41.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my grandma.</div><div id="00:34:42.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:34:43.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my granda.</div><div id="00:34:44.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my grandma.</div><div id="00:34:45.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my grandma.</div><div id="00:34:46.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my granda.</div><div id="00:34:47.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the two.</div><div id="00:34:48.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s her grandma.</div><div id="00:34:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my grandma.</div><div id="00:34:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my grandma.</div><div id="00:34:51.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got all their names here.</div><div id="00:34:54.240" class="transcript_line"> How lovely.</div><div id="00:34:55.240" class="transcript_line"> But all these, I remember all of them.</div><div id="00:34:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and this was at Rocket School.</div><div id="00:35:01.840" class="transcript_line"> 1937, my goodness.</div><div id="00:35:04.840" class="transcript_line"> I wonder how many of these are still around.</div><div id="00:35:09.840" class="transcript_line"> How many stayed in the area?</div><div id="00:35:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, more or less died, you mean.</div><div id="00:35:16.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, a lot of them are dead, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:19.840" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them that I went to school with, gone.</div><div id="00:35:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so the...</div><div id="00:35:24.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I had that piece of argus and do you think I could find it?</div><div id="00:35:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Not again, I think.</div><div id="00:35:29.840" class="transcript_line"> What did you use to make the nets?</div><div id="00:35:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, you stuck it on a little oaky, because it was a big old fashioned thing you had to cook in the oven.</div><div id="00:35:40.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, with no gas stove then.</div><div id="00:35:42.840" class="transcript_line"> You cook your oven big black.</div><div id="00:35:45.840" class="transcript_line"> You put the stove lid on there.</div><div id="00:35:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And then it was...</div><div id="00:35:50.840" class="transcript_line"> How can I describe it?</div><div id="00:35:52.840" class="transcript_line"> It was like a wooden thing like that.</div><div id="00:35:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:56.840" class="transcript_line"> And they had a piece coming up the middle with all this stuff twirled around.</div><div id="00:36:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:01.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to hook it in, hook it in like that, pull it out, hook it back and make the net.</div><div id="00:36:08.840" class="transcript_line"> So did you have... was it like a big wooden needle you had to do that?</div><div id="00:36:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was like a...</div><div id="00:36:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Series of knots?</div><div id="00:36:14.840" class="transcript_line"> It was wood, I know it was wood.</div><div id="00:36:16.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was sort of like that with the thing up the middle.</div><div id="00:36:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:36:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I used to set it up in Granshaw and make his nets.</div><div id="00:36:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:36:25.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a...</div><div id="00:36:26.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:36:27.840" class="transcript_line"> ...pure of the pictures in there of Roggett, the little bit that they put in there for Roggett.</div><div id="00:36:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t see that very well.</div><div id="00:36:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Terry took me up to the church and this is the mission hall.</div><div id="00:36:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Is the mission hall still there?</div><div id="00:36:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Because I mean this is just so different, even now, looking at Sodbrooke Bear, I mean it&#039;s so developed, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:36:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:36:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Over the last 50, 60 years.</div><div id="00:36:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t been up to Sodbrooke for ages.</div><div id="00:36:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Goodness me.</div><div id="00:36:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s the Roggett Hotel there.</div><div id="00:37:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that was a good old thing.</div><div id="00:37:03.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to have dances and all in there in the Roggett Hotel.</div><div id="00:37:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:37:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Back in our school...</div><div id="00:37:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Mum and Dad used to go dancing in the Roggett, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:37:15.840" class="transcript_line"> I was only seeing a girl on the thing that...</div><div id="00:37:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, they used to have dances and all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:37:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:25.840" class="transcript_line"> And another thing I remember up going up to the station with what they called the tinat.</div><div id="00:37:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Steve remembers that.</div><div id="00:37:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Your red tinat.</div><div id="00:37:34.840" class="transcript_line"> And your red tinat, which the footballers used to change in there.</div><div id="00:37:40.840" class="transcript_line"> And I can always remember that for how many railway houses and railwaymen and all that come there,</div><div id="00:37:48.840" class="transcript_line"> we used to have our Christmas party there.</div><div id="00:37:52.840" class="transcript_line"> And I can always remember there was five of

can&#039;t remember what I had, but I know Olive, when she opened hers, she had a famyad.</div><div id="00:38:14.840" class="transcript_line"> And we were all...</div><div id="00:38:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Just out of gives you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:38:21.840" class="transcript_line"> So did you...</div><div id="00:38:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you...</div><div id="00:38:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Terry was saying that he used to go hunting for eggs.</div><div id="00:38:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Your father used to tell Terry to go out and get eggs on the moors to make omelettes with or something like that.</div><div id="00:38:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go getting eggs or...?</div><div id="00:38:40.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="00:38:42.840" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:38:44.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:38:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So did the boys and girls play together or did you all play separately?</div><div id="00:38:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:38:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t think...</div><div id="00:38:54.840" class="transcript_line"> The boys used to get outside Miss White&#039;s, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:38:58.840" class="transcript_line"> The shop.</div><div id="00:38:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, the one boy, the boy Watkins, took Olive up the woods, he went with a gang of them, eh?</div><div id="00:39:07.840" class="transcript_line"> And he cut all Olive&#039;s hair off.</div><div id="00:39:09.840" class="transcript_line"> She came home with no hair.</div><div id="00:39:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Cut her hair all off.</div><div id="00:39:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember that?</div><div id="00:39:13.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I remember it being said, but I don&#039;t remember it.</div><div id="00:39:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was just that much older.</div><div id="00:39:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Your mother must have been furious.</div><div id="00:39:21.840" class="transcript_line"> When I was little, you know, when I was small, of course Rosie had left school and was working, because Rosie was 11 years older than me.</div><div id="00:39:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course, yeah.</div><div id="00:39:31.840" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:39:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;re just the baby.</div><div id="00:39:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember Tratty Watkins, we used to call him, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:39:36.840" class="transcript_line"> He lived on top of the hill.</div><div id="00:39:38.840" class="transcript_line"> As I said, when I think of it...</div><div id="00:39:40.840" class="transcript_line"> She had no hair.</div><div id="00:39:41.840" class="transcript_line"> The war made hell of a difference in our family.</div><div id="00:39:43.840" class="transcript_line"> The war?</div><div id="00:39:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I know we had no boys.</div><div id="00:39:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it made hell of a difference, because I was too old, Rose and May, which could have been about 17 at the time, they were sent up to Coventry to work in the factories.</div><div id="00:40:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Were they really?</div><div id="00:40:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Ammunition factories, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Ammunition factories, but I couldn&#039;t go because I was 14 in the August, as I think it&#039;s the war started or something in September.</div><div id="00:40:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:16.840" class="transcript_line"> September the 3rd or something, but I couldn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:40:20.840" class="transcript_line"> But after that, I had to go all sorts of jobs.</div><div id="00:40:27.840" class="transcript_line"> It was no picking and shoving and buying and getting money for nothing and more, a lot of days.</div><div id="00:40:32.840" class="transcript_line"> You had to, what job the labour exchange gave you, you had to go and do it.</div><div id="00:40:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Do it.</div><div id="00:40:42.840" class="transcript_line"> So what did you have to do?</div><div id="00:40:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had two or three jobs.</div><div id="00:40:47.840" class="transcript_line"> I had, one of them I know, I went to Newport and on the bus and sorting nails out.</div><div id="00:40:58.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, what do you think that, sorting nails.</div><div id="00:41:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:41:02.840" class="transcript_line"> We were sat on benches and having piles of nails and we&#039;d go like this and pick up the good ones and the bad ones.</div><div id="00:41:11.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no robots then, there&#039;s no way with the robots.</div><div id="00:41:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Picking it all out.</div><div id="00:41:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Then we went, then I went to Portscrew and pulling nails out of wood.</div><div id="00:41:25.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, I may have done that, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:41:28.840" class="transcript_line"> We had a lot of old wood would come in so they could reuse it.</div><div id="00:41:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:36.840" class="transcript_line"> So we worked on that.</div><div id="00:41:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Then we went down the...</div><div id="00:41:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t you work at the Boxworks?</div><div id="00:41:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Eh?</div><div id="00:41:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t you work at the Boxworks?</div><div id="00:41:47.840" class="transcript_line"> In Portscrew it.</div><div id="00:41:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Boxworks?</div><div id="00:41:50.840" class="transcript_line"> No, not the Boxworks.</div><div id="00:41:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Then the tinworks, I went down in the printing works.</div><div id="00:41:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I worked there.</div><div id="00:41:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d done sorts of printing things there and that&#039;s when they changed over then to they were making plastic</div><div id="00:42:08.840" class="transcript_line"> instead of doing sheets of things for making tins for everything.</div><div id="00:42:14.840" class="transcript_line"> And I remember pinning salts because they always had to go through the machine two or three times</div><div id="00:42:20.840" class="transcript_line"> because there were two or three times lots of printing.</div><div id="00:42:23.840" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the tinworks.</div><div id="00:42:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Then there was these black things they were, they used to put them over the car head vents.</div><div id="00:42:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:42:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Black.</div><div id="00:42:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:37.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d have them down in the black and then they&#039;d be hung up when they&#039;d go through the ovens.</div><div id="00:42:42.840" class="transcript_line"> But they would be to take the glare if you were driving a car.</div><div id="00:42:47.840" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:42:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And was that in Newport?</div><div id="00:42:51.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we were in Lugley.</div><div id="00:42:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Caldecott.</div><div id="00:42:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Caldecott.</div><div id="00:42:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:56.840" class="transcript_line"> In Caldecott.</div><div id="00:42:57.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fascinating.</div><div id="00:42:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Down the pill.</div><div id="00:42:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Little black things there.</div><div id="00:43:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:02.840" class="transcript_line"> And used to put on the headlights they used to to stop the glare.</div><div id="00:43:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so they couldn&#039;t see from above.</div><div id="00:43:07.840" class="transcript_line"> And another thing we used to watch a lot from our house and then we would watch the incendiary bombs</div><div id="00:43:13.840" class="transcript_line"> going over Dinham.</div><div id="00:43:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:16.840" class="transcript_line"> During the war.</div><div id="00:43:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s Dinham?</div><div id="00:43:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Just up by here in Corwent.</div><div id="00:43:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Corwent.</div><div id="00:43:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Where you saw the bombs.</div><div id="00:43:23.840" class="transcript_line"> The training, Corwent training area that is now.</div><div id="00:43:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:26.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to call it Dinham then.</div><div id="00:43:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:43:28.840" class="transcript_line"> My son worked there for 20 years, my other son.</div><div id="00:43:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:43:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Why is it Corwent?</div><div id="00:43:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to, I could see from my bedroom window you could see all the lights.</div><div id="00:43:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you could see them all from the window.</div><div id="00:43:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were, the lights were looking for planes.</div><div id="00:43:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Look, the planes, that&#039;s right, the planes would, they would, well, as you said.</div><div id="00:43:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Drop the incendiary bombs, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:43:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And then the fires would start.</div><div id="00:43:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Why were they dropping bombs there?</div><div id="00:43:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Because they used to stock all the little bombs and all that.</div><div id="00:44:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Shells.</div><div id="00:44:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Everything else.</div><div id="00:44:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:44:03.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a depot.</div><div id="00:44:04.840" class="transcript_line"> It was like a depot, like they got no, like Tesco&#039;s got a depot like there.</div><div id="00:44:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was a depot because it was underground as well.</div><div id="00:44:13.840" class="transcript_line"> That, for all the animation and different things.</div><div id="00:44:18.840" class="transcript_line"> So you used to watch that from your window?</div><div id="00:44:20.840" class="transcript_line"> My bedroom window, you could see all that.</div><div id="00:44:23.840" class="transcript_line"> No, when we was kids from the house.</div><div id="00:44:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:44:26.840" class="transcript_line"> From the bedroom window, yeah.</div><div id="00:44:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Used to watch it.</div><div id="00:44:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Used to see all that.</div><div id="00:44:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, was it, I mean, were you scared?</div><div id="00:44:32.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what did you think?</div><div id="00:44:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, we never took no, no, I can always remember getting under the table.</div><div id="00:44:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Our mum used to put us under the table.</div><div id="00:44:39.840" class="transcript_line"> I was seven when the war started.</div><div id="00:44:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:44:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:44:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Mum used to put us under the, in the pantry, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:44:46.840" class="transcript_line"> When the siren went, we used to have to go in the pantry, yeah, and mum put a thing on the floor, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:44:51.840" class="transcript_line"> It was all like in the pantry.</div><div id="00:44:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because there was a big concrete slab there.</div><div id="00:44:56.840" class="transcript_line"> They never had fridges in them days.</div><div id="00:44:58.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:44:59.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a slab on the concrete slab.</div><div id="00:45:01.840" class="transcript_line"> The concrete slab, yeah.</div><div id="00:45:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you have an air raid shelter in the garden?</div><div id="00:45:05.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:45:06.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we never had a road.</div><div id="00:45:08.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we never.</div><div id="00:45:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, and I remember us when we were, we just started work, as I said at the beginning of the war, it&#039;s got a lot to say for the beginning of the war.</div><div id="00:45:20.840" class="transcript_line"> That we were home and the planes come over and a bomb dropped at Roggett Poole, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:45:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:31.840" class="transcript_line"> And dad was in bed at the time, he must have been working nights, and you couldn&#039;t see Roggett Poole.</div><div id="00:45:37.840" class="transcript_line"> This is the, you&#039;re Roggett Poole down here, you can&#039;t see it because it was, you know.</div><div id="00:45:42.840" class="transcript_line"> And we went up and said, dad, get up, dad, get up, there&#039;s dropping bombs.</div><div id="00:45:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And he never got up, did he?</div><div id="00:45:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was just for one bomb?</div><div id="00:45:52.840" class="transcript_line"> One, no, no.</div><div id="00:45:54.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got one of the minutes.</div><div id="00:45:56.840" class="transcript_line"> We had one boy killed over where you&#039;ve just seen a pub, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:46:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was at the pub, yeah, boy pretty.</div><div id="00:46:02.840" class="transcript_line"> He lived in the house on a couple of little bungalows that was on there, and he come out to the gate to watch what was going on, kid-like, and he got killed.</div><div id="00:46:13.840" class="transcript_line"> He was, it was shrapnel, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:46:15.840" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah.</div><div id="00:46:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you know him?</div><div id="00:46:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:18.840" class="transcript_line"> It was lucky that they hadn&#039;t turned out of the pub at the time, so they were in the pub, you know.</div><div id="00:46:26.840" class="transcript_line"> And another one, that one.</div><div id="00:46:31.840" class="transcript_line"> One dropped at the top of the minute.</div><div id="00:46:33.840" class="transcript_line"> The minute&#039;s late, and that was dad won it, but a crater, a huge big one.</div><div id="00:46:40.840" class="transcript_line"> He used to go up there and see the crater when he was a kid.</div><div id="00:46:43.840" class="transcript_line"> It went on for years and years, everybody would go up and have a look at this great big hole in the field, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:46:50.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we had over a few, because that&#039;s what they were aiming for, the tunnel, look, see?</div><div id="00:46:56.840" class="transcript_line"> See, that&#039;s what they were aiming for, the tunnel.</div><div id="00:47:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:47:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Because everything was going through the tunnel, look, everything, ammunition, you name it, everything was going through the tunnel.</div><div id="00:47:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Presumably you could see across the estuary as well in Bristol what was going on there, could you, the bombing?</div><div id="00:47:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, not so much, really. Tell you, we&#039;ve seen the barrage balloons, they had barrage balloons to stop them coming up through the water down there.</div><div id="00:47:24.840" class="transcript_line"> You could see them.</div><div id="00:47:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:47:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:47:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Big barrage balloons up in the sky.</div><div id="00:47:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Barrage balloons, that&#039;s to stop the planes coming down low, down the water.</div><div id="00:47:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any guns on the sea front, on the sea wall?</div><div id="00:47:40.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:47:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Anything down there?</div><div id="00:47:42.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:47:43.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:47:44.840" class="transcript_line"> We still have today, we still today, still got the firing range, we still got the firing range where they go for practice now.</div><div id="00:47:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Was that there when you were kids?</div><div id="00:47:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Christ yes, oh, we used to always be down there picking up shells on one thing and another.</div><div id="00:48:00.840" class="transcript_line"> It belongs to Quent, training area, which had done them then, but my son used to run it, because he worked at them, so he ran the range.</div><div id="00:48:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="00:48:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he ran it for years.</div><div id="00:48:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have any American soldiers here?</div><div id="00:48:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, all of them.</div><div id="00:48:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, one wanted to be my girlfriend.</div><div id="00:48:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Give them a ride on your bike and you&#039;d have a tin of fruit and a bit of gun.</div><div id="00:48:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:48:25.840" class="transcript_line"> One wanted to be, and the dancehall in Chapstow wanted to be his girlfriend, wanted to be his girlfriend.</div><div id="00:48:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:48:32.840" class="transcript_line"> With gold teeth he had, oh, why&#039;d we have the anchor?</div><div id="00:48:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Was it good fun?</div><div id="00:48:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, shall we say, we have no, you didn&#039;t have transport and nothing there.</div><div id="00:48:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:48.840" class="transcript_line"> You only had to rely on somebody might put a bus on or you&#039;d go by bus and then had to leave early then to catch the last bus back home and things like that, you know, everything was different.</div><div id="00:49:02.840" class="transcript_line"> But I was only younger then, they used to park, they were all down Station Road, down to Ragapool or down there, and I used to go down on my little bike.</div><div id="00:49:13.840" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, they used to say, can we have a ride?</div><div id="00:49:18.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d give them your bike and they went off and had a ride and then you&#039;d have a tin of fruit and some gun.</div><div id="00:49:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:49:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the man was glad of that tin of fruit.</div><div id="00:49:26.840"

Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:51.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to put little cardboard little rings on the top, you know.</div><div id="00:57:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And then she put them in front of her bike with a basket, and go round delivering.</div><div id="00:58:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Round the village with the basket.</div><div id="00:58:04.840" class="transcript_line"> And I used to follow her on my three wheeler.</div><div id="00:58:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They were only half pikes, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:58:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so you could have half a pint or a pint.</div><div id="00:58:14.840" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, the farm yard where we buzzed at, you had the fresh milk,</div><div id="00:58:19.840" class="transcript_line"> as they milked the cows in the morning, six o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:58:22.840" class="transcript_line"> We had our milk, the milk at seven or eight o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:58:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Fresh milk, none of this pasteurised and all this half a dozen of other.</div><div id="00:58:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, Mae used to go up then at night time, didn&#039;t she,</div><div id="00:58:36.840" class="transcript_line"> and get these little bottles to take around.</div><div id="00:58:38.840" class="transcript_line"> You could have a small one in the morning and a small one at night.</div><div id="00:58:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they used to do little half pikes, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:58:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:45.840" class="transcript_line"> And she used to go on her bike.</div><div id="00:58:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And I told you about these ducks, I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve seen it,</div><div id="00:58:52.840" class="transcript_line"> on the news this week about the three ducks terrorising a village.</div><div id="00:58:58.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was on the telly this week.</div><div id="00:59:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, they used to have one, Smithy&#039;s farm.</div><div id="00:59:05.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to hate to go up there and we&#039;d keep her out because they had three.</div><div id="00:59:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Ducks hated her and they were vicious.</div><div id="00:59:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Honestly, there were, well, no one used to say that they were better than a dog.</div><div id="00:59:21.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d been like a geese, geese would like that.</div><div id="00:59:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Geese, yeah, that&#039;s what it was.</div><div id="00:59:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, geese, was it?</div><div id="00:59:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, geese are vicious.</div><div id="00:59:28.840" class="transcript_line"> But it was on the telly.</div><div id="00:59:30.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d already got geese in the village and they made pets of them.</div><div id="00:59:36.840" class="transcript_line"> But these three come from somewhere and they&#039;ve been terrorising the village.</div><div id="00:59:41.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether it was this week.</div><div id="00:59:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Terrorising the village and the cats and the dogs and everything else.</div><div id="00:59:47.840" class="transcript_line"> So they were open, they would go away.</div><div id="00:59:50.840" class="transcript_line"> It made me think then of when Mae was up there and we used to look up the driveway.</div><div id="00:59:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Go down there and get the conkers.</div><div id="01:00:01.840" class="transcript_line"> On that tree.</div><div id="01:00:02.840" class="transcript_line"> On that tree.</div><div id="01:00:03.840" class="transcript_line"> On that tree, big conker trees, we used to get the conkers, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:00:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They were yibbly yibbly yonker.</div><div id="01:00:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Old driveway, the driveway of conkers.</div><div id="01:00:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Where was that?</div><div id="01:00:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Where was the driveway of conkers?</div><div id="01:00:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, opposite the garage, the Stonier.</div><div id="01:00:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, opposite the garage.</div><div id="01:00:18.840" class="transcript_line"> None of their houses was there then.</div><div id="01:00:20.840" class="transcript_line"> That was all fields and just the farm.</div><div id="01:00:22.840" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;d have seen that then, there was only two little cottage bungalows,</div><div id="01:00:29.840" class="transcript_line"> workers bungalows, we&#039;ll put it that way.</div><div id="01:00:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was a little row like that about four cottages going that way.</div><div id="01:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> They worked up the farm, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:00:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Mrs. Ewer and all that.</div><div id="01:00:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And then it was co-sheds and lots of...</div><div id="01:00:45.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, that big shed.</div><div id="01:00:47.840" class="transcript_line"> But there was a great big...</div><div id="01:00:50.840" class="transcript_line"> To go around, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="01:00:54.840" class="transcript_line"> I said, if only anybody...</div><div id="01:00:56.840" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t have the cameras and the money then, see, to take these photographs.</div><div id="01:01:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, if we&#039;d have taken photographs of all these different places that have...</div><div id="01:01:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Have only...</div><div id="01:01:09.840" class="transcript_line"> No gone.</div><div id="01:01:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, see, even that old bridge, it would have just changed now over there.</div><div id="01:01:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the black bridge.</div><div id="01:01:15.840" class="transcript_line"> It was like that, now it&#039;s been like that for 80, 90 years.</div><div id="01:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> And now they&#039;ve put a new one there.</div><div id="01:01:22.840" class="transcript_line"> You know that...</div><div id="01:01:24.840" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t see it, so of course you don&#039;t think about, well, we didn&#039;t have the money.</div><div id="01:01:32.840" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have cameras then, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="01:01:34.840" class="transcript_line"> So until you&#039;re doing a project like this, because hearing your stories, I can see it in my head,</div><div id="01:01:39.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;d be lovely to have images, wouldn&#039;t it, of these things.</div><div id="01:01:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any...</div><div id="01:01:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Were there any locals, you know, myths or legends or stories you used to tell each other?</div><div id="01:01:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Or superstitions, local superstitions, things like that?</div><div id="01:01:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember none of that.</div><div id="01:01:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Terry was telling me about roping weddings.</div><div id="01:02:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, we used to rope the weddings, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:02:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, where they roped them, yeah.</div><div id="01:02:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they roped the weddings.</div><div id="01:02:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Over the church, yeah.</div><div id="01:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to throw out all their coppers.</div><div id="01:02:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:02:11.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, they&#039;d throw out their coppers, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="01:02:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, that old tradition.</div><div id="01:02:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s gone now, that&#039;s gone.</div><div id="01:02:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, Terry used to do that when he was a kid.</div><div id="01:02:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he said.</div><div id="01:02:23.840" class="transcript_line"> So would you have been aware of wildlife as children?</div><div id="01:02:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Would you have known what was around the area?</div><div id="01:02:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Flowers and birds and insects and animals?</div><div id="01:02:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Not really, not really.</div><div id="01:02:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Flowers? Because the fields were full of flowers, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:02:38.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it was because we had so much of them.</div><div id="01:02:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:02:41.840" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean.</div><div id="01:02:42.840" class="transcript_line"> The woods was full of bluebells and then the fields would be full of cove slips.</div><div id="01:02:48.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, everything like that.</div><div id="01:02:51.840" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing ploughed up then, was there?</div><div id="01:02:54.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:02:55.840" class="transcript_line"> And the fields were all just wild flowers, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:02:58.840" class="transcript_line"> And when we went to Caldecott or a man would take one of us</div><div id="01:03:02.840" class="transcript_line"> or her in the pasture or something and go into Caldecott,</div><div id="01:03:06.840" class="transcript_line"> it was great edges each side.</div><div id="01:03:09.840" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, were there any orchards around?</div><div id="01:03:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Were there any orchards?</div><div id="01:03:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, orchards, yes, but only in small.</div><div id="01:03:18.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go up country more for the big orchards.</div><div id="01:03:22.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to have loads of apple trees, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:03:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Like a big orchard at the Battle of the Red Tree.</div><div id="01:03:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Walnut tree.</div><div id="01:03:31.840" class="transcript_line"> They had a big walnut tree, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:03:33.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to go up there and get walnuts, yeah.</div><div id="01:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="01:03:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:03:37.840" class="transcript_line"> One thing our dad used to do, he wasn&#039;t a man to play with us as kids,</div><div id="01:03:44.840" class="transcript_line"> if you know what I mean.</div><div id="01:03:47.840" class="transcript_line"> But he always used to take us up the woods on a Sunday morning</div><div id="01:03:53.840" class="transcript_line"> out of our mam&#039;s way while she was getting the dinner.</div><div id="01:03:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:03:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And then this is where the walnut tree used to come in.</div><div id="01:04:01.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to get the walnuts then and he used to pickle them, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="01:04:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we came back and Johnny the ice cream man would be somewhere around,</div><div id="01:04:12.840" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t he?</div><div id="01:04:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Back on the green.</div><div id="01:04:15.840" class="transcript_line"> And you know, you might not believe it, but dad used to get a penny worth,</div><div id="01:04:22.840" class="transcript_line"> because money was money then, mind,</div><div id="01:04:25.840" class="transcript_line"> pennies worth of ice cream in a glass.</div><div id="01:04:30.840" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how we&#039;d share it between us.</div><div id="01:04:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no money around to throw away out there.</div><div id="01:04:36.840" class="transcript_line"> No, not for ice cream.</div><div id="01:04:38.840" class="transcript_line"> And what was Johnny, was he?</div><div id="01:04:40.840" class="transcript_line"> But he always seemed to be somewhere near when we&#039;d come back down from the woods,</div><div id="01:04:44.840" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:04:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:04:46.840" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d have a penny worth of ice cream in this.</div><div id="01:04:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Share it.</div><div id="01:04:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:04:52.840" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s a...</div><div id="01:04:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So you call this the Moors, this is the Moors.</div><div id="01:04:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, so, places like Redwick and Goldcliff and Nash,</div><div id="01:05:06.840" class="transcript_line"> would you know that area much?</div><div id="01:05:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Would you ever go there?</div><div id="01:05:09.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we never went down there, really.</div><div id="01:05:11.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Mam did, Mam worked down there.</div><div id="01:05:15.840" class="transcript_line"> When Mam was 12, she left school and she was working in this big house at Redwick.</div><div id="01:05:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="01:05:23.840" class="transcript_line"> She had to walk there in the morning and walk home at night back to Cloudycar.</div><div id="01:05:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And how far was that?</div><div id="01:05:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Eight miles, something like that.</div><div id="01:05:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember her working down there, but I&#039;m not coming with boys.</div><div id="01:05:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she always told me when she left at 12, she had to walk because there was no transport.</div><div id="01:05:40.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was a job, she was sent there to work.</div><div id="01:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> As a maid?</div><div id="01:05:44.840" class="transcript_line"> This big house, you know, cleaning, just cleaning.</div><div id="01:05:47.840" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know the name of the house?</div><div id="01:05:48.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, she had to walk.</div><div id="01:05:52.840" class="transcript_line"> That was very...</div><div id="01:05:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Redwick, did you just...</div><div id="01:05:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Redwick, yeah, she had to walk.</div><div id="01:05:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="01:05:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s quite a long way, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:05:58.840" class="transcript_line"> They left school at 12 in Memphis.</div><div id="01:06:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:06:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="01:06:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, I left when I was 14.</div><div id="01:06:04.840" class="transcript_line"> They won all these exams and all this that and the other.</div><div id="01:06:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="01:06:08.840" class="transcript_line"> We never had nothing, did we?</div><div id="01:06:09.840" class="transcript_line"> What about Lanwerne?</div><div id="01:06:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Did that ever affect you, the steelworks?</div><div id="01:06:13.840" class="transcript_line"> The what?</div><div id="01:06:14.840" class="transcript_line"> The steelworks at Lanwerne, is that...</div><div id="01:06:16.840" class="transcript_line"> The only thing that affected us was the noise and the mess and the dust going past our house</div><div id="01:06:24.840" class="transcript_line"> because our house was there on the mighty corner of the road</div><div id="01:06:27.840" class="transcript_line"> and the lorries streaming by all the time from the quarry.</div><div id="01:06:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, for the sale?</div><div id="01:06:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Very busy, very busy road with the lorries for Redlam-Werne.</div><div id="01:06:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:06:41.840" class="transcript_line"> But after that, you know, once it was built, that was the end of it, as the saying is.</div><div id="01:06:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:06:48.840" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of these houses had gone up.</div><div id="01:06:50.840" class="transcript_line"> But then they&#039;d gone up to accommodate workers at Lanwerne.</div><div id="01:06:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, no, no.</div><div id="01:06:55.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, they were put up.</div><div id="01:06:57.840" class="transcript_line"> But most of the people came from the valleys to work in Lanwerne and they lived in the houses.</div><div id="01:07:03.840" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t especially put up for them.</div><div id="01:07:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:07:06.840" class="transcript_line"> No, these were...</div><div id="01:07:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, council houses.</div><div id="01:07:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Most of these were railway houses.</div><div id="01:07:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:07:11.840" class="transcript_line"> They were.</div><div id="01:07:12.840" class="transcript_line"> There must have been so many people who worked on the railway.</div><div id="01:07:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there must have been.</div><div id="01:07:16.840" class="transcript_line"> There must have been so many people who worked on the railway.</div><div id="01:07:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but you know, we all saw a man working on the railway, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:07:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was going to say that was their main stay.</div><div id="01:07:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Because it was such a big place here, you know, years ago, Seven Tunnel was famous, you know.</div><div id="01:07:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:07:32.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to imagine what it was like.</div><div id="01:07:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:07:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:07:36.840" class="transcript_line"> It would have been a good place if you&#039;d have gone in and had a look, and that is over the chapel over here.</div><div id="01:07:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:07:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Because, tell you what, I run the walls in there, they&#039;ve got a lot of railway memorabilia.</div><div id="01:07:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they have, yeah.</div><div id="01:07:48.840" class="transcript_line"> In the chapel here, over there.</div><div id="01:07:51.840" class="transcript_line"> What, is it open?</div><div id="01:07:53.840" class="transcript_line"> No, you don&#039;t have to see it.</div><div id="01:07:54.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="01:07:55.840" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t have to see Coral.</div><div id="01:07:56.840" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s a lot of railway stuff.</div><div id="01:08:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, is it a Methodist chapel?</div><div id="01:08:02.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you another thing.</div><div id="01:08:04.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a Rocket Non-Political Club.</div><div id="01:08:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Dad was one of the first members of the...</div><div id="01:08:12.840" class="transcript_line"> When it was a little shack, a couple of men made a little shack together.</div><div id="01:08:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:08:17.840" class="transcript_line"> He was one of the...</div><div id="01:08:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Dad helped build it.</div><div id="01:08:20.840" class="transcript_line"> ...memorabilia.</div><div id="01:08:21.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, the people that started it.</div><div id="01:08:24.840" class="transcript_line"> One of the founders.</div><div id="01:08:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I found hundreds of it.</div><div id="01:08:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:08:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="01:08:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:30.840" class="transcript_line"> So is that still open today?</div><div id="01:08:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:08:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:08:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And where is it?</div><div id="01:08:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Ken&#039;s playing over there next week.</div><div id="01:08:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, is he?</div><div id="01:08:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:08:37.840" class="transcript_line"> He practically lives there.</div><div id="01:08:38.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all right, Father.</div><div id="01:08:39.840" class="transcript_line"> My son lives over there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:08:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Where is it?</div><div id="01:08:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Over here, did you say?</div><div id="01:08:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Over there.</div><div id="01:08:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Non-Political Club.</div><div id="01:08:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So I would go to the end of the road.</div><div id="01:08:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And turn right?</div><div id="01:08:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Go right up to the end.</div><div id="01:08:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And then you see it.</div><div id="01:08:55.840" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s there.</div><div id="01:08:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Next to the hairdresser is a room by the corner by an hairdresser.</div><div id="01:08:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:09:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t believe that.</div><div id="01:09:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s...</div><div id="01:09:02.840" class="transcript_line"> And the chapel is out onto the main road.</div><div id="01:09:03.840" class="transcript_line"> On the way down into...</div><div id="01:09:04.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all on the same road.</div><div id="01:09:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, on the same road.</div><div id="01:09:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:09:07.840" class="transcript_line"> So does the chapel still have people going there for...</div><div id="01:09:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:09:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:09:14.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very thriving

thriving.</div><div id="01:09:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps I should try and go and see that.</div><div id="01:09:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I got a lot of...</div><div id="01:09:20.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have to see Coral.</div><div id="01:09:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Coral Yates.</div><div id="01:09:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Because she does a lot for the chapel.</div><div id="01:09:25.840"

Yeah, she&#039;s a part of the chapel.</div><div id="01:09:28.840" class="transcript_line"> So as young women and you wanted to get your hair done or you wanted to go and buy a dress</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="01:10:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="01:10:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="01:10:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="01:10:11.840" class="transcript_line"> That...</div><div id="01:10:12.840" class="transcript_line"> No, that...</div><div id="01:10:13.840" class="transcript_line"> No, we never did.</div><div id="01:10:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I was only saying...</div><div id="01:10:18.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve said, no, when we think that all the dances and that I went to during the war and</div><div id="01:10:25.840" class="transcript_line"> one thing and another and that, but we never had no money for...</div><div id="01:10:29.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what clothes and that we wore because now if you&#039;re going anywhere, you&#039;re</div><div id="01:10:34.840" class="transcript_line"> spending a fortune buying this and the other to go to it, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:10:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:10:39.840" class="transcript_line"> And the dance and all this.</div><div id="01:10:40.840" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know what we did then.</div><div id="01:10:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I don&#039;t think we did then.</div><div id="01:10:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Did your mum make clothes?</div><div id="01:10:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Did she have a sewing machine?</div><div id="01:10:46.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:10:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Did she?</div><div id="01:10:48.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:10:49.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:10:50.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what she made.</div><div id="01:10:51.840" class="transcript_line"> No, she didn&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:10:52.840" class="transcript_line"> She had a sewing machine, but she didn&#039;t make clothes, did she?</div><div id="01:10:53.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="01:10:54.840" class="transcript_line"> As I can remember, I don&#039;t know where we got our clothes from.</div><div id="01:10:57.840" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we had hand in me, don&#039;t I suppose?</div><div id="01:11:00.840" class="transcript_line"> As the five girls we bound, I suppose we bound.</div><div id="01:11:03.840" class="transcript_line"> I know I had hand down from all this.</div><div id="01:11:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I did.</div><div id="01:11:06.840" class="transcript_line"> I know, but perhaps we did on some things.</div><div id="01:11:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I know we used to wear them best with the buttons down the front.</div><div id="01:11:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember them?</div><div id="01:11:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, was that a Liberty bodice?</div><div id="01:11:16.840" class="transcript_line"> A Liberty bodice, yes.</div><div id="01:11:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Everyone wore those, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:11:18.840" class="transcript_line"> We had them.</div><div id="01:11:19.840" class="transcript_line"> We had them.</div><div id="01:11:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So when did it start to change?</div><div id="01:11:31.840" class="transcript_line"> When did the houses start to go up?</div><div id="01:11:33.840" class="transcript_line"> When did it start to develop here?</div><div id="01:11:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, when the steelworks really, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:11:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Before, well, where I&#039;m living now, they put up little bungalows, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:11:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="01:11:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t really know where they went.</div><div id="01:11:54.840" class="transcript_line"> I first lived when I got married.</div><div id="01:12:00.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a field there, and we used to call it the sandpit.</div><div id="01:12:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Because it was just a rough old piece of ground.</div><div id="01:12:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I ended up living in one of them.</div><div id="01:12:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:12:14.840" class="transcript_line"> When I, you know, one day after I got married, went to living rooms.</div><div id="01:12:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Then we went up to Underwood.</div><div id="01:12:24.840" class="transcript_line"> And then a man from Rogget, then our councillor, came up there and told me that there&#039;s an</div><div id="01:12:30.840" class="transcript_line"> house going in, Rogget, he said, if you would like it.</div><div id="01:12:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And it turned out to be just the one I liked with a bay window on the end house.</div><div id="01:12:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:12:42.840" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s always, we used to call that the sandpit, because it was rough ground.</div><div id="01:12:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:49.840" class="transcript_line"> The same as Rogget Poole, that was always underwater, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:12:52.840" class="transcript_line"> That was water, yeah.</div><div id="01:12:53.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why it&#039;s called the Poole, Rogget Poole, because it&#039;s all underwater.</div><div id="01:12:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Now it&#039;s all houses.</div><div id="01:12:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:12:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:59.840" class="transcript_line"> I wonder what stopped it getting flooded.</div><div id="01:13:00.840" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t many houses, you&#039;re a tally one proud.</div><div id="01:13:05.840" class="transcript_line"> No, there wasn&#039;t, I think, only railway houses until they put them in the bungalows.</div><div id="01:13:09.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, there&#039;d be old stone-built houses.</div><div id="01:13:11.840" class="transcript_line"> They put some stone-built houses.</div><div id="01:13:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:13:14.840" class="transcript_line"> People, they come from away, I don&#039;t know why, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:13:17.840" class="transcript_line"> They were all from away that come to the bungalows.</div><div id="01:13:20.840" class="transcript_line"> And then they knocked them all down the bungalows and then put all them council houses.</div><div id="01:13:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="01:13:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever think about that you&#039;re below sea level here?</div><div id="01:13:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever think about that?</div><div id="01:13:31.840" class="transcript_line"> No, not really.</div><div id="01:13:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Mind?</div><div id="01:13:34.840" class="transcript_line"> The tide have come in a field, it have come in a field, I think it was about two and a</div><div id="01:13:41.840" class="transcript_line"> half fields or more when we was kids to get down to it.</div><div id="01:13:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Dad said he remembers it once when he was a kid, he&#039;d come up the station as far as</div><div id="01:13:50.840" class="transcript_line"> the station.</div><div id="01:13:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Did he?</div><div id="01:13:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when dad was a child he told him.</div><div id="01:13:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="01:13:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember it.</div><div id="01:13:56.840" class="transcript_line"> But I do know that, not now so much because they put a sea wall there, but before it was</div><div id="01:14:05.840" class="transcript_line"> gradually coming over, instead of three fields, it was two fields.</div><div id="01:14:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:14:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be a ream and where we&#039;d have to jump over it to get into the next field</div><div id="01:14:17.840" class="transcript_line"> and things like that.</div><div id="01:14:19.840" class="transcript_line"> But of course that have stopped now because they sort of put, you know.</div><div id="01:14:25.840" class="transcript_line"> The motorway come through, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:14:27.840" class="transcript_line"> What was that like when the motorway came through?</div><div id="01:14:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="01:14:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Well I remember all those motorways.</div><div id="01:14:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Does it make a big difference?</div><div id="01:14:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Well this one here, you mean this motorway here?</div><div id="01:14:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:14:43.840" class="transcript_line"> No, the one down there, the new one.</div><div id="01:14:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Down the, not the old one.</div><div id="01:14:49.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I know the one you mean.</div><div id="01:14:51.840" class="transcript_line"> The new one down.</div><div id="01:14:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I got a photo of one of them.</div><div id="01:14:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Because it had to go through.</div><div id="01:14:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I got a photo of them as they were building the bridge over the road.</div><div id="01:15:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:15:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Because we was going to Newport one day and they put lights there as they were doing it.</div><div id="01:15:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They had lights there, you know, stop and go like.</div><div id="01:15:10.840" class="transcript_line"> So when they&#039;d stop and I took a photo of it.</div><div id="01:15:15.840" class="transcript_line"> But now...</div><div id="01:15:16.840" class="transcript_line"> It went right through the rifle range.</div><div id="01:15:18.840" class="transcript_line"> They had to build a new rifle range because the motorway went through the old one.</div><div id="01:15:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Because Ray was there then working.</div><div id="01:15:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, this motorway you&#039;re at, you know, cut through.</div><div id="01:15:32.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to have half a dozen or more lanes quite near that we go up to the woods anywhere</div><div id="01:15:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and anywhere, you know.</div><div id="01:15:45.840" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s Mrs. Norm.</div><div id="01:15:48.840" class="transcript_line"> The windmill, what they call the windmill lane, where the windmill is up there.</div><div id="01:15:54.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve seen the windmill, have you?</div><div id="01:15:56.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:15:57.840" class="transcript_line"> You mean the very big one?</div><div id="01:15:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Aye.</div><div id="01:16:00.840" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s only a ruin but you know.</div><div id="01:16:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="01:16:03.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the windmill.</div><div id="01:16:04.840" class="transcript_line"> I can see the windmill from here.</div><div id="01:16:07.840" class="transcript_line"> You mean it&#039;s an old windmill?</div><div id="01:16:09.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been there.</div><div id="01:16:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s always been called the windmill.</div><div id="01:16:13.840" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know how many years it&#039;s been there.</div><div id="01:16:17.840" class="transcript_line"> A woman there, Mrs. North, used to live up there.</div><div id="01:16:21.840" class="transcript_line"> There used to be two little stone bungalows there at the top of this lane.</div><div id="01:16:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:16:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And she used to have to walk all the way down the lane because she had no water in there</div><div id="01:16:33.840" class="transcript_line"> and a tap down the bottom of the lane that got purely down to Rocket Pool on the main road one day.</div><div id="01:16:40.840" class="transcript_line"> They used to have to come down and get their bucket of water.</div><div id="01:16:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:16:44.840" class="transcript_line"> And when David says that with Turkey Tump they had to go to the well, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:16:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was a well there when we were kids, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="01:16:53.840" class="transcript_line"> They had to get there and get the well.</div><div id="01:16:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s Turkey Tump?</div><div id="01:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> At the Minnitz.</div><div id="01:16:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:16:57.840" class="transcript_line"> So this is when you were children?</div><div id="01:16:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:17:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:17:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Someone said that he, this is somebody on the other side of the usk at Marshfield,</div><div id="01:17:07.840" class="transcript_line"> he said he used to drink out of the ream.</div><div id="01:17:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever done that?</div><div id="01:17:11.840" class="transcript_line"> They would drink water from a ream.</div><div id="01:17:14.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="01:17:16.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:17:17.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:17:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I never did.</div><div id="01:17:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any photographs of your childhood or your father or anything like that?</div><div id="01:17:27.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a photo there, there, look, of the five of us.</div><div id="01:17:30.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to dress five as kids.</div><div id="01:17:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t you look lovely.</div><div id="01:17:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll see, you&#039;ll see I got a hat on.</div><div id="01:17:37.840" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="01:17:38.840" class="transcript_line"> That, and do you know why?</div><div id="01:17:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to get so fed up of people saying,</div><div id="01:17:43.840" class="transcript_line"> what beautiful hair she got, what beautiful hair she got.</div><div id="01:17:46.840" class="transcript_line"> And I would always have her head on the side.</div><div id="01:17:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, isn&#039;t that lovely?</div><div id="01:17:52.840" class="transcript_line"> So lovely.</div><div id="01:17:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And your hair&#039;s all pretty much the same, but you&#039;re...</div><div id="01:17:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, obviously she always wore a hat.</div><div id="01:18:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I said they used to call me copper top because I said it&#039;s nice to hear that everybody says,</div><div id="01:18:06.840" class="transcript_line"> oh, what beautiful hair, what beautiful hair.</div><div id="01:18:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I got bloody fed up with it.</div><div id="01:18:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to say, oh, I&#039;m going to be a beauty queen.</div><div id="01:18:13.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to say, oh, I&#039;m going to be a beauty queen.</div><div id="01:18:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I got bloody fed up with it.</div><div id="01:18:18.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to say, and I always used to wear a tan then.</div><div id="01:18:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, lovely.</div><div id="01:18:23.840" class="transcript_line"> But I used to get fed up with it.</div><div id="01:18:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you see the difference in me now to Rose?</div><div id="01:18:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:18:31.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s so many years.</div><div id="01:18:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:18:34.840" class="transcript_line"> She used to look after me when I was born because she put lead in Luxie.</div><div id="01:18:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Was your mum working?</div><div id="01:18:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my mum always worked.</div><div id="01:18:42.840" class="transcript_line"> What did she do?</div><div id="01:18:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, she only worked in later life, didn&#039;t she, when she went up the hospital?</div><div id="01:18:48.840" class="transcript_line"> No, she worked at the Box Works for years.</div><div id="01:18:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Did she?</div><div id="01:18:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my mum did.</div><div id="01:18:53.840" class="transcript_line"> I got a photo of her working at the Box Works.</div><div id="01:18:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s the Box

Don&#039;t ask me what they&#039;ve done there.</div><div id="01:19:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:19:01.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called the Box Works.</div><div id="01:19:02.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="01:19:04.840" class="transcript_line"> My only time I remember, ma&#039;am, is when she went to work up at the St Lawrence Hospital.</div><div id="01:19:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow, that was later life.</div><div id="01:19:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And later, I
