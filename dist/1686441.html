    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales who supported this project which is</div><div id="00:00:08.880" class="transcript_line"> about Tiger Bay, Bute Town and that area and try to help people understand something about</div><div id="00:00:14.840" class="transcript_line"> the place.</div><div id="00:00:15.840" class="transcript_line"> HDA is grateful to them.</div><div id="00:00:18.200" class="transcript_line"> This particular episode, story is an explanation which attempts to counter one of the nastier</div><div id="00:00:27.880" class="transcript_line"> and more mischievous impressions about Tiger Bay and Bute Town.</div><div id="00:00:34.640" class="transcript_line"> In particular about Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:00:36.720" class="transcript_line"> No one would say Tiger Bay was an area without crime.</div><div id="00:00:41.040" class="transcript_line"> It certainly had gambling.</div><div id="00:00:43.040" class="transcript_line"> But consistently in the papers and in material you&#039;ll read now if you go onto Wikipedia</div><div id="00:00:50.020" class="transcript_line"> and tap in Tiger Bay you will find that it says area of high prostitution.</div><div id="00:00:57.880" class="transcript_line"> In fact what it says is the centre of prostitution in Cardiff at the time.</div><div id="00:01:03.380" class="transcript_line"> The problem with that is it simply wasn&#039;t true.</div><div id="00:01:07.140" class="transcript_line"> The crime figures don&#039;t show it nor does the other evidence.</div><div id="00:01:13.460" class="transcript_line"> What people do, lazy researchers and lazy people generally who want to collect stories,</div><div id="00:01:20.460" class="transcript_line"> what they do is they say well it&#039;s in the newspaper.</div><div id="00:01:24.700" class="transcript_line"> Well the newspapers, much of them were attacks on Tiger Bay and its residents and people</div><div id="00:01:32.860" class="transcript_line"> from other countries.</div><div id="00:01:34.740" class="transcript_line"> There was an article in Wales Online which was back in June 2019 when they talked about</div><div id="00:01:44.820" class="transcript_line"> the Cardiff Peaky Blinders.</div><div id="00:01:47.980" class="transcript_line"> And just like there was the Shelby family in Birmingham who were the actual Peaky Blinders,</div><div id="00:01:57.740" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff had its own.</div><div id="00:01:59.340" class="transcript_line"> And their main area for prostitution were two streets, both of which were lined with</div><div id="00:02:06.940" class="transcript_line"> brothels, Charlotte Street and Whitmore Lane.</div><div id="00:02:10.860" class="transcript_line"> Now if you&#039;re looking for them in Tiger Bay well you&#039;re not going to find them because</div><div id="00:02:14.380" class="transcript_line"> actually they were outside of Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:02:18.260" class="transcript_line"> They are now where you will find the Marriott Hotel.</div><div id="00:02:21.460" class="transcript_line"> Both those streets will be under the Marriott and under the car park and they were alongside</div><div id="00:02:27.100" class="transcript_line"> the canal which of course is gone as well.</div><div id="00:02:29.620" class="transcript_line"> So if you were to compare a map now from 1851 to the present day you&#039;d find yourself digging</div><div id="00:02:36.300" class="transcript_line"> up the lobby on Marriott Hotel with a JCB to find any remains of Charlotte Street in</div><div id="00:02:43.380" class="transcript_line"> particular but also Whitmore.</div><div id="00:02:45.700" class="transcript_line"> Those areas were filled with pimps and prostitutes, gangsters and thieves.</div><div id="00:02:51.300" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a lot of research being done on this by a gentleman called Anthony Reese whose</div><div id="00:02:59.620" class="transcript_line"> relatives came from that area.</div><div id="00:03:03.460" class="transcript_line"> There is no evidence to show Anthony Reese&#039;s relatives were part of those particular industries</div><div id="00:03:09.740" class="transcript_line"> but they came from that area.</div><div id="00:03:11.540" class="transcript_line"> Now what he&#039;s done in his work and there&#039;s a book called Notorious and a great deal of</div><div id="00:03:17.780" class="transcript_line"> research he&#039;s identified some of these people.</div><div id="00:03:21.660" class="transcript_line"> People like Ned Llewellyn, Livable Dick and the aptly named John Thomas, we won&#039;t go there,</div><div id="00:03:28.900" class="transcript_line"> were reported in the Cardiff Merthyr Guardian in 1847 because they used to kick and knock</div><div id="00:03:36.220" class="transcript_line"> the poor girls about as a boy would a football.</div><div id="00:03:40.740" class="transcript_line"> The canal that ran alongside those areas became known for suicides.</div><div id="00:03:46.740" class="transcript_line"> With reports of prostitutes throwing themselves into the water in desperate bids to escape</div><div id="00:03:52.100" class="transcript_line"> the horrors of their daily lives.</div><div id="00:03:54.620" class="transcript_line"> Those canals were also full of numerous unwanted babies, some of which were drowned and others</div><div id="00:04:01.740" class="transcript_line"> suffocated beforehand and certainly dismembered bodies were also found bobbing in the water.</div><div id="00:04:08.220" class="transcript_line"> But plenty of women were also involved as brothel keepers such as Mrs. Protheroe at</div><div id="00:04:13.740" class="transcript_line"> 63 years of age was the oldest owner of the oldest brothel in Cardiff and she got a lion&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:20.980" class="transcript_line"> share of the business on Whitmore Lane.</div><div id="00:04:23.660" class="transcript_line"> Not least because Whitmore Lane was right next to a building where sailors got paid</div><div id="00:04:31.900" class="transcript_line"> off after they were arrived back from the ships and there were others like Mary the</div><div id="00:04:37.660" class="transcript_line"> Cripple so called because she had withered legs and could not walk.</div><div id="00:04:42.860" class="transcript_line"> She was an amazing woman given her circumstances says Mr. Rees.</div><div id="00:04:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Imagine being a disabled woman living in the early Victorian period and still managed to</div><div id="00:04:53.020" class="transcript_line"> carve out for yourself a 40 year career as the head of a small criminal empire first</div><div id="00:04:59.980" class="transcript_line"> in Newport and then in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:05:02.620" class="transcript_line"> Her first arrest is recorded in 1835 when she got sent down for keeping a brothel and</div><div id="00:05:09.180" class="transcript_line"> she was still procuring girls in Cardiff in 1876 41 years later and her son Abraham Reardwood</div><div id="00:05:17.620" class="transcript_line"> was still running brothels in Cardiff up until the 1920s.</div><div id="00:05:22.660" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;ll find very little about Charlotte Street or Whitmore because it was such an</div><div id="00:05:27.580" class="transcript_line"> embarrassment that actually they didn&#039;t talk about it.</div><div id="00:05:31.480" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t much in the press because well I guess for those kind of areas to be such</div><div id="00:05:38.920" class="transcript_line"> a great success someone would need to know and let&#039;s say someone would be assisting</div><div id="00:05:47.540" class="transcript_line"> the criminals to try and make sure they did not end up in court.</div><div id="00:05:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Now all of the petty sessions books that&#039;s the transcriptions from the court are in the</div><div id="00:05:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Glamorgan archives.</div><div id="00:05:59.360" class="transcript_line"> Meanwhile now if you think about where to drink in those streets there would be places</div><div id="00:06:04.400" class="transcript_line"> like the lame chicken, the Noah&#039;s Ark, the flying eagle, the wild wave, the Irishman&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:10.500" class="transcript_line"> glory and the coal hole all of which are gone.</div><div id="00:06:14.280" class="transcript_line"> One booze out of one pub may well survive that&#039;s the Golden Cross which started as</div><div id="00:06:20.040" class="transcript_line"> the shield and Newcastle in 1846 before changing its name several times.</div><div id="00:06:26.380" class="transcript_line"> It was on what would have been the corner of Whitmore Lane and Bute Street.</div><div id="00:06:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Now that&#039;s the only connection.</div><div id="00:06:32.460" class="transcript_line"> Bute Street was at the very end of Bute Street.</div><div id="00:06:36.860" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t part of the bay it was certainly not part of Bute Town.</div><div id="00:06:41.740" class="transcript_line"> Now there are very very few pictures of the people from those times.</div><div id="00:06:44.300" class="transcript_line"> There will only be on court record in mugshots.</div><div id="00:06:47.360" class="transcript_line"> There is one such on Wales online of Swansea Dan also known as Daniel Davis a boatman and</div><div id="00:06:54.400" class="transcript_line"> a bully from Whitmore Lane and he was sent to Pentonville prison in 1876 for a firearms</div><div id="00:07:00.720" class="transcript_line"> charge.</div><div id="00:07:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Now the connection between the boatman and the prostitution is quite important.</div><div id="00:07:07.820" class="transcript_line"> An awful lot of boatmen according to these records were also what&#039;s called bullies.</div><div id="00:07:14.720" class="transcript_line"> A bully was the other name for someone who was a pimp and operated a ring of prostitutes.</div><div id="00:07:23.700" class="transcript_line"> We need to be clear these people were not from Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:07:29.940" class="transcript_line"> They were not the people identified by the papers which largely were these people from</div><div id="00:07:38.260" class="transcript_line"> other countries from overseas.</div><div id="00:07:41.160" class="transcript_line"> The nearest most of these people came from being overseas is because at the time there</div><div id="00:07:47.760" class="transcript_line"> was a strong connection between Irish families and the crime.</div><div id="00:07:51.800" class="transcript_line"> But the one thing we do know is someone needed to be blamed and once again that was Tiger</div><div id="00:07:58.100" class="transcript_line"> Bay and the many races who lived possibly up to 45 different nationalities in modern</div><div id="00:08:06.480" class="transcript_line"> terms that lived in Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:08:08.940" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m not saying there weren&#039;t prostitutes in Tiger Bay but there is a big difference</div><div id="00:08:14.060" class="transcript_line"> between prostitutes which were all over Cardiff, brothels which were all over Cardiff and an</div><div id="00:08:21.660" class="transcript_line"> occasional brothel and the main centres and the way most of the time it&#039;s described is</div><div id="00:08:29.940" class="transcript_line"> that Tiger Bay was the main centre of prostitution.</div><div id="00:08:36.180" class="transcript_line"> It was not.</div><div id="00:08:37.980" class="transcript_line"> It was a residence for families, for merchant seamen in between ships and for extremely</div><div id="00:08:47.160" class="transcript_line"> wealthy people who occupied places such as Mount Stewart Square, Loudoun Square etc.</div><div id="00:08:56.280" class="transcript_line"> So the point of what I guess I&#039;m trying to say here is much is said about Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:09:02.880" class="transcript_line"> If you read something about it I would suggest you say where&#039;s the evidence?</div><div id="00:09:10.220" class="transcript_line"> The reality is Tiger Bay was a working class area full of people who lived their lives</div><div id="00:09:17.540" class="transcript_line"> and as the city got wealthier and wealthier from the work, much of it of those working</div><div id="00:09:24.480" class="transcript_line"> class people it increasingly wanted to distance itself from the working class environment</div><div id="00:09:33.120" class="transcript_line"> and those people from overseas and they became the brunt and the blame for so much that was</div><div id="00:09:43.040" class="transcript_line"> normal in Cardiff and crime certainly was before the people from the Empire arrived</div><div id="00:09:52.940" class="transcript_line"> in the bay there were different gangs operating in Cardiff regularly but there is no evidence</div><div id="00:10:00.140" class="transcript_line"> to show that the people from the bay or the new people from overseas in terms of certainly</div><div id="00:10:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Africa, Arab countries, Caribbean countries, Italy, India, there&#039;s no evidence to show</div><div id="00:10:19.480" class="transcript_line"> they were major players or running brothels or leaders in criminality.</div><div id="00:10:29.680" class="transcript_line"> There is a great deal of evidence to show however they were family people.</div><div id="00:10:34.120" class="transcript_line"> I hope this has helped you understand a little bit about how people get labelled and then</div><div id="00:10:40.640" class="transcript_line"> conveniently that label stays because people quote a paper from 1850 or 1880 when there</div><div id="00:10:50.260" class="transcript_line"> was no complaint against what was written in the press about you.</div><div id="00:10:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for listening.</div></div></p>
