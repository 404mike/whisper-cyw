    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So far we&#039;ve talked only about the past and the present and nothing at all about</div><div id="00:00:04.080" class="transcript_line"> the future and yet the future of Connors Quay lies more in the youngsters hands</div><div id="00:00:08.520" class="transcript_line"> than in many other places because here with expanding industry families are</div><div id="00:00:13.480" class="transcript_line"> moving in and the two or three children in each house on the New Estate will be</div><div id="00:00:17.940" class="transcript_line"> starting their lives here. Work there is so far as one can see and plenty. What</div><div id="00:00:23.720" class="transcript_line"> about leisure? Well we&#039;ve tracked down George Curran the entertainment manager</div><div id="00:00:28.360" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve come to the Civic Centre which is really a rather pleasant place and he&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:33.320" class="transcript_line"> let us come onto the stage here alongside the swimming bath. Mr. Kerr what</div><div id="00:00:38.800" class="transcript_line"> is there for the youngsters? I suppose there are youth clubs. Oh yes yes we have</div><div id="00:00:43.360" class="transcript_line"> youth clubs in the area and on the whole they&#039;re fairly well supported. They&#039;re</div><div id="00:00:47.880" class="transcript_line"> mostly run by the churches. Mostly yes by the churches and of course the Civic</div><div id="00:00:53.360" class="transcript_line"> Centre itself we run two to three dances a week for the youngsters which</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> again are well supported but I feel that we could do more in this respect. For</div><div id="00:01:04.920" class="transcript_line"> instance? Well what I would like to see is a large room that could be used as a</div><div id="00:01:11.640" class="transcript_line"> sort of social centre for the youth of the area with something like a bar in</div><div id="00:01:17.160" class="transcript_line"> one corner serving soft drinks, a jukebox or a resident disc jockey. A real</div><div id="00:01:23.760" class="transcript_line"> discotheque in other words as a kid understands it rather than a social</div><div id="00:01:27.760" class="transcript_line"> centre which puts the establishment stamp on it. Yes but still we you know it</div><div id="00:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> would be a place where everybody could meet their friends they could come in</div><div id="00:01:35.160" class="transcript_line"> and sit as long as they wanted to and we also provide games in there such</div><div id="00:01:40.680" class="transcript_line"> as darts dominoes other things like that. I suppose there&#039;d be sort of</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> spin-off activities which you&#039;d gently introduce without making the youngsters</div><div id="00:01:50.080" class="transcript_line"> feel that it was being pushed on to them. Oh yes and I&#039;m sure this could be</div><div id="00:01:53.680" class="transcript_line"> done you know me myself I&#039;m a very keen motorcyclist and I know a lot of</div><div id="00:02:01.240" class="transcript_line"> the younger people have got scooters and motorbikes and I&#039;m quite sure a</div><div id="00:02:05.320" class="transcript_line"> club you know for catering specifically for them could be put into operation. Now</div><div id="00:02:10.440" class="transcript_line"> there must be other types of clubs that we could cater for as well. Do the</div><div id="00:02:14.380" class="transcript_line"> youngsters round about tend to help themselves in this way? Have they come</div><div id="00:02:17.840" class="transcript_line"> forward with any ideas I mean in connection with swimming or anything</div><div id="00:02:20.680" class="transcript_line"> else? Oh yes I think they do but there&#039;s one or two in the area that are sort of</div><div id="00:02:27.320" class="transcript_line"> outstanding at this and they can sort of round everybody else up. In what respect?</div><div id="00:02:31.440" class="transcript_line"> Who are they? Well one in particular is a Miss Sheaby</div><div id="00:02:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Hannaby who&#039;s the secretary of the swimming club and this girl has done</div><div id="00:02:40.080" class="transcript_line"> wonderful work in connection with the club. I&#039;m sure that the Connorsky</div><div id="00:02:44.600" class="transcript_line"> women&#039;s club must be one of the best-run clubs in the country. This was quite</div><div id="00:02:47.800" class="transcript_line"> spontaneous on her part. Yes oh yes. And another one? Well Mr. Victor</div><div id="00:02:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Richard is another example. If you want to raise money for charity or something</div><div id="00:02:59.560" class="transcript_line"> like this you contact Victor and he gets the kids cracking together you know and</div><div id="00:03:04.120" class="transcript_line"> they go out in a march raise funds this way something like that. Right Mr. Kerr now</div><div id="00:03:09.200" class="transcript_line"> what about music? Well I&#039;d like something by Woody Herman and his orchestra.</div><div id="00:03:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Particularly Apple Honey if that is available.</div></div></p>
