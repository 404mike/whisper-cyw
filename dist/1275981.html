    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 13 in our series of short stories in relation to the race riots in Wales in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Chapter 13 is actually the 1919 race riots in Liverpool. This podcast is drawn from a film</div><div id="00:00:21.520" class="transcript_line"> produced and directed by Hatch TV made in partnership with WALW, Writing on the Wall,</div><div id="00:00:28.640" class="transcript_line"> and the Geography Department of Liverpool University. It is narrated by Jannia Pickett</div><div id="00:00:35.280" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re grateful to them for giving their permission for us to use this within our project.</div><div id="00:00:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Today this area of Liverpool forms a vibrant and diverse community whose many cultures live</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> peacefully side by side. Here in the Baltic Triangle there is a thriving creative industry,</div><div id="00:01:02.880" class="transcript_line"> but in 1919 things were very different and these streets witnessed unprecedented racial violence,</div><div id="00:01:10.240" class="transcript_line"> bloodshed and murder. This short film looks at some of the people and places featured in</div><div id="00:01:16.400" class="transcript_line"> the Great Water Race Riot Archive which can be explored online and in a book available from</div><div id="00:01:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Writing on the Wall.</div><div id="00:01:31.520" class="transcript_line"> In 1919, as today, the city&#039;s diverse population reflected its long heritage as a thriving port.</div><div id="00:01:39.280" class="transcript_line"> The area around Chinatown and the Baltic Triangle was known as Sailor Town and was populated by</div><div id="00:01:45.120" class="transcript_line"> black, Chinese, Scandinavian, Russian, Ukrainian and Italian seafarers.</div><div id="00:01:51.280" class="transcript_line"> During World War I, industries in Liverpool that had traditionally shunned black workers</div><div id="00:01:56.160" class="transcript_line"> welcomed men from West Africa and the Caribbean to fill the wartime labour shortage.</div><div id="00:02:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Many worked as merchant seamen and in factories. At the end of the war, black men found themselves</div><div id="00:02:07.280" class="transcript_line"> out of work when a colour bar in employment was reintroduced. They were blamed for the post-war</div><div id="00:02:12.080" class="transcript_line"> economic slump and, backed by the local press, the mayor of Liverpool, John Ritchie,</div><div id="00:02:16.800" class="transcript_line"> sought to repatriate the city&#039;s black workers.</div><div id="00:02:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Throughout the summer of 1919, racial violence erupted in seaports throughout the UK.</div><div id="00:02:27.280" class="transcript_line"> On the 4th of June, John Johnson, a West Indian man who lived here at 48 Nelson Street,</div><div id="00:02:32.640" class="transcript_line"> was brutally stabbed by two Scandinavian men for refusing to give them a cigarette.</div><div id="00:02:37.280" class="transcript_line"> The following evening, Johnson&#039;s friends retaliated by attacking a group of Scandinavians</div><div id="00:02:42.400" class="transcript_line"> at a pub on Bailey Street. This sparked a wave of racial violence against black people by white mobs</div><div id="00:02:49.040" class="transcript_line"> in their thousands. On the 5th of June, police raided 18 Upper Pitt Street. A young Bermuda</div><div id="00:02:55.200" class="transcript_line"> sailor, Charles Watton, was at home and leave during the raid. Charles fled the house and was</div><div id="00:03:00.800" class="transcript_line"> chased by the police and an angry mob.</div><div id="00:03:06.720" class="transcript_line"> Charles was pursued here to Queen&#039;s Dock, where he was either pushed or fell into the water.</div><div id="00:03:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Under the hail of missiles, Charles was hit unconscious on the head with a rock and drowned.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Violence intensified over the next few nights with thousands of people attacking black homes</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> and boarding houses. Hundreds of black men and their families were housed in police stations</div><div id="00:03:27.680" class="transcript_line"> for their own safety. Following the riots, the Chief Constable of Liverpool and the Queen&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Home Office made plans for the repatriation of black colonial workers.</div><div id="00:03:37.520" class="transcript_line"> The Killing of Charles and the Race Riot of 1919 stand as a landmark event and watershed</div><div id="00:03:43.360" class="transcript_line"> for Britain&#039;s black community.</div></div></p>
