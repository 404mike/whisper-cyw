It&#039;s K-E-M-I, Nevins, N-E-V-I-N-S.</div><div id="00:00:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Cammie, tell us when and how did you first become involved in the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:31.680" class="transcript_line"> I think it was about 2003, and my friend in mind, Mary Ann, who was involved in it,</div><div id="00:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> just pop along. Contains a community centre. It&#039;s good fun. There&#039;s loads of people there.</div><div id="00:00:43.040" class="transcript_line"> You can bring the kids. They can do some activities. So I thought, oh, great. I was working</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> then. I was still nursing and I was working nights. So I went along, and next thing I know,</div><div id="00:00:54.080" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re in the full throes of making costumes, of practising dance routines. It was absolutely</div><div id="00:01:00.960" class="transcript_line"> wild, but it was memorable. I loved it. And I must confess, it was actually back in 1993,</div><div id="00:01:06.880" class="transcript_line"> not 2003. Oh, sorry, 1993. I was in a dementia setting.</div><div id="00:01:12.400" class="transcript_line"> And I remember that you were certainly one of the lead. It was a group of angels, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. We had all white costumes with white wings, which we made out of, I think it might have</div><div id="00:01:21.680" class="transcript_line"> been some sort of bamboo-y, bendy wood. And we had to thread metres and metres and metres of white</div><div id="00:01:28.400" class="transcript_line"> material through them. They were quite big and quite high. And then a full white costume as well.</div><div id="00:01:33.600" class="transcript_line"> And it had to be made so that you could securely sort of strap to your body.</div><div id="00:01:37.920" class="transcript_line"> Got it. Got it. And of course, your choreographer, your dance tutor, your,</div><div id="00:01:42.960" class="transcript_line"> what can I say, your inspiration was Mary Ann Roberts. Yeah. Originally from Trinidad and</div><div id="00:01:48.800" class="transcript_line"> residence in Cardiff. And if I remember correctly, there was a climactic battle between your</div><div id="00:01:55.280" class="transcript_line"> virginal white angelic group and a group of, what can I say, water pistol, well,</div><div id="00:02:01.920" class="transcript_line"> they were pump action shotgun type water pistols. Hooligans. Hooligans. They were devils.</div><div id="00:02:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So we were the angels. Yeah. So what exactly happened to you on the steps of the</div><div id="00:02:11.040" class="transcript_line"> National Museum? Well, we were there and we&#039;d done the dance routine, which was really cool.</div><div id="00:02:14.800" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s all of us, there&#039;s kids there, there&#039;s adults there, the whole sort of generational</div><div id="00:02:18.960" class="transcript_line"> thing going on. And then we were squirted with this red blood. You all died, didn&#039;t you? Yeah,</div><div id="00:02:25.600" class="transcript_line"> we did. That was the end of us really. But it was a brilliant way to go in a brilliant location.</div><div id="00:02:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Not quite the end of the story because despite the fact that we had practised to make sure that</div><div id="00:02:38.480" class="transcript_line"> the red dye, that the devils were pumping all over your beautiful white costumes. Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> In fact, didn&#039;t dye the steps of the iconic National Museum of Wales. I mean,</div><div id="00:02:50.560" class="transcript_line"> when I got permission from the director to use the space for our finale, I signed on behalf of</div><div id="00:02:56.800" class="transcript_line"> SWCCA a very big legal document, an indemnity document in which the company undertook to return</div><div id="00:03:04.080" class="transcript_line"> the fabric of the building intact and unaltered in any way. And that night, you know, 1993,</div><div id="00:03:12.960" class="transcript_line"> night mass, the performance was in the evening. Obviously, we had lights and we had pyro as well.</div><div id="00:03:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Some naked flame before health and safety was invented and the rest of it. But unbeknownst to</div><div id="00:03:25.600" class="transcript_line"> me, in some enthusiastic devil, rather than going with the approved and tested weak strength red dye,</div><div id="00:03:34.560" class="transcript_line"> had taken it upon themselves to add volumes of more food colouring and dye to the blood type</div><div id="00:03:42.160" class="transcript_line"> stuff that was in the water pistols and the water guns. And so the next morning after the carnival,</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I received a phone call from the director of the National Museum of Wales, who asked me to come and</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> meet him urgently on the steps of the National Museum of Wales in Cattays. Naturally, I scooted</div><div id="00:04:02.960" class="transcript_line"> over there and as I approached the steps in sunlight, I could see they appear to be dappled</div><div id="00:04:10.480" class="transcript_line"> with something. And then to my utter horror, I discovered that, yeah, the carnival had in fact</div><div id="00:04:17.280" class="transcript_line"> dyed a goodly proportion of the steps of the National Museum bright red, which of course was</div><div id="00:04:25.360" class="transcript_line"> a disaster. I mean, the idea that you can&#039;t imagine that. Yeah, the look on my face. Well,</div><div id="00:04:30.320" class="transcript_line"> to cut a long story short, the director of the museum, who was fully aware that we were a small</div><div id="00:04:36.320" class="transcript_line"> scale community funded organisation, decided to wait three months to see whether or not</div><div id="00:04:44.800" class="transcript_line"> the rain and wind and natural weathering would in fact take away these marks. I used to pop</div><div id="00:04:51.120" class="transcript_line"> along once a week and sort of spit them before, try and rub them with my feet. It was rather pathetic.</div><div id="00:04:56.800" class="transcript_line"> But three months in and good news for everyone. Otherwise, I&#039;m afraid the carnival would have</div><div id="00:05:02.080" class="transcript_line"> died an ignomal die based death way back then. I hasten to add that the marks had</div><div id="00:05:09.200" class="transcript_line"> virtually gone and the director very kindly said that he would accept that I&#039;d returned the steps</div><div id="00:05:15.680" class="transcript_line"> largely as they were. And we shook hands and kind of carnival went on to even more wonderful things.</div><div id="00:05:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. It&#039;s always nice to put things in context. At the point in which you were describing</div><div id="00:05:28.080" class="transcript_line"> being in the carnival in 1993, you were a nurse in the Royal Great Hospital. Yeah, I was doing</div><div id="00:05:33.840" class="transcript_line"> agency night shift. So you&#039;re working at night? With my costume in tow, my accessory and to the</div><div id="00:05:42.560" class="transcript_line"> great delight or sort of wonderment of the rest of the staff I was on with, I&#039;d produce this in my</div><div id="00:05:48.480" class="transcript_line"> break and start sewing and sticking on sequins and weaving material. And I&#039;d actually ask people</div><div id="00:05:55.360" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d like to get involved as well. I thought, well, no point in just sitting there, you know,</div><div id="00:05:58.480" class="transcript_line"> with your coffee. We&#039;ve done all our bits and you know, you have odd bits of time free in between</div><div id="00:06:03.360" class="transcript_line"> the observations and settling patients. So I had people helping me really picking up needles,</div><div id="00:06:09.360" class="transcript_line"> the glue gun. So we got it all done. It was brilliant. That was a fabulous, I have to say,</div><div id="00:06:14.080" class="transcript_line"> brilliant, brilliant job. I mean, I can still see you there in my mind. Of course, you moved on from</div><div id="00:06:20.800" class="transcript_line"> nursing and now I certainly would like those in the future to know. So Chemie&#039;s, the rest of us,</div><div id="00:06:28.800" class="transcript_line"> the queen of all things vegetarian. It&#039;s like a food carnival really, the cafe. We try to encourage</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> people to try different things. We like experimenting as cooks and it is like a carnival,</div><div id="00:06:43.280" class="transcript_line"> different colors, different textures. It&#039;s like stuff from around the world. And it&#039;s just good</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> fun. I enjoy it as much as I do dancing in the streets, dancing in the kitchen. Chemie,</div><div id="00:06:56.240" class="transcript_line"> thank you very much for that and bring this back to one of the earliest carnivals.</div><div id="00:06:59.680" class="transcript_line"> I hereby declare you a carnival hero. Thank you very much. Thanks, Steve.</div></div></p>
