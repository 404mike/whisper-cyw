class="transcript_line"> Of residents?</div><div id="00:00:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Maybe six, seven, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:00:08.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not honestly sure.</div><div id="00:00:09.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there&#039;s more than that.</div><div id="00:00:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Do they still have services there?</div><div id="00:00:12.800" class="transcript_line"> They do.</div><div id="00:00:13.800" class="transcript_line"> They do.</div><div id="00:00:14.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got our Jewish New Year coming up in two weeks&#039; time, and they&#039;ll have one day</div><div id="00:00:20.040" class="transcript_line"> service in the home, and one day&#039;s in the synagogue.</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> And they try and do the other festivals.</div><div id="00:00:25.980" class="transcript_line"> They try and do one day in the home, and one day in the synagogue, which is a bit of</div><div id="00:00:30.820" class="transcript_line"> a boner contempt because it splits the community, and we haven&#039;t got enough people to fill one</div><div id="00:00:36.380" class="transcript_line"> area, do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:00:38.420" class="transcript_line"> But that is what it is.</div><div id="00:00:40.340" class="transcript_line"> And they do Friday night dinners as well, in the home as well, which is nice for the</div><div id="00:00:46.620" class="transcript_line"> Jewish residents who are there, the Sabbath.</div><div id="00:00:50.020" class="transcript_line"> You were telling me when we met before that you can vlog with Midsford, though.</div><div id="00:00:54.380" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:00:55.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:56.380" class="transcript_line"> And this is now taking, suddenly I had a meeting a couple of days ago for Midsford Day.</div><div id="00:01:02.860" class="transcript_line"> This is what I call Good Deed Day.</div><div id="00:01:05.500" class="transcript_line"> And you can have it any time, but we always have it in November because this is when,</div><div id="00:01:09.060" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s November the 16th this year, when we pick a day and it&#039;s all over the country.</div><div id="00:01:17.460" class="transcript_line"> People do their own things.</div><div id="00:01:18.940" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not for raising money, it&#039;s for doing good deeds, helping others.</div><div id="00:01:24.260" class="transcript_line"> And Cardiff being a small community, we find it difficult, but I run clothes, collecting</div><div id="00:01:29.220" class="transcript_line"> clothes.</div><div id="00:01:30.220" class="transcript_line"> Andrew, who goes out on a Thursday night into town every Thursday, like for the last 30</div><div id="00:01:37.340" class="transcript_line"> years, he goes out at 11, he comes back at 5.</div><div id="00:01:40.660" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been on these trips with him.</div><div id="00:01:42.820" class="transcript_line"> And he serves food and gives clothes, warm clothes to the street people on the streets.</div><div id="00:01:48.740" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s unbelievable.</div><div id="00:01:50.540" class="transcript_line"> Unbelievable.</div><div id="00:01:52.180" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t think that, and it&#039;s troubled, when I went, which was about a year ago, he</div><div id="00:01:57.740" class="transcript_line"> said it&#039;s troubled in the amount of people there now.</div><div id="00:02:00.820" class="transcript_line"> Very, very, very, and people from all walks of life.</div><div id="00:02:04.060" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not necessarily just drug addicts or alcoholics.</div><div id="00:02:07.820" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s people who have fallen on hard times or families have gone and they&#039;re left.</div><div id="00:02:14.340" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite sad.</div><div id="00:02:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Quite sad to see these people.</div><div id="00:02:17.740" class="transcript_line"> So I make sure everybody, we send out notices that they collect all their old clothes, or</div><div id="00:02:24.700" class="transcript_line"> not ever new clothes, that they don&#039;t want winter things.</div><div id="00:02:27.460" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always in the winter.</div><div id="00:02:28.460" class="transcript_line"> And they either bring them to me or take them straight to Andrew, drop them at the synagogue,</div><div id="00:02:33.340" class="transcript_line"> and then I collect.</div><div id="00:02:34.980" class="transcript_line"> But now we&#039;ve actually got, we had a meeting a couple of days ago and we are, there&#039;s a</div><div id="00:02:40.340" class="transcript_line"> couple of other people and myself, and we&#039;re trying to broaden it a bit now.</div><div id="00:02:45.620" class="transcript_line"> And what we&#039;ve decided, we&#039;re doing Mitzvah Day, Good Day Day, with interfaith.</div><div id="00:02:51.020" class="transcript_line"> Not just with the Jewish religion, but doing it with all the religions.</div><div id="00:02:55.980" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve got a meeting coming up in September and emails have been sent out to the different</div><div id="00:03:01.860" class="transcript_line"> leaders and people of the different faiths.</div><div id="00:03:04.340" class="transcript_line"> The Sikhs, Muslims, the, I&#039;m dealing with the Welsh Chapel because my son-in-law&#039;s uncle</div><div id="00:03:13.340" class="transcript_line"> is a minister in the Welsh Chapel.</div><div id="00:03:15.780" class="transcript_line"> Mormons, because they&#039;re very good at sorting things out and that, and Catholic faith.</div><div id="00:03:21.540" class="transcript_line"> So we want to try and get a meeting all together with everybody around the table.</div><div id="00:03:25.380" class="transcript_line"> This will probably take place in the synagogue.</div><div id="00:03:29.380" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ll get ideas together and see what people from other faiths feel like they&#039;d</div><div id="00:03:34.900" class="transcript_line"> like to do.</div><div id="00:03:35.900" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s just happened in the last couple of days.</div><div id="00:03:37.900" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s a bit early.</div><div id="00:03:38.900" class="transcript_line"> So just what the response is going to be for that?</div><div id="00:03:41.900" class="transcript_line"> A bit early.</div><div id="00:03:43.540" class="transcript_line"> They may say, hang on, no, we&#039;re not interested in any of that, you know, but I&#039;m trying to</div><div id="00:03:47.500" class="transcript_line"> get Andrew along so that he can say what he does when he goes out on a Thursday night.</div><div id="00:03:52.740" class="transcript_line"> And there might be people, they do, but I think they sort of collect in a different</div><div id="00:03:57.460" class="transcript_line"> way, you know, their good deeds.</div><div id="00:03:59.340" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ll see what it brings forth.</div></div></p>
