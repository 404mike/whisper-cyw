class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s out of school, and it was Eleanor,</div><div id="00:10:59.340" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d all have our answers on when they&#039;re coming out of school,</div><div id="00:11:02.340" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:11:03.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I do. I do.</div><div id="00:11:05.340" class="transcript_line"> It was, oh, God, it was great.</div><div id="00:11:08.340" class="transcript_line"> We did not know anything about white, it is, and all of that.</div><div id="00:11:12.340" class="transcript_line"> We did not know anything about it until we grew, you know.</div><div id="00:11:15.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:16.340" class="transcript_line"> But we all had to, I mean, tell them the least,</div><div id="00:11:21.340" class="transcript_line"> Joni Carp is, it was white as snow, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:11:24.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:25.340" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d all have our answers all around when they&#039;re coming out,</div><div id="00:11:27.340" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d all play together, and they&#039;d come in the house,</div><div id="00:11:31.340" class="transcript_line"> and answer me, can we get in our house?</div><div id="00:11:34.340" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:11:35.340" class="transcript_line"> Everybody used to eat at everybody&#039;s houses.</div><div id="00:11:38.340" class="transcript_line"> I think the mums must have cooked for school half the time.</div><div id="00:11:45.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I know my friend through the lab,</div><div id="00:11:48.340" class="transcript_line"> I was straight, she used to say, oh, watch them, they&#039;re cooking.</div><div id="00:11:51.340" class="transcript_line"> Remember, they always made apple tarts and all the pastries,</div><div id="00:11:57.340" class="transcript_line"> they were best over.</div><div id="00:11:58.340" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d made little jam tarts and that.</div><div id="00:12:01.340" class="transcript_line"> So, roll it in.</div><div id="00:12:02.340" class="transcript_line"> She came in this day, and she did not remember the gesture of the oven.</div><div id="00:12:06.340" class="transcript_line"> You know what jam&#039;s like, boiling.</div><div id="00:12:09.340" class="transcript_line"> She pinched the jam.</div><div id="00:12:14.340" class="transcript_line"> And she started screaming,</div><div id="00:12:16.340" class="transcript_line"> Mum said, see that, you get to be nicking.</div><div id="00:12:18.340" class="transcript_line"> All you have to ask is if you have one.</div><div id="00:12:22.340" class="transcript_line"> Remember, there was always baking.</div><div id="00:12:24.340" class="transcript_line"> My father was a cook at sea.</div><div id="00:12:27.340" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I was the baby of my family,</div><div id="00:12:30.340" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m the one who got to get their fingers around the inside of the pot.</div><div id="00:12:39.340" class="transcript_line"> You fight to be the one where the pot was almost empty.</div><div id="00:12:44.340" class="transcript_line"> Great mix, Pegs.</div><div id="00:12:48.340" class="transcript_line"> And you used to have the old solid metal griddle thing.</div><div id="00:12:54.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 72.</div><div id="00:12:57.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:58.340" class="transcript_line"> But you know what I mean, that big slab of metal and the Welsh cakes went on it.</div><div id="00:13:03.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the smell.</div><div id="00:13:06.340" class="transcript_line"> My mother&#039;s is round.</div><div id="00:13:08.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it must have been, one of the things that somebody said to me the other day was just</div><div id="00:13:14.340" class="transcript_line"> walking along some of the streets, you know, Sapphire and Millicent,</div><div id="00:13:19.340" class="transcript_line"> you could walk along them, and the smell that was coming out the aisles of the cooking,</div><div id="00:13:25.340" class="transcript_line"> from all the way round the world.</div><div id="00:13:29.340" class="transcript_line"> And where were you from?</div><div id="00:13:31.340" class="transcript_line"> All my family are Barry.</div><div id="00:13:33.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:35.340" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re a Barry family.</div><div id="00:13:37.340" class="transcript_line"> Hinds, Paynes.</div><div id="00:13:41.340" class="transcript_line"> Darwin Hines was my uncle.</div><div id="00:13:44.340" class="transcript_line"> Gwen was my auntie.</div><div id="00:13:46.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, sorry, Gwen.</div><div id="00:13:48.340" class="transcript_line"> When you had them, the club in Barry, we used to go down there.</div><div id="00:13:55.340" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s the thing, Barry and Cardiff, people went back and forth.</div><div id="00:14:01.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, before my friend moved out, she lived in Caddickston.</div><div id="00:14:06.340" class="transcript_line"> I used to go down there a lot.</div><div id="00:14:08.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:09.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, that club in Barry, we used to go down there.</div><div id="00:14:16.340" class="transcript_line"> So, okay, what was your first job then?</div><div id="00:14:20.340" class="transcript_line"> Let me see, oh, the brushworks.</div><div id="00:14:23.340" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:14:25.340" class="transcript_line"> It was good.</div><div id="00:14:26.340" class="transcript_line"> And it was good in old days.</div><div id="00:14:28.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:30.340" class="transcript_line"> The brushworks, oh, I had so many jobs.</div><div id="00:14:33.340" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the brushworks, I worked in the cigar factory, the old cigar factory in Greenstown.</div><div id="00:14:39.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, was that Freeman&#039;s?</div><div id="00:14:42.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:44.340" class="transcript_line"> My mum worked there for a while when she came back to Wales.</div><div id="00:14:47.340" class="transcript_line"> When I worked in the old one in Greenstown, oh, God, it was great.</div><div id="00:14:53.340" class="transcript_line"> But then when I went to the one in Canaas Road, oh my God, it was like being in a, like, in a concentration camp.</div><div id="00:15:07.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, I didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:15:10.340" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:11.340" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t stay there long.</div><div id="00:15:12.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I had all kinds of jobs.</div><div id="00:15:14.340" class="transcript_line"> But then when I went to, I was in a show.</div><div id="00:15:20.340" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:15:22.340" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, because I went, my mother said to us when we were little to Miss Marjory&#039;s dancing class in Greenstown.</div><div id="00:15:33.340" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:34.340" class="transcript_line"> Used to go.</div><div id="00:15:35.340" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it was good.</div><div id="00:15:38.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I went in a show.</div><div id="00:15:40.340" class="transcript_line"> Where was that?</div><div id="00:15:41.340" class="transcript_line"> Down in London?</div><div id="00:15:42.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, we used to do London every three weeks.</div><div id="00:15:45.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;d go like, oh, I went all over the country.</div><div id="00:15:49.340" class="transcript_line"> I was 16, going on 17.</div><div id="00:15:54.340" class="transcript_line"> My mother didn&#039;t want me to go.</div><div id="00:15:55.340" class="transcript_line"> I told her, you&#039;re sent off to dancing school.</div><div id="00:15:57.340" class="transcript_line"> You know, I, you know, I wanted to go.</div><div id="00:16:02.340" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what was that show called?</div><div id="00:16:04.340" class="transcript_line"> Something Goes to Harlem?</div><div id="00:16:06.340" class="transcript_line"> Was that it?</div><div id="00:16:07.340" class="transcript_line"> Harlem Comes to Town.</div><div id="00:16:08.340" class="transcript_line"> Ah, that&#039;s the one.</div><div id="00:16:10.340" class="transcript_line"> No, that was the Netherlands.</div><div id="00:16:11.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was Girls from the Bay went down with that as well, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:15.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:16.340" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m trying to think what house it was called.</div><div id="00:16:22.340" class="transcript_line"> I know that my sister was in Harlem Comes to Town or something in that.</div><div id="00:16:30.340" class="transcript_line"> I forget what.</div><div id="00:16:31.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:32.340" class="transcript_line"> I was 16, 17.</div><div id="00:16:34.340" class="transcript_line"> But it was okay, the experience, you know.</div><div id="00:16:37.340" class="transcript_line"> Because every third week we played like Shackled Bush and Kilburn and all those places.</div><div id="00:16:47.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was okay.</div><div id="00:16:48.340" class="transcript_line"> You got about a bit then?</div><div id="00:16:51.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I met my uncle who was American.</div><div id="00:16:54.340" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t want to say.</div><div id="00:16:56.340" class="transcript_line"> Ah, when was that then?</div><div id="00:17:00.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I was, let me see.</div><div id="00:17:03.340" class="transcript_line"> I got married when I was 20.</div><div id="00:17:07.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 88 now.</div><div id="00:17:09.340" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:17:10.340" class="transcript_line"> So I was 20.</div><div id="00:17:13.340" class="transcript_line"> And I got married.</div><div id="00:17:15.340" class="transcript_line"> And then my uncle went back to the States and she keep on saying, when are you coming?</div><div id="00:17:21.340" class="transcript_line"> When are you coming?</div><div id="00:17:24.340" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t get me.</div><div id="00:17:25.340" class="transcript_line"> So I stayed there a while.</div><div id="00:17:27.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:28.340" class="transcript_line"> And then Massachusetts, we lived.</div><div id="00:17:33.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I, oh, we managed a couple of years before I got pregnant with my son.</div><div id="00:17:43.340" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, no, I&#039;m not having him here.</div><div id="00:17:46.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going home.</div><div id="00:17:48.340" class="transcript_line"> I went home.</div><div id="00:17:50.340" class="transcript_line"> I went home and I&#039;m clean.</div><div id="00:17:53.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I said, right.</div><div id="00:17:56.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, when you coming back?</div><div id="00:17:58.340" class="transcript_line"> When you coming back?</div><div id="00:18:00.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m coming soon.</div><div id="00:18:02.340" class="transcript_line"> He had a dental fly in those days.</div><div id="00:18:05.340" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I had a fly in.</div><div id="00:18:07.340" class="transcript_line"> And he used to say, I&#039;m going to ship and you can&#039;t even swim.</div><div id="00:18:13.340" class="transcript_line"> So I went back with Craig.</div><div id="00:18:17.340" class="transcript_line"> He was about five months old, I should think.</div><div id="00:18:22.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I stayed for a while and then my youngest sister was getting married.</div><div id="00:18:26.340" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, I want to go home for the wedding.</div><div id="00:18:32.340" class="transcript_line"> So he said, you&#039;re always back and forth.</div><div id="00:18:36.340" class="transcript_line"> He said, OK.</div><div id="00:18:37.340" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re not going to stay long.</div><div id="00:18:39.340" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, no.</div><div id="00:18:42.340" class="transcript_line"> I came back for my sister&#039;s wedding and never went back.</div><div id="00:18:49.340" class="transcript_line"> But my sister was my roommate.</div><div id="00:18:53.340" class="transcript_line"> I was there every year in the States.</div><div id="00:18:57.340" class="transcript_line"> I used to work the year into what I am being lately because all this lockdown and the</div><div id="00:19:06.340" class="transcript_line"> hangover of the country.</div><div id="00:19:09.340" class="transcript_line"> Me and Janice, that&#039;s my niece.</div><div id="00:19:12.340" class="transcript_line"> We were there.</div><div id="00:19:14.340" class="transcript_line"> Let me see.</div><div id="00:19:17.340" class="transcript_line"> The one last year was the year before.</div><div id="00:19:20.340" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:19:21.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I got nieces and nephews in California and in Illinois and that.</div><div id="00:19:30.340" class="transcript_line"> My sisters, children.</div><div id="00:19:33.340" class="transcript_line"> So what happened to your husband then?</div><div id="00:19:37.340" class="transcript_line"> You just dumped him.</div><div id="00:19:40.340" class="transcript_line"> Is he what?</div><div id="00:19:42.340" class="transcript_line"> You just dumped him.</div><div id="00:19:44.340" class="transcript_line"> No, I never went back.</div><div id="00:19:51.340" class="transcript_line"> In the late years, I was there all the time.</div><div id="00:19:54.340" class="transcript_line"> And the family, even though I never went back, it&#039;s family was all they were terrific.</div><div id="00:20:01.340" class="transcript_line"> Every year they sent great clothes and different things.</div><div id="00:20:06.340" class="transcript_line"> They were a great family.</div><div id="00:20:09.340" class="transcript_line"> But.</div><div id="00:20:12.340" class="transcript_line"> The trouble is you love the bay, you love Cardiff.</div><div id="00:20:17.340" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:21.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it took me all that time to go.</div><div id="00:20:25.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I went and then oh God, I was so old sick.</div><div id="00:20:32.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh God, I was old sick.</div><div id="00:20:35.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I said to him, oh no, I&#039;m not having a baby yet.</div><div id="00:20:41.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going home.</div><div id="00:20:44.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so I went.</div><div id="00:20:48.340" class="transcript_line"> I come home and he said, oh, when you coming back, when you coming back?</div><div id="00:20:52.340" class="transcript_line"> And I took him back and then I said, my sister&#039;s getting married and I&#039;m going to the wedding.</div><div id="00:20:58.340" class="transcript_line"> And I went back.</div><div id="00:21:01.340" class="transcript_line"> And then, but then.</div><div id="00:21:04.340" class="transcript_line"> My sister was there.</div><div id="00:21:06.340" class="transcript_line"> And then I used to go where we are.</div><div id="00:21:08.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:10.340" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the point is, it&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:21:14.340" class="transcript_line"> Everybody I&#039;ve spoken to who&#039;s from the bay and who&#039;s from Cardiff, they just miss it.</div><div id="00:21:21.340" class="transcript_line"> Even though it&#039;s different, they just miss it.</div><div id="00:21:25.340" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:21:27.340" class="transcript_line"> I might never have any trouble with people in America.</div><div id="00:21:33.340" class="transcript_line"> You know, I mean, I&#039;ve had more than one thing said to me.</div><div id="00:21:37.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:38.340" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:21:39.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:40.340" class="transcript_line"> And in the States, maybe because my accent.</div><div id="00:21:44.340" class="transcript_line"> Well.</div><div id="00:21:45.340" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s like, oh, where you from?</div><div id="00:21:48.340" class="transcript_line"> But also, also maybe, Beryl, because you&#039;ve been brought up in a different place.</div><div id="00:21:55.340" class="transcript_line"> Not prepared to take some of the nonsense that the Americans have had all their life.</div><div id="00:22:03.340" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:22:04.340" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:22:05.340" class="transcript_line"> But see, I didn&#039;t live in the South.</div><div id="00:22:07.340" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:08.340" class="transcript_line"> I lived up in North Massachusetts, you know, one side of Boston.</div><div id="00:22:12.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:13.340" class="transcript_line"> And there was nothing like that.</div><div id="00:22:19.340" class="transcript_line"> But they did.</div><div id="00:22:21.340" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t show, you know.</div><div id="00:22:22.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:23.340" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were more likely afraid of you.</div><div id="00:22:28.340" class="transcript_line"> I mean, my uncle went to, he said, oh, Beryl, you&#039;re going home with you.</div><div id="00:22:39.340" class="transcript_line"> This was before I had came.</div><div id="00:22:41.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:42.340" class="transcript_line"> Because he had to go to, he had isolated tour where you couldn&#039;t, because he&#039;s in the</div><div id="00:22:47.340" class="transcript_line"> airport, where you couldn&#039;t take your wife.</div><div id="00:22:49.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:22:50.340" class="transcript_line"> And in Greenland they were.</div><div id="00:22:51.340" class="transcript_line"> In Greenland.</div><div id="00:22:52.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:22:53.340" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, you&#039;re not going home with you.</div><div id="00:22:56.340" class="transcript_line"> Because he knew if I went home, I would be.</div><div id="00:22:59.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll do for my friend.</div><div id="00:23:01.340" class="transcript_line"> And my friend, we went to school with, she lived in Arizona.</div><div id="00:23:06.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:07.340" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, come down here, babe.</div><div id="00:23:11.340"
