    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I just have to introduce this at the top Bob, that&#039;s okay. So I&#039;m Marcia O&#039;Mahony and I&#039;m here with Simon Hicks and we&#039;re here today to interview Hickman, sorry Simon, Simon Hickman and we&#039;re here today to interview Bob Trett and it&#039;s Bob Trett, is that right?</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> T-R-E-double T</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay and we&#039;re at Kaleon and it is Thursday April 25th 2019. So I&#039;m just going to pop that down there Bob. It is going. Yeah, there we go.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder Bob if we can start off, Simon and I are going to pitch in together.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Sure.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> If you could just introduce yourself, who you are, your background.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, well my name is Bob Trett. I wasn&#039;t born here but I used to be a curator at different museums and I was employed as the curator at the Newport Museum and Art Gallery in 1983.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to try and remember that exactly. And I had a double job, one was being the curator which had been like his administratively in charge in the museum and art gallery and to a lesser degree of tradiga house when he was in the council&#039;s control.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I had a very good curator there anyway so I didn&#039;t really have to do much. But the museum itself had moved in the 1960s and they were still in the process of re-displaying it.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The art gallery was fine, it had been completed but most of the museum needed re-displaying so one of the first jobs I was given by the council was to re-display the museum.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There were various keepers there, staff, very clever people who knew a lot and in charge of collections some of them had been there for a long time.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main collections were, if you like, the natural sciences including geology, a good geology collection, birds, in fact including I noticed the last ibis shot on the seven levels, way back sometime.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had the natural history collections, various types of stuff, a lot of it, stuffed animals of course.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a very good archeology collection, mostly Roman from the Roman town of Coent, which is on the Etchley levels, from excavations in the 1900s.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a very good social history collection, local history collection, well still do of course, and then of course the art collections which were on the floor above.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all linked in pretty well as well. So my job first of all was to start with re-displays and the first thing we did was to re-display the medieval collection.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of that&#039;s now gone but we did that because a lot of fresh medieval material was coming in, places like Skinfriff Castle and from Penhowar Castle and from Lanternie Priory and so on.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a can-do-why collection. So anyway, so that was displayed, a lot of help from Caddo and other people to put it together.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the next section we did was on the local history collections, which started in sort of 18th century really, included the Chartists of course, because there&#039;s a good Chartist collection.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then mainly on Newport Industry and Civic Life and so on. A lot of that is still there, it&#039;s adapted a bit now.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course the port was there and they&#039;re still working and so on. So there was quite a lot of material which we couldn&#039;t show but some of which we could for the very first time.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we did the archaeology. Well the first part of the archaeology was the prehistory. And they&#039;d already had some cases put in.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And we reckon there was about, the tools weren&#039;t very secure, but there was about 13 items in the collections from prehistory of Gwent, not just Newport.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was about 13 cases to put them in. So we were very short on material.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And so what happened was that we started to cultivate lots of metal detectors. Some of them had actually been on the levels and out there.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I became involved with the Glamour Gwent Archaeological Trust. They went out and they were a great help.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But the man that gave the most help to us, because he came in with a load of iron-edge pottery, which had my eyeballs going out like this, was a man called Derek Upton.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Derek I think lived near Sudbrook. He was born out there. And even as a child he used to say he would wander over the seawall, almost as a toddler, and wander around to the mudflats and then came back and still alive.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was a fascinating guy. We came very, very close. So whenever he found anything he would ring up and we would go out and have a look.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And various other colleagues and volunteers I had helping me, including a gentleman called Steve Parry, who was very brilliant at, he was a sort of archaeologist, come eco man, but he was very brilliant at spotting things.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So Derek would point out stuff. So I went down and had a little investigation on the channel where all this iron-edge pottery was coming out of. And these two went walking along the foreshore.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> This was, what&#039;s never the place, I&#039;ll forget. Anyway, they finished up a place called Chappeltump, which was a couple of miles away.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They came running back and said, we&#039;ve got a prehistoric platform there.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> This is out in the estuary.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> This was in the estuary. And all sorts of stuff. So I went and had a look and there they had hurdles which had been laid down and were pegged in to the ground. But of course no idea of dates.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But we had contacts with the University in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And we managed to get a whole series of radio comm dates done and things and this turned out to be Iron Age.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember offhand the date because I&#039;ve been retired for so many years, but anyway it was Iron Age before the Romans.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And alongside it they started finding Bronze-Edge pottery.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And we found a Bronze-Edge working site which they had bits of flint obviously were brought in, big pits in which they were burning stuff.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I even found a little bone piercing pin which had been manufactured.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the stuff from Chappeltump was quite important.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it just snowballed from there.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> This was at, oh I&#039;ve forgotten the name of the place now, there&#039;s a pill down there, Magor Pill, which I started out from.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And Derek found all sorts of other stuff out there of all different periods.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we then followed him to Goldcliff.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went out to Goldcliff because he was discovering Mesolithic, some early prehistoric material coming up.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Broken bones and stuff that had been burnt.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was obviously an island there and trees had been burnt off.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But there are lots of things like boar and wild deer and in the piece of a wild wolf, I think.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were all mixed in with the charcoal and stuff.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So again we were able to get it dated.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And with some help from the University and the Trust, the Morgwain Archaeological Trust, we managed to start some surveys off there as well.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So this was all happening very well.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the next thing, we walked on a bit further and we started finding one thing after another after another after another.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the most fascinating things, which we found all the way along the foreshore, was stumps of trees or trees which had fallen over.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you got there, you could be out there and you could be thinking you were actually in the forest.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> If you just look down, you can see where all the trees were.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So you know exactly how it was.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the estuary is made up of layers of peat and layers of alluvium or clay.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a whole sammage of them.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And each tide drops extra mud down.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course you get fierce storms and everything gets wiped away.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is why all these things were being discovered.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a great time going through this.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we went a bit further on from Gouldcliffe, as I was saying.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And we bumped into more fishing traps, all sorts of stuff.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we suddenly found a hut.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s just the base of a hut.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But it had partitions inside it and it had a reed floor.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And that turned out to be our nature.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was part of a small settlement.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There were several of them around there.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think people were probably using them for cattle.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was really far too much for us to cope with on our own.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then because the next thing happened, Derek rang up very excitedly and said,</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It had just been off Nash near the mouth of the usk.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come across, in the lower levels, embedded in the clay, a set of human footprints.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I mean we were busy photographing everything.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So by this point everybody knew what was happening.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So all the archaeological bigwigs from around gathered together.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had a meeting at the University and the National Museum were there as well,</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> because they had found some additional items there.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d found an aurochs, which was quite interesting, at Nash as well,</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> which is like a wild cow.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was a massive big thing.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Bits of it are on display in the museum.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, most of what&#039;s on display in the museum and the new prehistoric displays</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> came from the discoveries in the 7th century,</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> together with some more material which was found by metal detector users inland as well.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So from having virtually nothing, we&#039;ve changed it up in quite an important connection</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> covering a whole of prehistory, including hand axes,</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> which are the earliest type of artefact you tend to find, and very rare.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a couple that had been brought down by Glacier Laction, I imagine, into the estuary.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re on display in the museum.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the National Museum were a bit jealous of all this,</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> but nevertheless everyone was very cooperative.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So nobody had really gone out and done what you had done?</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody really, no.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d been one hut circle which had been excavated at Chapel Tump,</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> perhaps known as Chapel Tump 1, a few years earlier by Stephen Oldhouse Green,</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> who was the prehistorian at the National Museum of Wales.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;d been a sort of wall off.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> There was other people working on the geology and the river flows and tidal things and all this.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the whole area was SSSI as well, so there was that aspect of it all.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But nobody really looked there.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d looked on the other side, because obviously at Glastonbury,</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> where, I can&#039;t remember what it&#039;s called now, it&#039;s because I&#039;m getting old.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, there were all sorts of stuff come up from the wetlands on the other side.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And here we are.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Somerset Louse, yes.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> A little booklet like this shows the sort of stuff that they were fighting.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We were fighting similar things as well.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There was an enormously important site there, whose name, well near Glastonbury.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the sort of stuff that was known about.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But obviously the same thing was happening on our side.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> After the prehistory on the mudflats into tidal area,</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> they started finding it in profusion on the Londonward side of the seawall.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> In particular, we found, when they were doing some excavations of the Col de Cot Castle,</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> part of a huge plank which was part of a Bronze Age boat and various other things,</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> which was done through the Archaeological Trust.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But then another one they found was a Roman boat,</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> a virtually complete small Roman boat called the Barlands Farm Boat,</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> when they were putting it in Guernierot Park.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So with the help of the Trust who were digging it,</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and the Conservator we had, Kate Hunter, we excavated that,</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and that came in the museum and that&#039;s in store with the Remains of Newport ship.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Other boats had been, we also discovered there was about an 1800 canal boat up at Newbridge, up the Usk.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That was very early and all handmade, it was very interesting,</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> but most of that was now gone, disappeared.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s it gone?</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was excavated, and it was, you know, how big a canal boat is.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They did it by putting a bund in the river,</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and they pumped it all out and there was this boat, and it was excavated and recorded.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they were thinking about what to do with it,</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and just at that moment they had one of these flash floods,</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> so the whole boat lifted out of the water, not the water, the river bed,</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and was taken over the bund and floated down several hundred yards,</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> so it smashed up against the bank.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the man who was advising us, was a man called Professor John McGrail,</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> well-known eminent sort of maritime archaeologist.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, well, it&#039;s actually not a bad thing,</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> because he can now look at all the bits individually, which is what they did.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And the bits were then transferred to Newport to an old warehouse that&#039;s now gone,</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were recorded and a report published.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Bits were left in the museum, and I don&#039;t know whether,</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think most of them are probably there and kept.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> How old was it?</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> About 1800.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But in fact it was all handmade, and it was flat-bottomed.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was so similar in many ways to the Roman boat,</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> the way the fittings worked and so on, that that was the interesting part of it.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it like a tro, then?</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, it was a canal boat, you know, pointy at both ends,</div><div id="00:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was obviously towed from a towing post up the river.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it probably had a small mast as well, probably from up to Newbridge.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was stuff used to come down the river from Newbridge to Caleon and then on to Newport.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And when it was abandoned, because it was old,</div><div id="00:17:03.000" class="transcript_line"> they just put it onto the river bankers to help the river defences.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how we found it.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the first one that created quite a stir.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> When was this? What sort of period was this? Was this the early 80s?</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was probably built around about 1800 when the first canals were also coming in,</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> although it seems to be no river craft rather than a canal boat.</div><div id="00:17:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t sort of fit in with the early Monmouthshire canal boats.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was found in the early 1980s, was it?</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ve got slides.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The trouble is that I used to know this off my heart and I forget it all,</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;ve got the record still.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of the stuff went into the museum, the museum archives as well.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, so that was Tridentic Boat.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was the Roman boat, the Barlands Farm Boat.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was the Caldecott Bronze Age Planks, but enormous.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then one medieval boat was found at Magor Pill.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And quite frankly, we&#039;d got enough going on to do that.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So the National Museum were very keen to take that project on.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So they did.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They did.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And what remained of that boat went into the National Museum collections,</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> not on show, but it&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, in essence, there was almost a unique collection of early boats</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> of different periods that had been found.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And it would be nice at some point for them to all merge together and be displayed.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, the duel in the crown didn&#039;t happen until 2002 when the Newport ship,</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s a later story, I was in the museum until about 2000.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had a steady programme of material coming in and recording it.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were sort of in the early stages of computerising records.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So all that came in.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came there, there were handwritten cards and nice little volumes of accessions</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> with little hand-drawn pictures in some places next to a description.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And now, of course, it&#039;s all digital and everything else.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So totally different goal game.</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, the photography, the fact that you get digital photography has changed everything.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So all the old photographs, probably not similar ones I&#039;ve got actually,</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> but have now been digitalised or on archives, in the archives, on the museum or wherever.</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, the other aspect was a lot of publication went on as well.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my involvement.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But the Newport ship, I think you described it as the duel in the crown.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us about that? Were you there when it was discovered?</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> At what point did you get involved?</div><div id="00:20:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s quite interesting because when I retired from the museum,</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved here and I was mainly doing guided tours around Killian.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was still involved with the Glenborne Quintine Archive Archaeological Trust based in Swansea.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And for many years I&#039;ve been the chairman of the trustees.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had a very close link with the staff there.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were called in to do a watching brief on a piece of land,</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> which was where the New Riverfront Theatre was going to be.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they phoned me quite excitedly because Kate Howell, who was the girl that was running it at the time,</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> said they&#039;d found some curved timbers just underneath where the orchestra pit,</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> we know all this anyway.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were quite excited.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it looked like it was a boat or a ship, but nobody knew how big it was or exactly what date it was.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And it had a sort of key over the top.</div><div id="00:21:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was probably pre-1800s, but that&#039;s about all you could say.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So after some argument and debate with the council, they tried to keep very quiet about it.</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did they try to keep quiet about it?</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, because if this turned out to be a big, massive thing, it would hold the whole project up.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t insured for this sort of hold-up.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it could have cost them, well, it did in the end, millions.</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So they kept very quiet about it.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course I knew because through the trust and also because my friendship with the staff in the museum was still there</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> because I used to go in and help them and tell them where things were and so on.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was agreed that they could excavate at least part of it, which they did.</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And what they found was that it stretched from one side of where the orchestra pit was to the other side,</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> a little bit missing on either end beyond this or massive big iron-covered dams had been put in.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But most of it was inside, you know, if you were going to plan an excavation and you had to put a pit in,</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> you would almost put it exactly where it is, maybe a bit longer just to get the stern and the brow in.</div><div id="00:22:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But nobody still knew what the date was until one of our colleagues, Nigel Naling, who&#039;s now a professor,</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I actually interviewed him for a job on the 7th Street a long time ago, but he&#039;s gone up in the world.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s a dentrotron and he was able to date a particular timber mixed up with it to 1457 or 8 or 9 or sometime around about then.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course that made it internationally important.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In the end it was discovered that his timber, I think, was a repair done in England or proposed repair on part of the ship.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But he found that, you know, bits had been repaired in England, but it took him a long time to get an actual date for the ship,</div><div id="00:23:54.000" class="transcript_line"> which would seem to have been built in what I call the Basque country in northern Spain.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the feeling? What was the sense? Was there great excitement?</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, there was a lot of excitement. But of course most of the public didn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But the word was getting around and so I was told by a reporter when it did blow, you know,</div><div id="00:24:21.000" class="transcript_line"> that he&#039;d rang up the council and they were saying, well, what boat is this?</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they were denying its existence. But in the end the truth came out.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there a risk that they could have covered it back over them? Was that the...?</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think, no, they couldn&#039;t even do that because what they would have had to have done was allow them to record sections of the ship,</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> remove a few of the timbers and the rest would have been bulldozed away because it was in the orchestra pit.</div><div id="00:24:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was in the way. So we couldn&#039;t save it at all.</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, the news got out and I was sort of interviewed by the reporter from the South Wales Argus, Mike Buckingham,</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and he explained to him what was going on because the trust staff weren&#039;t allowed to say anything,</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the museum staff weren&#039;t allowed to say anything, council wouldn&#039;t say anything.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I was a sort of volunteer in the know, I could actually tell them.</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So, and then... Did you get a lot of flak for that then?</div><div id="00:25:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they were very happy with me, particularly. But there&#039;s nothing they could do about it.</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was just too important to pretend it didn&#039;t exist and they didn&#039;t know what they were doing.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there a sense that the people of the city in the area were behind the project?</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, because what happened was immediately it got out.</div><div id="00:25:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Me, mainly through Charlie Ferris and other people, they set up a meeting and I was asked to talk,</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> so I was one of the speakers and they had international speakers coming along, you know.</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was held in the Dolmen Theatre and various things were said.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the end, it didn&#039;t seem to get anywhere. I said, well look, as far as I understand it,</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> the archaeology trust, they haven&#039;t got any other option,</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> the contractors will have to move out in so many weeks&#039; time and then the project will be destroyed.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So then that gelled them. So then it became the Save Our Ship campaign</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and eventually the Friends of the Newport ship.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And they mounted a 24-hour vigil having people tooting their horns and processions.</div><div id="00:26:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was one of the most successful, I have some very clever people help me,</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> the most successful, all of the earliest internet protest campaigns.</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they actually brought down, of course, didn&#039;t take much to do that,</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the local councils&#039; websites and everything else, plus I think they were a shock on to the Welsh Assembly.</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d get people writing from, or coming in from all over the world, literally,</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, from Australia, from America, obviously a lot from Europe as well,</div><div id="00:27:39.000" class="transcript_line"> including virtually all the eminent ship archaeologists as well, Margaret Rools of this world, you know,</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and these sort of people. And so the campaign was huge.</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was obviously very clear to the council they had to do something.</div><div id="00:27:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had a discussion with the Caddw and then with the National Assembly for Wales.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were offered, I think it was about three and a half million pounds,</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> to pay for the excavation of the ship and the eventual display of the ship.</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were told they had to have somewhere where they could put it.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So a big idea, without consulting any of the archaeologists or museum people,</div><div id="00:28:25.000" class="transcript_line"> was they&#039;d build another big pit within the site of the theatre,</div><div id="00:28:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and that would be used for displaying the Newport ship.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, a bit dubious about it when I heard about it, but this is what was proposed.</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they then agreed, you know, the campaign was won.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The leader of the council, Sir Harry Jones, was seen down there, smiles all around, you know,</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> we are going to take it up. And they had to take it up piece by piece, you know, you couldn&#039;t lift it out.</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was, it had lots of officer help, including British Steel as it was then, you know,</div><div id="00:29:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and then there was a warehouse there when they took the tanks of water down there,</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> although they put the timbers down there which had to be kept in water.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Interestingly enough, they had to get water on this site and put in these big tanks in a large empty shed they had there.</div><div id="00:29:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And they got the water out of the local reams.</div><div id="00:29:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we went and then looked at it, it was absolutely infested with small shrimps and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> which was okay, it didn&#039;t do too much harm.</div><div id="00:29:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And the timbers are so strong anyway.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the end they got some goldfish in and somebody managed to get a baby sturgeon,</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> which over the years I saw grow to about that, from about that.</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And they left it, you know, selling until everything was washed and cleaned as part of the conservation process.</div><div id="00:30:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was a huge wrangle because the director of the trust had told them</div><div id="00:30:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and he hoped to get the ship out in about six weeks, which was clearly impossible.</div><div id="00:30:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It took about six months.</div><div id="00:30:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean, without going into too many details, they said, okay, you go ahead and have the six months.</div><div id="00:30:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t very happy about it.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They being the council?</div><div id="00:30:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The council, yes.</div><div id="00:30:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But it went ahead and it was successful.</div><div id="00:30:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in actual fact, it was very quick.</div><div id="00:30:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, if you think of another site as big as that, you could be there for years.</div><div id="00:31:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But they did it in about six months, cut it out.</div><div id="00:31:05.000" class="transcript_line"> How many, what were the numbers of the people working there?</div><div id="00:31:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They varied from 30 to 40 at the most, but they varied.</div><div id="00:31:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had specialists came in as well, like Nigel and others.</div><div id="00:31:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I used to go along and annoy them because I was allowed to go in and photograph them,</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> which they were grateful for afterwards because when they were reassembling it,</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d taken photographs of timbers which had been misplaced so they could work out where they went.</div><div id="00:31:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was all right.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a long job.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was really there on a supporting level.</div><div id="00:31:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t really taking part in the excavation or the recording or the conservation process,</div><div id="00:31:49.000" class="transcript_line"> which were all sort of, you know, breaking new ground all the time, particularly in the recording.</div><div id="00:31:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Conservation had been done before, but this was new techniques coming in as well.</div><div id="00:32:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Unlike the Mary Rose, for instance, this preserved much better and quicker</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> because of course it was all in bits and you could treat all the timbers individually.</div><div id="00:32:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the fines kept coming up.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I got involved in looking at the fines as well.</div><div id="00:32:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course nobody knew exactly what the ship was.</div><div id="00:32:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It was assumed it was a British ship.</div><div id="00:32:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of them traded from Bristol, but it was a vast one.</div><div id="00:32:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably thought at that time to be about 300 tonnes or could carry about 300 tonnes.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They found barrel remains and everything else, including marks of merchants and so I was delving into them.</div><div id="00:32:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were a lot of the timbers there were obviously for rebuilding the ship</div><div id="00:32:56.000" class="transcript_line"> because they had been badly damaged and massive timbers, and that&#039;s the ones that Nigel managed to date.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was having a think.</div><div id="00:33:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking, well, who on earth could afford to either repair or build a ship of this size?</div><div id="00:33:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So thanks to Newport, they gave me a bit of money to do some research.</div><div id="00:33:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I went around researching various places and I did a lot on Medieval Newport, which I found out for the first time.</div><div id="00:33:30.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things I discovered was that at the time the Newport ship was in Newport.</div><div id="00:33:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It had been towed in there because it certainly didn&#039;t seem to be a Newport ship as such.</div><div id="00:33:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It was right in the middle of the Walls of the Roses.</div><div id="00:33:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And at that time the man we all call Warwick the Kingmaker had actually succeeded in capturing Newport</div><div id="00:33:56.000" class="transcript_line"> as part of territories of the then Earl or the late Earl of Pembrokes, as he soon became, mooting his head.</div><div id="00:34:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was all taken over by Warwick.</div><div id="00:34:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And by looking through the archives, particularly in Warwick themselves and elsewhere,</div><div id="00:34:17.000" class="transcript_line"> we were able to find out quite a lot of information, including the fact that somebody was paid to bring the ship to Newport,</div><div id="00:34:29.000" class="transcript_line"> a ship to Newport at that time, and other people were paid to repair the ship at Newport.</div><div id="00:34:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a similar size and it was in 1469, which is spot on the date.</div><div id="00:34:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So with a lot of arguing, it didn&#039;t prove anything, according to some, but I think the experts as a whole realised</div><div id="00:34:51.000" class="transcript_line"> there was nothing else they could compare it to.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m pretty certain, you can never say never, but 99.9% certain that the references were relating to Newport ships.</div><div id="00:35:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was able to bring in this royal connection and the Walls of the Roses connection, which is what you&#039;d expect.</div><div id="00:35:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And this led to all sorts of other discoveries of the historical nature in particular.</div><div id="00:35:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my contribution, if you like.</div><div id="00:35:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you describe the Newport ship as the jewel in your crane, or are there other things that you would consider?</div><div id="00:35:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Micro? Well, it&#039;s certainly the biggest individual item I&#039;ve ever had to deal with, if you don&#039;t count buildings.</div><div id="00:35:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve been on sites all over the place. I was up on Hadrian&#039;s Wall, down in the Pyrenees,</div><div id="00:35:51.000" class="transcript_line"> involved in the fishbowl on Roman Palace excavations, and I&#039;ve discovered lots of different things in my different jobs</div><div id="00:36:00.000" class="transcript_line"> just by going out and looking. But it was interesting with this, because by using a location where the ship was found,</div><div id="00:36:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was able to prove, really for the first time, that we knew that Newport was a walled town.</div><div id="00:36:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that was another project which went from there, and I don&#039;t want to prove where the original Merringer&#039;s House was,</div><div id="00:36:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and what the layout was, and so on and so forth. So I became Mr. Medieval Newport, very much so.</div><div id="00:36:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But even the eminent archaeologists had to, or historians at that point, had to agree and be fair. They got tremendous backing.</div><div id="00:36:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Professionally, not just the ship, but all those other finds along the estuary, it must be an incredibly rich period to be working in.</div><div id="00:36:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It is, but there are two things. One is that if you drop something in mud, it gradually becomes anaerobic, there&#039;s no air in there, it gets preserved.</div><div id="00:37:08.000" class="transcript_line"> For instance, at Caldecott, they&#039;re even finding ladybirds mixed up with it, with, you know, the kiln still red with a bit of black spots on.</div><div id="00:37:19.000" class="transcript_line"> When we were digging out the trackway, which we call the Upton Trackway, that had leaves, twigs and very fine material, because it was buried and it wasn&#039;t disturbed.</div><div id="00:37:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And nobody knew it was there, and there it remained until you got one of these really fierce storms, which could happen thousands of years later, which exposed it.</div><div id="00:37:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was the Upton Trackway? What was that?</div><div id="00:37:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was our first trackway we discovered with Derek Upton. We called it the Upton Trackway because it was after him.</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Near Sudbrook, was that in the estuary?</div><div id="00:37:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was near Chapel Tunk, where the other side was. It was near Magor Pill. That was one of the first things we discovered.</div><div id="00:38:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, and all the miscellaneous stuff, yes, it was incredibly rich. There are all sorts of other fascinating things.</div><div id="00:38:16.000" class="transcript_line"> For instance, there&#039;s an area which goes all the way along the side of the Wendt Noot levels. We were looking elsewhere as well, but along the Wendt Noot level, you could go and you could pick up sort of spitfire shells, you know, using it as a firing range for practicing spitfires.</div><div id="00:38:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, there was a spitfire that was buried there, and Derek helped to dig out.</div><div id="00:38:43.000" class="transcript_line"> In the same area, you could find sort of 19th century lead shot. So they&#039;re using it as a firing range there.</div><div id="00:38:52.000" class="transcript_line"> From the prehistoric period, we were finding things like arrowheads. So, you know, it&#039;s sort of the same purpose, being there, even though the conditions in the land, you know, the sea levels have gone up and down.</div><div id="00:39:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it&#039;s been wooded, sometimes the floods have come in and compressed it and the peat, and so it all became mudflaps again. So there&#039;s a whole series of dynamics going on there.</div><div id="00:39:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a massively complicated area and lots of people looking at that sort of side of it.</div><div id="00:39:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You said that you found, out there in the estuary, you found ancient putters and ranks?</div><div id="00:39:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep. Yes, I&#039;ll have to go up to the den and dig out some of the photographs just to show you.</div><div id="00:39:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, a lot of them are obviously now recorded.</div><div id="00:39:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I must have seven levels of research committees set up, which I no longer are involved in because I&#039;m sort of retired too far now to get back into that side of it.</div><div id="00:40:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And lots of these discoveries are published in there and published in different magazines.</div><div id="00:40:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And lots were in the papers. And a selection you can see obviously still in the museum in Newport.</div><div id="00:40:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s only a tiny tip of the iceberg to what was discovered.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were... Sorry, sorry. Oh, sorry. I was just going to ask, because of course you&#039;ve had very deep involvement in Newport heritage for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:40:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Prior to the Newport ship discovery, did you detect that there was a sort of long-term build-up of frustration with the council&#039;s approach to heritage, or was it a very sudden thing in 2002?</div><div id="00:40:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was that specific point. To be fair to the council, when I arrived in 1983 they&#039;d just built a new museum, well, they&#039;d built a new museum.</div><div id="00:40:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They were in the process of wanting it updated and improved. And I got tremendous support.</div><div id="00:41:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course they did the same thing with Traditia House. I mean, they took on that when it was in danger of being demolished.</div><div id="00:41:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And now with the National Trust, of course. There was some money around. So I wouldn&#039;t say that was the case at all.</div><div id="00:41:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There could be a bit, on the planning side, there could be a bit bad, in a sense that they didn&#039;t seem to realise that a lot of the historic buildings they had in the town, which disappeared.</div><div id="00:41:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And basically anything that could bring a job took precedence over any of the cultural side. But that was a planning issue really.</div><div id="00:41:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Not supporting the actual facilities which we had was different.</div><div id="00:41:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And that attitude obviously has changed over the years. And now there&#039;s very strict planning guidance terms.</div><div id="00:42:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ve got a very good team, or did have, when they had people looking at planning matters and so on.</div><div id="00:42:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t see that as a particular problem. But no, there was no problems at all until this bloody boat came up.</div><div id="00:42:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh well, I have to delete bloody. Because that was holding up another key project.</div><div id="00:42:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And so when it came to the Arts Centre or Arts Theatre, all this dubious yet another boat, there was no question there,</div><div id="00:42:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and mine&#039;s just keep quiet about it and get it out of the way as quickly as possible. And they failed.</div><div id="00:42:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You stuck your neck out there in the bit really, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:42:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had, they couldn&#039;t, in fact, when I got my pension they couldn&#039;t do anything about that.</div><div id="00:42:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But what they did do, and that was about that time, was that when the Royal Gwent Archaeological Trust,</div><div id="00:43:06.000" class="transcript_line"> who hadn&#039;t been involved in saying anything about it, finished their contract, they said, right, we&#039;re not going to pay you.</div><div id="00:43:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They said, you&#039;ve said six weeks, ten six months, you know, we&#039;re not paying you after the six weeks.</div><div id="00:43:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This was despite the fact that they&#039;d never said anything about that before.</div><div id="00:43:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d been monitoring all their records, including how much they were paying staff and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:43:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And it nearly brought the Trust down. So I was very involved in that.</div><div id="00:43:37.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I&#039;ve still got the papers, although the more sensitive ones I put in the embargo on and sent to the Gwent Archives.</div><div id="00:43:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, it was a very nasty business and it was a, you know, it went on for ages.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And fortunately, all those involved in it have now gone.</div><div id="00:43:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And it didn&#039;t help them anyway because they&#039;d been told by their conservator, Kate Hunter,</div><div id="00:44:02.000" class="transcript_line"> that the gallery they were putting in and it would not fit the ship.</div><div id="00:44:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The experts had come along and said it wouldn&#039;t fit the ship.</div><div id="00:44:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Staff at the museum elsewhere were told under threat of losing their jobs and discipline.</div><div id="00:44:19.000" class="transcript_line"> If they said anything other than the party line, that they were for the chop.</div><div id="00:44:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But we knew it wouldn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:44:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was only after most of these people had seen the writing on the wall and left.</div><div id="00:44:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I won&#039;t mention any names, but they appointed a new guy who was then a sort of museum services manager.</div><div id="00:44:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s Mike Lewis, who is still there and has gone through hell of a way, you know, with all the cut packs and everything else.</div><div id="00:45:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;s kept the project going and he backed the conservator and backed the other people.</div><div id="00:45:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he convinced, not in that but he convinced the council that they were right.</div><div id="00:45:11.000" class="transcript_line"> What they were told was wrong.</div><div id="00:45:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to a meeting much later on and there were some councillors there.</div><div id="00:45:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them would just glare at me.</div><div id="00:45:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a political, you see.</div><div id="00:45:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of them, a sweet old guy, said, will our ship fit in that basement?</div><div id="00:45:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, some of it would.</div><div id="00:45:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to be diplomatic.</div><div id="00:45:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But the message got out because obviously they&#039;d heard it at sort of highest possible levels.</div><div id="00:45:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But they just wouldn&#039;t take advice.</div><div id="00:45:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they paid the price.</div><div id="00:45:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we paid the price and they&#039;ve just gone on and elsewhere.</div><div id="00:45:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, there&#039;s been total change around in regime.</div><div id="00:46:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Support is there.</div><div id="00:46:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And the big problem these days is austerity.</div><div id="00:46:06.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s support for the project.</div><div id="00:46:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The support is there.</div><div id="00:46:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve got to get money to do it.</div><div id="00:46:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you generally think the outlook for the ship is quite good at the moment?</div><div id="00:46:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I think so.</div><div id="00:46:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it will be re-displayed in my lifetime is another matter.</div><div id="00:46:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And last I heard, and I&#039;m not really up to date with it, I&#039;ll have to talk to Martin Lewis,</div><div id="00:46:29.000" class="transcript_line"> the idea was to sort of put it on the top of the present museum or to that building.</div><div id="00:46:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Because one of the troubles about having a new museum and new display,</div><div id="00:46:42.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not just the cost of putting it in, the capital cost, if you like,</div><div id="00:46:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because that can usually be found from lottery heritage or whatever.</div><div id="00:46:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the running costs.</div><div id="00:46:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course if it&#039;s part of an existing project, which is why they want it in the front,</div><div id="00:46:59.000" class="transcript_line"> there are people there.</div><div id="00:47:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And the building is there.</div><div id="00:47:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s sort of much more economical.</div><div id="00:47:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, I won&#039;t, but there were huge problems and very vicious things going on,</div><div id="00:47:15.000" class="transcript_line"> which I perhaps better not go into now.</div><div id="00:47:19.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it for Chewitus that you met Derek Upton?</div><div id="00:47:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Very few Chewitus.</div><div id="00:47:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Derek just happened to come into the museum when we were wanting material.</div><div id="00:47:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, where did you find it, Derek?</div><div id="00:47:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he took us out there.</div><div id="00:47:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And from then on, he&#039;d been telling people about what he&#039;d been finding for years,</div><div id="00:47:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and the odd things which had been taken normally by the National Museum of Dunnely.</div><div id="00:47:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d accepted, you know, bronze spearhead, this sort of thing.</div><div id="00:47:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But nobody had really wanted to go out with him, you know.</div><div id="00:47:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just went everywhere together.</div><div id="00:47:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We became really close friends and went round to his house</div><div id="00:48:00.000" class="transcript_line"> and heard all these rambles and recollections.</div><div id="00:48:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was divorced.</div><div id="00:48:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had his son Dean living with him.</div><div id="00:48:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said one of the reasons divorce went through was because of his collecting.</div><div id="00:48:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And including he had found this sort of big cannonball,</div><div id="00:48:24.000" class="transcript_line"> which he&#039;d brought in and put by the back door as a store stop.</div><div id="00:48:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And thought nothing about it until he started weeping something out of it.</div><div id="00:48:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And eventually, somehow, somebody in the know said,</div><div id="00:48:39.000" class="transcript_line"> well, I think you should get the bomb squad in there.</div><div id="00:48:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They did. And it had been full of nitroglycerin.</div><div id="00:48:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So maybe she had a point.</div><div id="00:48:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But he collected all this stuff.</div><div id="00:48:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He had, you know, masses of it he gave to us.</div><div id="00:48:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Very generous with it.</div><div id="00:48:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But he wasn&#039;t an archaeologist. He was just an enthusiast.</div><div id="00:48:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was out there. You know, he lived his life there.</div><div id="00:49:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he worked in a steelworks one time.</div><div id="00:49:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But what he was, was he was the honorary warden for the Seven Estuary</div><div id="00:49:09.000" class="transcript_line"> for the Gwent Wildlife Trust, which incidentally I went on to be the deputy general as well.</div><div id="00:49:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he was involved in Magelmarsh and all these projects and in the Seven Estuary.</div><div id="00:49:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So he became Mr. Seven Estuary and knew a lot about it.</div><div id="00:49:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, in the course of that, he got into the archaeology.</div><div id="00:49:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the natural historians and the ecologists were a bit worried</div><div id="00:49:35.000" class="transcript_line"> that he was going to sort of give up all that side of it and do it.</div><div id="00:49:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, they&#039;re so interrelated that it was just marvelous.</div><div id="00:49:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And much later on, I was invited by the Gwent Wildlife Trust to do a survey</div><div id="00:49:52.000" class="transcript_line"> from the historical archaeological point of I think 14 of their sites, including Magelmarsh.</div><div id="00:49:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So that, you know, I found a lot more information that way.</div><div id="00:50:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That was after I retired from the museum.</div><div id="00:50:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So were the reams, you know, a rich source of archaeology?</div><div id="00:50:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:50:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Did anything emerge from them though?</div><div id="00:50:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, lots of stuff.</div><div id="00:50:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, it&#039;s a matter of finding it.</div><div id="00:50:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, if it&#039;s in the ground, how do you know it&#039;s there?</div><div id="00:50:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, when Gwent Euro Park went in near, what&#039;s her name, the hill there,</div><div id="00:50:32.000" class="transcript_line"> near Magor anyway, that&#039;s when the Balmonds Farm boat came up.</div><div id="00:50:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But a bit further on, they found huge pits and remains of a hard-aged settlement there.</div><div id="00:50:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There had been obviously monastic settlements on there.</div><div id="00:50:51.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people got very interested in the training of the levels and the sea walls</div><div id="00:50:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and lots of arguments even today on the dating of things.</div><div id="00:51:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And so there was a lot of training going on.</div><div id="00:51:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly on the Ramblin levels, which is the other side of Newport,</div><div id="00:51:08.000" class="transcript_line"> the University of Reading got very actively involved in doing sedimentology.</div><div id="00:51:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And their archaeologists discovered a whole series of reams</div><div id="00:51:19.000" class="transcript_line"> which went beyond the sea wall into the floodplain,</div><div id="00:51:24.000" class="transcript_line"> well the floodplain onto the Intertidal area.</div><div id="00:51:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And these were Roman, you know, so the Romans had been doing it.</div><div id="00:51:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a hugely complicated area.</div><div id="00:51:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Masses and masses of reports.</div><div id="00:51:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I hesitate to take you upstairs because where all my working notes are and everything</div><div id="00:51:44.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s in a mess, but I can show you up there if you want.</div><div id="00:51:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can see the stuff I&#039;ve got.</div><div id="00:51:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So before you came here, Bob, where had you been?</div><div id="00:51:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, because it&#039;s massively interesting, unusual landscape, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:52:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, with the water drainage and the reams.</div><div id="00:52:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Was that a surprise? Was that a bonus?</div><div id="00:52:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I knew the levels were here.</div><div id="00:52:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was actually for nine years before that,</div><div id="00:52:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I was curator at Kingsley Museum, which is on the edge of the Fens.</div><div id="00:52:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were involved in the archaeology there.</div><div id="00:52:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t find King John&#039;s treasure, but we found lots of other stuff.</div><div id="00:52:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a massive amount of stuff that came out there.</div><div id="00:52:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And also industrial archaeology with the draining of the Fens and so on.</div><div id="00:52:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So the levels was, you know, it&#039;s like repeating myself in many ways.</div><div id="00:52:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where my interest in it started.</div><div id="00:52:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a good idea of what was going on here.</div><div id="00:52:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned that you filmed or took photographs of the last Putra rank at Gold Coast, is that right?</div><div id="00:52:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:54.000" class="transcript_line"> When was that?</div><div id="00:52:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I did it on slides. So I&#039;ll have to look at the slides.</div><div id="00:53:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that because you knew it was coming to an end and they had to be recorded?</div><div id="00:53:07.000" class="transcript_line"> No, just because it was interesting. I didn&#039;t know it was going to end then.</div><div id="00:53:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But it ended soon afterwards. Just a nice picture.</div><div id="00:53:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I took lots of them.</div><div id="00:53:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I got a lovely one, which is about a mile out in Yestery, looking back towards Goldcliff Point.</div><div id="00:53:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Just in front of me is a big pool about the size of this room.</div><div id="00:53:30.000" class="transcript_line"> In the middle was a red Renault 4, half submerged in the water.</div><div id="00:53:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It looked brand new.</div><div id="00:53:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I sort of wondered if there was somebody still in it, but there wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:53:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;d find all sorts of stuff dumped by the ships there.</div><div id="00:53:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What sort of things?</div><div id="00:53:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, lots, for instance, to give you an example, around Nash.</div><div id="00:53:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There are sort of banks going on either side of the usk.</div><div id="00:53:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And the ships used to dump everything out of there.</div><div id="00:53:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a few bits upstairs, but there&#039;s a lot in the museum.</div><div id="00:54:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got things like shipping lines, porcelain.</div><div id="00:54:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But above all things like clay pipe bowls.</div><div id="00:54:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Derek had hundreds of these he&#039;d picked up.</div><div id="00:54:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got four or five upstairs.</div><div id="00:54:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Pottery, obviously.</div><div id="00:54:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Wooden stuff.</div><div id="00:54:22.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a ship&#039;s fender, which we picked up, took back to the museum.</div><div id="00:54:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Stuff washed out and prehistoric stuff from elsewhere.</div><div id="00:54:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything under the sun you can think of.</div><div id="00:54:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;d all get washed up against the seawall, the high tide marks.</div><div id="00:54:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So you arrived in the early 80s, and then the dockland area,</div><div id="00:54:47.000" class="transcript_line"> was there an active place then?</div><div id="00:54:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, it had been going.</div><div id="00:54:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the town dock was about 1840, was it?</div><div id="00:54:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, earlier than that, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:55:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve snorled this stuff.</div><div id="00:55:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to see now.</div><div id="00:55:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, so that&#039;s certainly 19th century.</div><div id="00:55:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean, Newport was a massive port because of, you know,</div><div id="00:55:12.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s where the canals and the railways came from, the valleys,</div><div id="00:55:17.000" class="transcript_line"> bringing down iron and coal and stuff.</div><div id="00:55:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it wasn&#039;t ever as big as Cardiff, but it was vastly important.</div><div id="00:55:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was the Lord Tridiga or the Morgan family at Tridiga House.</div><div id="00:55:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It owned, you know, lots of the land here.</div><div id="00:55:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It had what was called the Golden Mile, which was in the railway,</div><div id="00:55:40.000" class="transcript_line"> which went through their land and their estates,</div><div id="00:55:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and every truck they got a payment on.</div><div id="00:55:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So they became vastly wealthy.</div><div id="00:55:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they paid for huge amounts of things in Newport, you know,</div><div id="00:55:56.000" class="transcript_line"> rebuilding and so on and so forth.</div><div id="00:56:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just wondering, because the docks are now, you know, by all accounts,</div><div id="00:56:07.000" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t just walk in anymore.</div><div id="00:56:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No, you can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:56:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, Jan, for example, has got a fantastic interview</div><div id="00:56:13.000" class="transcript_line"> with a woman who was a prostitute there during the war, for example.</div><div id="00:56:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the colour.</div><div id="00:56:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Down at the Waterloo Arms, no doubt.</div><div id="00:56:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I just wonder whether, as a curator,</div><div id="00:56:26.000" class="transcript_line"> whether one records what&#039;s happening now.</div><div id="00:56:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it&#039;s probably what we&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:56:31.000" class="transcript_line"> To a degree, I mean, it depends, because it depends whether you&#039;ve got the time.</div><div id="00:56:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve been down there quite a number of times.</div><div id="00:56:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can still get on the docks quite easily,</div><div id="00:56:46.000" class="transcript_line"> because I took my scrap boiler when they put a new boiler in,</div><div id="00:56:51.000" class="transcript_line"> a hot water boiler, a copper one, got 60 quid for it.</div><div id="00:56:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that was well worth it, you know, I went down there.</div><div id="00:56:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, with the flimsy sort of excuses you can get down and see.</div><div id="00:57:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously it&#039;s not a patch on what it was in its heyday,</div><div id="00:57:07.000" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s still a very active report.</div><div id="00:57:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Trinnega House, I should ask you about that, really.</div><div id="00:57:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So, your time working in Newport, what was your contact with Trinnega?</div><div id="00:57:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, according to my job description,</div><div id="00:57:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I was responsible for overseeing Trinnega House.</div><div id="00:57:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a really brilliant guy called David Freeman,</div><div id="00:57:31.000" class="transcript_line"> who knew exactly what he was doing, running it.</div><div id="00:57:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no, you do what you want, David, I&#039;ll just support you.</div><div id="00:57:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he did that.</div><div id="00:57:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But when he left, you know, I went down there and worked for a little while,</div><div id="00:57:46.000" class="transcript_line"> just to help things tick over.</div><div id="00:57:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it open to the public then?</div><div id="00:57:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Yes, but in those days they were guided tours.</div><div id="00:57:55.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the rooms were still empty, they still are.</div><div id="00:58:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just a long, long business of finding bits of stuff to go in there,</div><div id="00:58:07.000" class="transcript_line"> particularly things which had belonged to the family.</div><div id="00:58:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And so stuff came in.</div><div id="00:58:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it was bought, sometimes it was on loan, and sometimes it was given.</div><div id="00:58:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So that process is still going on.</div><div id="00:58:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The restoration work, again, you know, is always needed, lots doing to it,</div><div id="00:58:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and it still does.</div><div id="00:58:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s one reason why the National Trust has taken it on,</div><div id="00:58:34.000" class="transcript_line"> because council can no longer afford it because of the austerity measures,</div><div id="00:58:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and it saved it, you know.</div><div id="00:58:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But if it hadn&#039;t been for the early days, particularly David Freeman</div><div id="00:58:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and then director Alf Robke and others that supported him,</div><div id="00:58:51.000" class="transcript_line"> he wouldn&#039;t have survived.</div><div id="00:58:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had great fans as well.</div><div id="00:58:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Princess Margaret, when she was died, was one of his personal friends,</div><div id="00:59:03.000" class="transcript_line"> so she would come down and have tea in his cottage by Tredegar House.</div><div id="00:59:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So he knew everybody and we might sort of interfere with that,</div><div id="00:59:15.000" class="transcript_line"> so I just mainly concentrated on the museum.</div><div id="00:59:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was his background then? What do you know about him?</div><div id="00:59:22.000" class="transcript_line"> David, oh, goodness. I&#039;m not sure about his early history, he&#039;s still around.</div><div id="00:59:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Is he?</div><div id="00:59:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. He was a close friend of...</div><div id="00:59:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s the fashion designer? Settle Beaton, is it?</div><div id="00:59:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:59:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very, very. When I say close, I mean close.</div><div id="00:59:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And when Settle died, he inherited his house and everything else,</div><div id="00:59:51.000" class="transcript_line"> so he lived there, but he&#039;s a really enthusiastic, effervescent sort of character.</div><div id="01:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He must be rather ancient, though, surely.</div><div id="01:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s younger than me.</div><div id="01:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, he must have been a very young friend of Settle Beaton.</div><div id="01:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a young friend. I&#039;ll go into that.</div><div id="01:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Does he still live locally, then?</div><div id="01:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he lives...</div><div id="01:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s out in...</div><div id="01:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow, I can&#039;t remember the name of the place, but it settles Beaton&#039;s house,</div><div id="01:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> which is sort of, I don&#039;t know, somewhere in Hampshire or somewhere around about there.</div><div id="01:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure where. He did have a...</div><div id="01:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, but he still got a flat at Cardiff Bay.</div><div id="01:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, when he was working, he lived in a flat at Trudiga House.</div><div id="01:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so it would be interesting to talk to him, maybe.</div><div id="01:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, definitely.</div><div id="01:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t suppose you have a contact, do you?</div><div id="01:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I send him a Christmas card, and then he sends me one the next year,</div><div id="01:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> so I then send him one the year afterwards.</div><div id="01:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But somewhere I&#039;ve got his address.</div><div id="01:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it might be really...</div><div id="01:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But, I mean, Trudiga House wouldn&#039;t know where he was.</div><div id="01:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he&#039;s still involved in schemes there, like the...</div><div id="01:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a voluntary scheme for helping people with mental problems in the gardens and so on,</div><div id="01:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s been very actively involved in that.</div><div id="01:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re unlikely to give me his number, though, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hm.</div><div id="01:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Trudiga House are unlikely to give me his address, I should think.</div><div id="01:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you may be able to contact him there, but if not, I&#039;ll have to just have to dig it out, that&#039;s all.</div><div id="01:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;d be grateful. Thank you.</div><div id="01:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So, just on the levels, so it sounds a bit of a cliché question, really,</div><div id="01:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> but is there any find you&#039;ve discovered that really sticks, apart from the ship, that really, you know, stays with you?</div><div id="01:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, and the Ballinsfarm boat, of course.</div><div id="01:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They were the two major ones.</div><div id="01:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s just the quantity of stuff, you know.</div><div id="01:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The most exciting moment was the village at...</div><div id="01:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> In Eln Edge Village, which we discovered near Goldcliffe, of Pill,</div><div id="01:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because he was just going, you&#039;re finding one thing, and then there was Derek and myself,</div><div id="01:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and about three or four others, and then there was something else, and then there was something else,</div><div id="01:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and then there was something else, you know, and you knew exactly what it all was,</div><div id="01:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> and you just couldn&#039;t believe it, you know.</div><div id="01:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It must have been overwhelming trying to curate all this.</div><div id="01:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was there, you know, and you went back to the foreshore again, and onto the bank, and it all got covered by the sea,</div><div id="01:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> so, but I mean, what happened there was, of course, that Martin Bell, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve come across Martin,</div><div id="01:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> he came along and said, would you mind if I deal with some of this stuff?</div><div id="01:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No, go ahead, Martin.</div><div id="01:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, he had the proper people and the proper resources went into it,</div><div id="01:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and some massive reports came out, and he&#039;s still working now.</div><div id="01:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he&#039;s on my list of people to interview, actually.</div><div id="01:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> A great guy, and, you know, he did it properly.</div><div id="01:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever come across Sir Hampy Tennyson?</div><div id="01:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The Pontic Boule estate?</div><div id="01:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so did you have, what sort of gene did you have with the Pontic Boule estate?</div><div id="01:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a huge amount, because I knew him through the Monmouth Surinquarian Society,</div><div id="01:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and I wasn&#039;t really studying his papers as much as going into archives,</div><div id="01:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and doing that, which I had close, I still have close connections with.</div><div id="01:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were tremendous when I was doing my medieval Newport,</div><div id="01:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> because they were finding stuff all over the place and telling me about it, you know.</div><div id="01:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, actually we&#039;ve got a meeting, we&#039;re going there next Thursday afternoon.</div><div id="01:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the Moray Guards, particularly Tony Hopkins.</div><div id="01:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Tony&#039;s at Ebbw Vale?</div><div id="01:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="01:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so we&#039;re going to the Glamorgan one.</div><div id="01:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s in Swansea, yes.</div><div id="01:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you know Tony then?</div><div id="01:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew Tony, when he was at the Quintal Cup.</div><div id="01:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He translated a lot of the documents from the Warwick letter and so on for me.</div><div id="01:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh really? Gosh.</div><div id="01:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was a great supporter, and I don&#039;t think I could have managed it without him actually.</div><div id="01:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So is he a Latin scholar then?</div><div id="01:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he can read medieval Latin, which I can&#039;t.</div><div id="01:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I try and I get the odd words, you know.</div><div id="01:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Although the Warwick letter was written in English, but it was still sort of old-fashioned English.</div><div id="01:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any other characters you&#039;ve met over the years that you should record?</div><div id="01:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, unfortunately you can&#039;t record Derek.</div><div id="01:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he&#039;s not there. Come in, Tickham, have you come across him?</div><div id="01:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, get him. He was a great friend of Derek&#039;s, and he&#039;s involved with the, or was involved with the Gwent Wildlife Trust.</div><div id="01:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m sure they would put you straight on to him.</div><div id="01:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to go around giving lectures, and they used to have this, the groupies that go around.</div><div id="01:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He found stuff for us, and he set up a reserve at, what&#039;s it called, Brockweir, or somewhere.</div><div id="01:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it&#039;s actually not far again from Magor, the village of Magor, and it&#039;s now a trust reserve.</div><div id="01:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was his family&#039;s farm, and he knows a huge amount.</div><div id="01:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he concentrates on the natural history, but also living there.</div><div id="01:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what the reserve is at Magor?</div><div id="01:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Not the Magor Marsh Reserve, the Brockwell Farm, which is another reserve in the area.</div><div id="01:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to have to take you upstairs, I&#039;m going to have to apologise in advance, because the working area is up there.</div><div id="01:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t worry, that would be fantastic. Shall I turn this off?</div><div id="01:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can do that.</div><div id="01:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That was fascinating. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.</div><div id="01:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just wondering if over the years you&#039;ve had much involvement also with the transporter bridge?</div><div id="01:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Off and on, off and on. It didn&#039;t used to be part of the museum collections, now Mike has got it as part of the museum collections.</div><div id="01:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had to do, I had to write some articles for it and do a bit of research in it.</div><div id="01:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the Newport Schiff staff were involved.</div><div id="01:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from doing historical stuff, my biggest contribution regarding the Newport transporter bridge was when I arrived and I wanted a display put in about it.</div><div id="01:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had a contact, Derek, no not Derek, anyway, a guy who made models.</div><div id="01:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got in touch with him and he did almost as a labour of love the model that&#039;s in the Newport Museum now, which was then working, so you could, I think we go back, and that&#039;s a fantastic model.</div><div id="01:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was responsible for that coming.</div><div id="01:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever use it? Did you ever use the bridge?</div><div id="01:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, which model or the real one?</div><div id="01:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The real one.</div><div id="01:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, well yes, I&#039;ve been across it on foot and on car and over the top and everywhere, yes of course.</div><div id="01:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever hang beneath it? I&#039;ve spoken to a couple of people who used to hang beneath it and then drop off.</div><div id="01:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it never really appealed to me.</div><div id="01:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, knowing me, I&#039;d probably hang down and jump straight into the gondola or something.</div><div id="01:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, it&#039;s a rather silly idea.</div><div id="01:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think people commit suicide that way, on the Seven Bridge they did the same.</div><div id="01:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever found any bodies in the peat?</div><div id="01:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes?</div><div id="01:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, lots of skulls and stuff like that.</div><div id="01:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact I&#039;ve had a very long argument with, not sure if nailing, well not argument at all, but discussion I should think would be a better way of putting it.</div><div id="01:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when the Newport ship was excavated, where the struts supporting the ship were, beneath that they found a skeleton, a headless skeleton.</div><div id="01:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And immediately people were talking about it being sacrifices and everything else.</div><div id="01:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But it predated the ship, in fact turned out to be iron age, or everything seems to be iron age.</div><div id="01:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And the people who were writing the report were talking about it being headless because of the head was sacrificed separately.</div><div id="01:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well they didn&#039;t have Derek Upton&#039;s experience, nor him talking with the police, which I listened to.</div><div id="01:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the time you find bodies of people which have drowned in the usk or in the cell, happens frequently.</div><div id="01:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I can come in to some nice gruesome stories now.</div><div id="01:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, basically what tends to happen is somebody either dies or commits suicide or falls overboard, their body floats and it will float up with the tide, which is a massive tide, and then out again.</div><div id="01:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So it will go in and out.</div><div id="01:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the weakest point in the body is in the neck.</div><div id="01:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So the necks tend to come away and the heads go off.</div><div id="01:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you then find a headless body alongside the bank, you can assume that it&#039;s not necessarily a human sacrifice or anything like that.</div><div id="01:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There are other things, at least Derek&#039;s stories rather than me, because he used to tell them all to me.</div><div id="01:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one case just on the other side, on the Bristol side, but he was trying to cross over at low tide.</div><div id="01:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came across a pair of boots which were upright like this, with human bones sticking in their head.</div><div id="01:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Someone had got stuck in the mud.</div><div id="01:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness!</div><div id="01:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I then went on to...</div><div id="01:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean that&#039;s almost comical but tragic.</div><div id="01:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I know, yes.</div><div id="01:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I went on, you know, because most people get trapped because of quicksands out there and everything.</div><div id="01:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And the mud is thick, you know.</div><div id="01:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The number of parties we&#039;ve taken out there, they&#039;ve lost their wellies.</div><div id="01:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean I did it, but then we get blasey about it.</div><div id="01:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We take the students out there and they&#039;re all stuck and we&#039;re just sort of walking around because we know how to walk in the mud.</div><div id="01:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they&#039;re always coming back covered in mud.</div><div id="01:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to be washed down in the house when we came back because we were so bad.</div><div id="01:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said to Derek, I said, well, did you ever get stuck there?</div><div id="01:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh yes, once I did.</div><div id="01:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> He decided he&#039;d walk out to Denny Island.</div><div id="01:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So he went at the very lowest tide possible.</div><div id="01:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s a channel between Denny Island and us and he just couldn&#039;t get through the channel.</div><div id="01:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t get that way to Denny Island.</div><div id="01:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So he started walking back and he got stuck in some mud and he couldn&#039;t get out.</div><div id="01:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was lying flat on his face.</div><div id="01:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I looked at him and said, well, Derek, why are you still here today then?</div><div id="01:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, well, when the tide came in, it sucks me out.</div><div id="01:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I swam in with the tide.</div><div id="01:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="01:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> A number of people have tried that and it hasn&#039;t worked.</div><div id="01:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s really tragic in a sense, the way he died in the end, which I won&#039;t go into.</div><div id="01:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What other stories did he tell you, this adventures out in the estuary?</div><div id="01:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I mean, Spitfire was quite a good one.</div><div id="01:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They knew of Spitfire, so he helped to dig it out.</div><div id="01:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They come to me and I go.</div><div id="01:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the unusual stuff he&#039;s found.</div><div id="01:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one occasion when I went out with him and another friend of mine called Roger James and his wife.</div><div id="01:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Roger is, well, he was, probably still is, the president of the Wild Life Trust, whatever the title is.</div><div id="01:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> A very nice guy and very knowledgeable.</div><div id="01:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But he found this enormous long bow.</div><div id="01:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he found this about this long.</div><div id="01:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I was there with Derek and Cindy, who was his friend, and Roger.</div><div id="01:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We wandered along and we said, well, we&#039;ll have to take this back because it could be a sort of giant aurochs.</div><div id="01:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So Roger had to carry this thing, bloody thing, miles back over the mud to the bank.</div><div id="01:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So we got it there.</div><div id="01:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we got back to the museum and actually got an identification done on it.</div><div id="01:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a giraffe leg bone.</div><div id="01:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Giraffe leg bone.</div><div id="01:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s amazing what you find out there.</div><div id="01:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, it&#039;s really weird.</div><div id="01:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, lots of stories about Derek, I mean, of him wandering out there and discovering things.</div><div id="01:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it was getting his knowledge out there.</div><div id="01:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it came to the point, you know, when I certainly wasn&#039;t sidelined, but I left them to it.</div><div id="01:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> He would talk to Martin Bell, for instance.</div><div id="01:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> None of them would go out without Derek because Derek knew so much.</div><div id="01:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would say, listen, he wasn&#039;t a trained archaeologist or an academic.</div><div id="01:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> He would just say, no, that could hurt.</div><div id="01:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they&#039;d all sort of think again about what they&#039;d been pronunciating.</div><div id="01:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was right.</div><div id="01:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think he got an honorary doctorate given to him in university.</div><div id="01:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was sort of modest and assuming.</div><div id="01:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But he did like taking young ladies out there.</div><div id="01:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, sort of, you know, he would take groups out there and quite often they would get stuck.</div><div id="01:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He would have to help them out again.</div><div id="01:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;d take me back to his house and he lived there with his son Dean.</div><div id="01:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And he collected crassulas in a little plant.</div><div id="01:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So he had them. But the house was just a mass of stuff.</div><div id="01:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He discovered bottles, you know.</div><div id="01:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of these early bottles were quite valuable, you know.</div><div id="01:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Just as an aside, did the Museum and Art Gallery ever have anything to do with the School of Documentary Photography?</div><div id="01:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> David Hearn?</div><div id="01:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Yes.</div><div id="01:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Mainly through Ron McCormack.</div><div id="01:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> If you come across Ron.</div><div id="01:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he used to be head of the Documentary Photography thing.</div><div id="01:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I arrived there, he was in the eighties and he&#039;s long retired.</div><div id="01:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And each year they had what they call the Newport Survey.</div><div id="01:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Museum would commission them.</div><div id="01:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Students go out and they did all sorts of different subjects.</div><div id="01:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got any here, I don&#039;t think, but I&#039;ve had them in the Museum and the Library.</div><div id="01:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had two different themes.</div><div id="01:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It might be still working, sort of life down in pill or whatever it was.</div><div id="01:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And each student would take a different theme.</div><div id="01:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were put together and they would produce a book.</div><div id="01:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And this went on for about 12 years.</div><div id="01:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> In those days we had some money, so we were able to help fund it as well.</div><div id="01:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s copies at the Museum, do you think?</div><div id="01:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, I didn&#039;t, yeah.</div><div id="01:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the whole thing is still there.</div><div id="01:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got any copies at all, I don&#039;t know why.</div><div id="01:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s well worth looking at.</div><div id="01:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because that School of Photography was sort of internationally well known.</div><div id="01:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Phenomenal.</div><div id="01:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a great tragedy when they&#039;re closing university here.</div><div id="01:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw David Herden about a fortnight ago talking to me about when he&#039;s petted up.</div><div id="01:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He was living in a camper van by the lighthouse the first year of that.</div><div id="01:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I thought was quite extraordinary.</div><div id="01:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And just go back to the Spitfire, was it shot down over St. Broads?</div><div id="01:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it crashed there.</div><div id="01:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It crashed, sorry, not shot down.</div><div id="01:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve been in Germany, it might have been, but it might have been shot down, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Was the pilot ever identified?</div><div id="01:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think so, I think it was known about.</div><div id="01:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t one I was directly involved in, so I can&#039;t give you the details.</div><div id="01:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So were there other things from the Second World War?</div><div id="01:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was talking to a lady last week.</div><div id="01:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> A parachute had come down, and they took the parachute.</div><div id="01:17:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She made an Italian POW, who happened to be a tailor, made her a silk blouse.</div><div id="01:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She kept it for years and years and years.</div><div id="01:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I just wonder if there&#039;s any other things that came from it.</div><div id="01:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s lots.</div><div id="01:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We talk about the prisoners of war, for instance.</div><div id="01:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Down at Underwood there was a prisoner of war camp there.</div><div id="01:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And lots of prisoners were kept there.</div><div id="01:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of them actually came out and worked on farms here.</div><div id="01:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There are lots of evidence, you know, from pill boxes to little platforms for anti-aircraft guns all the way around Newport.</div><div id="01:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And Jan could tell you a lot more about it than I could.</div><div id="01:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s lots of evidence and some bombing, but got off lightly compared to Swansea or places like that.</div><div id="01:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m going to turn this off now, Bob.</div><div id="01:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. I&#039;m sure we could talk all day.</div><div id="01:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much. That was absolutely fascinating.</div></div></p>
