    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the 12th of June, I&#039;m Stephanie Cruz of Ellen Lynx and I&#039;m here today in Raider</div><div id="00:00:06.360" class="transcript_line"> talking to Mawver Shaw and to Jill Willie. Mawver, just for reference, in which year</div><div id="00:00:12.160" class="transcript_line"> were you born? 1938. And Jill? 1951. Thank you. Mawver, can you tell me a little bit</div><div id="00:00:19.360" class="transcript_line"> about your family and how you came to be in Raider where you were born? I was born and</div><div id="00:00:24.800" class="transcript_line"> I was born and raised in Raider at number nine in the gardens and I was the second daughter of the family.</div><div id="00:00:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Your father was? My father was a blacksmith and I&#039;m not sure, I think the man was just a housewife then.</div><div id="00:00:41.800" class="transcript_line"> And we lived there for a while and then I think just before the war finished, my father was a</div><div id="00:00:50.800" class="transcript_line"> moved from Raider to work at Winds, I&#039;m not sure what it was, something to do with blacksmithing I would imagine.</div><div id="00:00:59.800" class="transcript_line"> And we were there for a while because my brother was born in an air raid in Newport itself. Oh, right.</div><div id="00:01:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And then the way he was, my father was working, it was bombed so we came back to Raider.</div><div id="00:01:15.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think eventually, I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t remember where we were at. Just trying to figure it out.</div><div id="00:01:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Did you move back to Green Gardens? No, we moved back to a place called, I can&#039;t think of the name of it now.</div><div id="00:01:36.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll come. Whereabouts was it?</div><div id="00:01:41.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll just up the, what I call the Pounds Lane but I can&#039;t think of the name of the farm. It came to me just before you said something.</div><div id="00:01:48.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s gone again now. Anyway, we shared a house there for a little while and then we came back to live in Raider in Penpole.</div><div id="00:01:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Opposite to the Contaider Arms pub then, you know, the alleyway up to, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:02:04.800" class="transcript_line"> I do Church Street.</div><div id="00:02:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And then we lived there then until we were allocated the Moratie Green Gardens and that&#039;s where I stayed until I got married.</div><div id="00:02:16.800" class="transcript_line"> And then we got married in 1963, like myself. And then I think it was about, Mark was six months old when we came to live here.</div><div id="00:02:29.800" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve been here ever since? Yeah, he was born in 1965. And then three years later I had Richard and he was born in 1968.</div><div id="00:02:40.800" class="transcript_line"> And then I went, eventually went back to the chemist after Richard went to school before.</div><div id="00:02:46.800" class="transcript_line"> So if we go back a bit, you first started working at the chemists in 1955. And did you have an interview?</div><div id="00:02:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, actually in one respect, yes, but no in another because I worked for one year in Central Stores, which is now the spa.</div><div id="00:03:09.800" class="transcript_line"> She was owned by Gerald Morgan and his family. And I had worked there for a year.</div><div id="00:03:17.800" class="transcript_line"> And then my sister, who was already working in the chemists before me for one year, was going to teach a trade in college.</div><div id="00:03:25.800" class="transcript_line"> So T.C. Price very kindly asked her to ask me would I like the job?</div><div id="00:03:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Because he thought the work I was doing at Central Stores was too much for a young woman. So that&#039;s how I came to work in the chemists.</div><div id="00:03:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay. And Jill, your mum worked in the same chemist, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:03:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, she did. Not for very long, I don&#039;t think. Probably the very late 50s, going into the early 60s.</div><div id="00:03:55.800" class="transcript_line"> I know she left in 62, but she did have a few very happy years working part time, I believe it was, in the chemist shop.</div><div id="00:04:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but not for T.C. Price. It was for E.W. Price.</div><div id="00:04:11.800" class="transcript_line"> And what do you remember of Jill&#039;s mum?</div><div id="00:04:15.800" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember. I don&#039;t remember your mum that much. I mean, I remember her going, she was a W.I. member, wasn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:04:21.800" class="transcript_line"> But I wasn&#039;t there, of course, because I was only a teenager then, wasn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> So not a time for me to get under the bridge since then.</div><div id="00:04:31.800" class="transcript_line"> So what stories do you remember your mum telling, Jill?</div><div id="00:04:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ll have to tell you. I&#039;ll start with a funny one anyway. No, perhaps I&#039;d better start with a more serious one, haven&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:04:42.800" class="transcript_line"> I know she used to talk about the customers that came in and the sort of things they&#039;d ask for.</div><div id="00:04:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d seem to go off at a tangent sometimes, you know, not knowing quite what it was that they wanted.</div><div id="00:04:54.800" class="transcript_line"> I think they wanted the assistants there to sort out their problems, you know.</div><div id="00:05:00.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure a lot of that used to happen. And of course, these are in the days where you didn&#039;t sort of walk around and help yourself like a supermarket.</div><div id="00:05:08.800" class="transcript_line"> You actually went to the counter, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:05:11.800" class="transcript_line"> And people used to come in with their problems. And I remember one lady, she was a single lady,</div><div id="00:05:18.800" class="transcript_line"> but she obviously thought she was in the family way, which of course was a bit hush hush in those days.</div><div id="00:05:23.800" class="transcript_line"> And she went up to my mother asking her if there was anything my mother could do or anything my mother could give her, you know, in these circumstances.</div><div id="00:05:32.800" class="transcript_line"> And of course, my poor mother, well, she wasn&#039;t in any position to do that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:05:37.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, that was a bit of a sad story.</div><div id="00:05:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Quite hard for her.</div><div id="00:05:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Then I remember something rather funny. There was a lady working there, who all the knew very well, called Jean Buffton.</div><div id="00:05:50.800" class="transcript_line"> And she had an amazing sense of humour. And one day a customer came into the chemist saying to Jean,</div><div id="00:05:58.800" class="transcript_line"> look, can you help me, please? I want something, a nice present for a nice little old lady.</div><div id="00:06:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Jean sort of looked at her and said, well, how about a little old man?</div><div id="00:06:09.800" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was a lovely story. I still tell that one.</div><div id="00:06:14.800" class="transcript_line"> And more for you. You&#039;ve got a little black book there where something&#039;s written down in it, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:21.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, yes, we did, yes. We used to have a lot of fun about this. Do you want to read that one?</div><div id="00:06:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ll read a few.</div><div id="00:06:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really, about myself, because I shouldn&#039;t say it ahead of time.</div><div id="00:06:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Right, it says here. This is myself now over. I went up to the cemetery last night collecting, but I didn&#039;t get an answer.</div><div id="00:06:42.800" class="transcript_line"> And what did some people come and ask for?</div><div id="00:06:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Because as Jill says, you didn&#039;t go and have a look on the shelf. You asked for certain kinds of hand cream.</div><div id="00:06:55.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, different ones come and ask for different things. Four years one.</div><div id="00:06:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Somebody asked for scruples ammonia, and it should have been scrubbed ammonia. We still have that today, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:07:06.800" class="transcript_line"> We do.</div><div id="00:07:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and another one was somebody asked, could they have some J, Jews fluid? Should have been J&#039;s fluid.</div><div id="00:07:18.800" class="transcript_line"> J&#039;s fluid, yes, I remember that.</div><div id="00:07:20.800" class="transcript_line"> And you were saying just earlier, going through some of the changes that you saw in the shop,</div><div id="00:07:26.800" class="transcript_line"> you used to have to handwrite the labels for the medicines that were dispensed.</div><div id="00:07:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did. Yes, that&#039;s quite interesting. You got writers crap doing that, but of course it wasn&#039;t as busy as it got eventually, you know, with the NHS.</div><div id="00:07:44.800" class="transcript_line"> And then we sort of progressed. And I think it was after T.C. Price retired, and even when E.W. retired, Mrs. Evans, that was another pharmacist who bought the chemists off E.W.</div><div id="00:08:00.800" class="transcript_line"> And she had already bought a chemist off him in Willish. Oh, right.</div><div id="00:08:05.800" class="transcript_line"> And like they followed one another really to Rairdham. She actually had retired.</div><div id="00:08:10.800" class="transcript_line"> But because her son was going to university, she felt she would have to go back to work to see him through university.</div><div id="00:08:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And then afterwards it didn&#039;t matter to much, she said, you know, but she was quite a character.</div><div id="00:08:25.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think she had everything under the sun in the chemist then, like, you know, entirely different to E.W. and T.C. Price.</div><div id="00:08:33.800" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember this is Kathleen Price now, the previous owner&#039;s wife.</div><div id="00:08:40.800" class="transcript_line"> She said to me one day, she said, it&#039;s like a woe, she said, it&#039;s not a chemist shop.</div><div id="00:08:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And she was quite sharp about that.</div><div id="00:08:48.800" class="transcript_line"> So when you first started working at the chemist, can you describe what the shop looked like inside?</div><div id="00:08:55.800" class="transcript_line"> It looked like it would go in through the front doors.</div><div id="00:08:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, well, there&#039;s a lot of.</div><div id="00:09:02.800" class="transcript_line"> At the back of the shop, at the back of the counter in the actual shop,</div><div id="00:09:07.800" class="transcript_line"> there were like all these drawers with all these labels on, like mothballs and, you know, varying things all in these little cupboards behind you.</div><div id="00:09:18.800" class="transcript_line"> And then there were shelves above with all these carboys and things, you know.</div><div id="00:09:24.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember one day we had to dust the top shelves.</div><div id="00:09:27.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember T.C. Price saying to me, Maverick, don&#039;t take the top off that ammonia because it&#039;ll take your head off.</div><div id="00:09:35.800" class="transcript_line"> You said if you must have, of course I did, didn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:09:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Then you came down the ladder.</div><div id="00:09:42.800" class="transcript_line"> I love you.</div><div id="00:09:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Thanks, we don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:09:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And do you remember the shop as it was like that?</div><div id="00:09:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do. I remember cupboards full of jars of these very interesting looking medicines.</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember that. And I remember there was like a little almost like an ante room which had baby food.</div><div id="00:10:01.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember the shelves behind shelves sort of thing.</div><div id="00:10:04.800" class="transcript_line"> And then there was one completely full room baby food.</div><div id="00:10:07.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember. And of course, then you had the other things on display, like nice perfumes and nice talcum powders and soaps.</div><div id="00:10:16.800" class="transcript_line"> And perhaps something for the little old lady is what that lady I think was really talking about.</div><div id="00:10:21.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and if I can just mention, my father had a very good friendship with Mr. T.C. Price.</div><div id="00:10:29.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember being literally in the back behind the scenes trying on pairs of glasses with my father and Mr. Price.</div><div id="00:10:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Because he was an optometrist as well.</div><div id="00:10:41.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:42.800" class="transcript_line"> And some of his younger family, you know, we&#039;d get together and try on lipsticks, Dorothy Gray particularly.</div><div id="00:10:49.800" class="transcript_line"> We thought we were very, very sophisticated.</div><div id="00:10:51.800" class="transcript_line"> But all this was going on sort of behind the scenes as it were.</div><div id="00:10:55.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember, for instance, glasses or an awful lot of makeup actually on display.</div><div id="00:11:01.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I certainly remember it. And of course, the big difference being that you went up to the counter to...</div><div id="00:11:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:10.800" class="transcript_line"> And T.C. Price used to make concoctions for the farmers.</div><div id="00:11:16.800" class="transcript_line"> And he had a lovely, like, what do they call it?</div><div id="00:11:20.800" class="transcript_line"> A book that he kept them in, you know, he wrote the recipes in.</div><div id="00:11:25.800" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful handwriting he did.</div><div id="00:11:27.800" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know where that chronicle went.</div><div id="00:11:30.800" class="transcript_line"> It was certainly in the chemist&#039;s...</div><div id="00:11:32.800" class="transcript_line"> After Mrs. Evans left and then Mr. Ken Evans, he came.</div><div id="00:11:40.800" class="transcript_line"> No, Edward, sorry, not Evans, sorry. Mr. Edwards came.</div><div id="00:11:44.800" class="transcript_line"> And when they left, I think they took it with them.</div><div id="00:11:48.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ve got a feeling that they loved it.</div><div id="00:11:50.800" class="transcript_line"> It was a shame because you shouldn&#039;t have been left really there.</div><div id="00:11:53.800" class="transcript_line"> And so that was for the animals?</div><div id="00:11:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ll tell you what it is.</div><div id="00:12:00.800" class="transcript_line"> We used to sit out the back.</div><div id="00:12:02.800" class="transcript_line"> There was like a lean-to at the back and then one sat up like today sort of thing.</div><div id="00:12:08.800" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d mix this concoction up in a big bucket.</div><div id="00:12:14.800" class="transcript_line"> And if the wind was in the right direction, we would take your breath away.</div><div id="00:12:18.800" class="transcript_line"> And it was what we called a green salve.</div><div id="00:12:22.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember this one day, saying to Mr. Price, well, what exactly is that for?</div><div id="00:12:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s something they put on the little slabs when they were castrated.</div><div id="00:12:32.800" class="transcript_line"> I thought, poor little things.</div><div id="00:12:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what was in it?</div><div id="00:12:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no. I can&#039;t remember now. That&#039;s so many years ago.</div><div id="00:12:41.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that stopped a long time ago.</div><div id="00:12:43.800" class="transcript_line"> But you have a memory of...</div><div id="00:12:45.800" class="transcript_line"> I do have a memory of the medicines that he used to make.</div><div id="00:12:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And there was a couple of things he&#039;d make, which is supposedly to cure a cold.</div><div id="00:12:54.800" class="transcript_line"> I think they were like a general antidote, really.</div><div id="00:12:57.800" class="transcript_line"> One was pink and one was white.</div><div id="00:12:59.800" class="transcript_line"> And he claimed that one was vanilla and one was strawberry.</div><div id="00:13:03.800" class="transcript_line"> And if you took this, you&#039;d be fixed up.</div><div id="00:13:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, the taste of these was so absolutely ghastly that the very thought of taking it instantly cured you.</div><div id="00:13:14.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure it was psychological.</div><div id="00:13:16.800" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ll never forget those.</div><div id="00:13:18.800" class="transcript_line"> And the very thought, you knew he was disappearing out the back to make these concoctions.</div><div id="00:13:23.800" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, oh, no, here we go.</div><div id="00:13:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh. Oh, for goodness sake.</div><div id="00:13:29.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, look, a bottle.</div><div id="00:13:31.800" class="transcript_line"> One of the bottles out.</div><div id="00:13:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Those were the bottles.</div><div id="00:13:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Glass bottle and stopper and...</div><div id="00:13:38.800" class="transcript_line"> A jar.</div><div id="00:13:40.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s some more there.</div><div id="00:13:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Was the green salve kept in that jar?</div><div id="00:13:44.800" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. That was for other things.</div><div id="00:13:46.800" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:13:48.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no label on it.</div><div id="00:13:50.800" class="transcript_line"> There needs to be a label on it, but there&#039;s another small...</div><div id="00:13:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s a label on that one.</div><div id="00:13:54.800" class="transcript_line"> No, there&#039;s not been a label.</div><div id="00:13:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Pil-hydra.</div><div id="00:13:58.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what that is.</div><div id="00:14:00.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s a pass.</div><div id="00:14:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Jill, can you pass me the step up by you there?</div><div id="00:14:04.800" class="transcript_line"> The step, certainly.</div><div id="00:14:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Just chuck that on the floor.</div><div id="00:14:08.800" class="transcript_line"> And the glass bottle is labelled salt-tri-pan blue.</div><div id="00:14:12.800" class="transcript_line"> One gram with a squiggle there that I can&#039;t...</div><div id="00:14:17.800" class="transcript_line"> You need a promise.</div><div id="00:14:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we need a promise.</div><div id="00:14:21.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like they used to make up medicines, you know, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:14:23.800" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:14:25.800" class="transcript_line"> And notice telephone number 45.</div><div id="00:14:29.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it&#039;s...

I think I remember it looking like that, yes.</div><div id="00:26:53.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a young girl.</div><div id="00:26:54.800" class="transcript_line"> And NHS, I noticed, so that would have been, well, obviously after 1947.</div><div id="00:26:59.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:27:00.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when it was all...</div><div id="00:27:01.800" class="transcript_line"> Like all the, at the back of the counter as you walked in,</div><div id="00:27:06.800" class="transcript_line"> there was all these, as you say, like mahogany counters and that, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:11.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were beautiful.</div><div id="00:27:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:27:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Or cabinets and counters. I do remember that, yes.</div><div id="00:27:16.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, with like elegant sort of brass handles.</div><div id="00:27:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Can I see the date on it?</div><div id="00:27:22.800" class="transcript_line"> That one&#039;s 1955.</div><div id="00:27:24.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s me, that is. That&#039;s the year I started.</div><div id="00:27:29.800" class="transcript_line"> My father died in the January of that year.</div><div id="00:27:33.800" class="transcript_line"> And then I worked then from...</div><div id="00:27:36.800" class="transcript_line"> How did he die?</div><div id="00:27:38.800" class="transcript_line"> He died of cancer.</div><div id="00:27:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, bless. Smoker?</div><div id="00:27:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Quite young, really. There we are.</div><div id="00:27:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yes. So, yes, it looks a fascinating shop.</div><div id="00:27:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was very...</div><div id="00:27:51.800" class="transcript_line"> And of course, we changed the uniform and everything over the years.</div><div id="00:27:55.800" class="transcript_line"> But mostly white. I like the white overall.</div><div id="00:27:58.800" class="transcript_line"> White you had to keep them clean or else you were in trouble.</div><div id="00:28:01.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember my mother in those white overalls.</div><div id="00:28:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you&#039;re quite right.</div><div id="00:28:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And one of the posters that you&#039;ve got up in the shop is a castle cinema ballroom.</div><div id="00:28:12.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah. Well, that&#039;s where Lost Ark is down.</div><div id="00:28:16.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. So that&#039;s 1955. You&#039;re having a whist drive and a dance.</div><div id="00:28:20.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. You just have lots of those.</div><div id="00:28:22.800" class="transcript_line"> And you just have St. Thomas Hall, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:28:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I believe so, yes, which is sort of now the leisure centre.</div><div id="00:28:28.800" class="transcript_line"> So if I can just ask, did...</div><div id="00:28:31.800" class="transcript_line"> T.C. Price didn&#039;t mind sort of advertisements for local...</div><div id="00:28:36.800" class="transcript_line"> No, he didn&#039;t mind that. He didn&#039;t mind at all.</div><div id="00:28:38.800" class="transcript_line"> No, he was very good with that.</div><div id="00:28:40.800" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, over the years he belonged to the Red Chamber of Trade.</div><div id="00:28:44.800" class="transcript_line"> I think he and Richard Hughes&#039; father and Mr. Harold Ryder,</div><div id="00:28:52.800" class="transcript_line"> I think they were all belonged to the Chamber of Trade.</div><div id="00:28:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very probable.</div><div id="00:28:58.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think it was finished before I...</div><div id="00:29:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were all business people in the town, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:29:03.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:29:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it did look quite different, much lighter.</div><div id="00:29:08.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:29:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Much more space. Fascinating.</div><div id="00:29:13.800" class="transcript_line"> So what other changes in Raider have you seen over your lifetime here?</div><div id="00:29:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, quite a lot, really.</div><div id="00:29:23.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve lost a lot of shops, haven&#039;t we, over the years, sort of thing.</div><div id="00:29:27.800" class="transcript_line"> They seem to change all the time.</div><div id="00:29:29.800" class="transcript_line"> Almost every time I was coming back before I came to Livy permanently,</div><div id="00:29:33.800" class="transcript_line"> a shop would have changed hands, and it&#039;s happening still.</div><div id="00:29:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:29:39.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, something will close down and then something else will pop up.</div><div id="00:29:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Of course, it&#039;s the traffic, isn&#039;t it, that&#039;s really changed so much.</div><div id="00:29:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but you know, how shall we say, we&#039;re in the North Street now, aren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:29:52.800" class="transcript_line"> No, West Street, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:29:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the bottom end, you know where the Butcher&#039;s shop is now?</div><div id="00:29:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Bobby the Butcher&#039;s, as we call it, well, that&#039;s changed to another.</div><div id="00:30:01.800" class="transcript_line"> That used to be Walton&#039;s shop there, a television shop.</div><div id="00:30:05.800" class="transcript_line"> This used to sell, you know, all sorts of things there.</div><div id="00:30:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Then next door to that, I&#039;m trying to think now, what was there?</div><div id="00:30:13.800" class="transcript_line"> I seem to remember, was there an ice cream shop there, near the Beehive,</div><div id="00:30:17.800" class="transcript_line"> and there was Dyboot and his...</div><div id="00:30:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve gone off a bit too far.</div><div id="00:30:21.800" class="transcript_line"> Am I going too far to the clock now?</div><div id="00:30:23.800" class="transcript_line"> There was a Mrs. Harris&#039;s, I think, in the shop where the Antiques shop is now.</div><div id="00:30:30.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m trying to think who was in the shop.</div><div id="00:30:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I tell you, it was in the shop next, between the Butcher and the Antiques shop,</div><div id="00:30:38.800" class="transcript_line"> it was a Mrs. Mills with the wool shop.</div><div id="00:30:40.800" class="transcript_line"> But I remember buying wool from there, because I&#039;m a right knitter.</div><div id="00:30:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And then, I&#039;m trying to think now, what else?</div><div id="00:30:50.800" class="transcript_line"> And there used to be a...</div><div id="00:30:54.800" class="transcript_line"> like a cafe.</div><div id="00:30:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Next door to Dyboot, years ago.</div><div id="00:31:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Was it the West End?</div><div id="00:31:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:31:04.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember that.</div><div id="00:31:05.800" class="transcript_line"> I seem to remember it was something to do with ice cream, on the West End.</div><div id="00:31:09.800" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, it&#039;s always been...</div><div id="00:31:11.800" class="transcript_line"> where the kebab shop is now, used to be the men&#039;s department for Richard Hughes, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:19.800" class="transcript_line"> I believe it was.</div><div id="00:31:20.800" class="transcript_line"> And then the other half, the other part of the shop, the main big shop, was ladies&#039; clothing, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:28.800" class="transcript_line"> It was, and it was the most amazing shaped shop.</div><div id="00:31:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:31:32.800" class="transcript_line"> It had like an arcades.</div><div id="00:31:34.800" class="transcript_line"> You went in one way around.</div><div id="00:31:37.800" class="transcript_line"> And the display windows seemed to be on an angle.</div><div id="00:31:41.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:31:42.800" class="transcript_line"> And you walked in, and there was like an awning over them.</div><div id="00:31:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And again, a very, very old fashioned shop.</div><div id="00:31:49.800" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d expect the change to be humming on wires.</div><div id="00:31:52.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether they did that at any stage.</div><div id="00:31:56.800" class="transcript_line"> And again, like you mentioned, everything was in little drawers.</div><div id="00:31:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:32:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Everything of drawer was pulled out, you know, cardigans, jumpers, etc.</div><div id="00:32:04.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do remember.</div><div id="00:32:07.800" class="transcript_line"> And where are we?</div><div id="00:32:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s a lyre.</div><div id="00:32:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Then there was where the...</div><div id="00:32:15.800" class="transcript_line"> oh, what do you call it?</div><div id="00:32:18.800" class="transcript_line"> The real estate.</div><div id="00:32:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Community.</div><div id="00:32:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:32:21.800" class="transcript_line"> That was the post office, the Crown post office.</div><div id="00:32:25.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:32:26.800" class="transcript_line"> That was lovely.</div><div id="00:32:27.800" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember, I can&#039;t remember the name of the people that got it from,</div><div id="00:32:31.800" class="transcript_line"> but they came there to run it.</div><div id="00:32:33.800" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d got a dog, a boxer dog.</div><div id="00:32:36.800" class="transcript_line"> And Bart went to, I don&#039;t know whether he went to help sort out posts or what he was doing,</div><div id="00:32:42.800" class="transcript_line"> but this dog used to love polar mints.</div><div id="00:32:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Not Harvey Pugh, was it?</div><div id="00:32:48.800" class="transcript_line"> He was there at some stage, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:32:49.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but that was a Crown post office.</div><div id="00:32:51.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right, he was.</div><div id="00:32:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:32:53.800" class="transcript_line"> And then on the corner, where the estate agent is now,</div><div id="00:33:00.800" class="transcript_line"> which was the Air Ambulance shop for a while,</div><div id="00:33:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Val Evans and Inwill Evans, his mother, had a grocery shop and a sweet shop there.</div><div id="00:33:11.800" class="transcript_line"> I remember that, yes.</div><div id="00:33:12.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s been many things on the corner.</div><div id="00:33:14.800" class="transcript_line"> And then where Holton&#039;s Fish and Chip shop is now,</div><div id="00:33:18.800" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Evans also had a sweet shop there years ago,</div><div id="00:33:24.800" class="transcript_line"> before she moved to the corner.</div><div id="00:33:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember that as a kid.</div><div id="00:33:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, everybody moves, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:33:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:33:31.800" class="transcript_line"> They set up somewhere else.</div><div id="00:33:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:34.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember Dr. Poole used to live, had his surgery at home at Brinkoid,</div><div id="00:33:42.800" class="transcript_line"> by the car park, and they used to take maternity patients in, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:33:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, several people.</div><div id="00:33:53.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to go there.</div><div id="00:33:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, we were actually four there, yes.</div><div id="00:33:56.800" class="transcript_line"> And they used to keep goats.</div><div id="00:33:58.800" class="transcript_line"> And if these goats got out, they&#039;d chase you, you know.</div><div id="00:34:01.800" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going down to the dark place,</div><div id="00:34:04.800" class="transcript_line"> we were terrified that these goats might be out.</div><div id="00:34:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember this one day, this one was out.</div><div id="00:34:08.800" class="transcript_line"> When I took off down the road with him behind me,</div><div id="00:34:11.800" class="transcript_line"> and I dashed into Mrs. Evans&#039;s sweet shop, and they go after me.</div><div id="00:34:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s an element of the chemist, but never mind.</div><div id="00:34:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Just memories of growing up.</div><div id="00:34:22.800" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t happen these days.</div><div id="00:34:24.800" class="transcript_line"> The name of the farm was Dolvea.</div><div id="00:34:26.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where we stayed, a little farmhouse.</div><div id="00:34:29.800" class="transcript_line"> So we shared the house with another family.</div><div id="00:34:34.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember my mother, the other lady that lived there,</div><div id="00:34:40.800" class="transcript_line"> they used to cycle to town for milk, you know, every so often.</div><div id="00:34:45.800" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d take it in turns to do that.</div><div id="00:34:47.800" class="transcript_line"> So we certainly moved around.</div><div id="00:34:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Dolvea, did you say?</div><div id="00:34:54.800" class="transcript_line"> B-Y-R?</div><div id="00:34:56.800" class="transcript_line"> D-O-L.</div><div id="00:34:57.800" class="transcript_line"> F-I-R, I think it did.</div><div id="00:34:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, we look at it on the map anyway.</div><div id="00:35:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Dolvea, it is, yeah.</div><div id="00:35:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Down the Pound Lane, was it?</div><div id="00:35:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can go in from the main road and turn by...</div><div id="00:35:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Down towards Teylettice there.</div><div id="00:35:14.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah, you turn up the lane there.</div><div id="00:35:17.800" class="transcript_line"> We find it on the map.</div><div id="00:35:19.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember living there.</div><div id="00:35:21.800" class="transcript_line"> I was only a little kid, I expect.</div><div id="00:35:23.800" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember of school?</div><div id="00:35:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember a lot of it.</div><div id="00:35:28.800" class="transcript_line"> I know I went to Cuntighver School.</div><div id="00:35:30.800" class="transcript_line"> And the only thing I can really remember of Cuntighver School,</div><div id="00:35:34.800" class="transcript_line"> that on your birthday, whoever was in the class had a birthday</div><div id="00:35:38.800" class="transcript_line"> the same day as you.</div><div id="00:35:40.800" class="transcript_line"> You had to sit on a chair with them,</div><div id="00:35:42.800" class="transcript_line"> and there was a lantern down Cuntighver somewhere,</div><div id="00:35:45.800" class="transcript_line"> and he sat by my side, and I wasn&#039;t very pleased.</div><div id="00:35:49.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why.</div><div id="00:35:52.800" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:35:54.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I can remember about Cuntighver School.</div><div id="00:35:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Then I went to Reader School.</div><div id="00:35:59.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think I was taught by...</div><div id="00:36:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Price.</div><div id="00:36:08.800" class="transcript_line"> Miss Farmer.</div><div id="00:36:12.800" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Owen.</div><div id="00:36:16.800" class="transcript_line"> She used to live at Glance Earth, or she left,</div><div id="00:36:19.800" class="transcript_line"> she was at Glance Earth, but she was on Glyfran before that.</div><div id="00:36:23.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember that.</div><div id="00:36:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:36:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and Miss Farmer.</div><div id="00:36:30.800" class="transcript_line"> If you didn&#039;t bring your sewing to school,</div><div id="00:36:32.800" class="transcript_line"> which they did sewing in those days, you know, embroidery,</div><div id="00:36:35.800" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;d make you down her brother&#039;s socks.</div><div id="00:36:39.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m quite a good downer, actually.</div><div id="00:36:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well.</div><div id="00:36:45.800" class="transcript_line"> And is that where you got interested in knitting?</div><div id="00:36:48.800" class="transcript_line"> No, I think my mother taught me to knit.</div><div id="00:36:52.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think I got...</div><div id="00:36:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Jennifer&#039;s a good bit younger than me, my younger sister.</div><div id="00:36:58.800" class="transcript_line"> I used to knit for our dresser dolls.</div><div id="00:37:01.800" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how I came about it.</div><div id="00:37:03.800" class="transcript_line"> But I still do knit, you know.</div><div id="00:37:05.800" class="transcript_line"> I just finished a show now.</div><div id="00:37:07.800" class="transcript_line"> You are a wonderful knitter.</div><div id="00:37:09.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, I made a real mess up of that, because not mess up.</div><div id="00:37:14.800" class="transcript_line"> I was counting the amounts, I suppose I had 143 patterns on this show.</div><div id="00:37:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think I&#039;ve done about 50 too many.</div><div id="00:37:23.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I do.</div><div id="00:37:25.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want to do that.</div><div id="00:37:27.800" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve won so many prizes in shows and competitions, haven&#039;t
