    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Looking at plans</div><div id="00:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When Marina&#039;s ideas arrived they were interesting.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> A quote from some of the text.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The idea of the house is that it looks like a cave.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The ground floor is very dark.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> The external walls are from stones and the additional parts that contain the kitchen, bathroom and the bed</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> are built in with concrete walls in organic form.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The sliding doors covering these can be painted and hung with canvases like a gallery.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> A curved wooden staircase was shown up to the first floor</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> with the wall beside it containing many little niches with hidden lights.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Leading out of the cave up to a more natural light upstairs there would be a studio workroom.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> There are also some very clever ideas picking up on our brief of multifunctional use</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and inspirations that we discussed from caravan or boat interiors with folding tables and benches.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Her stairs were shown as a curving staircase</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> and she was also proposing the ground floor to have some living room features as well as serving as a kitchen.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We concluded that our own ideas had been relatively safe and angular in design.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t wait to see what Manos had come up with.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In the event it was several weeks after the deadline that he himself had chosen</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> that the first set of ideas from Manos arrived.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were worth the wait.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The plan itself was a single sheet of paper with a floor plan and elevation sketched as little coloured drawings.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The notation was so small on the original A4 that we could only read it after I&#039;d enlarged it on our printer.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The plan also contained a series of messages to us.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I have elaborated a lot of other solutions but all seem to me very artificial, boxy, claustrophobic.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> This one is probably the only one with Manos&#039; full open plan room with light and social area.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So colours and materials, white stone as you indicated for the floor, eventually,</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> visible iron beams for ceiling, rusted, niches in stone and pointed.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Rest of the walls pressed plaster plus old wooden planks and a lot of glass, plexiglass and colour.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> All the niches are invisible, pointed stone.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> All niches have interior lights. Any shelves are glass or plexiglass.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Some can be coloured.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The plan itself showed a wet room to the right of the front door with a staircase over which started at the back wall</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and turned 90 degrees to climb over the wet room.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The bottom half of the stairs before it turned were behind a floor to ceiling glass slate.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> There were niches on the other three walls.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The left hand side of the room was split between storage and seating at the back</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> with a kitchen area near the new window on the front wall.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> A glass or stone slab was drawn as a curved work surface which split the room and had stools underneath.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> A new small window was drawn in on the front wall to ventilate and light the wet room.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot seemed to have been fitted in but we liked a number of the ideas</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and it seemed to make sense to have a ground floor social area as long as there was enough room.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We were so excited that we overlooked the lack of plan for the first floor.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> This was to follow a while later.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In the meantime we sent some comments on the plan.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> This was the way we worked through the project as a dialogue.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it felt we were in tune with each other.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> At other times there was a lot more work required to involve a joint solution.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Our first comments on the ground floor were</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We like very much the design for the kitchen area with a separate social seating and breakfast bar.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We like it but we will need to ensure that sufficient storage and space for a fridge, microwave, oven combination etc.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps this could be combined with Marina&#039;s idea for an occasional bed.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> This seems a good position and divides the bathroom from the kitchen social area.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We like the glass wall slate to the top idea.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We wondered if Marina&#039;s myriad of lit niches could be incorporated upstairs to light the way.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> This could be gorgeous.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The position on this wall is a good solution.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Separate from kitchen living, more space freed up, more privacy, light and ventilation is possible here.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Marina drew in a double door which seemed good and space saving but it looked like a traditional design too.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Any thoughts about the back wall niche as a gash of light and whether glass bricks are an option for this here or upstairs?</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Upstairs, we&#039;ve already sent some of our ideas but we&#039;re still unsure of the best position for access to the roof terrace.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> This will decide the stairs position.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve sent a picture of clever slide out stairs that we found.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Could this perhaps be possible?</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Marina&#039;s positioning of the stairs in the lower part of the ceiling makes some sense.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We see the first floor as lighter, able to get some air in through the French doors, small balcony and roof access.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The purpose of the room, sleeping, sitting, entertaining, studying storage, all quite a challenge.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We think it&#039;s going to be really good and we&#039;re very excited about the whole project.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We had some further conversation and after some thought we sent more comments.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> We have some views on the overall colour scheme.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We really like the tiny details you added to the house in Kritsa using coloured tiles.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t want to restrict your palette but would like something similar using plain etched textured patterned glass.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Using occasional details in textured translucent or metallic mosaic tiles in natural neutral white cream light or dark grey.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> In elks or shell stone rather than bright colours.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> This is because we like to change the colours in our home.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> If a definite colour is used on a fixed object, say the work surface or floor or tile surfaces, we&#039;re likely to get bored with it and we want to change it.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Also, a more neutral palette gives us more options for adding a wider range of colour.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We can add colour with furnishing fabric, household objects, lights, ornaments or accessories.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> These can be changed as and when we want to.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But to create the interest in more permanent features by limiting colour but interest in textures and finishes.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not asking for bland but this will give you loads of scope to create something beautiful.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So that floor surfaces, shelves, glass, work tops and tiling will be light.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Neutral colours and accessories using brighter colours can be changed when required against the neutral backdrop of the house.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Finishes.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Although much of the house will have a modern look with glass, modern materials and lighting.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We talked of using some old wood from the house, perhaps as cupboard doors to use some of the previous history of the house.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> This could be stained or colour washed or varnished over bleached paint.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Light and power.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This needs to be sufficient and flexible for living, working and to zone areas.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> For example, the kitchen ground floor social area where feasible, energy efficient, low wattage or LEDs should be used.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Ground floor.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> One of Marina&#039;s plans showed a double front door which would be space saving within the thickness of the exterior walls.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The new high level window for the bathroom could be constructed to include a shelf and some other storage is needed in the bathroom, perhaps in a niche or under the sink.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Ground floor windows.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Privacy should be maintained by use of mirrored glass.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Kitchen work surface.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Sufficient overhang should exist to avoid any diagonal lines being visible from appliances or storage below.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The new metallic pole to support the glass staircase could be utilised to clamp on an organic shaped curved tabletop that could be raised up to the ceiling and incorporated in 12 volts step down powered lighting unit.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The social seating area could be cut back on the right hand side to give clearer access and be level with the staircase glass.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The storage under this seating would be most useful.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Back wall niche to incorporate a row of glass bricks.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> First floor.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Lint niches on the right hand side wall up the stairs.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> In the front wall a long cupboard niche to be created with doors for storage, doors in recovered wood.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> A full glass top to roof shelves to be created out of glass, not coloured.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Back wall wardrobe storage to include drop down work surfaces for use at sitting height as desks.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Two double sockets within each at work surface level.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Bed sofa to be either board or constructed and will be against the front or left hand side wall leaving a clear view of the glass stairwell.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Sun terrace.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Sink for washing with tap on the top sun terrace could be on the floor in the top right hand corner.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Windows into the first floor room from the sun terrace.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The plan for the first floor when it arrived echoed some of the features of the ground floor plans.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Stone wall niches with lights, the use of structural iron bars and glass.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The most interesting feature was a proposal for a glass panel to the ground floor below a spiral staircase attached to a metal pole that went down through the building to the back on the left hand side of the ground floor seating area.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The spiral would go up to the new roof terrace.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The spiral staircase was described as a light well topped by a glass roof hatch.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> This would bring light down through the building.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> One night a short time later my mobile rang.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, are you at home?</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It was Manos.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be sending you a fax.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve changed the plans.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> New ideas.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You will see.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Ring me when it arrives.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I hope you like it and we will talk later.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Cooking the evening meal was put on hold.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The inbox was scanned for fax notification and after a short wrestle with the laptop a four page fax was printed out.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> New ideas certainly.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The roof terrace would have a glass floor to go with the glass hatch and a glass spiral staircase.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Further closer examination of the plans revealed a partial glass floor in the first floor room as well.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The plan was annotated to bring light to the ground floor.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The spiral stairs had been moved to a different corner of the building but it made more sense there.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be amazing but was there a sudden glut of plate glass in Crete?</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It would certainly be light but would heat be a problem?</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was to be discussed.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We call back.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We love it.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But you need to think about it and the colour.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Here&#039;s a website link.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You will see examples there with glass blocks that can be used on the terrace walls.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The colours could be interesting.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Let me know what you think of the colours.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> We are now blocked until you speak to me.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We will proceed with other parts of the plan.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The niches etc.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, do you know about kumquats?</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We answered yes.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Nervously.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you make marmalade or confiture with kumquats?</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I have many of them outside my window.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The conversation was taking a Cretan turn.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> There was much to consider even before the question of kumquat chutney.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We eventually recommended using a bottling of the surplus.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps in Brandew or Metaxa.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you tried this?</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well no.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t exactly get snowed under with kumquats in Sussex.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Or Metaxa come to that.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We have talked enough.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The phone went dead.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Still it felt like progress of sorts.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The next spring visit.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The first visit of this year was an opportunity to stay in a house that had already been renovated.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Impressively, this was the one we&#039;d visited by torchlight only six months previously.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We arranged to meet with Manos in a cafe near the office in the port.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> After a daytime flight, we found ourselves in the cafe above the new marina.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Enjoying a very welcome cooling drink.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He arrived late and flustered and welcomed us with a flurry of sorrys and bristly double cheek kiss each.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s been hectic in the office today.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Less hectic, I quietly and unkindly thought to myself now that you&#039;re here with us and not still there.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We had some more drinks and after Manos had relaxed and briefly discussed some of his plans for our house,</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> it was agreed we would follow him in our hire car up to the renovated house in the hills.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just as well that we did.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d previously been driven there in the dark and I doubt that I would have found it again in the rabbit warren of streets and alleyways.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Eventually we drove up at the side of a large storm drain</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and after parking the cars crossed over into the track.</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> To our right at the end of a small street was a smart new green stained wooden door</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> set in a newly pointed stone wall with a newly plastered wall over it.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the house, come in said Manos unlocking the door.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d only seen the house once before the renovation works in the dark by torchlight.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d been a transformation, the inside was bright and airy, a mix of plastered and original stone walls,</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> there were lots of modern lights, a fitted kitchen and interesting objects and furniture.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Manos opened the fridge and took out a bottle of wine and opening it said,</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> please make yourself at home here, use the food and drink, they are for you</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and let me know of anything that&#039;s missing for comfortable living.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You are the first people to stay here,</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> it will be useful to you in finalising the detailed plans for your house.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We looked around with him, it was such a transformation and the layout was so interesting.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> On the ground floor was one long room with a glass door at each end,</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> screened by a translucent curtain.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> At one end there was a comfortable sitting area with a large coloured sofa bed next to a coffee table</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and a corner fireplace with a plastered chimney up to the ceiling.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The other end of the room was a fitted kitchen with all the necessary appliances</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> as well as a small dining table cleverly fitted into an alcove.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> A vertical slice of glass gave a glimpse of a small desk and a storage area below the stairs.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> These were off to the left of the main room and ran up past a beautifully exposed stone wall.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> There was only one room on the first floor, the bedroom,</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but there was a useful fitted wardrobe,</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> interesting small windows with shutters in green stained wood to match the front door</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and best of all a door out onto a large roof terrace.</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> This was a great space with plenty of stone seating,</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> places to lie down, a dining table under a shady pergola made of old olive wood and thick canes for the roof.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There was also a tap and a large old stone sink next to a barbecue area.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There were views over the village, neighbouring gardens, the olive groves and the mountains,</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> even a glimpse in the distance of the sea.</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We thought it was perfect and told Manos so.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He was sitably modest and said it was a rushed job, achieved cheaply.</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We were not entirely convinced, there seemed good quality fittings</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and the attention to detail in the finish, but we found this reassuring.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The house lacked for nothing in terms of amenities.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There were two air conditioning units, a power shower, oven, hob, washing machine, satellite TV, DVD and stereo.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> A real home from home with better weather.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We were very impressed and grateful to Manos.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Our frustration at the slow start for our house evaporated, at least for the time being.</div></div></p>
