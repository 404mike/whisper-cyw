Thank you Margaret. So do you want to start with</div><div id="00:00:17.460" class="transcript_line"> how it was being a child during the war, how old you were? Yeah well I was born in</div><div id="00:00:22.680" class="transcript_line"> 1937 so I&#039;d be about seven, wasn&#039;t I? Yes. And I remember, I can remember my father</div><div id="00:00:34.840" class="transcript_line"> coming home in the auxiliary fireman&#039;s uniform when he did his duty there.</div><div id="00:00:43.080" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned the RAF? Yes. Yeah he did want to go in the RAF and was accepted</div><div id="00:00:49.080" class="transcript_line"> but because he worked on munition for Avros in Manchester and they wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> release him so to do his bit for his country he joined the</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> auxiliary fire service and I do remember him coming home and the uniform</div><div id="00:01:08.880" class="transcript_line"> when he&#039;d been on duty with them but I also remember going into there was a</div><div id="00:01:13.600" class="transcript_line"> shelter down the middle of the street, a concrete shelter and soon as the air raid</div><div id="00:01:18.720" class="transcript_line"> went off we all had to run into the, our parents would carry us and get us</div><div id="00:01:25.760" class="transcript_line"> into the shelter and it used to be frightening. Did you feel safe in the shelter?</div><div id="00:01:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Did you hear the bombs falling around you? Was it that close? Yeah I think</div><div id="00:01:37.840" class="transcript_line"> you could a bit you know you were nervous when you heard the</div><div id="00:01:42.920" class="transcript_line"> bombs going you know and you were sort of nervous but once you got into the</div><div id="00:01:49.400" class="transcript_line"> shelter all the neighbours were there together so it eased it a bit you know</div><div id="00:01:53.520" class="transcript_line"> but there was that little bit of fear as a child. So did you have a gas mask?</div><div id="00:01:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes we did we had gas masks and we had to put those on. Were they horrible?</div><div id="00:02:05.560" class="transcript_line"> You just got used to them you know yeah so I had to put a gas mask on. What about things</div><div id="00:02:11.200" class="transcript_line"> like not eating maybe an orange until after the war or bananas? Were they, was</div><div id="00:02:17.080" class="transcript_line"> that a surprise at the end of the war to find all these fruits that you could</div><div id="00:02:20.640" class="transcript_line"> suddenly eat? Yeah yeah you know you couldn&#039;t get anything could you? There were no</div><div id="00:02:25.080" class="transcript_line"> sweets everything was on rationing and it was very rare you can get sweets.</div><div id="00:02:33.120" class="transcript_line"> And fruit? Yeah it was just, it seemed to be a shortage of everything and I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:39.820" class="transcript_line"> think we knew what a banana looked like. So did your mum look after you? Did she</div><div id="00:02:45.420" class="transcript_line"> do any other work for the war? Did she do war effort? She worked all her married</div><div id="00:02:53.060" class="transcript_line"> life but I can&#039;t remember what she did when we were kiddies in the war. She</div><div id="00:02:57.580" class="transcript_line"> perhaps looked after you. She probably took time off you know probably yeah. That&#039;s lovely thank you.</div><div id="00:03:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah my younger sister, well Carol was, she was the youngest so I&#039;m trying to</div><div id="00:03:13.140" class="transcript_line"> think if the war was still on. I&#039;m like, oh Carol was born. So when you were children in</div><div id="00:03:17.500" class="transcript_line"> school you had a saying didn&#039;t you? So it&#039;s a bit naughty because it&#039;s children&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:22.140" class="transcript_line"> talk but would you like to repeat it? Do you think a short term would be offensive in this day and age?</div><div id="00:03:28.500" class="transcript_line"> Well it was then wasn&#039;t it and we can cut it out if it is. Yeah. So what did you all say to each other?</div><div id="00:03:34.580" class="transcript_line"> We were to say to each other if you see a man with a square head run away because it&#039;s a German.</div></div></p>
