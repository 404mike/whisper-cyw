    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Vicki MacDonald in Holy Trinity Church, Landernau, during the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:05.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m talking to Eric Smith, who has memories of his childhood during the war.</div><div id="00:00:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Eric.</div><div id="00:00:11.640" class="transcript_line"> So, where do you want to start?</div><div id="00:00:13.200" class="transcript_line"> What do you want to talk about?</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was born in 1936, so I was almost three years old when the war started.</div><div id="00:00:26.660" class="transcript_line"> We lived in a fairly remote home near the top of the Pennines between Lancashire and</div><div id="00:00:33.740" class="transcript_line"> Yorkshire.</div><div id="00:00:36.140" class="transcript_line"> We had no air raid shelter there, I&#039;m happy to talk about that.</div><div id="00:00:41.700" class="transcript_line"> So when the sirens went to indicate that there were enemy aircraft around, my mother, my</div><div id="00:00:50.020" class="transcript_line"> father and myself, we had to shelter under the table in the living room.</div><div id="00:00:56.140" class="transcript_line"> That was the only â€“ the house was a stone-built house.</div><div id="00:01:02.340" class="transcript_line"> I do clearly remember one night the sirens went off.</div><div id="00:01:08.100" class="transcript_line"> We did go under the table and two bombs dropped close by, shaking the house.</div><div id="00:01:13.940" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was going to collapse.</div><div id="00:01:17.100" class="transcript_line"> I can remember that this was in the middle of the night.</div><div id="00:01:21.460" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I&#039;d be about four years old, I suppose.</div><div id="00:01:26.060" class="transcript_line"> I remember going out and standing on the edge of the craters made by the bombs because they</div><div id="00:01:31.020" class="transcript_line"> landed in fields near where we lived.</div><div id="00:01:35.300" class="transcript_line"> I can still remember standing on the edge and looking down into the crater.</div><div id="00:01:40.120" class="transcript_line"> No people were killed, but a lot of chickens and hens were at the time, but we lived in</div><div id="00:01:46.340" class="transcript_line"> the country then.</div><div id="00:01:48.340" class="transcript_line"> So your father was in an occupation?</div><div id="00:01:51.940" class="transcript_line"> My father was in what was called a reserved occupation.</div><div id="00:01:55.100" class="transcript_line"> So he wasn&#039;t called up for military service in that sense because he worked in a textile</div><div id="00:02:03.980" class="transcript_line"> mill which made the cloth for the uniforms for the military.</div><div id="00:02:09.620" class="transcript_line"> You kind of forget things like that, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:02:14.620" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t leave that occupation either.</div><div id="00:02:19.260" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t particularly care for the work he did, but that&#039;s what he&#039;d been brought</div><div id="00:02:24.340" class="transcript_line"> up to do since leaving school.</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it was reserved, he could not leave until the very end of the war.</div><div id="00:02:34.340" class="transcript_line"> On the very first day after the end of the war, he did in fact leave and move to another</div><div id="00:02:39.540" class="transcript_line"> job.</div><div id="00:02:41.100" class="transcript_line"> As indeed, there were coal miners and people like that who had to work.</div><div id="00:02:47.020" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t move to another job.</div><div id="00:02:50.060" class="transcript_line"> He did his bit though in the evenings.</div><div id="00:02:52.500" class="transcript_line"> You said you moved?</div><div id="00:02:53.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he did move a little nearer to the mill where he worked and a little more populated</div><div id="00:02:59.700" class="transcript_line"> area.</div><div id="00:03:02.820" class="transcript_line"> In order to help the fire brigade, what was formed called the Auxiliary Fire Service,</div><div id="00:03:12.380" class="transcript_line"> which later became the National Fire Service.</div><div id="00:03:15.980" class="transcript_line"> So my father was not only working during the day, in the evening he was called out to put</div><div id="00:03:22.420" class="transcript_line"> fires out and to train and do all the things, learning how to tie knots and things.</div><div id="00:03:29.340" class="transcript_line"> I can remember my father having the book showing how to do these things that firemen</div><div id="00:03:37.140" class="transcript_line"> have to do, etc.</div><div id="00:03:38.620" class="transcript_line"> So did he go out most nights?</div><div id="00:03:41.580" class="transcript_line"> No, only when he was caught really.</div><div id="00:03:44.700" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I don&#039;t actually recall him going out to where a bomb had dropped, for example,</div><div id="00:03:52.620" class="transcript_line"> Nevertheless, there were fires and he went to a very big mill fire, a huge fire.</div><div id="00:04:00.260" class="transcript_line"> But nevertheless, he had to be available.</div><div id="00:04:02.060" class="transcript_line"> He was on call, shall we say.</div><div id="00:04:04.580" class="transcript_line"> And your mother, was she working also in the cellar?</div><div id="00:04:09.220" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:04:10.220" class="transcript_line"> She looked after...</div><div id="00:04:12.420" class="transcript_line"> She stopped working and was at home with me at the end of the war.</div><div id="00:04:18.660" class="transcript_line"> So they both survived the war and life went on?</div><div id="00:04:21.900" class="transcript_line"> Yes, indeed.</div><div id="00:04:22.900" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:04:23.900" class="transcript_line"> Good to know.</div><div id="00:04:24.900" class="transcript_line"> I can remember, obviously, afterwards you can look back and think what did I miss?</div><div id="00:04:32.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s silly little things.</div><div id="00:04:34.220" class="transcript_line"> I used to see railway trains and it said on the side, Palethorpe&#039;s sausages.</div><div id="00:04:40.420" class="transcript_line"> Now I had not the slightest idea what a sausage was because I&#039;d never actually heard or seen</div><div id="00:04:47.580" class="transcript_line"> of sausages and things like that.</div><div id="00:04:49.900" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, but it was an odd thing.</div><div id="00:04:53.020" class="transcript_line"> There were other things that were fairly common.</div><div id="00:04:56.420" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, many people can tell you about, I&#039;d never seen a banana before and I wonder</div><div id="00:05:02.500" class="transcript_line"> what the...</div><div id="00:05:03.500" class="transcript_line"> I saw someone in a cinema queue eating this strange curved fruit and I went home and said</div><div id="00:05:09.660" class="transcript_line"> to my mother, I&#039;ve seen someone eating a strange curved fruit.</div><div id="00:05:12.980" class="transcript_line"> She says, oh yes, that will be a banana.</div><div id="00:05:16.100" class="transcript_line"> Simple little things.</div><div id="00:05:18.300" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Eric.</div></div></p>
