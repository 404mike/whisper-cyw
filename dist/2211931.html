they teach us like we can do something we are able</div><div id="00:25:02.500" class="transcript_line"> is because before we just listening you can&#039;t do this you can&#039;t do that this is what but</div><div id="00:25:09.300" class="transcript_line"> when we are here now we have that ability that we can say yes I can do something or I can share</div><div id="00:25:19.140" class="transcript_line"> something or we was just scared you know can&#039;t do anything somebody have to be with us no</div><div id="00:25:29.460" class="transcript_line"> now even we are alone but we can manage everything by ourselves we can also advise others and help</div><div id="00:25:39.300" class="transcript_line"> them what they can able to do yeah you&#039;re experts in your experience

class="transcript_line"> ability and skills to do something but they skate like English language is the barrier for</div><div id="00:26:27.540" class="transcript_line"> them to do something but but here they are helping with courses and supporting women so</div><div id="00:26:38.260" class="transcript_line"> they can do so I just encourage them to do something rather than sitting that&#039;s why</div><div id="00:26:44.740" class="transcript_line"> we go to the groups where they can teach sewing they can learn with it and IT for the women</div><div id="00:26:52.980" class="transcript_line"> so we do that yeah do you have any other hopes for the future of what you&#039;d like like to do</div><div id="00:27:03.060" class="transcript_line"> for the future I want to be like do something for the ladies who cannot able to</div><div id="00:27:10.100" class="transcript_line"> do anything you know so we do some like run communities or help them to improve</div><div id="00:27:22.260" class="transcript_line"> and get confident that they can do something</div><div id="00:27:28.260" class="transcript_line"> is there anything else you&#039;d like to share I know it&#039;s 10-2 now you have to leave but</div><div id="00:27:32.820" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s okay thank you so much</div></div></p>
