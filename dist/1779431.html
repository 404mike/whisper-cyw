    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> going to turn this on. So this is on. So I&#039;m just going to say my name is Marcia Omani</div><div id="00:00:05.360" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m with Stephanie Davis, Kristin Delivia Davis, Olivia Baker Jones and we are at Stephanie&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> home in Rumney or at Marshfields. Oh it&#039;s Rumney in this area. Yes, yes. And it&#039;s Monday the 25th</div><div id="00:00:24.160" class="transcript_line"> of February 2019 I believe. I think that&#039;s a date. Okay then Stephanie, first of all thank you so much</div><div id="00:00:33.040" class="transcript_line"> for allowing me to come to your home today. Oh sure. And so what were you christened as?</div><div id="00:00:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Let me see, Olivia Stephanie Baker Jones but I was always called Stephanie. They didn&#039;t seem to use</div><div id="00:00:49.200" class="transcript_line"> the other. My father had the name Baker, he was a Baker Jones. Yeah. But I was born</div><div id="00:01:01.520" class="transcript_line"> just down the road from here, across the main road and into Hendra Road. Yeah. And there was a house</div><div id="00:01:09.440" class="transcript_line"> there that we lived in. It was called Hendra Vach and they, my, I think when my parents got married</div><div id="00:01:20.960" class="transcript_line"> they moved in there and my father did the place up but I think they only lived there. Well it must</div><div id="00:01:28.640" class="transcript_line"> have been about a year because I can remember asking my mother, how old was I when we moved to</div><div id="00:01:34.800" class="transcript_line"> the farm in Rumney and she said I was 12 months old. Gosh. So initially I don&#039;t remember too much</div><div id="00:01:43.600" class="transcript_line"> about the house. We moved over into the farm, upper Newton Farm it was called in Rumney and</div><div id="00:01:53.680" class="transcript_line"> we moved in there. It must have been, what let me see, doing about 1929, 1930.</div><div id="00:02:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Must have been. Do you remind me asking how old you are Stephanie? I&#039;m 90.</div><div id="00:02:11.920" class="transcript_line"> Only recently 90 this past last year. Goodness you don&#039;t look 90 do you?</div><div id="00:02:17.360" class="transcript_line"> No. I say to people don&#039;t remind me. I just have.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes we moved. I can&#039;t remember too much of my early childhood down there</div><div id="00:02:34.400" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;d been so young moving in there. I must have been a year old and we lived,</div><div id="00:02:45.280" class="transcript_line"> because this was just before the war you see as well and I had my parents, we had a,</div><div id="00:02:55.440" class="transcript_line"> they had another child. My sister was born four years after me you know. What was her name? And</div><div id="00:03:04.080" class="transcript_line"> we lived, lived down in the farm then and it was not too much to do really.</div><div id="00:03:15.600" class="transcript_line"> It was, my father hadn&#039;t had, he used to live, the family, there&#039;s a farm down in St. Melonshire</div><div id="00:03:24.560" class="transcript_line"> that where the family lived. He lived there with his parents and what was it three brothers and</div><div id="00:03:31.600" class="transcript_line"> his sister and he started a bit of farming then. What was your father&#039;s name? Wilfred, Wilfred Baker</div><div id="00:03:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Jones. So he comes from, he came from farming stock? Yes, yes his parents, yes my grandparents</div><div id="00:03:51.520" class="transcript_line"> grandfather was farming down there. Is where the way you come up now down the road and up here</div><div id="00:03:59.600" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a big house called Teecock and that was the family home.</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> And I spent a lot of my childhood down there. At your grandparents farm? And what? At your</div><div id="00:04:13.280" class="transcript_line"> grandparents farm. Oh yes, yes, yes. It wasn&#039;t huge I don&#039;t suppose. The house was big but then</div><div id="00:04:22.880" class="transcript_line"> all the land was down there because it&#039;s all been built on now you see, there&#039;s all masses of houses</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> everywhere. So I was just looking at the view just now and it&#039;s been developed. What did it look like</div><div id="00:04:37.760" class="transcript_line"> when you were a child, if you were stood here as a child? Well I can&#039;t remember too much as a child</div><div id="00:04:43.200" class="transcript_line"> but I know when we first came here we moved in here about 1960s, Cathy was born that year.</div><div id="00:04:52.160" class="transcript_line"> There was of course there were hardly any houses then you just looked out, it was just a lot of</div><div id="00:05:04.320" class="transcript_line"> fields but since in the past 60 years it has been built on quite a lot you know.</div><div id="00:05:15.360" class="transcript_line"> And even above the road down it&#039;s a main road now but when we moved in it was a very narrow</div><div id="00:05:22.400" class="transcript_line"> country lane. What&#039;s it really? I can&#039;t believe that you know it&#039;s all built up now.</div><div id="00:05:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So tell me about your grandparents farm. What did they do, what did they farm? Oh it was</div><div id="00:05:40.080" class="transcript_line"> oh it was just cows milking herds really that was all, I don&#039;t know whether.</div><div id="00:05:47.600" class="transcript_line"> There was a market garden as well? Yes there was a market garden I was just going to say that</div><div id="00:05:54.960" class="transcript_line"> and my father he was the eldest of the children and he left school I think as young as 12 or 14</div><div id="00:06:08.880" class="transcript_line"> because and then he used to he used to I think he must have had started up a milk around from there</div><div id="00:06:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and used to go round with a horse and cart, chins of milk and around here not so much not here really</div><div id="00:06:32.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean you know where we are now there was absolutely nothing here I mean this was this</div><div id="00:06:39.280" class="transcript_line"> ground here where the all these houses are it was fields and we used to make</div><div id="00:06:46.720" class="transcript_line"> my father used to come up here hay making you know really yeah it was just a field</div><div id="00:06:53.840" class="transcript_line"> and there was just one</div><div id="00:06:58.480" class="transcript_line"> it was a big house up the top which some a couple lived it was a brother and sister</div><div id="00:07:06.080" class="transcript_line"> oh it was the name Davis I can&#039;t remember though let me see</div><div id="00:07:14.160" class="transcript_line"> let me see</div><div id="00:07:18.480" class="transcript_line"> yes a brother and sister that lived in a big house up the top and eventually of course this</div><div id="00:07:26.960" class="transcript_line"> land belonged to them and bit by bit they sold it all the houses you know but</div><div id="00:07:33.840" class="transcript_line"> yes and down well I suppose the actual time on the farm has got to be the one down in Rumney</div><div id="00:07:48.640" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s your father&#039;s farm yes my father&#039;s farm upper Newton farm it was there were three farms</div><div id="00:07:56.240" class="transcript_line"> together upper Newton middle Newton lower Newton and so you upper Newton was elevated you could</div><div id="00:08:07.280" class="transcript_line"> see well it was the first one that came you came to it was all on the flat really but it was just</div><div id="00:08:14.080" class="transcript_line"> the day with the first ones I forget who owned the land I&#039;m trying to think that yes it was I</div><div id="00:08:21.120" class="transcript_line"> was just going to say to do with Tredegar House so was he a tenant farmer or did he buy well he was</div><div id="00:08:30.400" class="transcript_line"> he was a tenant farmer yes to start off with and eventually then he did get to to own it</div><div id="00:08:44.080" class="transcript_line"> it was a lot a lot of the farms were all being sold off you know eventually</div><div id="00:08:49.520" class="transcript_line"> but it was a long way out from the local village or to get anywhere was it oh it was</div><div id="00:09:00.240" class="transcript_line"> we were you know we had no transport in those days we had bicycles we cycled everywhere or we</div><div id="00:09:11.520" class="transcript_line"> everywhere or we walked everywhere I suppose it must have been a couple of miles from there</div><div id="00:09:19.440" class="transcript_line"> up into the village of rumney that was our nearest village and</div><div id="00:09:28.320" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d go there any shops or shopping we did or the church we went to was all in rumney you know</div><div id="00:09:37.040" class="transcript_line"> but it wasn&#039;t huge because it was</div><div id="00:09:44.240" class="transcript_line"> well just before the war really you know that&#039;s all I remember a bit before I can remember</div><div id="00:09:52.720" class="transcript_line"> during the war I can remember standing out on the yards in the in the at the farm</div><div id="00:10:03.680" class="transcript_line"> at the farm at in the evenings or at night time and listening to the the german planes going over</div><div id="00:10:13.280" class="transcript_line"> really and the search lights working there was a search light battery in one of the fields nearby</div><div id="00:10:22.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah and then another lot there was a a gun emplacement you know in another they parked</div><div id="00:10:31.840" class="transcript_line"> them around all the farms down there you know but it was only I mean it wasn&#039;t a huge farm because</div><div id="00:10:42.080" class="transcript_line"> my father had maybe 10 or 12 cows that he&#039;d have to milk every day well then he had a horse and cart</div><div id="00:10:52.800" class="transcript_line"> and he had a milk round and he</div><div id="00:10:59.600" class="transcript_line"> had I often wondered what time he got up to milk in the morning to get it done so that he could</div><div id="00:11:06.800" class="transcript_line"> take it out on the milk run because he very often used to give me a lift up to school in rumney so</div><div id="00:11:13.120" class="transcript_line"> it must have been earliest what on the horse and cart in the yes really gosh yes I from the farm</div><div id="00:11:21.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d ever lift up into the village he dropped me off in the village and then I&#039;d walk the rest of</div><div id="00:11:27.120" class="transcript_line"> the way then to school and so would he have a churn on the cart and you have a jug yes he did</div><div id="00:11:38.800" class="transcript_line"> yes there were no milk bottles in those days it was a churn churn full of milk as you say</div><div id="00:11:47.040" class="transcript_line"> um that had a it was a measuring can that he used to use and um</div><div id="00:11:56.320" class="transcript_line"> very often when he&#039;d go then he I think he may have had a few customers in rumney but then used</div><div id="00:12:04.080" class="transcript_line"> to go on across to what is now oh the main road through into the roth area</div><div id="00:12:15.040" class="transcript_line"> had a lot of customers around there and of course what he did as you said he had a thing</div><div id="00:12:21.840" class="transcript_line"> a measuring thing that he would uh scoop up the milk from the churn and um people would bring</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> either bring their jugs out or bring a basin for that matter and he filled the basin up gosh</div><div id="00:12:39.680" class="transcript_line"> and certainly when I can remember that what about your mother what was her name</div><div id="00:12:46.400" class="transcript_line"> oh olive olive olive yes where did they meet your she didn&#039;t well I&#039;m not so sure I have I</div><div id="00:12:55.360" class="transcript_line"> remember asking friends but I think they met up at what I would think would be the local</div><div id="00:13:03.840" class="transcript_line"> tennis club oh yes the 10 in rumney my mother was from rumney my father was a melons yeah</div><div id="00:13:12.160" class="transcript_line"> and I think the two got together the tennis club you know goodness so is that quite an active club</div><div id="00:13:19.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it must have been I didn&#039;t know too much about it but uh yes was she from a farming family</div><div id="00:13:27.600" class="transcript_line"> no she didn&#039;t she actually was born in bristol</div><div id="00:13:33.280" class="transcript_line"> and she had two sisters and they were born in bristol and they all used to live in uh</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> what was a cottage a place over in rumney that is only recently closed down as the local doctor&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:47.360" class="transcript_line"> place but um her

I think there really wasn&#039;t much work over there so they came back to rumney to find work over here</div><div id="00:14:26.960" class="transcript_line"> because they knew that they had some of the family were here they lived with them</div><div id="00:14:31.600" class="transcript_line"> initially moved in with the family</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and then they

class="transcript_line"> whether or not the house might have collapsed so he got us out</div><div id="00:29:01.680" class="transcript_line"> dragged us over the local the little gates we had there because the blast had uh</div><div id="00:29:09.120" class="transcript_line"> jammed the gate shut and we couldn&#039;t open it gosh so my father had to lift us all over</div><div id="00:29:15.920" class="transcript_line"> and we all went across the yard down on the road down to the next farm</div><div id="00:29:22.960" class="transcript_line"> and we knocked them up and said oh we&#039;ve just been bombed so they took us in there and i think</div><div id="00:29:28.960" class="transcript_line"> we did stay a couple of nights there gosh it&#039;s amazing Stephanie talking about this</div><div id="00:29:37.280" class="transcript_line"> incredible story you always take it in your stride</div><div id="00:29:44.800" class="transcript_line"> but was there much damage did you lose any animals we did one animal oh no</div><div id="00:29:51.360" class="transcript_line"> calves they were a couple of calves i think were killed but there was one cow that had been</div><div id="00:30:01.280" class="transcript_line"> chained up in one of the sheds who with a blast she was blown blown out they found her wandering</div><div id="00:30:08.880" class="transcript_line"> up around the field the next morning with the chain around her neck still alive yes alive</div><div id="00:30:16.720" class="transcript_line"> how amazing how amazing gosh yes it was amazing</div><div id="00:30:30.480" class="transcript_line"> what did she say oh i mean the cow had post-traumatic stress</div><div id="00:30:37.040" class="transcript_line"> oh yes yeah so was it business as usual you went back home well yeah you had to really i mean</div><div id="00:30:44.320" class="transcript_line"> i seem to remember we stayed a couple of nights with the people next door</div><div id="00:30:49.200" class="transcript_line"> and then from there we moved over to where my mother&#039;s other sister and her husband family lived</div><div id="00:30:56.720" class="transcript_line"> over in cattletown in well code curnew yeah i came through it coming here yes there was a house</div><div id="00:31:05.520" class="transcript_line"> and farm there that they were so i think we had a few nights there with them</div><div id="00:31:10.240" class="transcript_line"> um because i can remember getting a bus the next morning must have had some clothes with us and</div><div id="00:31:17.440" class="transcript_line"> i was at that time going to school in town i went to our ladies conference school so i</div><div id="00:31:24.720" class="transcript_line"> got the bus from code curnew into town and knocked the school door and said oh we&#039;ve been bombed</div><div id="00:31:33.840" class="transcript_line"> out and they said oh yes we have as well they they&#039;d had the fire fire there was burnt a lot of</div><div id="00:31:41.280" class="transcript_line"> other the school away yes there was a lot of bomb damage i think that particular time night</div><div id="00:31:50.400" class="transcript_line"> but then eventually we got back to rumney and we had um there was</div><div id="00:31:58.240" class="transcript_line"> uh the farm what was it called</div><div id="00:32:06.720" class="transcript_line"> peter may peter may they were billeted the farm where the prices lived long cross long cross farm</div><div id="00:32:16.240" class="transcript_line"> yeah we moved in with them yeah and it was through there was a what they called a billet</div><div id="00:32:24.480" class="transcript_line"> billeting yeah a billeting manager they had to find a place anybody bombed out they had to find</div><div id="00:32:31.520" class="transcript_line"> accommodation for them okay and they found us accommodation there yeah that&#039;s that&#039;s the farm</div><div id="00:32:38.560" class="transcript_line"> where these people lived and we were living there i think about a at least a year oh really yes so</div><div id="00:32:46.000" class="transcript_line"> what happened to why if your house was intact so why why did you leave your farm was there just</div><div id="00:32:53.200" class="transcript_line"> too much damage i think so well my father didn&#039;t want to stay there i think he felt that</div><div id="00:33:00.960" class="transcript_line"> because of the you know everything seemed to have got loose in the house he felt that the house could</div><div id="00:33:06.640" class="transcript_line"> collapse on us you know yeah that it wasn&#039;t but we were lucky eventually after staying a year about</div><div id="00:33:16.160" class="transcript_line"> long cross the other there was another farm before you got a long cross this was ceter bain farm</div><div id="00:33:24.320" class="transcript_line"> which was there next to that house there was a a searchlight battery and i think the man had lived</div><div id="00:33:34.960" class="transcript_line"> there i think he he&#039;d managed to get out he&#039;d had enough of it he didn&#039;t want to stay there any longer</div><div id="00:33:41.280" class="transcript_line"> he moved somewhere up the i can&#039;t remember where over the back of some islands</div><div id="00:33:49.360" class="transcript_line"> and put his house up for sale and my father bought the house there</div><div id="00:33:54.240" class="transcript_line"> and land and we moved in there and we were there ever since until my father died gosh</div><div id="00:34:01.200" class="transcript_line"> so was that still in robinney well it was just a few yards up the road from where we were</div><div id="00:34:07.840" class="transcript_line"> when we bombed out oh gosh so yeah so it was rumney really yes what happened to your old</div><div id="00:34:14.080" class="transcript_line"> newton upper newton farm well we well we didn&#039;t do anything with it and it was used my father did</div><div id="00:34:22.080" class="transcript_line"> use it for a certain length of time um with cattle there and i think he obviously was able to milk</div><div id="00:34:31.760" class="transcript_line"> the cows i think from there but eventually it was moved most of it back up to teter main when</div><div id="00:34:38.720" class="transcript_line"> we were and was that still within sight of the seawall or was that yes yes it is</div><div id="00:34:45.760" class="transcript_line"> yes i mean we were there seawall was there we were there upper newton and it was just one or two</div><div id="00:34:52.480" class="transcript_line"> fields up and then there was ceter bain there&#039;s a few houses around around there so as a child you</div><div id="00:35:01.280" class="transcript_line"> probably aren&#039;t aware of the pressures your parents were under finding a home and keeping</div><div id="00:35:07.120" class="transcript_line"> money coming in it must have been yes hard for your parents yes so i tried already had some</div><div id="00:35:14.960"

id="00:51:36.880" class="transcript_line"> but my father would</div><div id="00:51:42.160" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d if he wanted to we&#039;d he&#039;d kill a chicken for christmas you know</div><div id="00:51:50.800" class="transcript_line"> christmas time the chickens were really valuable and he&#039;d kill one and</div><div id="00:51:55.920" class="transcript_line"> feather it and i can remember feathering it yes did you and then</div><div id="00:52:00.800" class="transcript_line"> yes they would kill them and the ducks and we were</div><div id="00:52:10.240" class="transcript_line"> it was very useful really because during the war food was rationed yeah and we had our own</div><div id="00:52:18.960" class="transcript_line"> as i said dad would kill christmas time he&#039;d kill a chicken or kill a duck and</div><div id="00:52:25.600" class="transcript_line"> i think he even they were allowed to kill one pig a year for food</div><div id="00:52:34.320" class="transcript_line"> was there a village pig killer who used to come oh there was somebody who came around</div><div id="00:52:44.960" class="transcript_line"> yes they were and</div><div id="00:52:49.120" class="transcript_line"> so nothing was wasted no not really no no no we certainly did very well for food you know although</div><div id="00:52:54.560" class="transcript_line"> it was rationed during the war did your mother do lots of bottling of fruit and vegetables</div><div id="00:53:01.360" class="transcript_line"> they did a certain amount yes</div><div id="00:53:05.520" class="transcript_line"> yes because we did have those bottles that you could get the jars killed their jars yes that&#039;s</div><div id="00:53:12.720" class="transcript_line"> right that you could preserve the fruit or whatever in the well for food you know although it was</div><div id="00:53:21.280" class="transcript_line"> rationed during the war did your mother do lots of bottling of fruit and vegetables they did a</div><div id="00:53:28.480" class="transcript_line"> kill no jobs yes that&#039;s right that you could</div><div id="00:53:33.360" class="transcript_line"> preserve the fruit or whatever in</div><div id="00:53:40.960" class="transcript_line"> so do you do you see yourself as a welsh woman or a woman of the levels or the malls</div><div id="00:53:50.240" class="transcript_line"> i don&#039;t have no thought about either really</div><div id="00:53:53.520" class="transcript_line"> you just give me a sense of how much this area has changed stephanie because</div><div id="00:54:01.280" class="transcript_line"> i mean it must have been really moral once was it well there is um oh it&#039;s built upon now you see</div><div id="00:54:08.880" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t it i mean as i said this this place here where all these houses are built was</div><div id="00:54:16.000" class="transcript_line"> uh</div><div id="00:54:19.600" class="transcript_line"> it it was used to cut yeah they cut the grass make hay from it because it was my uncle that</div><div id="00:54:28.080" class="transcript_line"> used to do it he used to look after cutting the hay this field here and the one next to it</div><div id="00:54:34.560" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes my father would come up and help him you know and i can remember dancing around on</div><div id="00:54:41.120" class="transcript_line"> around on almost the road out here and it was hay we was uh that we were dancing on sort of</div><div id="00:54:49.520" class="transcript_line"> thing you know really oh yes but and and because the road down below it&#039;s really a main road down</div><div id="00:54:59.200" class="transcript_line"> there now but it used to be a very narrow country road not much traffic no not much traffic um even</div><div id="00:55:08.400" class="transcript_line"> when we moved in here and there were no buses to get for them to get to school they used to send a</div><div id="00:55:16.240" class="transcript_line"> lorry or a van up here in which leslie and kathy would get in and they take them to school and</div><div id="00:55:24.880" class="transcript_line"> and bring them back in the afternoon but um so do you know the levels on the other side of the usk</div><div id="00:55:34.880" class="transcript_line"> do you know that area very much no</div><div id="00:55:39.600" class="transcript_line"> no i don&#039;t really</div><div id="00:55:43.440" class="transcript_line"> what did she say they&#039;re better on this side no</div><div id="00:55:48.400" class="transcript_line"> because he&#039;s so built up over here we&#039;re right at the limit aren&#039;t we</div><div id="00:55:53.920" class="transcript_line"> right yeah</div><div id="00:55:59.520" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s more built up here yes yes it&#039;s always been uh that main road has always been there</div><div id="00:56:09.040" class="transcript_line"> but they have since since my childhood days they were they made it wider and cost a lot more houses</div><div id="00:56:19.120" class="transcript_line"> along there now when i was in school over in remny they were oh very few houses one odd</div><div id="00:56:30.240" class="transcript_line"> house here and there along the main road you know and then all of a sudden they started</div><div id="00:56:36.160" class="transcript_line"> widening the road and building more houses and that&#039;s how remny was extended</div><div id="00:56:43.280" class="transcript_line"> it you&#039;ve got amazing views from here though haven&#039;t you yes yes if only i could appreciate</div><div id="00:56:50.720"

don&#039;t know what&#039;s happened to them</div><div id="00:57:34.640" class="transcript_line"> um so if there&#039;s anything you&#039;d like to add stephanie i haven&#039;t asked you about</div><div id="00:57:42.640" class="transcript_line"> as a teenager on the levels and remny what did you do oh i never really appreciated</div><div id="00:57:51.440" class="transcript_line"> time

class="transcript_line"> newly built wimpy&#039;s was the name of the builders i don&#039;t know whether they&#039;re around now so where</div><div id="01:01:02.480" class="transcript_line"> had you moved from to come here oh we after when we were first married we lived down on the farm</div><div id="01:01:09.200" class="transcript_line"> with my parents for about a year yeah but i i wanted to get out i wanted to be near a town</div><div id="01:01:17.280" class="transcript_line"> so we discovered that where i was working in a bank in lord&#039;s bank and there was some guy there</div><div id="01:01:24.960" class="transcript_line"> was living in a flat in town and he was about to move out told me about it so i said oh we&#039;ll see</div><div id="01:01:32.320" class="transcript_line"> see if we can have it you know yeah we did so we had a flat there not far from</div><div id="01:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> albany road i think it was and we lived there for seven years actually actually my other daughter</div><div id="01:01:47.920" class="transcript_line"> was born while we were there and then it was when i was expecting cathy that we moved out here</div><div id="01:01:55.920" class="transcript_line"> and what was it like moving in here knowing that your dad had made hay here and stuff</div><div id="01:02:01.040" class="transcript_line"> oh yes i i don&#039;t know i can&#039;t</div><div id="01:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t believe that it happened all those years ago</div><div id="01:02:16.080" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s amazing and with some occasionally we talk about</div><div id="01:02:21.280" class="transcript_line"> because when the original narrow road down here it went up stopped and then it went down round</div><div id="01:02:28.160" class="transcript_line"> bit further down and there was a a water pipe in the road and this water was continually running</div><div id="01:02:40.080" class="transcript_line"> out of this pipe and i think there must have come from over</div><div id="01:02:47.600" class="transcript_line"> i said that the water came from rumney or lan rumney came through</div><div id="01:02:53.600" class="transcript_line"> it must have been something somewhere</div><div id="01:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> because rem well i suppose remney&#039;s got a few old places and amongst them you know yeah did you ever</div><div id="01:03:09.360" class="transcript_line"> go to church as a child yes or chapel we went to the baptist chapel in rumney yeah yes every sunday</div><div id="01:03:18.400" class="transcript_line"> yes we did would you walk up on the farm we&#039;d have to walk and we&#039;d go my sister and i would</div><div id="01:03:24.720" class="transcript_line"> go to sunday school we&#039;d use our bikes then even in the wet weather i can remember</div><div id="01:03:30.800" class="transcript_line"> riding up on my bikes leaving them out the side of the church and go to sunday school</div><div id="01:03:37.680" class="transcript_line"> and then get back home and</div><div id="01:03:42.080" class="transcript_line"> it was amazing i didn&#039;t like it from that point of view i hated having to cycle all the way up</div><div id="01:03:48.080" class="transcript_line"> in all the weather the wet weather and</div><div id="01:03:55.520" class="transcript_line"> but yes it was a rumney baptist that was and there were one or two shops</div><div id="01:04:02.640" class="transcript_line"> rumney it was called rumney village and it was just a village then in those days</div><div id="01:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> so did it have a shop and the baker and the pub yes they did yes yes</div><div id="01:04:19.600" class="transcript_line"> but um it must have been so rural</div><div id="01:04:24.640" class="transcript_line"> yes i mean the this this um</div><div id="01:04:31.440" class="transcript_line"> name on the bus telling you where it&#039;s going was rumney village it wasn&#039;t just rumney it was rumney</div><div id="01:04:38.160" class="transcript_line"> village and it used to come out from town and it would only go into the middle of the village</div><div id="01:04:45.920" class="transcript_line"> they even cut down the length of their journey you know during the war to save uh petrol i suppose</div><div id="01:04:54.640" class="transcript_line"> so as a child did you have electricity in your farmhouse we didn&#039;t in the first farm no</div><div id="01:05:01.840" class="transcript_line"> and we didn&#039;t in the second farm uh no it was oil lamps oh i hated it from that point of view</div><div id="01:05:11.120" class="transcript_line"> but eventually my my father did manage to get they brought the electricity</div><div id="01:05:18.960" class="transcript_line"> by poles so uh so it ended up in the farm next to us and my father used to say well why don&#039;t</div><div id="01:05:28.080" class="transcript_line"> they bring it over here as well uh but we did get it over but my father had to pay it</div><div id="01:05:34.880" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s for it to be brought over that we had electricity in the farm then because they were</div><div id="01:05:40.880" class="transcript_line"> then able to use um electricity for milking the cows you know yeah which happened to know it was</div><div id="01:05:50.800" class="transcript_line"> always hand so when would that have been stephanie would that be in the 40s um or the 50s</div><div id="01:05:58.080" class="transcript_line"> when what when did the electricity come to the farm</div><div id="01:06:04.160" class="transcript_line"> it must have been in the 50s let me see if we were the early 40s that we were bombed out</div><div id="01:06:11.600" class="transcript_line"> and when 39 45 the war ended in the um</div><div id="01:06:17.760" class="transcript_line"> oh maybe maybe in the late 40s then it probably came</div><div id="01:06:28.320" class="transcript_line"> and it was so it made such a difference to the work to have the electricity there</div><div id="01:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> so what had your mother been cooking on was it wood oh she had an oven uh stove</div><div id="01:06:42.640"

top that used to put stuff in to cook</div><div id="01:06:57.760" class="transcript_line"> but there was um oh what was there we did have a</div><div id="01:07:06.960" class="transcript_line">

class="transcript_line"> but eventually we do we used to my father got a stove from somewhere</div><div id="01:07:27.760" class="transcript_line"> and i think we used to have to get it going to use some firewood you know when to get it working</div><div id="01:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> about your water where did your water come from oh</div><div id="01:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> well if we certainly had water on all right anyway i don&#039;t know where it came from</div><div id="01:07:51.200" class="transcript_line"> it certainly certainly had a water supply there</div><div id="01:08:00.960" class="transcript_line"> but even when we moved into that farm there were no electricity there were there was quite a</div><div id="01:08:10.960" class="transcript_line"> let me see one two three there were four very big bedrooms but then we had one of them</div><div id="01:08:19.520" class="transcript_line"> converted into a bathroom gosh and indoor toilet there was no indoor toilets you know</div><div id="01:08:26.720" class="transcript_line"> things like that there&#039;s at the end of the garden yes that was the privy down the garden

dealt with it had to use some</div><div id="01:09:00.720" class="transcript_line"> keep its supplies with oh what was that stuff that they used that sawdust so no no it was</div><div id="01:09:08.160" class="transcript_line"> like a liquid it was like oh i can&#039;t think no</div><div id="01:09:14.480" class="transcript_line"> did you have a chamber pot under the bed yes we did we certainly did i think it was in all the</div><div id="01:09:22.560" class="transcript_line"> bedroom until eventually my father got the you got the local builder came in to alter it and</div><div id="01:09:33.120" class="transcript_line"> put a toilet in and then we did have a more of a toilet out in the garden then</div><div id="01:09:43.120" class="transcript_line"> but yes did you ever experience poachers on

right but they were quite well behaved gypsies actually did they work on the</div><div id="01:10:34.800" class="transcript_line"> farm and no they didn&#039;t know they might remember i mean we did have workers on the farm but i i</div><div id="01:10:43.200" class="transcript_line"> tell oh my father got hold of them there were two one that used to weigh he must have been</div><div
