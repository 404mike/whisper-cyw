    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is another episode, chapter 12 in our continuing story about the race riots in Wales in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is the race riots in Newport, 6th and 7th of June 1919.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The first of the race riots in Wales actually broke out in Newport on the 6th of June when it was alleged that a black man had made an insulting remark to a white woman.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> A white soldier then attacked him. Violence quickly flared as an angry mob of white people began attacking at random all perceived non-white people, who then began retaliating in turn with whatever they had to hand, including sticks, pokers, razors, knives and in some cases revolvers.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It would seem that the most accurate record was actually the one told by the police at the court at the beginning of July 1919 when 8 white men, 1 white woman and 32 black men, semen, were brought before the court.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The following is taken from the Western Mail, 3rd July 1919, as written by their court reporter.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Quote, Constable Nan Carrow said in court that on the 6th of June he saw a crowd of a thousand to fifteen hundred men and youths outside a black men&#039;s boarding house in numbers 3 and 4 George Street.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Stones were being thrown and one of the ringleaders was Gordon Maskell.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They got into the house, smashed the furniture and burnt it on the railway siding. Later reports describe this as a bonfire of kindling and wood.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> According to PC Nan Carrow, Maskell then led the crowd to the Swan Cafe in Commercial Road, which is left at the first intersection off of George Street.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that was wrecked he shouted, now for the Chinese, and they proceeded to 16 Commercial Road, which they damaged and further raids were made on Maskell and William Hunt being the ringleaders.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The constable continued, when arrested Maskell stated, I did it for the benefit of semen, who I am one, and cannot get a job because of the, and we choose not to use this word, N, being here.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve tried other ways, now we intend to take the law into our own hands.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Researching Maskell we find that during the war he was a stoker in the Royal Fleet Reserve on the HMS Ampetrite, which had spent much of the war as a mine layer operating the Northern Atlantic from Portsmouth down the coasts of Portugal, Spain, Morocco and Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He was only discharged three months earlier on the 21st of March 1919 on a disability discharge.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Hunt was to be given an alibi by several members of his family, which resulted in his acquittal.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> In the following days the Western Mail, reporting of the trials, continued under the heading Pandemonium in Potters Parade.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Jeremy Shea, John James Lynn, William Ryan, Mary Ellen Sheedy and William Edgar Reynolds were charged with riotous assembly, assembling together on the 7th of June 1919 in Rupera Street, Bolt Street, Canal Terrace and George Street.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In court Mrs Jane Martimaz of Potters Parade said a crowd assembled outside her house at 10.15pm on June 7th.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs Sheedy shouted, Come out you black N.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She, Mrs Martimaz, closed the door shop, but the crowd started to break out the windows.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> The door was broken open and some men went upstairs and out to the back premises.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Mrs Sheedy told Mrs Martimaz she ought to be burned.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Another witness, William Hastie, gave similar evidence and said that Mrs Sheedy poured paraffin oil out of a bottle onto the windowsill.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Another witness, Edith Schultz of Potters Parade, said the curtains of the house were burnt and she smelt paraffin.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> In researching the riots the only woman we can find that appeared in court as a result of the race riots was Mrs Sheedy.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> William Hastie was also a former soldier, that&#039;s the witness, having been in the Worcester Regiment and invalidated out of the army in 1916 with a British war medal and the victory medal.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> In court, Constable Nancarrow said he saw John Lynn, one of the foremost figures in a hostile crowd of 700-800 people.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Police Constable Griffiths said that he saw Lynn through a stone, through a window in No. 3 Rupera Street.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And Police Sergeant Bailey said William Ryan was shouting to the crowd, Come on boys, let&#039;s have the ends out.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Ryan also smashed some windows. A witness, Alfred Tyler of Canal Terrace, said he saw Reynolds throw a stone and also saw him drag a woman down to the ground by taking hold of her blouse.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The court records show one significant fact that differs from Barry and Cardiff reports.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> White witnesses and others coming forward and appearing in court and as I say those witnesses were local white people.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Western Mail, 5th July 1919.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Percy Samuel White, a coloured soldier of Newport who failed to surrender to his bail, was charged with riotous assembly.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He had been arrested in Bristol.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> PC&#039;s Nancarrow McCauley said he&#039;d been one of the leaders in the racial riots.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three months hard labour.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> If the reporting is correct, White was actually part of the mob attacking black people.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We cannot be sure if that is correct, although it is disturbing if it is.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The events of June 1919 in Newport are even less discussed than Barry and Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Not common knowledge locally and little has been written about them in a hundred years since then.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Only recently has this secret history been published but it&#039;s still not the topic of schoolwork which is a shame for so many reasons.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The black men arrested were all from Sierra Leone and West Africa.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The sentence handed out in court varied.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The following sentences were handed out.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> One bound over for 12 months.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> This is not a criminal conviction and means that if someone misbehaves again they will be dealt with more severely.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Acquitted, found not guilty or no evidence presented.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Sentenced to prison for a specified number of months.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The white rioters, William Haley and John James Lynn were bound over for 12 months as, and we really don&#039;t know why, was Lynn&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Gordon Maskell and Mary Ellen Sheedy, as we said, the only woman to have been brought into court, was sentenced to three months.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> William Ryan was sentenced to two months.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> William George Hunt, Jeremiah Shea and William Edgar Reynolds were acquitted.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Percy Samuel White, as we said, was sentenced to three months hard labour.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The black semen that appeared in court on the 3rd of July 1919 and their sentences will give you their age.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And as far as we know they were all African with only one not being born in Sierra Leone.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> All were charged with riotous assembly.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Only one black semen went to prison.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That was Jack Savage who was aged 22 in 1919.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was sentenced to one month&#039;s hard labour.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Jack Savage obviously stayed connected to Wales because 9th of December 1914, 1943, during World War II, he died on a ship that had steamed out of Cardiff Docks.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He therefore served on the British Merchant Navy in two world wars, dying at the age of 46.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> John Davis was bound over for 12 months.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> At the time of the race riots he was 22 years old.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> For his service in World War I on the Merchant Navy he received a campaign medal.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He is recorded as having been born in Old Calabar, also known as Duke Town, which is now part of southern Nigeria.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 30th of September 1940 he died aboard the SS Heminge, leaving behind his wife Irene in a hull.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He was 43 years old.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Joe Ellis was bound over for 12 months.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Born in Sierra Leone he was 28 in 1919.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> He died in World War II aboard the SS Manchester Brigade on the 27th of September 1940.</div><div id="00:09:40.000"

months.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Tom Savage was bound over for 12 months.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He was born in Sierra Leone and he was 24 in 1919.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> He died in World War II aboard the SS Chilledale on the 17th February 1940.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He had received a campaign medal for his service in World War I.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He was 45 years old and at the time as he&#039;s deaf he lived at 9 Charles Street, Newport.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Also bound over for 12 months were Toby Jackson, age 22, John Brass, age 24, Jack Purser, age 23 and Jacob Brown, age 19.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Charles Brown was bound over for 12 months.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Born in Sierra Leone he was 24 in 1919.</div><div
