    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is the 28th of April 2023 and I&#039;m here at the home of Mrs Pauline Walton at Hazelmere,</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Hazelmere House, Hazelmere Estate in Rairdale.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks very much for inviting me into your home Pauline and I think we&#039;re going to have a very interesting chat from what I can gather.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> First of all, do you mind if I ask you your date of birth?</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The 6th of October 1940.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, thank you very much. Now I understand you&#039;re not originally from Rairdale, you&#039;re very much a native now, but can you tell me a little bit about your early life?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was born and grew up in Clendring de Dwells, down Tremont Road, one of a family of seven children, most of them still alive.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a wonderful upbringing in Clendring Dodd because the great outdoors was your playground.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We had the lake in Clendring Dodd and there used to be boating on the lake and lots of different things going on up there and the rock park, which was a wonderful playground.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I attended the local national school in Clendring Dodd and at the age of 11, I passed my 11 plus to go to the grammar school.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed there until I was 17. I didn&#039;t stay on for my A levels.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to leave because by now my mum and my father had divorced and my mum was bringing up the family on her own.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So I needed to be a breadwinner in the family.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I didn&#039;t go for further education.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I came and worked for the family.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things my sister always tells me that the first new pair of shoes she ever had was when I started work and was able to buy her from Edie&#039;s in Clendring Dodd a little pair of red shoes.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She always reminds me of that.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on, I started to work at the Metropole in Clendring Dodd in the reception and had many wonderful years there working with the Baird Murray family.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were so kind, so helpful.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They always kept in touch with me.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed there until my first born Christian was born.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to give it up, intended to go back.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And within 18 months I was expecting my second child Justin, so I didn&#039;t go back.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, thank you for that introduction.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, let&#039;s find out why you came to Reader all those years ago.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The dances in Clendring Dodd were always held at the Rock Park Centre.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> No alcohol, tea, coffee, sandwiches and cakes by two local ladies.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was always a live band.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> We were very lucky in Clendring Dodd that there was Mr. Samuels and Mr. Sheen.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were always on the QE2, I think it must have been QE1 or QE2 liner over to America.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So they learned, they were a band on board the ship.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They learned all the later songs and everything.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when they came back for a rest, they would go down the Rock Park and play.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was there as a 16-year-old when a young man, well, young man, Cliff was six years older than me, asked me to dance.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I looked at him and in those days you didn&#039;t see many men in beautiful suits,</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> white shirts and tie turned out, you know, they were all a little bit scruffy.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I turned him down and it wasn&#039;t until a year later that I saw him again.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And this time I decided, yes, I would dance with him.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> At the end of the evening he asked me, can I walk you home?</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh no, I live a long, long way from here.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a long walk. Oh, no problem.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got transport.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went outside and there was a motorbike and sidecar.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, there&#039;s no way that I&#039;m getting, I&#039;m getting him back to go home.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But he encouraged me.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my first time on a motorbike, which actually became one of the stays of our family in later life.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Both my sons and my grandson are all big motorbike enthusiasts.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where I met Cliff.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we got married in 1961 and I came to live in Raerder.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Our first home was with Mrs. Woods, the mount.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be Pam Wood&#039;s, Pam Pahl&#039;s mother in a little flat, one up, one down, a pound a week.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was lovely.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where Christian was born.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He was born in that first flat.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Bringoey came up for sale.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It had been a children&#039;s home for many, many years.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And Cliff loved it, loved the building, loved the look of it.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And Radnorshire District Council was selling it.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So he decided they were asking for offers.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s decided he put an offer in.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We talked about it and took a little bit advice.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And four thousand pounds was about the right sort of figure.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Cliff was born on the 19th of September.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, no, I said, don&#039;t just put the, bear four thousand, put four thousand and nineteen pounds, which he did.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he got it.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> As luck would have it at that time, we didn&#039;t know what we were going to do with it.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So William Holcro were building the Clwedwg Dam in Llanidloes.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d got all their key workers wanting somewhere to live.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So we quickly turned it round into flats for the workers.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I helped.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m pulling up the floorboards one day.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I found lots of little notes there from the children, from the children&#039;s home that they had posted between the floorboards to their parents asking them to come and take them home.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And messages to Father Christmas and things like that.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And that really, really upset me.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we lived down.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved from the mount, moved into Bringui.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had many, many wonderful years down there.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> By then, Cliff had built on the tennis court five houses.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And he let some of those to the key workers from Sir William Holcro&#039;s and local people.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> One was John Price, the reporter for the County Times and his wife.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we had Mr.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Ellis.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was a schoolteacher at Brinterion.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the others were key workers on the Clwedwg, the work.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Wonderful memories, wonderful times.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> None of Bringui was built then.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Right opposite was a field.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was owned by Lluingulam Farm, I think.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and it wasn&#039;t so many, many years later after we left Bringui.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That that became a building site.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bernard Lloyd and his sons built all the houses and the bungalows there.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Bringui in itself has such a fascinating history.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a wonderful point that you were part of all that.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, what exactly brought Cliff&#039;s family to this part of the world in the first place?</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re certainly not from anywhere near here originally.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They were Northumbrian people from up north.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Grandad had worked for Sir Edmund Nuttall, the engineering firm all over the country for years,</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> until they found that they were going to build the Clarewind Dam in the Ellam Valley.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> All the key workers came down to have a look in the bad, bad winter of 1947.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And Dad thought he&#039;d gone to hell. He always told me.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He said it was so cold.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, they decided they would take the job on.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the key workers all came down earlier.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They were housed locally, some in Dolgurtham,</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> some in Nantmadug at the back of the Ellam Valley Hotel, and some in the village.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So Dad then, the family all came with Dad.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Prior to that, they&#039;d been in Trakeen in Carmarthenshire,</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> where the Admiralty had been building a massive, massive tunnel out into the mountain</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> to keep all the armaments from the Second World War, you know, all the bombs and things.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So they moved up to Raerder and went to live in Nantmadug.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad, Clip&#039;s first job, my husband, his first job was an apprentice electrician on the Clarewind,</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> as many others did.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They had wonderful, wonderful amount of people.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Where I live now, Hazelmere, was the home of Frank Worthing, and Frank run a bus service.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he would travel all over Breckenshire, Radnyshire, Montgomeryshire,</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> picking up people, workers, every day to bring in and take up the Ellam Valley to work.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So there were thousands and thousands.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Grandad said the hardest workers up there always was the Irish boys.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They were absolutely wonderful.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But he said they were drinkers.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said at the end of the month, when it was payday, they would come down into town,</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> they would go to Percy Hughes&#039;, which is Richard Hughes&#039; father&#039;s shop, than grandfathers in town.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They were gents&#039; outfitters.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They would buy a new suit, a shirt, a tie, socks.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They would disappear over to Llandrindod, to the log cabin, which was at the back of the Commodore Hotel.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They would spend the weekend there.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d come back to work on a Monday morning in the same clothes that they&#039;d been in all weekend.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would live in those for the next month until payday again.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the Hughes&#039; did very, very well out of the workers of the Clairewyn Dam.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But they did have, grandad said as a foreman, he wouldn&#039;t allow any alcohol on, you know.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, they had all those wonderful stonemasons from Italy when they came over</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were doing all the front of the dam.</div><div id="00:11:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were absolutely amazing workers.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s really how dad came to Riddar.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They stayed in Riddar because the oldest daughter started courting a local boy, Henry Bryce.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And Henry and Margaret were talking about getting engaged and getting married.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And Nana Walton, Olive Walton, decided it&#039;s time to put down roots.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And so she wanted to buy a place in Riddar out from Nant Naddauk to live.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Dulgerth and Bungalows were all key workers&#039; bungalows for people working on the Clairewyn Dam.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And she decided that when they became empathy, she would like one.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So she went to see the clerk and she said, listen, when they become available, I would like one.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No problem, Mrs. Walton. How are you going to pay for it?</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it possible to take it out of Albert&#039;s wages every month?</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no problem at all.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So the money for buying Six Doll Girth and was taken out of Albert&#039;s wages every month.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he never knew because in those days, they would hand the men, would hand the wage packet</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> complete without taking a penny out of it to the wife.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And the wife looked after the finances.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how they got Doll Girth.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the family then settled in Riddar.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The one son married Shirley Williams from the drill hall.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I married Cliff.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My sister-in-law, Olive Bennett Evans, married Simon Bennett Evans.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And my other sister-in-law, Margaret, married Henry Price, who had an electrical firm in Llanidlois, a shop in Llanidlois.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He also had a little shop in Riddar, where Bob the Butcher&#039;s was and now Watson&#039;s the Butcher&#039;s.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And he decided that it was not doing any good and he was going to give it up.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> By this time, Cliff had left the Clairewyn, was working for Henry as an electrician,</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and decided he would take the shop on.</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He took it on, just working for Henry during the daytime and then doing all the work for the shop in the evenings.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It soon became obvious that it was too small, that he needed somewhere bigger.</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So he bought Paris House in Riddar, which is now where the Chinese takeaway is.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That soon became too small and then Kimberley Cafe became available to sell, to buy, sorry.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So he bought that and built a massive extension, an 8,000 square metre extension on the back.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was now when Colour Television came to Riddar.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the making of the business, Colour Television.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Not many people could afford to buy Colour in the beginning, so we would rent and hire Purchase in the beginning.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I can honestly say that most of the televisions in Riddar and the community were from Cliff Shop.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were so good that Joe tells me some of those televisions in the farms are still going strong today.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We always went for brand makes. We went for Sony and Toshiba and Itachi.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They stayed the course and they were wonderful.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, can I?</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Pauline, you&#039;ve been mentioning quite a few places in the area now.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> For the benefit of our listeners, could you just explain how far away the Clioin Dam actually is?</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> From Riddar, is it about six miles or more?</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I would think about six miles.</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, about six miles from Riddar. In the Ellum Valley, the top end of the Ellum Valley.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Going slightly south-west, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> A river going into the Ellum, the Clioin.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And you mentioned the Butcher&#039;s Shop. Where exactly is that in Riddar, please?</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Next door to the library in South Street, opposite the Ellum Hotel.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be West Street, would it?</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, West Street.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Dolgurtham Bungalows, where would we find those?</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> In East Street, halfway along.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The post office on your right-hand side, the Bear Hotel on your left-hand side.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The next turning on your left was six bungalows built for key workers, building the Clioin Dam.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And those are called Dolgurtham.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And at the top of that lane is Dolgurtham House itself, which is a sorry sight at the moment,</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> because they had a fire there many years ago.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a beautiful building.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The youth club used to be there. All the guide people would be there.</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was well used, and now it&#039;s just empty and looking dreadful.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Very sad indeed.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And Paris House you mentioned, where would we find that?</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> If you go up into North Street, Daisy Powells is next to Cliff Walton &amp; Sons shop, Euronics.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And the next place down to that is Butique in Northbrook.</div><div id="00:17:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And next to that is Paris House, and that is now a Chinese takeaway.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Interesting how they all change.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;ve mentioned the relationship now between Henry and your husband, Cliff.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I believe they became builders in the area. Can you give us some details about that?</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Where we live now, Hazelmere House, came up for sale.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lovely lady, Mrs. Evans, living here with her family.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was getting quite elderly, and she wanted to sell.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So we bought Hazelmere House, and we bought the four fields that were around,</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> which are now Hazelmere Estate.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was called Hazelmere because the road into Hazelmere House itself,</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> a great big hazel, and nut trees growing all on the side of the road,</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s why it was called that.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were the last buildings on St. Harmon Road. Above us there was nothing.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no pen, mace, nothing.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It was wide open right up to the top of the hill.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So we bought that, and we came here to live in 1972,</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and Cliff started building on the fields around the house.</div><div id="00:19:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Trying to remember how many, 24, 25 bungalows.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely estate, and they were steel-built bungalows then.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no wood inside.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were just steel frame, which was, you know, quite innovative in its day in the 1970s.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how we came to live at Hazelmere.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m still living here.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But during our time, before we moved to Hazelmere, we bought Brungawee,</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> which is now a nursing home in Raerdy in South Street.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And we bought that from Radnor District Council in the late 60s, early 70s.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And we turned it into flats.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the tennis court, we built some houses on the tennis court.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But the key workers for the Cloedeg Dam there in Llanidlois came to live at Brungawee House.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And after we left there, we sold it to Nancy Hickley, who used to run the Ellen Hotel in Raerdy.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And she just lived there with the flats as her home.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. If we could just go back to the valley for a couple of minutes.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You tell me an interesting story about something that Cliff did for a bet.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you able to tell us that little story again?</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. He was a young man, apprentice electrician on the Clairewyn.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was not long before the official opening.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d had some water over to try it out.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was shut off.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they bet him for £5, would he climb up the centrepiece of the Clairewyn Dam,</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> which he did. They used to remind him of that in years to come about him doing it.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite an interesting anecdote indeed.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. Can you tell us a little bit about how the electrical business that you started grew in Raerdy?</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s quite a big concern now.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. My husband Cliff was an electrician.</div><div id="00:21:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he worked after the Clairewyn was opened and finished.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He worked for his brother-in-law, Henry Price, W.H. Price in Llaneddlois.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was at the time where not many farms had got electricity in Montgomeryshire over to Aberystwyth, a massive area.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that&#039;s what he would do.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So we got to know a whole area and people in Montgomeryshire and in Ceredigion as well.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he worked for Henry until Henry had a little place that Mrs. Walton and Anna Walton used to look after,</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> where Bob the Butcher&#039;s was and now Watson&#039;s.</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to just have people coming in.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were messages, this has gone wrong, that&#039;s gone wrong, not so much sales, you know, service shop really.</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was going to close it.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And Cliff said, no, don&#039;t don&#039;t do that. I&#039;ll keep it on.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So Cliff took it and he noticed that people were wanting much, much more than just servicing.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So he started selling appliances out there, washing machines and tumble dryers.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was too small. So Paris House came up for sale in North Street.</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> That was Mrs. Meredith&#039;s, a coal merchant&#039;s next door.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And a little bit of interest because on the side of Paris House, there&#039;s a lane,</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> a right of way running right to the back of Paris House into Northbrook next door.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s still there today. And that&#039;s how they used to bring the coal in.</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s up the side of the Crown Hotel.</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t much longer before that got too small.</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And Kimberley Cafe came up for sale.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Kimberley Cafe was a wonderful, wonderful building.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And in on holiday weekends, there&#039;d be seven, eight mile tailbacks of traffic coming into Rader.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> People from the Midlands being out to the coast for the day.</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> The first place they would see for somewhere to eat was the Kimberley Cafe in Rader in North Street.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That was open sometimes until midnight. People would be in there eating.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, the people who were running that decided they were getting too old and they wanted to give it up.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we bought Kimberley and transformed it.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> We built a 8,000 meter extension on the back, some flats above the shop.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where we moved into. That would be what?</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> In the late, in the early 1970s, 1974, 75.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it was the Advent Color Television.</div><div id="00:24:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And that really made the shop what it is today because everybody wanted color.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was rental. It was HP.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people couldn&#039;t get a signal locally.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Even an aerial on the roof of a house couldn&#039;t get it.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So Cliff used to do pipe television and he would go all over Radnyshire, Breckinshire, Montgomeryshire.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He would spend days and hours looking for a good strong signal, sometimes on the top of a massive hill.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he would dig a trench from the top of the hill down to the farmhouse or the dwelling, bring the cable down.</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where they would get that&#039;s where they get their signal.</div><div id="00:25:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so easy was that a life today.</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was hard work.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how the business came into being.</div><div id="00:25:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And now both my sons and my grandson and my daughter-in-law work for it.</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have to mention Katrina, who came out of school at the age of 16.</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s now 57 and she&#039;s still with us in the in the shop, a local girl.</div><div id="00:25:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And we couldn&#039;t do without her.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the Walden&#039;s van is a very prominent feature, a very prominent vehicle in this area.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re forever lasting doing deliveries all over this part of Wales and further out there.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So your family will obviously keep it on for years to come, I would imagine.</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I would hope. Yes.</div><div id="00:26:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thanks ever so much for telling us about the build up to all these businesses and the interest in the buildings in Raerdyd.</div><div id="00:26:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Talking about living now in Raerdyd and bringing up a family in Raerdyd, what changes have you yourself seen in Raerdyd?</div><div id="00:26:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you point out any specific changes?</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s so many over the years.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The community is not what it was when I was growing up, when I was living in, started to live in Raerdyd.</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And you knew everybody.</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What I find now, I know I&#039;m getting older, but what I find now, I can go downtown, I can walk the street.</div><div id="00:26:52.000" class="transcript_line"> If there&#039;s somebody my age, group fine.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But the young people, I don&#039;t know anymore.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That wasn&#039;t like that in the 1960s, the 1970s.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You knew everybody on the street.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You knew their name. You knew their family.</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very close-knit community.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to have quite a group of men, about eight or ten men, every day would be on the corner of North South Street there, just standing, watching the world go by.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you wanted to know anything about what was happening, you only had to speak to them.</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> A lovely lot of banter with them every time you pass by, being teased.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But the shops is the theme.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We had so many shops.</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t need to go out of Raerdyd.</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We had everything in Raerdyd then.</div><div id="00:27:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And Eddie Collard&#039;s, the butcher in the centre of Raerdyd.</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember going there on a Saturday, two and sixpence, for a piece of meat for Sunday lunch.</div><div id="00:28:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That would do your Sunday lunch.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It would do your Monday meal and sandwiches for the family for a couple of days as well.</div><div id="00:28:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They had some wonderful shops in Raerdyd.</div><div id="00:28:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And now we haven&#039;t got them.</div><div id="00:28:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Big changes in the town.</div><div id="00:28:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Yes.</div><div id="00:28:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Big, big changes.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And not for the better.</div><div id="00:28:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Not for the better.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> This is a beautiful house where you live, Pauline.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you give us a few more details about the house, when you think it may have been built, et cetera?</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think Hazelmere was built by Bowen Hamer, who was, I don&#039;t know whether he was an accountant or a solicitor.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And he ran a business from here.</div><div id="00:28:50.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a building out in the yard and he ran a business from here.</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But he dealt mainly with farmers.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And later on, he started selling animal feeds as well from the building.</div><div id="00:29:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He built it and he lived here with his family.</div><div id="00:29:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know what happened.</div><div id="00:29:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was told he went bankrupt.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, the house was sold.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think Birmingham Corporation bought it.</div><div id="00:29:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They put one of the engineers for the dam.</div><div id="00:29:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it would be the first dam, must have been the first dam, I should imagine.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know the name of the engineer.</div><div id="00:29:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They lived here.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a couple of owners over the years.</div><div id="00:29:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Then Mrs. Evans was a housekeeper to Mr. Thomas, who had bought Hazelmere.</div><div id="00:29:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Thomas was from the Kashanth family in Raider.</div><div id="00:29:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And he lived here.</div><div id="00:29:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a bachelor.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Evans was his housekeeper.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> When he died, he left the house to her.</div><div id="00:29:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And in turn, when Mrs. Evans was wanting to move, she left the house to my husband, Cliff.</div><div id="00:30:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Cliff, in turn, then, involved his brother-in-law, Henry Price, in the buying of Hazelmere in the beginning.</div><div id="00:30:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was a lot of land involved.</div><div id="00:30:23.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a couple of acres, about three or four acres, all around the house,</div><div id="00:30:28.000" class="transcript_line"> which they started to develop as a housing estate, Hazelmere estate.</div><div id="00:30:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Cliff bought the house outright for us to live in.</div><div id="00:30:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was in 1972, 1973.</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when we came here to live in Hazelmere.</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been here ever since.</div><div id="00:30:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful place, beautiful setting.</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, very interesting history of the house.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You were mentioning the first dam before.</div><div id="00:31:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Would that be the Cabin Cook Dam?</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The first one we see going up in the valley.</div><div id="00:31:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you do for entertainment in Raider, then, Pauline?</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you relax?</div><div id="00:31:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re very lucky, really.</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We have Callard, which has always got something going on in Raider to get involved with and to visit.</div><div id="00:31:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a big supporter of the Wives side in Bilth Wells.</div><div id="00:31:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They have some very good do&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:31:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the Pavilion in Llandrindod has got
