Have you seen Mr Evans up here? There&#039;s still a fair bit to do, even though the war is over.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Nonetheless, I&#039;m not sure how much work there is for us lumberjills these days.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve played our part, you know. It&#039;s already starting to look different since I came in 42.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a glorious summer&#039;s day. We had some laughs over the last three years, but it&#039;s not been easy.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m lucky, really. Most of the land girls are English and can&#039;t speak a word of Welsh.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Still, it&#039;s been a bit of a shock for me, having grown up in Bangor.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the locals, especially the wives, have been a bit wary of us too.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Thought we were going to steal their men.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Although, between you and me, I think all the best ones must be soldiers.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I can understand it, but we were only here to do our bit, in the country&#039;s hour of need and all that.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very proud of what we&#039;ve achieved.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When I first came here, I did all the usual forestry labour work, you know, cutting timber, burning the brash,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and even did a bit in the sawmill and nursery here.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now they&#039;ve got me in the office, which is a promotion, so they say.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m loist, by the way.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to head off into the mountain later to measure some of the trees at Blaen Glesyrch,</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> just north of here on the other side of the road.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The Home Guard have already been in there once to measure up for the pit props,</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> but as they say, if you want a job doing properly, if you want to join me,</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I can show you what what, if you&#039;d like.
