Jones.</div><div id="00:01:56.240" class="transcript_line"> We were separated out.</div><div id="00:01:57.720" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know one another anyway.</div><div id="00:02:00.280" class="transcript_line"> But when we were settled in with our people, we had to go to school then.</div><div id="00:02:06.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was only one classroom.</div><div id="00:02:08.280" class="transcript_line"> And we had one teacher, Miss Wakeman.</div><div id="00:02:13.640" class="transcript_line"> Funny, her name&#039;s come back now.</div><div id="00:02:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Miss Wakeman.</div><div id="00:02:17.880" class="transcript_line"> And she taught the three rows of pupils.</div><div id="00:02:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You had the infants, you had the juniors, and you had the seniors.</div><div id="00:02:28.800" class="transcript_line"> When we all, everybody, learned about the war,</div><div id="00:02:34.360" class="transcript_line"> well, all the school teachers had to take all the children home to their mothers</div><div id="00:02:41.640" class="transcript_line"> to tell them what was happening.</div><div id="00:02:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And they were all told, see, that they were going to be taken down to the station</div><div id="00:02:49.440" class="transcript_line"> in so-and-so time and day, and they would be safe.</div><div id="00:02:53.760" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re going down into Wales, near Swansea.</div><div id="00:02:58.760" class="transcript_line"> So I can always remember my father and mother talking about it,</div><div id="00:03:03.640" class="transcript_line"> what we&#039;re going to do about them.</div><div id="00:03:05.800" class="transcript_line"> So I had one brother, yeah, Blaise, and two sisters who were in school.</div><div id="00:03:13.920" class="transcript_line"> And they wanted to go because to them, it was like a picnic going in a train.</div><div id="00:03:18.960" class="transcript_line"> I think they didn&#039;t know what it was going to be like.</div><div id="00:03:21.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, anyway, it was up to them to decide.</div><div id="00:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So my parents decided to let them go.</div><div id="00:03:29.840" class="transcript_line"> So they came down here.</div><div id="00:03:31.760" class="transcript_line"> And of course, they were parted, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:03:35.240" class="transcript_line"> My brother had a marvellous life because he was with the, you know, the new inn?</div><div id="00:03:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Penbank Farm.</div><div id="00:03:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Penbank Farm, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:03:46.880" class="transcript_line"> My brother was, he was very clever with his hands on that.</div><div id="00:03:51.840" class="transcript_line"> He goes up there to them and because the farmer was good,</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> he was riding horses in no time.</div><div id="00:04:00.840" class="transcript_line"> He used to go across the bank, across all the mountains from the new inn</div><div id="00:04:08.120" class="transcript_line"> and end up in Pontedoui on a horse.</div><div id="00:04:12.160" class="transcript_line"> But my two sisters were sent to Rideau-Ferot.</div><div id="00:04:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And she used to make my sister get up early, a couple of hours early,</div><div id="00:04:23.120" class="transcript_line"> to get ready to go to school, to scrub the kitchen, clean the windows or anything.</div><div id="00:04:29.520" class="transcript_line"> She made like a sleigh.</div><div id="00:04:31.560" class="transcript_line"> But my youngest sister now, Marge, she went up to Rideau-Ferot</div><div id="00:04:39.160" class="transcript_line"> and she was with a married couple of girls.</div><div id="00:04:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was a daughter there who was older than my sister was,</div><div id="00:04:48.360" class="transcript_line"> but they treated her like a daughter.</div><div id="00:04:50.640" class="transcript_line"> She had a wonderful time up there.</div><div id="00:04:52.840" class="transcript_line"> In fact, when she went back, she was always phoning them and they was phoning her, you know.</div><div id="00:04:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any of the evacuees coming to you?</div><div id="00:05:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, we had an evacuee over with us.</div><div id="00:05:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:05:05.880" class="transcript_line"> Ernie Thompson from Finsbury in London.</div><div id="00:05:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And he didn&#039;t stay after the war?</div><div id="00:05:12.720" class="transcript_line"> No, he didn&#039;t stay.</div><div id="00:05:16.120" class="transcript_line"> He came early in the war and London wasn&#039;t bombed for long.</div><div id="00:05:22.520" class="transcript_line"> The mother came down and took him home.</div><div id="00:05:25.640" class="transcript_line"> He had a sister as well, which was with somebody else in the grave.</div><div id="00:05:29.440" class="transcript_line"> And the day the mother came down and took him back,</div><div id="00:05:33.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he didn&#039;t hear anything from them since.</div><div id="00:05:37.240" class="transcript_line"> But there is an evacuee, and she stayed in the grave?</div><div id="00:05:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, Freddie Wilson, he was with the HR Jones.</div><div id="00:05:45.800" class="transcript_line"> He stayed with them.</div><div id="00:05:49.360" class="transcript_line"> And he didn&#039;t go back.</div><div id="00:05:50.800" class="transcript_line"> He was always still with them.</div><div id="00:05:52.600" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a grave boy now, isn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:05:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he talks well.</div><div id="00:05:56.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, good.</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> So the evacuees, when they came to the school, they had to learn Welsh?</div><div id="00:06:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, we could speak English with them, like, you know, so it wasn&#039;t a problem, really.</div><div id="00:06:09.680" class="transcript_line"> You could talk to them because they had a bit of a problem with me.</div><div id="00:06:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Or do they have their own teachers?</div><div id="00:06:14.440" class="transcript_line"> They brought their own teachers, yes.</div><div id="00:06:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Well, during that time, most of them were 11-year-olds, like, you see.</div><div id="00:06:21.920" class="transcript_line"> And they went down to Clifdon School.</div><div id="00:06:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, yes.</div><div id="00:06:26.320" class="transcript_line"> But they stayed in the grave, like, you know, the bus going from the grave down to school.</div><div id="00:06:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Every day.</div><div id="00:06:32.480" class="transcript_line"> Now, tell me, but you had evacuees come to the leg.</div><div id="00:06:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, they came up by bus from the railway station, I street, I believe.</div><div id="00:06:42.520" class="transcript_line"> And then it was dark.</div><div id="00:06:43.920" class="transcript_line"> It was late in the evening, you know.</div><div id="00:06:45.880" class="transcript_line"> And we were all waiting outside now when all the evacuees were inside now.</div><div id="00:06:51.440" class="transcript_line"> And we were jumping up the window to see what was happening.</div><div id="00:06:55.240" class="transcript_line"> We could look straight inside, you know, we were jumping up.</div><div id="00:06:58.640" class="transcript_line"> I could see the women going in, like, picking the evacuees.</div><div id="00:07:02.440" class="transcript_line"> I knew all the mothers from the village, you know.</div><div id="00:07:05.760" class="transcript_line"> And they were picking our boys and girls to take home, you know.</div><div id="00:07:10.760" class="transcript_line"> So they had teachers with them.</div><div id="00:07:12.640" class="transcript_line"> They brought their own teachers down.</div><div id="00:07:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, they mixed in with the Welsh boy.</div><div id="00:07:19.240" class="transcript_line"> They went, you know, they came to the Romer village school,</div><div id="00:07:21.560" class="transcript_line"> then they mixed with us and we played with us.</div><div id="00:07:25.640" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how we learned the Welsh from the yard, I think.</div><div id="00:07:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Were they big boys?</div><div id="00:07:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, they were bigger than us, you know.</div><div id="00:07:35.240" class="transcript_line"> And the average size were bigger than us.</div><div id="00:07:38.560" class="transcript_line"> From Chatton, they were, East End, you know.</div></div></p>
