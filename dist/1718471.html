    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You moved to Devanna when you were about 14, 15, did you say? A bit older?</div><div id="00:00:04.880" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I never lived here as a child.</div><div id="00:00:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay.</div><div id="00:00:12.080" class="transcript_line"> We just spent a lot of time here because of family.</div><div id="00:00:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Just what, like you did?</div><div id="00:00:16.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, but no, I lived in St Harmon and then when I moved to Nottingham to study further education,</div><div id="00:00:23.920" class="transcript_line"> the first term I came back, it was 1986, so I went in September, came back in for Christmas.</div><div id="00:00:33.440" class="transcript_line"> I was away for the whole 12 weeks and my uncle died. My uncle died just after I got back</div><div id="00:00:46.080" class="transcript_line"> and he was the sole occupier at that time of Devanna. He didn&#039;t marry my uncle Jack,</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> he was the eldest one of all the boys. My father was the youngest one of all the boys,</div><div id="00:00:55.760" class="transcript_line"> so it was about 20 years between my father and my uncle Jack. He died and the house was empty for a</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> year and it was, what should we do? Nobody wanted, because it was such a centre, the centre of the</div><div id="00:01:09.920" class="transcript_line"> family and the family, it&#039;s sort of, we were all over the place, but nobody wanted it to be sold.</div><div id="00:01:20.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;m talking about the next generation above, they were sort of like deciding what to do.</div><div id="00:01:27.360" class="transcript_line"> So in the end, my parents moved in, so they moved in while I was studying in Nottingham.</div><div id="00:01:34.320" class="transcript_line"> And so then it was only when I moved back, I was in Nottingham about seven years,</div><div id="00:01:39.280" class="transcript_line"> and it was only when I moved back that I moved into Devanna. That&#039;s the first time I&#039;d actually</div><div id="00:01:43.840" class="transcript_line"> lived there. And I got, because I&#039;d got, I started working in Herefordshire, so I&#039;d be driving to</div><div id="00:01:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Leicester every day from here, which was doable. And my plan was to, you know, find somewhere a</div><div id="00:01:56.320" class="transcript_line"> bit nearer to live, but it never really happened. And then I met Jake, who was already living in</div><div id="00:02:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Abercombe here, next to the church at Cross Cottage. And he was working in Kidderminster,</div><div id="00:02:08.960" class="transcript_line"> so we ended up just renting little places in between Lentster and Kidderminster.</div><div id="00:02:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And then we got married and, you know, moved to Kidderminster, moved to</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> North Staffordshire, moved to Leic with his work, and the little boys, our children came along.</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> But we, every weekend, we still came back to Abercombe here, even though, even though we were,</div><div id="00:02:37.760" class="transcript_line"> it was a hundred miles to drive to Leic, we&#039;d be coming back on a Friday evening. We&#039;d pick the</div><div id="00:02:43.920" class="transcript_line"> boys up from school, or one of them, because they were only very tiny. And so we did that for a</div><div id="00:02:51.280" class="transcript_line"> couple of years. And then when my father died, we moved back. We just, you know, Jake gave up his</div><div id="00:03:01.040" class="transcript_line"> job. We put the house on the market up there and moved back. And then we&#039;d been here about, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:09.680" class="transcript_line"> know, a few months, six months, eight months, something like that. And we moved into Little</div><div id="00:03:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Plot because Dad had built it to retire into. And of course he died at age 64, hadn&#039;t retired yet.</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> The house was sitting there empty, so we moved in. The boys needed somewhere a bit bigger to play.</div><div id="00:03:31.440" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s lots of space here, and we were closer to Mum to offer a bit of support.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, it had already been renovated, Little Plot, then?</div><div id="00:03:39.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:39.760" class="transcript_line"> When you moved in.</div><div id="00:03:41.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, it was a new build. It was, it&#039;s on the footprint of an old barn.</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay.</div><div id="00:03:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And funnily enough, my cousin sent me some old photographs a couple of weeks ago. And one of</div><div id="00:03:55.440" class="transcript_line"> them is of Devanor Yard. And the only reason I recognised it as being Devanor Yard was because</div><div id="00:04:01.280" class="transcript_line"> of the, there&#039;s like a concrete feeding trough, which was for the horses and the cows in the</div><div id="00:04:08.160" class="transcript_line"> yard. And I recognised that because the barn that this, you know, on this site was actually</div><div id="00:04:15.280" class="transcript_line"> in Devanor Yard. And it was called the French Barn. And they decided they wanted a bigger building.</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So they moved this barn, which was a wooden barn. They moved it into the field called Little Plot.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the brothers did it. And it must have been the late 60s to make room for the sort of</div><div id="00:04:40.560" class="transcript_line"> modern farm building barn that they put there.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:04:47.360" class="transcript_line"> So this was the French Barn. It had been here since the late 60s, but it had been, you know,</div><div id="00:04:55.280" class="transcript_line"> it was a much older, it was a very old building because it had been somewhere else prior to that.</div><div id="00:05:00.880" class="transcript_line"> It had been in Devanor Yard. And it wasn&#039;t really renovatable. So we built something new based on</div><div id="00:05:12.160" class="transcript_line"> the footprint, or my father did, based on the footprint of the barn and built it to look barn</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> like so that it blended in. So that was the plan.</div></div></p>
