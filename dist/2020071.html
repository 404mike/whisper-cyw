    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Good afternoon Maria. Hello. Hello, my name is Shea Buckley. I used to teach and was a</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> teacher at Mary Macklet School. So I&#039;m a volunteer doing some of the interviews and so it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:00:19.480" class="transcript_line"> pleasure and an honour to interview you as the niece of Paul Sartori.</div><div id="00:00:27.160" class="transcript_line"> We have a set of questions that people ask but we don&#039;t necessarily stick to them. Wherever</div><div id="00:00:32.760" class="transcript_line"> you go, if we find that far more interesting then we&#039;ll stick with that and carry on with</div><div id="00:00:39.160" class="transcript_line"> whatever you&#039;re saying. Okay. Yes. So for the sake of the tape and everything I have</div><div id="00:00:46.040" class="transcript_line"> to ask you the thing. So could you give the tape your full name?</div><div id="00:00:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Maria Bridget Ann Sartori.</div><div id="00:00:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Right and we have permission to record this interview?</div><div id="00:01:01.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Right then another question in this. Where and when were you born?</div><div id="00:01:07.800" class="transcript_line"> The 9th of September 1960.</div><div id="00:01:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Now we can get on to the far more interesting things. Could you talk about first of all</div><div id="00:01:23.800" class="transcript_line"> your early meetings with Paul Sartori?</div><div id="00:01:27.800" class="transcript_line"> One of my early memories of Paul.</div><div id="00:01:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Well my earliest memory, we were living in Trinsara near Llanelli and there were three</div><div id="00:01:47.800" class="transcript_line"> young, there were six of us eventually but in the beginning there were just three children</div><div id="00:01:52.800" class="transcript_line"> living in Trinsara and I remember the excitement of seeing young Uncle Paul coming to visit</div><div id="00:02:00.800" class="transcript_line"> us and he would do magic tricks. He&#039;d have a coin in his hand and then he would make</div><div id="00:02:08.800" class="transcript_line"> it appear from, as if it was coming from out of his ear. We were all on squeals of delight.</div><div id="00:02:16.800" class="transcript_line"> It would have been about seven, seven years old then. And another thing he&#039;d do was, I</div><div id="00:02:25.800" class="transcript_line"> remember having a fear of spiders.</div><div id="00:02:29.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:02:30.800" class="transcript_line"> What he&#039;d do was, he&#039;d move some furniture and he&#039;d make it his business to find a spider</div><div id="00:02:37.800" class="transcript_line"> somehow and he&#039;d pick it up and he&#039;d take his jacket off and roll his sleeve up and</div><div id="00:02:44.800" class="transcript_line"> leave the spider crawl up his hairy arm. We were horrified. Horrified.</div><div id="00:02:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:53.800" class="transcript_line"> He took the fear out of...</div><div id="00:02:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Of spider fear.</div><div id="00:02:58.800" class="transcript_line"> He took the fear away from me and my younger brother and sister.</div><div id="00:03:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:04.800" class="transcript_line"> And he was also very funny. We couldn&#039;t wait to see him.</div><div id="00:03:08.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:09.800" class="transcript_line"> What am I having earlier memories?</div><div id="00:03:13.800" class="transcript_line"> So he was very good with children then?</div><div id="00:03:17.800" class="transcript_line"> He could stop them at once.</div><div id="00:03:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:22.800" class="transcript_line"> Just pause, because I&#039;ve got this written down.</div><div id="00:03:25.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:03:26.800" class="transcript_line"> If you can find something to put into here, Maria, that&#039;s fine. What I&#039;ll do is I&#039;ll turn</div><div id="00:03:31.800" class="transcript_line"> this up on the recording and then maybe you can have a headphone so it&#039;ll be a bit louder</div><div id="00:03:36.800" class="transcript_line"> for you. Try that, see how you get on. Because I can cut all this out, it&#039;s not a problem.</div><div id="00:03:42.800" class="transcript_line"> See how you feel. Is that a bit louder for you?</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:49.800" class="transcript_line"> Maria, is it okay if you just say hello or something, just to see if Shay can hear you</div><div id="00:03:56.800" class="transcript_line"> a little bit clearer?</div><div id="00:03:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Hello?</div><div id="00:03:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Hello. That&#039;s fine. That&#039;s very good. Thank you.</div><div id="00:04:03.800" class="transcript_line"> So you said you&#039;ve written a lot of stuff down, so I&#039;ll let you get on with that. And</div><div id="00:04:09.800" class="transcript_line"> if you don&#039;t mind then, if there&#039;s anything I find that&#039;s really interesting, I&#039;ll maybe</div><div id="00:04:15.800" class="transcript_line"> ask you a few questions as you&#039;re going on with whatever you&#039;ve written.</div><div id="00:04:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Those are the early memories I&#039;ve got.</div><div id="00:04:22.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:04:23.800" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s a gasp then. So later memories of that, I would say I would be between the</div><div id="00:04:31.800" class="transcript_line"> ages of 12 to 18, before I passed away.</div><div id="00:04:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:04:38.800" class="transcript_line"> He would come and visit us. He&#039;d get a phone call, he&#039;d go down to see his mother, come</div><div id="00:04:46.800" class="transcript_line"> and visit his mother, then his sister, his mother Dominica, and his sister Mary who&#039;d</div><div id="00:04:52.800" class="transcript_line"> been copying for him. And he&#039;d get a phone call, he&#039;d say, Paul&#039;s coming over, Uncle</div><div id="00:04:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Paul&#039;s coming to visit you. So the house would be the six children.</div><div id="00:05:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:04.800" class="transcript_line"> The house would be awash with excitement and trepidation for this marvelous uncle coming</div><div id="00:05:11.800" class="transcript_line"> to see us.</div><div id="00:05:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, he&#039;d turn up, and the first of my men out the door would go with joy to see</div><div id="00:05:19.800" class="transcript_line"> him. And she would bring her sister, and she&#039;d come over from across the road, Margaret.</div><div id="00:05:25.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, he&#039;d grab onto us. You have to remember now this is in the late seventies and the</div><div id="00:05:33.800" class="transcript_line"> lamb chop side boats were in the stables of the seventies. And he grabbed onto us one</div><div id="00:05:42.800" class="transcript_line"> by one and rubbed it into our necks.</div><div id="00:05:45.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d be screaming with delight. And he&#039;d go this to my aunt, and she&#039;d be screaming,</div><div id="00:05:53.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh Paul, oh Paul, stop it, stop it.</div><div id="00:05:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:58.800" class="transcript_line"> But wanting him to carry on even more. And then he&#039;d throw us onto the floor and tickle</div><div id="00:06:05.800" class="transcript_line"> us pretending that he was playing the piano.</div><div id="00:06:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:11.800" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d be laughing so much, it was a tone to pee out.</div><div id="00:06:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:16.800" class="transcript_line"> The marvelous memories of him.</div><div id="00:06:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:21.800" class="transcript_line"> And we think what else now? He&#039;d bring nothing but happiness and laughter to our home. And</div><div id="00:06:32.800" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d settle down then, and have a whiskey with my dad, and they would spend the rest</div><div id="00:06:38.800" class="transcript_line"> of the afternoon talking.</div><div id="00:06:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:41.800" class="transcript_line"> And Paul was always full of ideas of how to make money.</div><div id="00:06:45.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And one I remember was, he said to my dad, I was in the room and he said, he said, I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:06:53.800" class="transcript_line"> got a bloody good idea now though, and how those monks could make money on Gordy Island.</div><div id="00:07:01.800" class="transcript_line"> He said they should turn it into an offshore casino.</div><div id="00:07:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:07:05.800" class="transcript_line"> With no tax.</div><div id="00:07:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:07:07.800" class="transcript_line"> Well that was one that my dad agreed it would be good. And then he said I&#039;ve got another</div><div id="00:07:14.800" class="transcript_line"> idea for us, because they&#039;ve got lots of farmland, they should start making yoghurt.</div><div id="00:07:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:07:20.800" class="transcript_line"> With selling chocolate. They should sell yoghurt, come eat in Gordy.</div><div id="00:07:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:25.800" class="transcript_line"> And he, on a personal note, he liked eating snails.</div><div id="00:07:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:07:32.800" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a certain way of talking of course, I&#039;ve never tried that myself, but he was</div><div id="00:07:39.800" class="transcript_line"> particularly fond of them. And when my aunt and aunt Kurt were on their way home from</div><div id="00:07:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Italy and France, they stopped the car in France and they went into some of these gardens</div><div id="00:07:53.800" class="transcript_line"> and they were removing some stones and gathering these snails and putting them into capoware</div><div id="00:08:00.800" class="transcript_line"> boxes to bring back for Paul in Harmanford West.</div><div id="00:08:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And he started reading them so he could eat them.</div><div id="00:08:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:10.800" class="transcript_line"> All right. That&#039;s great stories. But yeah, we know.</div><div id="00:08:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Another thing he said, when, I&#039;m referring to my notes, Paul&#039;s nickname was his, when</div><div id="00:08:24.800" class="transcript_line"> he, this is from what my dad told me, my dad&#039;s passed away now, now he died two years ago.</div><div id="00:08:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:33.800" class="transcript_line"> And he said that Paul&#039;s nickname in that family with the youngest of six children was the</div><div id="00:08:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Rooter. And the Rooter meaning, my grandmother would say, when he would come home from boarding</div><div id="00:08:51.800" class="transcript_line"> school with the Carmelite monks near Camargan or Llanondailo.</div><div id="00:08:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:57.800" class="transcript_line"> What are you doing now Paul? What are you looking for? Looking through all my carpets</div><div id="00:09:03.800" class="transcript_line"> and drawers.</div><div id="00:09:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:05.800" class="transcript_line"> What are you looking for? I&#039;m looking for something new.</div><div id="00:09:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:10.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m looking for something new.</div><div id="00:09:11.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, another thing he&#039;d do, my grandmother said was he would be forever taking things</div><div id="00:09:21.800" class="transcript_line"> apart. For example, he took apart a grandfather clock and a man-kill clock. But he would never</div><div id="00:09:30.800" class="transcript_line"> put them back again.</div><div id="00:09:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:32.800" class="transcript_line"> He put there the cafe with the beautiful jukebox, a 1950s jukebox.</div><div id="00:09:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:40.800" class="transcript_line"> And he got it in his head one day, he was going to take it apart. And he took it apart.</div><div id="00:09:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And that was the last time it was ever used.</div><div id="00:09:51.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:52.800" class="transcript_line"> In Sartorius Cafe.</div><div id="00:09:53.800" class="transcript_line"> In Swinsea.</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> In St. Ashley.</div><div id="00:09:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Clendley. Right.</div><div id="00:09:56.800" class="transcript_line"> In St. Ashley.</div><div id="00:09:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:58.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think of a street, is it Stratley Street?</div><div id="00:10:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, in Sartorius Cafe, another very famous jukebox, which he ruined.</div><div id="00:10:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:14.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d never heard that story before.</div><div id="00:10:17.800" class="transcript_line"> He was also, I remember my dad telling me, when he was away in Bowdoin School as a carmelite monk and</div><div id="00:10:26.800" class="transcript_line"> something like that, you know, he was a natural actor.</div><div id="00:10:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:31.800" class="transcript_line"> We went to see him in my bed.</div><div id="00:10:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:35.800" class="transcript_line"> And he played three or four parms.</div><div id="00:10:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:40.800" class="transcript_line"> And he was the only pupil to do this.</div><div id="00:10:43.800" class="transcript_line"> And one of the parts, a small part, was he was one of the witches.</div><div id="00:10:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And he put, they were laughing at him, he didn&#039;t have to put it on a fox&#039;s nose.</div><div id="00:10:56.800" class="transcript_line"> He had the witch&#039;s nose.</div><div id="00:10:58.800" class="transcript_line"> And he would be stirring the party, sadly enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:11:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:11:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, my other memories of poor land were, do you want me to stop?</div><div id="00:11:08.800" class="transcript_line"> No, you carry on.</div><div id="00:11:10.800" class="transcript_line"> I carry on my six of memories of poor land.</div><div id="00:11:13.800" class="transcript_line"> This is perfect, Maria, you&#039;re doing a fab job.</div><div id="00:11:16.800" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re in it, you&#039;re in it.</div><div id="00:11:18.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I&#039;ve got memories when he was in the sanctum, it is a big leap forward now to when he was ill.</div><div id="00:11:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Because, and he was, they announced that he was ill to the day he died, it was only six weeks I think.</div><div id="00:11:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:11:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Or was it 12 weeks, correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but it was, I wonder if it was different, I know it was very quick.</div><div id="00:11:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:47.800" class="transcript_line"> He was in the Santa Maria Hospital.</div><div id="00:11:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:51.800" class="transcript_line"> The cure is the crumbling of the bones in his spine.</div><div id="00:11:56.800" class="transcript_line"> The cure that had been fixed it.</div><div id="00:11:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:12:00.800" class="transcript_line"> And consulted Dr. Anthony Jones and put him on new traction.</div><div id="00:12:08.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:12:09.800" class="transcript_line"> On his head, weight on his head, and they separated the vertebrae and they stopped him from being paralysed.</div><div id="00:12:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:12:20.800" class="transcript_line"> The person who was in was at part of his time in the Santa Maria in the Applands and so on.</div><div id="00:12:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:12:29.800" class="transcript_line"> And once a day I&#039;d go there, it would be nice to see him with my daughter.</div><div id="00:12:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:35.800" class="transcript_line"> And he would always, my uncle Paul would always bring out trained qualities in different people.</div><div id="00:12:43.800" class="transcript_line"> I noticed that and he would put them up there at ease.</div><div id="00:12:47.800" class="transcript_line"> And he put me aside one day and he said to me, he put me aside one day and he said to me, Maria was the last person in the room.</div><div id="00:13:02.800" class="transcript_line"> He said, I don&#039;t want you ever to forget you&#039;re a lovely girl.</div><div id="00:13:06.800" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t had to wear very much of the boy.</div><div id="00:13:10.800" class="transcript_line"> That means a lot to me.</div><div id="00:13:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Nobody&#039;s ever said that.</div><div id="00:13:14.800" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I tell you something, I&#039;ve cooked the best egg and chips as well.</div><div id="00:13:20.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember one day my dad saying, Paul&#039;s hungry.</div><div id="00:13:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Cook him something.</div><div id="00:13:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I said, there&#039;s nothing in the fridge.</div><div id="00:13:28.800" class="transcript_line"> And he said, there&#039;s an egg there, yes.</div><div id="00:13:30.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a shot of a kid who&#039;s making egg and chips.</div><div id="00:13:34.800" class="transcript_line"> I said, there&#039;s an egg there.</div><div id="00:13:36.800" class="transcript_line"> And he said, you have a nice egg and chips, Maria.</div><div id="00:13:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Subsequently, in the last year, when I was abroad on holiday with my old family, my seven-year-old son Paul, we&#039;d go to expensive Italian restaurants.</div><div id="00:13:56.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m always an Italian man.</div><div id="00:13:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:13:59.800"
