    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> To Autumn by John Keats. Read by Nicholas Shaw for the BBC.</div><div id="00:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom friend of the maturing sun,</div><div id="00:00:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Conspiring with him how to load and bless with fruit The vines that round the thatch eaves run,</div><div id="00:00:21.600" class="transcript_line"> To bend with apples the mossed cottage trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core,</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells with a sweet kernel,</div><div id="00:00:34.160" class="transcript_line"> To set budding more and still more later flowers for the bees,</div><div id="00:00:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Until they think warm days will never cease, For summer has o&#039;er brimmed their clammy cells.</div><div id="00:00:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find thee</div><div id="00:00:52.880" class="transcript_line"> sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft lifted by the winnowing wind,</div><div id="00:00:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep, Drowsed with the fume of poppies,</div><div id="00:01:04.560" class="transcript_line"> While thy hook spares the next swath and all its twine&#039;d flowers,</div><div id="00:01:10.400" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes like a gleener thou dost keep steady thy laden head across a brook,</div><div id="00:01:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Or by a cider press with patient look Thou watchest the last oozing hours by hours.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they?</div><div id="00:01:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Think not of them, thou hast thy music too. While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day,</div><div id="00:01:38.560" class="transcript_line"> And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue, Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn,</div><div id="00:01:45.360" class="transcript_line"> Among the river sallows, born aloft or sinking As the light wind lives or dies,</div><div id="00:01:52.160" class="transcript_line"> And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly borne, Hedge crickets sing, and now with treble soft</div><div id="00:01:59.760" class="transcript_line"> The red-breast whistles from a garden croft, And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.</div></div></p>
