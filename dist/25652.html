class="transcript_line"> If you are lucky enough to have good weather, and you agree that this is a pretty fantastic</div><div id="00:00:12.800" class="transcript_line"> view then you are in good company, as the man who is depicted on the engraved slate</div><div id="00:00:18.120" class="transcript_line"> panel in front of you described it as the best view in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:23.760" class="transcript_line"> So who was he?</div><div id="00:00:25.400" class="transcript_line"> During his life Winford Vaughan Thomas brought pleasure to millions of people.</div><div id="00:00:30.560" class="transcript_line"> He will be most fondly remembered for his work at the BBC.</div><div id="00:00:34.480" class="transcript_line"> As a war correspondent between 1942 and 1945 he dealt with some of the most frightening</div><div id="00:00:41.040" class="transcript_line"> and thrilling events of the Second World War, including a report from a Lancaster bomber</div><div id="00:00:46.320" class="transcript_line"> over Berlin and another from the Belsen concentration camp.</div><div id="00:00:51.580" class="transcript_line"> In 1953 he was also part of a team to commentate on the coronation of the Queen.</div><div id="00:00:58.820" class="transcript_line"> Later in his life he not only co-founded Harlech TV, now ITV Wales, but he also travelled the</div><div id="00:01:05.740" class="transcript_line"> length and breadth of Wales to fulfil his love of the Welsh countryside.</div><div id="00:01:10.860" class="transcript_line"> So this man knows a good view when he sees one.</div><div id="00:01:14.700" class="transcript_line"> 13 peaks are shown on the slate panel and on a good day you may even be able to make</div><div id="00:01:20.660" class="transcript_line"> out Snowdon.</div><div id="00:01:23.620" class="transcript_line"> Winford Vaughan Thomas would have enjoyed the 9km walk we are about to embark on, but</div><div id="00:01:29.220" class="transcript_line"> would have been only too aware of the need to take care when walking in the uplands.</div><div id="00:01:34.700" class="transcript_line"> Whilst much of the route is along well defined tracks, some of your journey will take you</div><div id="00:01:39.660" class="transcript_line"> over rough and sometimes steep moorland.</div><div id="00:01:43.300" class="transcript_line"> If you are at all concerned that visibility will be reduced due to low cloud or mist,</div><div id="00:01:49.140" class="transcript_line"> then please consider delaying your trip.</div><div id="00:01:53.500" class="transcript_line"> Also ensure that you are wearing sturdy walking boots and carry suitable weather protection</div><div id="00:01:58.820" class="transcript_line"> for all conditions.</div><div id="00:02:00.940" class="transcript_line"> The weather can quickly change in the Welsh hills.</div><div id="00:02:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Navigation aids in the form of a route finding map and compass, plus the ability to use them,</div><div id="00:02:11.060" class="transcript_line"> will also be wise additions to the packed lunch and a drink as the audio trail will</div><div id="00:02:16.860" class="transcript_line"> take at least three hours to complete.</div><div id="00:02:20.300" class="transcript_line"> So if you have decided to follow our audio trail, you will hear how life has changed</div><div id="00:02:25.340" class="transcript_line"> on these moors over the millennia, and what exciting yet subtle plans the Montgomeryshire</div><div id="00:02:31.980" class="transcript_line"> Wildlife Trust have for their future.</div><div id="00:02:35.820" class="transcript_line"> If you would like to discover more about Winford Vaughan Thomas, including some of his most</div><div id="00:02:39.980" class="transcript_line"> memorable recordings, you can download a podcast about his life from the Campaign for the Protection</div><div id="00:02:45.320" class="transcript_line"> of Rural Wales website www.cprw.org.uk.</div><div id="00:02:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Head down the track past the memorial and through two gates, keeping the conifer plantation</div><div id="00:02:59.220" class="transcript_line"> on your right.</div><div id="00:03:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Where the track crosses a little gully, on a right hand bend, head diagonally uphill</div><div id="00:03:05.920" class="transcript_line"> across the open moorland, keeping a fence line in view on your left.</div><div id="00:03:11.760" class="transcript_line"> On reaching the top of the ridge, bear right towards a new stile.</div><div id="00:03:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Climb this and follow the narrow path through the heather and bilberry to the top of the</div><div id="00:03:21.200" class="transcript_line"> ridge where there is a concrete trig point.</div><div id="00:03:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Listen to track two at the concrete trig point that offers extensive views.</div></div></p>
