    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I start the bird survey again at the end of March.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I monitor the dippers and greewag deals from Pycon, they call it.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I follow the river all the way up the Cran Can Reservoir, the topside of Ebbw Vale.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the source of the river Ebbw.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Along that piece of river and the adjoining river which is the Ebbw Valle,</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got over 40 nests of dipper and around about 20 odd nests I record every year of grey wagdale.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And two of those sites are beyond the navigation.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Both ends of the long tunnel.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So the north end and the south end both have dipper nests.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And the south end has definitely got a red-legged grey wagdale nest in it.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the top end, the north end occasionally a grey wagdale nest.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> When I first started doing it, which is now 11 years ago,</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I could just walk around the end of the fence with my ladle on my shoulder.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course it&#039;s become more secure than that since.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I now get the code off Vira and I go there probably four times a year,</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> depending on the timing of the nesting.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Possibly a fifth sometimes if I missed the timing things.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all part of a monitoring scheme with the British Trust of Ornithology.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The 40 odd dipper nest that I record is just a drop in the ocean for the British Trust of Ornithology.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But when they pull all these drops in the ocean together,</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> they get a good idea of what&#039;s going on in the ornithological world.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s good fun, I enjoy doing it. That&#039;s the main thing.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you do it on your own? Do you have to be very quiet?</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Mainly on my own. I sometimes take a trainee bird-bringer along with me.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody who&#039;s interested in photography maybe comes along, but most of the time I do it on my own.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the time of day? I presume that&#039;s important.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I try to do it between dawn and midday. It&#039;s the quieter part of the day.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You spend a devil lot of time chatting with people otherwise, and I love chatting with people,</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> but it doesn&#039;t get the job done.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ll stand on the back door and I&#039;ll chat for about 20 minutes and I think,</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> God, I think I&#039;ve done another dipper&#039;s nest by now, you know.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I try to do it early morning and by midday, well, I&#039;ve had enough quite much.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve sent years of age and the wall out by midday, so I go and have lunch and bobby feed up.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you go and say that you&#039;re looking at the bottom of the tunnel and you see a nest,</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> how can you tell if it&#039;s active, if there&#039;s eggs in it?</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, generally, you know, I can look at the nest, we&#039;ll put in the ladder again,</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s kind of a small ladder wouldn&#039;t you, whether, we&#039;ll put in the ladder against the wall</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and you can see it&#039;s fresh, it&#039;s been rebuilt.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And as you&#039;re clamouring around your ladder, the dipper usually flies out anyway.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so, but mostly you&#039;ve got to actually go up to the nest and put your hand in</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and feel it and see what&#039;s in there, count the eggs, count the young as they&#039;re having.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Timing you can usually do pretty well because you&#039;ll know the timing of the breeding.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> When the young are about a cent-eight days old, it&#039;s ideal time to put rings on them,</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> which will identify them as individuals for the rest of their life then.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the adults will have colour rings on them.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I say, oh yes, it&#039;s red over blue, that&#039;s the female from Crumlin South or whatever,</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> without having to catch them again.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I actually put three, there&#039;s either a red or a yellow on the left leg</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and that indicates male or female.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So if it&#039;s yellow it&#039;s a female, if it&#039;s red it&#039;s a male.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> On the other leg there&#039;s two colour rings and those two colour rings identifies it at that centre,</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> a female from Crumlin South or a male from a young school or whatever.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re identified forevermore as individuals.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> For the first time this year I had a male who was eight years old.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It equals a record lifespan for the tipper.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s not going to be able to do the next screen I wouldn&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be really pleased to think he is, but I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s such an old blinder, nested under an old arch bridge there,</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> a real ancient old brick arch bridge there.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s not nested there for eight years, he&#039;s been in four different places along the river,</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> at four different ways over the eight years.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Well what happens is one dies off and then the other one has to move to find a mate</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> or stay put and sing and attract a mate.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But you get bigamous males, very often get one male with two nest sites,</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> there are all sorts of complications.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And this guy was born down at Abertaweery by the fire station there,</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> he was a pulley or a baby the next day.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> He went from there to another site just up in the park there,</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Abertaweery Park.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> From there he went all the way up the valley to the little site stream which is,</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah, come to there, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And he read young there and then he went down then to just below Blenau</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> where I recorded him last year.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So he got up at the third pit in those eight years.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know all that because he&#039;s got the colourings on his neck so I can just look</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and tell you where he&#039;s from.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So how many different colours do you have?</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just throwing the maths in my head.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s 14 colours and then of course you can make ever so many combinations of that.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, well I assume you don&#039;t have to read them.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> When you run out of one combination you can switch the male ring to the other leg</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and start all over again.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think I can sum it up around 200 combinations I can do.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s some of them that are not so easy to see.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s obviously red, blue, green.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a brown, there&#039;s a yellow.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a shocking pink, a real shocking pink.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s an ordinary pink.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t combine those if I can help it.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s an orange which very often gets mistaken for brown.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Black and white, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re easy to see colours, they&#039;re really easy ones.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> What about green?</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they do green.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Surprisingly easy to identify, you&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;d think it would be.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Biggest mistakes are between orange and red.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And shocking pink after about three or four years goes not so shocking,</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> it goes more pinkish.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want to complicate that.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Every baby gets a shocking pink ring on his right leg.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That tells me it&#039;s a young bird that hasn&#039;t been ringed as a breeding bird.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So when he&#039;s re-caught, he gets then his twin pullers.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Soon as I can catch him after the first year.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I see a shocking pink pulley, as I call them.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Pulley means baby bird basically.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You see when there&#039;s a shocking pink ring on it on the river,</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and you purposely put a net up to catch it.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So how do you catch it? Is that a big net?</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Long, fine, fine, fine, fine net stretched across the river.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s four pockets, there are four loops.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And as the bird hits the net, he forms a loop on the other side,</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s in that pocket.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s strands going through the netting,</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and those strands form four pockets in the net, all the way through the river.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And as the bird hits the net, he pushes the net forward and down,</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> so he gets trapped in that pocket.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you get two, yeah, because the net is very flexible,</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, they&#039;re very loose pockets.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s good, if you can catch male and female together, bang, bang, screaming, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Do they get distressed, or do they like freeze?</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s obviously stress involved, but the fact is, you know, that male&#039;s been there for eight years,</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> so couldn&#039;t be that bad, could it?</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell, is it easy to tell how old they are?</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The BVO keeps a catalogue, a computerised catalogue, of course, of all the colouring.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;ll know my colour combinations.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And if a bird just comes in as a searching of colourings,</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ll be able to tell you whether it&#039;s mine or one from up north, from Wales or whatever.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I had one come down to somewhere south of Newbridge, and that one came from Midwilch.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d come, I don&#039;t know how many kilometres he&#039;d come, and it was a male.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the furthest travel dip I&#039;ve had up until now.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The furthest one for me went from Aberdeleby over to Ponlepleve.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a large sewage works there, just below Ponlepleve,</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and a bird ring caught in a net there on the sewage works, well, on the river adjacent to the sewage works.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my furthest one at the moment.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had one come to me from way up in Midwilch.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So mine would be going that far as well, just so nobody&#039;s caught me.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell until they get bigger after that first year?</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, just change influence. They start off with a speckledy colour, like a baby robin.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> A young robin in his first few months is just speckledy colour all over.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And young dippers are like that as well, just speckledy all over.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> By the autumn, they look exactly like their parents and can&#039;t tell the difference.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I&#039;m looking for rings. I&#039;m looking for colour rings.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Or the lack of, if there&#039;s no rings on one of the adults feeding at the nest,</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll put a net in my catching and put rings on them.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in time it will save me and the bird a lot of stress.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, not stress for me, it&#039;s quite fun for me going up to.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all empty instinct job, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But it will save the bird a lot of stress of being caught and ringed and so on.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And do they really spend all, well, they can&#039;t spend all their life on the river.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Pretty well, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously they have to leave the river to go from one to three.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But what they&#039;re doing is following little river that&#039;s sort of stream that&#039;s over the mountains.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how they&#039;ve done it. They&#039;ve followed a little stream that&#039;s up a mountain, down a mountain, whatever.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So what do they feed on?</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Even down to the seashore and back up a river.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s been known as well. They&#039;ve been caught down on, feeding on the Esfydl.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course they&#039;ll go up another river and find one there.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s young birds looking for territories of their own.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Most movement is done in that first year. Long distant movements.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But these intermediate movements are because one of the pairs has died off.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s happening is there&#039;s a male looking for a territory and he stumbles along the territory.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a male in it but it&#039;s got a female in it, you know, and vice versa.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s a male looking for a female, you&#039;ll sit on a rock in the middle of the river and sing until one comes along, basically.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s what all this singing is about, you know, whether it be a blackbird or whatever.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So they pretty much do mate for life then? It&#039;s only when one of them...</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s difficult to say really, but I&#039;d rather think they do because of the longevity of the ones I know of, you know.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You do have the bigamous ones. I&#039;ve had a male servicing three nets.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> To have two is not an unusual talk.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not unusual.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Not unusual at all.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But along the river you&#039;ll have a male down here that&#039;s got another female, three nest territories further up.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s crossing two other territories to get to his other female, you know.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, those four years.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But he wouldn&#039;t think that would happen, but it does, it does, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And what would it actually feed on and what do they feed the babies on?</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They feed them almost entirely on insect larvae out of the water.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Caddis fly, mayfly and so on.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, their breeding is timed to when those things are walking up the walls, coming out of the water, actually out of their little cocoons.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And the dippers are very, very young in that period.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there you go, that&#039;s what they start nesting.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re nesting nests building now.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;re all in territory repairing and building nests now.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Already?</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They will repair the same old nest year.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I&#039;ve got a dipper nest sabacan like this.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But all there in a very deep cut in is the river.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Big tunnel that goes under the one on the flats, the tunnel.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was told about that nest by an old chap who took eggs from there when he was a boy.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, if you work it out, that nest had been nesting like 50 odd years.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s still there now, it&#039;s still using it.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, it&#039;s a combination of the one with the pair dying off, another one coming in, the other one dies off, another one comes in.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I took the guy there and I said, where&#039;s the nest then?</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, it&#039;s just below that pipe he said in the mottage, he said on the wall.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, that&#039;s right, it&#039;s still there now.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that same spot where he took eggs out when he was a boy.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And it worked out like 56 years ago or something.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s incredible, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That is incredible, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The beauty of those old industrial sites, there&#039;s walls and tunnels and bridges and it&#039;s still there, the old stonework.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And when they built these arches, I&#039;m the builder, sorry, I know what I&#039;m talking about.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> When you build an arch, you build a former, a wooden former, yeah?</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And this rests on pieces of steel or wood in the wall, mostly wood, because you could just cut it off and leave it there afterwards.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So along the bottom where the arch meets the upright, along here there&#039;s a series of holes where the wood was long long,</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> because it had rotted out 20 years ago, and left these nice 16 holes and that&#039;s where you find a lot of them in there.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, some of them, I got one at the old site there at Abbott-le-Eddy and at Deverdell, I&#039;ll find this one, they changed their site.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they started using a Dipper diadote. They put two foot above the water, it&#039;s all in the arch.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> What shape is the Dipper&#039;s Nest?</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, a Dipper&#039;s Nest is quite bulky, it&#039;s football size. So in the old, it&#039;s only like this big, but then they bring a big canopy out over the top and a big bowl underneath,</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got to put your hand up in like that to get in there, you know, just up and in. You can&#039;t look in the nest.</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s this big canopy over the top and that keeps the end of the trip in water, there&#039;s a lot of water in these situations, you know,</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and so a lot of water&#039;s tripping over and it hides the nest from predators and that. It&#039;s quite the construction.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It takes some months to make it, it&#039;s not something that a blackbird builds in a week or something. These dippers take months to build these nests.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The biggest predators I have found has been crows and macaws in this, because they get way the younger, the younger they go looking.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But if it&#039;s further up the tunnel, of course they&#039;re afraid to go in places like that. So the situation is in the protection mainly.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s low on the water, they&#039;re vulnerable to an otter or something, a mink. Not too many these days, but there&#039;s mink along the river, and there&#039;s otters along the river.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you see evidence of that along the site?</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> All the time, yeah, all the time. So, but the biggest predators would be avian predators. Your macaw or a crow would hear the young calling for food.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re feeding their own food.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they can get in at the entrance.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They just came to the wall and put their head in.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t get a devil lot of predation. Predation every year would be down as much as 10% probably, you know, the nests, which is not a lot.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas an open nest for black birds and song fish and everything like that, they must lose every other one, everything.</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve all got a part to play, you know. You know, magbys stealing the eggs and the younger birds. But it&#039;s all part of the natural cycle of events, you know.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Magbys do a good job, otherwise, you know, cleaning up dead things and things like that.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And another thing that is peculiar to the dipper, I don&#039;t know any other bird that does it, they build their nest directly over the water.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t carry the fecal sack away. The youngsters just do it straight out to the nest.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But it goes straight into the water. And that&#039;s another deterrent for predators. If they don&#039;t find the drop-ins, they don&#039;t find the nest.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They never ever find the dipper&#039;s nest that is not directly over the water, unless the water has receded tremendously.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, as I sat and took photographs at the nest and I couldn&#039;t believe what I was watching, the female, there was pebbles there because the river receded so much, the nest now was no longer over the water.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d go in, feed the young, drop down to the pebbles, clean up the drop-ins off the pebbles, and go down to the river and wash your billy in the river.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And every time they&#039;d come to feed, that&#039;s what they would do. They would feed the young, drop down to the pebbles, clean up the mess, go to the river, wash their billy in the river.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When they first had seen that, they couldn&#039;t believe it was happening, but they probably do it all the time.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I photographed the bird coming and going, but you can&#039;t sort of prove it.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You said all that so quickly, and they don&#039;t go to the exact place in the river every time, so you can&#039;t focus your camera on one spot.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They still have a photograph of that.</div></div></p>
