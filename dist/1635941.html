1950 when you and your twin brother got called up for National Service.</div><div id="00:06:13.220" class="transcript_line"> Well basically we were called up and did our training in Derring Lines in Brecon and during the career training and then we were doing some career training in Cwmgywdi at the mountain rescue places.</div><div id="00:06:39.220" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m not sure but and then we were on draft then for career or Belize in Central America and so we were all on the main square with all the streets and bedfords.</div><div id="00:07:00.220" class="transcript_line"> We were all in line picking different people up and my brother and I were by the tailboard of the lorry basically.</div><div id="00:07:10.220" class="transcript_line"> The other guys were getting up onto the vehicle and we were told that you&#039;re not going, you must report to the officers mess.</div><div id="00:07:23.220" class="transcript_line"> So we went up to the officers mess and that&#039;s where basically we stayed.</div><div id="00:07:32.220" class="transcript_line"> We became waiters and then.</div><div id="00:07:39.220" class="transcript_line"> What was the reason for you being called back?</div><div id="00:07:42.220" class="transcript_line"> The reason was that somebody had decided to send us up.</div><div id="00:07:57.220" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know who it was but unknown to myself and my brother years.</div><div id="00:08:06.220" class="transcript_line"> I almost finished with the tears.</div><div id="00:08:10.220" class="transcript_line"> My mother told me that she had written to the then Major Tyler who was the PMCD.</div><div id="00:08:24.220" class="transcript_line"> It must have been prior to that.</div><div id="00:08:27.220" class="transcript_line"> Who she&#039;d written to I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:08:31.220" class="transcript_line"> But to say that she&#039;d already lost one by and I don&#039;t know her words as she didn&#039;t say.</div><div id="00:08:43.220" class="transcript_line"> I was just guessing that when you look at my eyes I don&#039;t know what it was.</div><div id="00:08:52.220" class="transcript_line"> I have no idea.</div><div id="00:08:53.220" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know anything of this.</div><div id="00:08:55.220" class="transcript_line"> I was quite annoyed really because I wanted to do a bit of adventure.</div><div id="00:09:01.220" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was worried about where to go here and in any case.</div><div id="00:09:07.220" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how we landed in Bracken itself.</div><div id="00:09:14.220" class="transcript_line"> When we came out we had to join the TAVR, Territorial Volunteer Reserves.</div><div id="00:09:24.220" class="transcript_line"> Army volunteers TAVR.</div><div id="00:09:27.220" class="transcript_line"> So that was 1952?</div><div id="00:09:36.220" class="transcript_line"> That was supposed to be for about six years or seven years.</div><div id="00:09:44.220" class="transcript_line"> During that time I stayed with Fourth Welsh until that was disbanded.</div><div id="00:09:52.220" class="transcript_line"> On the photograph I sent you this morning I won the driving competition.</div><div id="00:09:59.220" class="transcript_line"> On the LMG pairs with the Sergeant Bill, I can&#039;t think of his name.</div><div id="00:10:14.220" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s the man in the centre behind to the right behind Colonel Tylai.</div><div id="00:10:25.220" class="transcript_line"> In that photograph you see of him he was the Colonel then.</div><div id="00:10:33.220" class="transcript_line"> During my time with the Fourth Welsh I was always Colonel&#039;s driver.</div><div id="00:10:43.220" class="transcript_line"> Because I was an advanced motorist and they must have thought I was better than anybody else.</div><div id="00:10:49.220" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:50.220" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:51.220" class="transcript_line"> Anyway I had the job.</div><div id="00:10:55.220" class="transcript_line"> As I think I told you the other day that I was in Talfblay Plain and this.</div><div id="00:11:05.220" class="transcript_line"> Ralph Tucker, Colonel Ralph Tucker, I was his driver.</div><div id="00:11:12.220" class="transcript_line"> He said I carry on along this.</div><div id="00:11:15.220" class="transcript_line"> What seemed to be like a big pudding in an area called Hangingstone Tor.</div><div id="00:11:24.220" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:11:26.220" class="transcript_line"> I said it&#039;s too much.</div><div id="00:11:28.220" class="transcript_line"> I said it&#039;s too soft.</div><div id="00:11:30.220" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll make it.</div><div id="00:11:32.220" class="transcript_line"> He said follow me Davis.</div><div id="00:11:35.220" class="transcript_line"> With that my Land Rover disappeared practically.</div><div id="00:11:39.220" class="transcript_line"> All I could do in the front end of the Land Rover was down in the mud.</div><div id="00:11:46.220" class="transcript_line"> I had an 18 foot aerial on the back.</div><div id="00:11:54.220" class="transcript_line"> I tried to hand-pitch it on that.</div><div id="00:11:58.220" class="transcript_line"> I had a couple of bars of Kit Kat chocolate.</div><div id="00:12:05.220" class="transcript_line"> After that Remy came to tow me out.</div><div id="00:12:10.220" class="transcript_line"> They got stuck by well towing me out.</div><div id="00:12:17.220" class="transcript_line"> I think it became a brigade exercise.</div><div id="00:12:21.220" class="transcript_line"> Anyway eventually from the Wednesday to the Friday I think I got back to one of the camps in Southbridge Bay.</div><div id="00:12:33.220" class="transcript_line"> Another little tale for you.</div><div id="00:12:36.220" class="transcript_line"> I was with Colonel Tyler.</div><div id="00:12:41.220" class="transcript_line"> Then he became a brigadier later on.</div><div id="00:12:46.220" class="transcript_line"> We were going across this web.</div><div id="00:12:52.220" class="transcript_line"> He said go straight across this field.</div><div id="00:12:57.220" class="transcript_line"> We drove straight across the field.</div><div id="00:13:01.220" class="transcript_line"> Then of course we&#039;ll say the Monday after or whatever it was.</div><div id="00:13:09.220" class="transcript_line"> He saw his mistake.</div><div id="00:13:12.220" class="transcript_line"> He was standing behind me and all the boys in front.</div><div id="00:13:17.220" class="transcript_line"> He said now this is what you must do.</div><div id="00:13:22.220" class="transcript_line"> He said go straight across the field like that.</div><div id="00:13:26.220" class="transcript_line"> He realised that somebody took the whole vehicle going across the field.</div><div id="00:13:42.220" class="transcript_line"> He said you don&#039;t cross fields like that.</div><div id="00:13:46.220" class="transcript_line"> You must go right round the edge and then your tracks won&#039;t be...</div><div id="00:13:54.220" class="transcript_line"> He was the one that was wrong.</div><div id="00:13:57.220" class="transcript_line"> He cleverly thought to clear this one up.</div><div id="00:14:03.220" class="transcript_line"> The camouflaging of all my vehicles.</div><div id="00:14:08.220" class="transcript_line"> To see if we had any mistakes at all.</div><div id="00:14:11.220" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t see any of our...</div><div id="00:14:14.220" class="transcript_line"> This was in RCT.</div><div id="00:14:17.220" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t see any mistakes at all that I had made with my boys.</div><div id="00:14:26.220" class="transcript_line"> The only thing we could see from the air was the officer&#039;s mess toilet with a Hessian right round it.</div><div id="00:14:35.220" class="transcript_line"> Sticking out like a sore thumb.</div><div id="00:14:40.220" class="transcript_line"> Later on of course that was shown as well.</div><div id="00:14:45.220" class="transcript_line"> I took a photograph of it.</div><div id="00:14:49.220" class="transcript_line"> When I was up in the air with this helicopter.</div><div id="00:14:54.220" class="transcript_line"> I took a photograph of it.</div><div id="00:14:58.220" class="transcript_line"> The officers were trying to not belittle us.</div><div id="00:15:06.220" class="transcript_line"> But see what mistakes we had made.</div><div id="00:15:11.220" class="transcript_line"> They were the ones that made the mistake.</div><div id="00:15:14.220" class="transcript_line"> Another little thing I used to do was stick into the toilet.</div><div id="00:15:19.220" class="transcript_line"> You had to dig six foot holes with the plank across.</div><div id="00:15:27.220" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d bump across the plank and do the rest of it.</div><div id="00:15:32.220" class="transcript_line"> One fell over, the plank broke.</div><div id="00:15:37.220" class="transcript_line"> They came out sinking over everything.</div><div id="00:15:41.220" class="transcript_line"> Then we were called up with 224 squadron.</div><div id="00:15:48.220" class="transcript_line"> I had a section of five or six vehicles.</div><div id="00:15:58.220" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll send you another photograph of one that we pulled in the side of the road.</div><div id="00:16:07.220" class="transcript_line"> Then I decided to go right across the road into this car parking area to change drivers.</div><div id="00:16:15.220" class="transcript_line"> At the start of it we were all collected together.</div><div id="00:16:23.220" class="transcript_line"> We had to drive to a place called Gage.</div><div id="00:16:29.220" class="transcript_line"> On the way down we must have left Carmarthen at about 7 o&#039;clock in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:16:37.220" class="transcript_line"> That was more or less midnight.</div><div id="00:16:41.220" class="transcript_line"> I went to the sergeant&#039;s west end.</div><div id="00:16:45.220" class="transcript_line"> They wished me a happy birthday and gave me a glass of red wine.</div><div id="00:16:49.220" class="transcript_line"> That was it. Off we went.</div><div id="00:16:53.220" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like it not to be known as Gage in Royal Air Force place.</div><div id="00:16:59.220" class="transcript_line"> We drove down into what was an underground arm and step over.</div><div id="00:17:07.220" class="transcript_line"> It was full of everything there.</div><div id="00:17:13.220" class="transcript_line"> There were rows and rows of ambulances, motorbikes and so forth.</div><div id="00:17:19.220" class="transcript_line"> We dropped the sides of the vehicles and loaded them up.</div><div id="00:17:25.220" class="transcript_line"> We started off down towards Marchwood in Southampton.</div><div id="00:17:34.220" class="transcript_line"> On the way down I stopped and had the vehicles in a formation of readiness to turn right into the car park.</div><div id="00:17:49.220" class="transcript_line"> All of a sudden we were shunted from behind by this big arctic vehicle.</div><div id="00:17:57.220" class="transcript_line"> There were three or four vehicles.</div><div id="00:18:04.220" class="transcript_line"> Bang, bang, bang.</div><div id="00:18:07.220" class="transcript_line"> I think three or four vehicles.</div><div id="00:18:12.220" class="transcript_line"> I think I showed you the photo.</div><div id="00:18:19.220" class="transcript_line"> I took those photographs while the boys were giving the police reports.</div><div id="00:18:31.220" class="transcript_line"> I went back to the lorry itself.</div><div id="00:18:37.220" class="transcript_line"> The little boy was in...</div><div id="00:18:41.220" class="transcript_line"> I know later on he had a broken leg.</div><div id="00:18:45.220" class="transcript_line"> I put him in my sleeping bag to give him a warm one and then off we went to the ambulance.</div><div id="00:18:51.220" class="transcript_line"> There was a helicopter above and other vehicles came and transferred the ammunition to other vehicles and off they went.</div><div id="00:19:07.220" class="transcript_line"> Then we went on to the emptying of the vehicles area.</div><div id="00:19:20.220" class="transcript_line"> I think it must have gone on to the Hermes or the Atlantic Coveya.</div><div id="00:19:28.220" class="transcript_line"> I think it was the Atlantic Coveya because the Hermes was in Plymouth.</div><div id="00:19:37.220" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:19:40.220" class="transcript_line"> On the way down, prior to leaving the depot, when we picked up the ammunition,</div><div id="00:19:54.220" class="transcript_line"> we wrote on it, from 2 to 4 Squadron, with love to the President,</div><div id="00:20:02.220" class="transcript_line"> love from 3 to 4 Squadron.</div><div id="00:20:06.220" class="transcript_line"> That little message, I don&#039;t think got there basically because it must have been sunk with the Atlantic Coveya.</div><div id="00:20:18.220" class="transcript_line"> We came back then and then I climbed Snowdon,</div><div id="00:20:27.220" class="transcript_line"> before that is climbed Snowdon with the boys 4 times.</div><div id="00:20:35.220" class="transcript_line"> Did I send you that photo?</div><div id="00:20:40.220" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:41.220" class="transcript_line"> I sent you that one after. We were all on top of Snowdon, which was quite good.</div><div id="00:20:49.220" class="transcript_line"> Being silly rather than clever, we all ran down instead of...</div><div id="00:20:57.220" class="transcript_line"> I was a lot better than I am now. I couldn&#039;t do it now. I can&#039;t walk across the blanket road.</div><div id="00:21:04.220" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just where I live now.</div><div id="00:21:07.220" class="transcript_line"> I was on standby to pick up a rocket of some kind from Milford Avon,</div><div id="00:21:17.220" class="transcript_line"> and to take it up to Ross Scrythe in Scotland.</div><div id="00:21:21.220" class="transcript_line"> I was on standby and all this happened in about 12 days basically.</div><div id="00:21:29.220" class="transcript_line"> But the fault comes to an end then basically.</div><div id="00:21:35.220" class="transcript_line"> It was all stood down and we all attended with us.</div><div id="00:21:40.220" class="transcript_line"> While this vehicle that was commandeered, it was a civilian vehicle, a Volvo F10 it was.</div><div id="00:21:55.220" class="transcript_line"> I was supposed to have driven that one, and I think because there was a police car there as well,</div><div id="00:22:03.220" class="transcript_line"> I was hoping that he&#039;d be in front because I wouldn&#039;t know the way to go up there.</div><div id="00:22:11.220" class="transcript_line"> And then he gets without maps and all that.</div><div id="00:22:15.220" class="transcript_line"> Don, are you a Welsh speaker by any chance?</div><div id="00:22:19.220" class="transcript_line"> No, my parents were English and we spoke English.</div><div id="00:22:26.220" class="transcript_line"> Another little story, my friend was a vet and he was in the German veterinary corps.</div><div id="00:22:35.220" class="transcript_line"> But he was stationed in... he had a practice in Llanfairfechon in North Wales.</div><div id="00:22:43.220" class="transcript_line"> He used to live in Llanfairfechon.</div><div id="00:22:46.220" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:22:47.220" class="transcript_line"> I worked in Llanfairfechon in a hospital there I believe to not.</div><div id="00:22:51.220" class="transcript_line"> Well, well.</div><div id="00:22:53.220" class="transcript_line"> That was when I was young, I was only about 20 then.</div><div id="00:22:56.220" class="transcript_line"> You know, 21, 22.</div><div id="00:22:59.220" class="transcript_line"> Well, he had a practice in Llanfairfechon.</div><div id="00:23:04.220" class="transcript_line"> Going from the sea road adjacent to the centre of Llanfairfechon,</div><div id="00:23:11.220" class="transcript_line"> it was on the right, almost before you got to the wooded area on the left.</div><div id="00:23:17.220" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:23:18.220" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, we were in this... you say, did I speak Welsh?</div><div id="00:23:26.220" class="transcript_line"> And my friend was attending to a cow with a big glove on his right hand,</div><div id="00:23:36.220" class="transcript_line"> so you can guess the rest.</div><div id="00:23:39.220" class="transcript_line"> And the farmer said, do you speak Welsh?</div><div id="00:23:43.220" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no, but I can understand it.</div><div id="00:23:46.220" class="transcript_line"> He said, there&#039;s nothing clever about that.</div><div id="00:23:48.220" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ve got a dog at home that can do that.</div><div id="00:23:52.220" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that you would like to add?</div><div id="00:23:57.220" class="transcript_line"> Any other stories or anything?</div><div id="00:24:02.220" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen the Days of Hope?</div><div id="00:24:08.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:24:09.220" class="transcript_line"> Well...</div><div id="00:24:10.220" class="transcript_line"> That was with you, that was the First World War.</div><div id="00:24:14.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:24:16.220" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yes, no, I have seen it.</div><div id="00:24:18.220" class="transcript_line"> Well, how that came about was all the boys were in the barracks in Cymraeddyn,</div><div id="00:24:27.220" class="transcript_line"> and this film crew turned up, and they wanted everybody...</div><div id="00:24:34.220" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d already been to 223 Scorton in Swansea,</div><div id="00:24:41.220" class="transcript_line"> and they came to us to ask for extras for the film.</div><div id="00:24:48.220" class="transcript_line"> So they said, some of you will have to get haircuts,</div><div id="00:24:55.220" class="transcript_line"> and I said, well, I don&#039;t mind having a haircut,</div><div id="00:24:58.220" class="transcript_line"> I said, because I haven&#039;t got much left in any case,</div><div id="00:25:01.220" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;m not shaving my moustache off.</div><div id="00:25:05.220" class="transcript_line"> And you see, as you are, we&#039;ve got a job for you.</div><div id="00:25:10.220" class="transcript_line"> So they promoted me suddenly to a captain,</div><div id="00:25:17.220" class="transcript_line"> and all the officers proper, including our favourite sergeant major,</div><div id="00:25:24.220" class="transcript_line"> into private soldiers.</div><div id="00:25:28.220" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re down in Pembroke, Lanyan Barracks in Pembroke Dock,</div><div id="00:25:38.220" class="transcript_line"> and I was dressed as an army officer, captain,</div><div id="00:25:46.220" class="transcript_line"> and the owner of the car was my driver in the picture,</div><div id="00:25:56.220" class="transcript_line"> and on the right hand side was, on my left hand side in the picture was two soldiers.</div><div id="00:26:03.220" class="transcript_line"> The nearest one to me was, then sergeant Westfold,</div><div id="00:26:10.220" class="transcript_line"> and the other gentleman was sergeant...</div><div id="00:26:23.220" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of his name just a second.</div><div id="00:26:28.220" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, the picture was, it looked as if I was just stepping into the car.</div><div id="00:26:41.220" class="transcript_line"> The car was a Swift, and it was owned by the chauffeur himself.</div><div id="00:26:48.220" class="transcript_line"> Somebody, he lives in Pembroke somewhere, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:26:53.220" class="transcript_line"> And so that was the story of that.</div><div id="00:26:58.220" class="transcript_line"> And when I was fitting for the jacket,</div><div id="00:27:05.220" class="transcript_line"> the jacket had been worn by David Niven,</div><div id="00:27:13.220" class="transcript_line"> and the hat that I had was worn by Steptoe and son,</div><div id="00:27:23.220" class="transcript_line"> son, Harry H Colbert.</div><div id="00:27:26.220" class="transcript_line"> They had their names inside it.</div><div id="00:27:28.220" class="transcript_line"> I thought for the next wearer, I put my name on it as well.</div><div id="00:27:35.220" class="transcript_line"> My name was put forward to drive a Land Rover in the rally called Black Dragon.</div><div id="00:27:50.220" class="transcript_line"> During that time, my navigator was then Second Lieutenant David Morris,</div><div id="00:28:01.220" class="transcript_line"> and we started the rally in Abergavenny army depot there.</div><div id="00:28:19.220" class="transcript_line"> We had to drive up as far as Chester,</div><div id="00:28:24.220" class="transcript_line"> and come all the way back down then to Sunnybridge.</div><div id="00:28:32.220" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to, it was about 154 miles over distance,</div><div id="00:28:46.220" class="transcript_line"> but I won it outright.</div><div id="00:28:49.220" class="transcript_line"> There was, I think, about 135 Land Rovers trying.</div><div id="00:28:59.220" class="transcript_line"> It was previously won a couple of years before by the Royal Military Police.</div><div id="00:29:12.220" class="transcript_line"> Then it was the following year or two, it was won by the Gurkhas,</div><div id="00:29:20.220" class="transcript_line"> and then it was finally won by me.</div><div id="00:29:25.220" class="transcript_line"> And Lieutenant Morris was a good navigator.</div></div></p>
