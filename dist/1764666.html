Can you describe the sort of run up to things?</div><div id="00:01:48.960" class="transcript_line"> I was really, well for me to begin with I was just, I didn&#039;t really take it seriously.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Like people around me were saying oh this is going to happen and we&#039;re going to have this worldwide thing and you know and I just thought no I don&#039;t see it myself.</div><div id="00:02:01.680" class="transcript_line"> And then slowly slowly things started to change and I thought hmm maybe I should start taking things more seriously but I just couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:10.080" class="transcript_line"> My brain wouldn&#039;t allow me to accept the change that was happening even though I knew it was going to happen and I knew I&#039;d have to adjust.</div><div id="00:02:16.720" class="transcript_line"> At that moment in time because nobody seemed to panic or everybody around me seemed to panic except for me.</div><div id="00:02:22.640" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit like should I be panicked and I thought but then if I start panicking I&#039;m only adding to what&#039;s already there and people would ask me why are you not panicking?</div><div id="00:02:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Why are you not panicked buying? I said because I don&#039;t need to.</div><div id="00:02:36.240" class="transcript_line"> I said I don&#039;t feel we&#039;re at that point where we need to start panicking about what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="00:02:42.720" class="transcript_line"> I think it really did hit me once we sort of got to start a march and they were like and everything&#039;s shut.</div><div id="00:02:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was strange it was almost like momentarily in my head the world had stopped because everything I&#039;d strive to have and achieve in my life had almost been put on hold.</div><div id="00:03:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I was like I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do because I dance eight to ten hours a week.</div><div id="00:03:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I do loads of other things and then all of a sudden to be told you can&#039;t even go out of your local area was a real shock really.</div><div id="00:03:18.560" class="transcript_line"> But I mean yeah the run-up to it was strange because in my head I didn&#039;t want it to happen or in my head I didn&#039;t want it to happen as quick as it did.</div><div id="00:03:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And then there was like I spoke to someone who&#039;s close to me, well it was my dance teacher in fact, and she was the same.</div><div id="00:03:40.240" class="transcript_line"> She says I can&#039;t wrap my head around why people are panicking and I said to her maybe it&#039;s just me and you.</div><div id="00:03:45.760" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d laugh and joke about the fact, not joke about what was going on, we&#039;d joke about the fact that we were so laid back and the rest of the world was in this panic-stricken.</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> And then suddenly we just kind of went now we understand why but it&#039;s because we were just like oh when it happens it happens.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think people were preempting the worst before it actually happened so already people were getting anxious about what was going to happen.</div><div id="00:04:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Whereas naturally you&#039;d think it would make me really anxious too but in a weird way I couldn&#039;t be anxious about something that wasn&#039;t real.</div><div id="00:04:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Like it hadn&#039;t happened, there was no lockdown. People around me were panicked by it yeah.</div><div id="00:04:29.360" class="transcript_line"> But other than that I was just like well it&#039;s kind of, to me it was almost like when you go to shops at Christmas time people are manic around you because they want to get all the pre-</div><div id="00:04:39.280" class="transcript_line"> To me nothing, it didn&#039;t really signal to me anything was wrong in the world at that moment in time so I was just kind of you know quite relaxed about it.</div><div id="00:04:47.040" class="transcript_line"> But when it hit it hit with full force then because then I was a bit like I almost felt that I didn&#039;t get any pre-warning because although other people were panicking and I wasn&#039;t and maybe I should have been.</div><div id="00:04:59.440" class="transcript_line"> It was kind of strange then to then suddenly be like well no it is real and then I was kind of frustrated at why I didn&#039;t accept it was real sooner because then it would have been less of a shock and less of an impact.</div><div id="00:05:11.840" class="transcript_line"> But just have to kind of go with it really.</div><div id="00:05:16.880" class="transcript_line"> Do you usually live in your own flat independently?</div><div id="00:05:22.320" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:05:23.520" class="transcript_line"> How has that changed then?</div><div id="00:05:26.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s changed massively in the fact that if I&#039;m being honest I&#039;m currently not living at my own house, I&#039;m living very much at my parents.</div><div id="00:05:34.400" class="transcript_line"> I do go to check my flat and make sure everything&#039;s alright, pick up the post, do things that sort of make to make people aware that I haven&#039;t just completely left it abandoned.</div><div id="00:05:46.480" class="transcript_line"> But it was more a case of when all the lockdowns came in I said to my mum I can&#039;t be on my own, I don&#039;t want you to be on your own because I had no internet.</div><div id="00:05:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Although I had a TV and I had people around me I had no internet and internet has become a massive part of how we communicate now so I&#039;m like if I had been at home and there was no way of me getting to my parents I genuinely have no idea what I&#039;d have done because other than phoning up somebody I would have been completely cut off from the world completely.</div><div id="00:06:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Other than the fact that people could talk to me on the phone I wouldn&#039;t be able to see them virtually because I wouldn&#039;t have, well I do have data on my phone but I wouldn&#039;t have been nowhere near enough for me to do what I do now.</div><div id="00:06:31.520" class="transcript_line"> And so yeah it was a bit of a shock because obviously coming down to my parents it was a bit stressful because suddenly my dad who works four days a week was suddenly working from home.</div><div id="00:06:45.840" class="transcript_line"> As well as myself having to keep up my men cat work and my other job because neither of them were furlough which was good in a way because it gave me something to focus on but in a way it was quite stressful because dad and I were having to make sure we were in opposite ends of the house otherwise we&#039;d hear each other&#039;s conversation.</div><div id="00:07:06.080" class="transcript_line"> And it just particularly as he was having to record quite a lot of his meetings so he was like it wasn&#039;t until they played it back all they could hear was me in the background talking about my work and they were like oh dad was like well we were in different rooms of the house but the house is not majorly big in terms of even if we went upstairs and then again the internet is not great because we&#039;re the furthest away from the internet box where we live so it&#039;s kind of hit and miss as to who whose call goes because usually if two of us are on a call</div><div id="00:07:36.080" class="transcript_line"> at the same time one would cut the other out so it was kind of working out who&#039;s more important.</div><div id="00:07:43.840" class="transcript_line"> So yeah I&#039;m hoping to go back up into my place at some point but the the fact that the world is so uncertain doesn&#039;t make me at the moment doesn&#039;t make me feel that going back is the right thing and I&#039;m still trying to look for a place to live in Abercadene.</div><div id="00:07:57.680" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t found one on the council yet even though there have been many properties on the council I still haven&#039;t found one but hopefully fingers crossed it won&#039;t be too much longer.</div><div id="00:08:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Four years.</div><div id="00:08:18.640" class="transcript_line"> Your independence and how was it kind of coming back to your family home?</div><div id="00:08:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Your family is your family you know you love them no matter what although I will say it was a bit of a shock for all of us because I had developed my own way of doing things and then also then of course because I moved back into my parents I pretty much had the contents of a flat in someone else&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:08:45.280" class="transcript_line"> My mum was like you can&#039;t bring all your stuff here I don&#039;t have the space you know yes you&#039;ve got your flat but you can&#039;t so I had to limit what I was bringing with me and also the room I have at my home is a box room and I&#039;m used to a double bedroom so the space issue there was was quite interesting but yeah I mean it has been stressful at times because mum isn&#039;t working because she&#039;s not able to work but she still does all her</div><div id="00:09:15.360" class="transcript_line"> stuff online so she does quite a lot of zoom meetings and things so that&#039;s interesting when you&#039;ve got a three-way thing going quite often there&#039;s three of us on three different laptops</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> trying luckily now we have three headsets we didn&#039;t have three headsets at the time so somebody would always have to make sure they were well out of the way</div><div id="00:09:32.160" class="transcript_line"> so that they couldn&#039;t be heard in another room so we were having to try and make sure we were</div><div id="00:09:36.400" class="transcript_line"> because you couldn&#039;t be in the same room with three of you doing three different things of course then the internet would struggle so ultimately somebody would somebody&#039;s call would drop</div><div id="00:09:44.160" class="transcript_line"> so it was quite it was quite difficult now it&#039;s sort of settled down because dad is back at work</div><div id="00:09:50.080" class="transcript_line"> so for us the family dynamic has changed again because it&#039;s meant that it&#039;s made it easier</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> him being at work because he&#039;s quite him being at home was quite stressful because he&#039;s very set in</div><div id="00:10:00.080" class="transcript_line"> his ways he&#039;s very has to do things at a certain time in a certain way and the fact that even though I was living there</div><div id="00:10:07.840" class="transcript_line"> he in his head it&#039;s and yes I&#039;m family but it&#039;s his house so therefore his priorities are the same mine and I&#039;m like I get that but we need to kind of be a bit fair in the fact that I didn&#039;t ask for this to happen in the world nobody did but you know</div><div id="00:10:25.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah it&#039;s been it&#039;s been quite a shock but at the same time things have sort of settled back down again now that he is back at work and it makes it a lot easier</div><div id="00:10:34.160" class="transcript_line"> for me and mum because we are able to separate if we&#039;ve got calls we&#039;re able to separate because</div><div id="00:10:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got dad on the big computer so yeah. And how about friendships then so I know you&#039;re really</div><div id="00:10:48.080" class="transcript_line"> busy part of lots of groups and things like that how maybe if we focus first on</div><div id="00:10:57.760" class="transcript_line"> the friends in groups and then those more sort of personal closer friendships</div><div id="00:11:04.560" class="transcript_line"> yeah I mean I&#039;m lucky in a way that because of my job a lot of because of my</div><div id="00:11:14.880" class="transcript_line"> job I have now I before I was employed by them I was already friends with people that were that were</div><div id="00:11:20.640" class="transcript_line"> there before I became employed so I&#039;ve been very lucky in the fact that we have zoom because that&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:26.640" class="transcript_line"> been zoom has been our main form of contact. Can you just explain what that job is then?</div><div id="00:11:34.880" class="transcript_line"> Just yeah so my job is I&#039;m a sessional worker for building bridges so I work</div><div id="00:11:42.160" class="transcript_line"> with the young people and their families all the way from the age of eight right up to the age of</div><div id="00:11:47.120" class="transcript_line"> adult some people are on the project older than myself and so I&#039;m basically my job is one that</div><div id="00:11:54.560" class="transcript_line"> if they need me to they&#039;ll they&#039;ll ask me if they need me to work so things I&#039;ve done over the</div><div id="00:11:58.400" class="transcript_line"> lockdown are so I&#039;ve done a tie-dye t-shirt video so I&#039;ve uploaded about 15 16 different craft videos</div><div id="00:12:07.200" class="transcript_line"> I started one just as a bit of fun that took off and it was it was a thousand ways for toilet roll</div><div id="00:12:12.640" class="transcript_line"> tubes because at the start I made this joke that everybody&#039;s going to have a toilet roll tube</div><div id="00:12:17.600" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s none in the there&#039;s no toilet rolls in the shop and that was right at the start and</div><div id="00:12:20.640" class="transcript_line"> people thought it was hilarious so I was doing all these different craft things. Just very recently</div><div id="00:12:26.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve had our first face-to-face activity that was a yoga session which was lovely we had it was a</div><div id="00:12:33.440" class="transcript_line"> very small number because a lot of people are actually too frightened to come out it&#039;s gone</div><div id="00:12:39.280" class="transcript_line"> the other way all these people that we encourage out of their houses have now gone completely</div><div id="00:12:42.800" class="transcript_line"> opposite way and so a lot of a lot 95 percent of the work I&#039;m doing is online at the moment with</div><div id="00:12:49.760" class="transcript_line"> with that job so yeah in terms of friendship groups with with that it&#039;s been predominantly</div><div id="00:12:57.360" class="transcript_line"> through zoom or phone calls really but if it hadn&#039;t have been for the fact of the internet</div><div id="00:13:05.200" class="transcript_line"> we wouldn&#039;t be able to do what we I wouldn&#039;t be able to contact people in the way I have</div><div id="00:13:10.080" class="transcript_line"> it has proved it has proved challenging because some people don&#039;t like using the internet they</div><div id="00:13:15.200" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t like it they&#039;re too frightened or they don&#039;t and we have you know and there have been</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> cases where people have not come on so that their communication is all over the phone or some people</div><div id="00:13:23.760" class="transcript_line"> are over email because they don&#039;t that&#039;s their form or texting is their form of communication so</div><div id="00:13:29.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s an interesting it&#039;s interesting how do you find zoom in terms of maintaining contact with</div><div id="00:13:36.240" class="transcript_line"> people and like sort of front with friends and zooms great however it&#039;s only great if one of you</div><div id="00:13:47.200" class="transcript_line"> and your friendship group can afford to have paid for the premium because the problem is and</div><div id="00:13:54.080" class="transcript_line"> I mean me and the groups of people I talk to we can talk and so 40 minutes feels like 10 minutes</div><div id="00:14:00.160" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s gone and I&#039;m like and I have to tell them I&#039;m going it&#039;s counting down it&#039;s going to kick</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> us out and we can restart a meeting the meeting again but then you kind of lose the flow of where</div><div id="00:14:08.480" class="transcript_line"> you are so it kind of yeah I mean zoom has been really helpful and I&#039;ve been lucky in that most</div><div id="00:14:15.360" class="transcript_line"> of my zoom calls with groups of people that I have been speaking to have been done through work so</div><div id="00:14:21.520" class="transcript_line"> therefore work have a premiums account so it&#039;s not quite as bad so we can just kind of set it up and</div><div id="00:14:26.480" class="transcript_line"> kind of go you know talk to we&#039;ve we&#039;ve had enough really so and so have you been able to use that</div><div id="00:14:33.360" class="transcript_line"> work kind of function for more personal connection not for personal I have my own zoom account but I</div><div id="00:14:42.880" class="transcript_line"> have the basics so I can I can contact somebody and do a 40 minute call if I wanted to but</div><div id="00:14:49.600" class="transcript_line"> nine times out of ten some of the times if I&#039;m for closer friends it&#039;s whatsapp video calls</div><div id="00:14:55.280" class="transcript_line"> rather than zoom because you&#039;re it&#039;s unlimited then and it&#039;s on your phone because quite often</div><div id="00:15:01.760" class="transcript_line"> if I&#039;m on the phone to a friend it might I might be outdoors in which I use my own wi-fi</div><div id="00:15:06.480" class="transcript_line"> and my own insets so then I can walk and talk and do things that way so yeah more often than not if</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s personal I don&#039;t zoom tends to be more work-based for me than personal but I have done one or</div><div id="00:15:17.680" class="transcript_line"> two like a friend of mine wanted to do a workout I mean I&#039;m the last person that I yeah I&#039;ll dance</div><div id="00:15:25.040" class="transcript_line"> but um she wanted me to make up some kind of workout so I just stuck some music on and</div><div id="00:15:30.160" class="transcript_line"> moved about but we did that over zoom because the quality was better and because I had the laptop</div><div id="00:15:34.160" class="transcript_line"> it was easier but other than that I tend to use what uh whatsapp really for my video calls</div><div id="00:15:40.480" class="transcript_line"> so with um closer friends then also that more personal contact um are there lots of people</div><div id="00:15:47.520" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;ve been staying in touch with or is it just one or two friends or how&#039;s that been have</div><div id="00:15:51.280" class="transcript_line"> you and Emily been in touch? No this is the thing sadly as well as connecting me to my friends</div><div id="00:15:59.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve also mine mine and Emily&#039;s friendship sadly has phased out to a point where we haven&#039;t been</div><div id="00:16:04.880" class="transcript_line"> in contact since well the last time I physically saw her face to face was probably it was the same</div><div id="00:16:11.760" class="transcript_line"> week we recorded with each other that was a lot yeah we haven&#039;t known yeah and it&#039;s not because</div><div id="00:16:18.160" class="transcript_line"> we haven&#039;t wanted to see each other it&#039;s you know how it is your life&#039;s change things move on you</div><div id="00:16:24.960" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t always stay with the same person and I know Emily&#039;s been through a lot and things have happened</div><div id="00:16:32.640" class="transcript_line"> her life has changed and things like that because she&#039;s not been involved in our</div><div id="00:16:36.400" class="transcript_line"> Bridges stuff for quite some time now but</div><div id="00:16:40.480" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;re still in contact really at all? Not really at all I do have her number and on you know</div><div id="00:16:47.280" class="transcript_line"> a while ago I was saying you know hi how are you but I wasn&#039;t getting any response and even</div><div id="00:16:51.200" class="transcript_line"> though I spoke to work in the work capacity to find out if everything was all right with her</div><div id="00:16:55.520" class="transcript_line"> um they just sort of said yeah as far as we&#039;re aware but I think it&#039;s just one of those</div><div id="00:17:01.440" class="transcript_line"> friendships change and your life changes and you move on and you lose friends and you make friends</div><div id="00:17:06.640" class="transcript_line"> and I think the pandemic has done exactly that for me it&#039;s brought me closer to people but it&#039;s also</div><div id="00:17:13.360" class="transcript_line"> took me away from people because I know that Emily wouldn&#039;t want to do zoom it&#039;s not that kind of</div><div id="00:17:19.920" class="transcript_line"> thing and I know that if I rang the conversation that we had would be very stop start because we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:17:26.160" class="transcript_line"> disconnected now so we haven&#039;t had that reconnect properly and for us the reconnect would be</div><div id="00:17:30.880" class="transcript_line"> something face to face and it just it wouldn&#039;t at the moment in this moment in time it wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:36.960" class="transcript_line"> be right it wouldn&#039;t happen properly so for us it&#039;s kind of and sadly I mean as much as I&#039;ve tried</div><div id="00:17:44.480" class="transcript_line"> to make contact she hasn&#039;t made contact with me either and I know it&#039;s difficult and I&#039;m not</div><div id="00:17:51.040" class="transcript_line"> saying either of us are to blame for anything that&#039;s happened but you have to meet in you have</div><div id="00:17:57.200" class="transcript_line"> to meet in the middle somewhere and you know if neither of you are kind of communicating to each</div><div id="00:18:01.120" class="transcript_line"> other then it kind of spells that what you had was great but you&#039;ve moved on and you know you have</div><div id="00:18:06.800" class="transcript_line"> to accept that and so at the moment we are I would pretty much say although Emily might have a</div><div id="00:18:13.840" class="transcript_line"> different view I&#039;d still say she&#039;s a friend of mine because I know her but I haven&#039;t seen her</div><div id="00:18:18.960" class="transcript_line"> you know it&#039;s one of those that if I was to rock up to her house and say hello to her she&#039;d</div><div id="00:18:23.440" class="transcript_line"> probably say hello but we wouldn&#039;t probably wouldn&#039;t hang out it&#039;s that kind of we&#039;re more</div><div id="00:18:27.200" class="transcript_line"> acquaintances now than we were friends so you said that in some ways it&#039;s brought you</div><div id="00:18:35.680" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve connected better with some people during this yeah yeah about that then well my one of my</div><div id="00:18:43.200" class="transcript_line"> friends she lives in Derby and has done for the past sort of a year maybe two years and when the</div><div id="00:18:51.680" class="transcript_line"> lockdown hit we we&#039;ve done a lot of video calls now because we used to do just you know just normal</div><div id="00:18:59.040" class="transcript_line"> phone calls but we like the fact that we could see each other and sort of talk that way so it&#039;s</div><div id="00:19:03.200" class="transcript_line"> brought us closer I mean we have seen each other face to face but that was just that was ages ago</div><div id="00:19:10.080" class="transcript_line"> before all the lockdown came in in to effect but we were lucky that we had the video call because</div><div id="00:19:18.480" class="transcript_line"> then we were able to sort of so it did bring us closer in that way because distance then was meant</div><div id="00:19:23.360" class="transcript_line"> nothing you know but then it&#039;s yeah and equally my other friend who we&#039;re even closer she only lives</div><div id="00:19:33.920" class="transcript_line"> well because I&#039;m an avocadedy she lives in Monmouth and we still do video call I mean we have done I</div><div id="00:19:38.800" class="transcript_line"> have visited her outdoors and done the distance thing you know and it&#039;s been it&#039;s been great but</div><div id="00:19:43.040" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve been she&#039;ll video call me or phone call me and even though we&#039;re only sort of a very</div><div id="00:19:52.080" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re only like 20 minutes away just the fact that we&#039;re still able to video call each other</div><div id="00:19:58.640" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s really helped it kind of it has kept the friendship going because I think</div><div id="00:20:03.040" class="transcript_line"> for us it was for me and my very close friend the one the one that lives in Monmouth, Sophie</div><div id="00:20:11.920" class="transcript_line"> the difference for us I guess is we were seeing each other four to five times a week</div><div id="00:20:19.280" class="transcript_line"> and then suddenly we were seeing each other once a month and for us that was a massive shock because</div><div id="00:20:24.640" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re that I mean we&#039;re that close we can she considers me family and I consider her family</div><div id="00:20:30.080" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s just how it is I mean we&#039;re not like they they&#039;ll ask and so oh yeah no she&#039;s you know it&#039;s</div><div id="00:20:35.440" class="transcript_line"> that kind of thing that I&#039;m family is just expected I could go to her house not even knock the door</div><div id="00:20:39.120" class="transcript_line"> just walk in and make a competition oh hi how are you you know and it&#039;d just be</div><div id="00:20:43.120" class="transcript_line"> for us I think because my other friend who lives in Derby we&#039;re used to the distance</div><div id="00:20:46.960" class="transcript_line"> whereas Sophie and I were not and so it was yeah because I was doing all I mean I do see her</div><div id="00:20:54.240" class="transcript_line"> I see her every day when I say that I mean when I do a dance classes they&#039;re on a Facebook live</div><div id="00:21:00.400" class="transcript_line"> so she can never see me or any of her members but I can see her so yes I&#039;m seeing her but it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:21:05.760" class="transcript_line"> two-way like I can comment and I can type comments on the videos as they go in but it&#039;s not quite the</div><div id="00:21:11.200" class="transcript_line"> same as she&#039;s not able to talk she can talk back but she doesn&#039;t know necessarily that I&#039;m talking</div><div id="00:21:17.360" class="transcript_line"> at the same time that makes sense because she&#039;ll read the comments but she&#039;ll read them after the</div><div id="00:21:20.160" class="transcript_line"> class because she can&#039;t do it at the same time but yeah it&#039;s been it it&#039;s been helpful to have</div><div id="00:21:29.040" class="transcript_line"> the internet and be able to communicate that way but it um yeah it&#039;s still a bit of a shock when</div><div id="00:21:36.320" class="transcript_line"> you realize how quick time goes till you see each other and we&#039;ve been lucky and so far fingers</div><div id="00:21:41.840" class="transcript_line"> crossed we are still lucky in that we&#039;re still able to go to venues because I&#039;ll be seeing her in a bit</div><div id="00:21:46.400" class="transcript_line"> later on to do a class so face to face which is lovely because it isn&#039;t it&#039;s more attractive</div><div id="00:21:51.680" class="transcript_line"> because two-way then but yeah. How did you and Sophie get to know each other then and how long</div><div id="00:21:58.400" class="transcript_line"> have you known each other? So I Sophie and I have known each other for six years we&#039;ve just had our</div><div id="00:22:05.120" class="transcript_line"> six years of friendship in April just gone and I I was incredibly lucky I met the only reason</div><div id="00:22:12.480" class="transcript_line"> I knew that Sophie even existed was the fact that her sister Rachel actually worked on the project</div><div id="00:22:19.200" class="transcript_line"> that I now work for that I&#039;m now an employer for when I was a young person on the project</div><div id="00:22:24.640" class="transcript_line"> they um Rachel was a volunteer and she we&#039;d gone I can&#039;t remember I was at some sort of activity</div><div id="00:22:31.680" class="transcript_line"> and at that point I wasn&#039;t great with with crowds of people and talking to people</div><div id="00:22:36.640" class="transcript_line"> and so I just kept myself to myself and she sort of came over and started talking to me</div><div id="00:22:41.520" class="transcript_line"> and asked how I was and I said yeah I&#039;m good you know sort of side opening up and I thought</div><div id="00:22:46.480" class="transcript_line"> you know she you know she&#039;s come and sort of spoke to me and I thought we&#039;ll get on really well so</div><div id="00:22:50.720" class="transcript_line"> then after that aside I then said I was looking for a PA at the time and Rachel said oh I&#039;d be</div><div id="00:22:58.400" class="transcript_line"> interested in doing some work for you so I said okay so we sort of went through all the legalities</div><div id="00:23:02.960" class="transcript_line"> you have to go through and all the formalities and stuff and we met we went out for um something to</div><div id="00:23:10.240" class="transcript_line"> eat and the drinking now because any she met me and I&#039;m going to meet that I had no idea she had</div><div id="00:23:15.440" class="transcript_line"> she had a younger sister at all and we were just talking away and she said to me I have to you and</div><div id="00:23:21.760" class="transcript_line"> my younger sister have to meet and I said why is that because you&#039;re so like it&#039;s unreal it&#039;s like</div><div id="00:23:26.720" class="transcript_line"> you should have been it&#039;s like you should have been our third sister so it&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:23:31.520" class="transcript_line"> met you but it&#039;s like we should have been because our sense of humour was the same what you what</div><div id="00:23:36.400" class="transcript_line"> annoys us is the same like we you know and um she&#039;d shown me photos and things and that that was it</div><div id="00:23:43.840" class="transcript_line"> really and I commented I think on something on Facebook that Rachel had put up and I thanked her</div><div id="00:23:48.960" class="transcript_line"> for you know a nice nice time out and Sophie had seen the comment and said who is this person and</div><div id="00:23:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Rachel was like oh no Sophie&#039;s like have you just met them and she was like uh sorry</div><div id="00:23:59.920" class="transcript_line"> so have you known them for a long time she&#039;s like no I&#039;ve just met her and Sophie was quite</div><div id="00:24:04.400" class="transcript_line"> taken aback because she was like oh it doesn&#039;t sound like it sounds like you&#039;re into the forever</div><div id="00:24:07.360" class="transcript_line"> and she was like no but that&#039;s just the kind of person she is she&#039;s very very friendly and you</div><div id="00:24:11.520" class="transcript_line"> know she I think you&#039;d make good friends and that was it really um I for the first time ever had gone</div><div id="00:24:17.840" class="transcript_line"> out to the cinema with somebody that wasn&#039;t family my dad dropped me off in Raglan and Rachel and</div><div id="00:24:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Sophie met me and that was it it was in that moment in that car we&#039;ve been we&#039;ve been best friends and</div><div id="00:24:28.320" class="transcript_line"> ever since then that&#039;s how it&#039;s been you know we&#039;ve been in the holidays together</div><div id="00:24:32.240" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got a disability or autism?</div><div id="00:24:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Sophie is uh she&#039;s sight impaired she&#039;s registered blind and so um we I think the reason we got on</div><div id="00:24:46.560" class="transcript_line"> so so well is where I sometimes lack the sense of not necessarily danger but like sometimes my</div><div id="00:24:54.960" class="transcript_line"> my brain won&#039;t engage before I do something so like we could be out somewhere and I&#039;ll just be</div><div id="00:24:59.360" class="transcript_line"> like not not giving thought to much things whereas Sophie will so where where my brain</div><div id="00:25:07.040" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t necessarily kick in Sophie helps me in that area whereas I then I then help her with</div><div id="00:25:12.640" class="transcript_line"> seeing things and you know she&#039;s very I will say one thing you would never know that she couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:25:19.360" class="transcript_line"> see very well because I didn&#039;t even know in our friendship I had no idea until I think it was</div><div id="00:25:25.200" class="transcript_line"> about a month through months and a half into our friendship it must have been yeah it must have</div><div id="00:25:31.200" class="transcript_line"> been yeah good three weeks and it wasn&#039;t until she it wasn&#039;t until Sophie said it just never made</div><div id="00:25:36.720" class="transcript_line"> it never made a difference I think that&#039;s for us why it it has gone has kept we&#039;ve kept it as close</div><div id="00:25:43.680" class="transcript_line"> as we haven&#039;t for as long as we have because it just it just it is what it is you know we</div><div id="00:25:49.360" class="transcript_line"> we get on with each other and yeah. So during this time you&#039;ve been keeping in touch</div><div id="00:25:56.320" class="transcript_line"> kind of on zoom but a lot of that&#039;s based around so she&#039;s involved with Dance Blast is she</div><div id="00:26:00.880" class="transcript_line"> in your dance group? No Sophie Sophie&#039;s self-employed so Sophie actually runs</div><div id="00:26:06.160" class="transcript_line"> dance classes she&#039;s actually my dance instructor okay this is where it&#039;s really interesting because</div><div id="00:26:13.360" class="transcript_line"> I when I met Sophie Sophie wasn&#039;t self-employed at that time she was she well I said she wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:20.080" class="transcript_line"> self-employed Sophie and Rachel started up RS dance so they they were doing dance but it was</div><div id="00:26:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Rachel&#039;s thing at the time so Rachel had trained to do some fitnessy stuff and then Rachel went on</div><div id="00:26:33.280" class="transcript_line"> then and decided she didn&#039;t want to do it anymore and so Sophie took it over and it was then when</div><div id="00:26:37.200" class="transcript_line"> Sophie was doing that that she&#039;d said to me oh I&#039;m thinking of becoming a fit steps instructor</div><div id="00:26:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I said well what&#039;s fit steps and she said well it&#039;s born with Latin she said you know strictly</div><div id="00:26:46.320" class="transcript_line"> come dancing and I said yeah I know a bit of it is that kind of dancing you wouldn&#039;t need a partner</div><div id="00:26:49.840" class="transcript_line"> she said I&#039;m gonna so I think this summer coming I&#039;m gonna learn to do it and I said all right and</div><div id="00:26:55.360" class="transcript_line"> that was she she&#039;d learned to do it I think in the yeah she&#039;d learned to do it over the summer</div><div id="00:27:03.280" class="transcript_line"> and then in the September so it literally was six months between me knowing Sophie to Sophie</div><div id="00:27:09.440" class="transcript_line"> becoming self-employed and becoming a fitness instructor there was a six month gap of me like</div><div id="00:27:14.320" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d only been friends six months then suddenly she becomes self-employed and achieved all of this</div><div id="00:27:17.760" class="transcript_line"> and I the nice thing was I&#039;d seen it from from the box I&#039;d seen it from the ground up so that was</div><div id="00:27:23.280" class="transcript_line"> what was was lovely about it but that&#039;s why it&#039;s an interesting spin on our friendship because those</div><div id="00:27:28.080" class="transcript_line"> I know that come to our classes know we&#039;re close friends but before that</div><div id="00:27:32.400" class="transcript_line"> like we&#039;d be we&#039;d be dancing or at the end like so could be like I&#039;ve always said look if I&#039;m</div><div id="00:27:37.680" class="transcript_line"> doing something that looks ridiculous tell me like show me how the arms went and because she&#039;s so</div><div id="00:27:42.080" class="transcript_line"> direct it we used to start and laugh out people would look at us as if she&#039;d been really mean to</div><div id="00:27:46.960" class="transcript_line"> me but I was like no it&#039;s fine like we&#039;re really we&#039;re really close friends like we we banter all</div><div id="00:27:52.480" class="transcript_line"> the time and we have inside jokes and stuff like chatting about or what&#039;s happening well normally</div><div id="00:28:00.640" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re just having a cup of tea and putting the world to rights or we&#039;re just like quite often</div><div id="00:28:05.440" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;ll ask me how I&#039;ve how I found the classes online because it&#039;s really difficult for her to</div><div id="00:28:09.920" class="transcript_line"> gauge how members are you know if they&#039;re enjoying it if they&#039;re finding some of it too</div><div id="00:28:15.680" class="transcript_line"> too quick or too much because you can&#039;t really she can&#039;t see us to know how we&#039;re doing</div><div id="00:28:21.200" class="transcript_line"> so quite often like on one occasion she&#039;s like I was trying to try something I was like okay</div><div id="00:28:26.480" class="transcript_line"> and so she&#039;d put music on and she&#039;d have me do the dance because she knows if I&#039;m able to do it then</div><div id="00:28:33.520" class="transcript_line"> then I you know then she&#039;s taught it right if I&#039;m able to pick it up so she&#039;s done that a few times</div><div id="00:28:38.720" class="transcript_line"> all the odd times she&#039;s like I&#039;ll ask her questions about a line dance that she&#039;s done because</div><div id="00:28:44.400" class="transcript_line"> the tricky thing with line dancing is when you get to the back wall Sophie&#039;s behind you so you</div><div id="00:28:49.280" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t see her you&#039;ve got to listen but I&#039;ve been lucky in that when it has been at venues I&#039;m on</div><div id="00:28:54.720" class="transcript_line"> the back wall anyway so I&#039;ve been used to having to listen because people are following me I somehow</div><div id="00:28:58.960" class="transcript_line"> got the honour of being asked within two or three weeks of being there if I&#039;d go on the back wall</div><div id="00:29:05.120" class="transcript_line"> so it meant that I had to know what I was doing because people were copying me but no we just talk</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> about anything really and quite often 95 percent of the time we never we made a point of not talking</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> about the world as it is now we would just talk about happy things and we reminisce over memories</div><div id="00:29:23.200" class="transcript_line"> and things we have done and you know and even now we we reminisce over things we you know the funny</div><div id="00:29:29.120" class="transcript_line"> things that have gone on in lockdown and you know we just we try and every everything we have in our</div><div id="00:29:36.640" class="transcript_line"> conversation is always a positive not you know sometimes there are going to be conversations we</div><div id="00:29:41.120" class="transcript_line"> have where one of us is feeling a bit down or whatever that&#039;s natural but nine times out of</div><div id="00:29:45.520" class="transcript_line"> ten we do try and keep positive about it because we both believe that what you put out will come</div><div id="00:29:51.840" class="transcript_line"> back so we try and be as positive as we can be so yeah yeah we do talk about lots of things but</div><div id="00:29:59.520" class="transcript_line"> always positive if we can. How have you been kind of emotionally during this time what how have you</div><div id="00:30:07.600" class="transcript_line"> kind of felt? It&#039;s kind of sound really odd emotions wise I feel I&#039;ve become attached and</div><div id="00:30:15.520" class="transcript_line"> detached at the same time with my emotions like I realized it wasn&#039;t until I mean it&#039;s it&#039;s now I</div><div id="00:30:26.400" class="transcript_line"> joke about it but I didn&#039;t at the time because I didn&#039;t realize until I think it probably about</div><div id="00:30:34.080" class="transcript_line"> May time May June time I realized it I&#039;d seen somebody in the supermarket who I knew quite well</div><div id="00:30:41.120" class="transcript_line"> and I suddenly started having this real panic internally because I was like I&#039;ve lost the</div><div id="00:30:46.720" class="transcript_line"> ability to communicate with somebody face to face I genuinely had this panic of please don&#039;t say</div><div id="00:30:50.800" class="transcript_line"> hello or do say hello but I don&#039;t know how what so they said hello and I just I went hi and that</div><div id="00:30:56.320" class="transcript_line"> was it and normally I&#039;d be like hi how are you you know what we&#039;ve been up to literally I managed</div><div id="00:31:00.720" class="transcript_line"> to get the words high out and I felt so embarrassed because they looked at me as if to say you&#039;re</div><div id="00:31:04.960" class="transcript_line"> going to say anymore and then before I knew it we&#039;d gone our separate ways and we were</div><div id="00:31:09.600" class="transcript_line"> gone about the shopping but I was just like I realized I as well as the fact that</div><div id="00:31:16.400" class="transcript_line"> zoom and all this had brought me closer to people it almost took away my ability to communicate</div><div id="00:31:23.760" class="transcript_line"> face to face if that because although yes I&#039;m face to face now because I&#039;m talking to you and I can</div><div id="00:31:27.920" class="transcript_line"> see you it&#039;s not the same as if I was physically with somebody so the way I spent like I almost</div><div id="00:31:33.920" class="transcript_line"> made the anti-social because I was like I don&#039;t know like people say hello and I&#039;m like I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:31:37.680" class="transcript_line"> know what to do with you like you&#039;re there but do I say hello what comes next almost like I&#039;ve lost</div><div id="00:31:45.440" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s almost as well as like the social cues are completely different when you&#039;re online to when</div><div id="00:31:51.600" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re face to face like when you&#039;re online you can&#039;t talk at the same time so it&#039;s not natural</div><div id="00:32:00.240" class="transcript_line"> like you have to wait for somebody to stop talking to get your word in whereas when you&#039;re talking</div><div id="00:32:04.240" class="transcript_line"> face to face the natural thing is you&#039;ll talk at the same time and you might talk over people and</div><div id="00:32:09.600" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s fine because you know what it&#039;s been said because it can happen at the same time</div><div id="00:32:14.000" class="transcript_line"> so yeah emotions wise I&#039;ve been I&#039;ve been okay there have been moments where I&#039;ve not been but</div><div id="00:32:22.160" class="transcript_line"> but</div><div id="00:32:32.240" class="transcript_line"> two minutes so yeah it&#039;s been no it&#039;s right it&#039;s been my emotions have been it&#039;s been tough in a way of</div><div id="00:32:46.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s been tough in a way of</div><div id="00:32:52.640" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s really difficult because I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve allowed myself to fully grieve for the way things</div><div id="00:32:59.360" class="transcript_line"> have been just because I&#039;m the kind of person that&#039;s like no I don&#039;t want to grieve I want</div><div id="00:33:03.520" class="transcript_line"> to be happy and I want to be I mean I have had a few people say to me how can you be like like</div><div id="00:33:09.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen them in the street and now because of work I&#039;ve been it it&#039;s gone the other way now I&#039;m</div><div id="00:33:16.560" class="transcript_line"> okay I&#039;m able to talk to people because I&#039;m doing more face to face and things it&#039;s gotten better</div><div id="00:33:20.960" class="transcript_line"> but I have had the occasion where I&#039;m like I&#039;ve gone the other way so whereas I wouldn&#039;t say</div><div id="00:33:25.760" class="transcript_line"> a lot of people I&#039;m like hi how are you and like really cheerful and I&#039;ve had a few times when</div><div id="00:33:29.600" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve gone we&#039;re going through a pandemic how can you be you&#039;re too happy how can you be so</div><div id="00:33:34.640" class="transcript_line"> happy and I was like I&#039;d rather be happy than be miserable because being miserable doesn&#039;t make the</div><div id="00:33:41.120" class="transcript_line"> situation won&#039;t get any better if you know I might as well try and be happy and take every</div><div id="00:33:45.680" class="transcript_line"> positive I can out of the situation and I just smile at people and I&#039;m like I feel I feel for</div><div id="00:33:52.800" class="transcript_line"> them because I think you must be really struggling and feel really sad and feel really alone</div><div id="00:34:00.080" class="transcript_line"> if you think I&#039;m too happy because this is just this is me I haven&#039;t been any more happy than I</div><div id="00:34:04.800" class="transcript_line"> usually am so I&#039;m like yeah it kind of opens your eyes really to the fact that I think people</div><div id="00:34:13.760" class="transcript_line"> are less inclined to say how they feel now more than ever because they don&#039;t want to burden an</div><div id="00:34:19.360" class="transcript_line"> already heavy world so they kind of and I&#039;m like I wish you&#039;d speak because actually speak there&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:26.000" class="transcript_line"> nothing wrong with saying I&#039;m not okay there&#039;s nothing wrong with saying saying that at all and</div><div id="00:34:31.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean I&#039;ve kind of come full circle emotion-wise because I kind of went from where I was really</div><div id="00:34:37.200" class="transcript_line"> panicked but well I was really laid back then I went to this panic phase and I went through this</div><div id="00:34:45.280" class="transcript_line"> manic OCD phase as well that phase kind of gave me my hands were literally red raw I burnt my</div><div id="00:34:50.560" class="transcript_line"> hands pretty much because I was washing them that much and the taps were that I had the taps that</div><div id="00:34:56.560" class="transcript_line"> hot and I was like you&#039;ve burnt your hands and I said yeah but I need to wash them in a little</div><div id="00:35:01.120" class="transcript_line"> shorter point where I was washing them 20 30 times a day it was that bad at one point because</div><div id="00:35:06.960" class="transcript_line"> I was so panicked by the fact that everywhere you went it was a you must wash your hands and</div><div id="00:35:10.800" class="transcript_line"> it was really in your face so I was and then it kind of I still wash my hands but not I wash them</div><div id="00:35:17.280" class="transcript_line"> more than I should more than needs me but not as bad as I was and then communications gotten</div><div id="00:35:24.080" class="transcript_line"> better I&#039;ve sort of relaxed a little bit and not got as panicked as I was and then I&#039;ve tried to</div><div id="00:35:30.640" class="transcript_line"> help other people not be as panicked because my my work has almost helped in a way of I I&#039;m in a</div><div id="00:35:38.480" class="transcript_line"> position with work where not that it&#039;s expected of me to cope but like I don&#039;t want others to feel</div><div id="00:35:45.520" class="transcript_line"> anxious because I&#039;m anxious so I kind of try and find the positives and you know so yeah emotion</div><div id="00:35:52.000" class="transcript_line"> wise it&#039;s been it&#039;s been tough at times and it still is now and again I get moments where I&#039;m like</div><div id="00:35:57.200" class="transcript_line"> you know can you know like I&#039;ve learned now I&#039;m living day to day and I know I&#039;m already thinking</div><div id="00:36:03.520" class="transcript_line"> in my head I can see my phone I&#039;m already thinking at half past one between half past one half past</div><div id="00:36:08.240" class="transcript_line"> two if the government hasn&#039;t said there are any restrictions I can go to a dance class tomorrow</div><div id="00:36:12.720" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;ve got to give you 24 hours notice so I&#039;m still I&#039;m still controlling in a way of like I</div><div id="00:36:18.640" class="transcript_line"> know exactly when the government posts out about restrictions because I&#039;ve seen the times they get</div><div id="00:36:22.400" class="transcript_line"> posted but that&#039;s my own thing but other than that emotion wise I&#039;m in a good place now</div><div id="00:36:29.280" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m quite positive I&#039;m quite happy and I&#039;m quite I&#039;m quite okay with the way things are but</div><div id="00:36:34.400" class="transcript_line"> the happy times where it&#039;s been really like there were times where because I was so unsure of the</div><div id="00:36:41.600" class="transcript_line"> world and so anxious and so kind of my emotions were really confused I was actually lashing out</div><div id="00:36:48.160" class="transcript_line"> with people and it was always those that were the closest to me and wanted to help me and wanted me</div><div id="00:36:51.520" class="transcript_line"> to be happy that I was doing that too and then I&#039;d do it and then get really upset that I&#039;d done</div><div id="00:36:56.160" class="transcript_line"> it but I wasn&#039;t that wasn&#039;t the emotion I wasn&#039;t angry I was confused and lost and didn&#039;t know where</div><div id="00:37:01.920" class="transcript_line"> I stood but it came out as anger and that&#039;s not yeah but I guess you know we all go through the</div><div id="00:37:10.880" class="transcript_line"> emotions and I&#039;ve come the other side now and it is it&#039;s one of those it&#039;s coming the other side</div><div id="00:37:14.720" class="transcript_line"> now but I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;ll be before it kind of goes round again so I have to wait and see</div><div id="00:37:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you have have you been able to talk to people have there been people that you&#039;ve been able to</div><div id="00:37:26.800" class="transcript_line"> you know share the way you&#039;ve been feeling with during this time?</div><div id="00:37:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I&#039;m lucky in a way that mum and dad are quite open and will let me talk but obviously</div><div id="00:37:38.240" class="transcript_line"> you never really want to burden your parents but they I do talk to them and we do have conversations</div><div id="00:37:42.800" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re quite open about it but I&#039;m also lucky that my closest friends are a great outlet for me</div><div id="00:37:49.680" class="transcript_line"> as well as they as I am for them you know quite often they&#039;ll go it&#039;s so unfair and like it</div><div id="00:37:56.720" class="transcript_line"> sometimes for me it&#039;s it&#039;s the need to decompress at the end of the day like because there&#039;s so much</div><div id="00:38:03.840" class="transcript_line"> going on there&#039;s so much uncertainty and there&#039;s where as my anxiety would come and go there&#039;s a</div><div id="00:38:12.160" class="transcript_line"> steady anxiety now whereas I&#039;d have moments where I&#039;d almost be free of anxiety because I&#039;d be like</div><div id="00:38:17.360" class="transcript_line"> oh you know this is how life is like excuse me pre-Covid I was I had I didn&#039;t always have anxiety</div><div id="00:38:26.080" class="transcript_line"> I would just have it now you know now and again whereas now there&#039;s always there&#039;s a there&#039;s an</div><div id="00:38:33.360" class="transcript_line"> anxiety that there&#039;s always like a baseline and then it either go up or it&#039;ll go down it&#039;ll never</div><div id="00:38:38.080" class="transcript_line"> stop and I think it&#039;s just because I the world isn&#039;t predictable like it used to be people aren&#039;t</div><div id="00:38:44.400" class="transcript_line"> predictable like they used to be all that predictability has been taken away so therefore</div><div id="00:38:48.800" class="transcript_line"> I have nothing to base anything on you know I just I&#039;m just having to literally go oh well</div><div id="00:38:55.920" class="transcript_line"> this is what&#039;s happened here and now I can&#039;t base anything on anything you know and I can&#039;t look at</div><div id="00:39:01.200" class="transcript_line"> people and know their emotion because quite often that&#039;s not their true emotion because nobody wants</div><div id="00:39:07.200" class="transcript_line"> to burden anybody else so whilst I&#039;m trying to understand people and work it out because nobody&#039;s</div><div id="00:39:14.080" class="transcript_line"> being as definitive with their emotions like they&#039;re happy they&#039;re happy you know you know</div><div id="00:39:19.280" class="transcript_line"> whereas actually now people are happy but they&#039;re that that&#039;s not their emotion if you see what I</div><div id="00:39:25.600" class="transcript_line"> mean it&#039;s like people will be like oh yes I&#039;m really happy yeah it&#039;s really difficult to</div><div id="00:39:32.560" class="transcript_line"> to know and more so than ever because now you&#039;ve got to wear a face mask indoors I can&#039;t tell by</div><div id="00:39:38.720" class="transcript_line"> somebody just by looking at them what they&#039;re feeling and whether</div><div id="00:39:42.880" class="transcript_line"> my because I don&#039;t know whether what I&#039;ve said has offended them or whether they&#039;re happy or</div><div id="00:39:46.640" class="transcript_line"> whether they&#039;re you know how they&#039;re feeling because I can&#039;t tell just by their eyes alone</div><div id="00:39:51.920" class="transcript_line"> I mean I&#039;m lucky in that some people that I do know they have got a degree in drama and theatre</div><div id="00:40:00.160" class="transcript_line"> and stuff like that so actually it&#039;s boded well because they can tell me through their eyes because</div><div id="00:40:05.760" class="transcript_line"> they they go over the top which works really well like I know if they&#039;re if they&#039;re bored</div><div id="00:40:10.560" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;ll show me but yeah. And what about kind of work colleagues have you had support</div><div id="00:40:20.240" class="transcript_line"> through work or how has that been? Yeah absolutely I mean work on many levels has saved me</div><div id="00:40:27.440" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;re always there for me they were on occasion they&#039;ve asked me to do videos they&#039;ve</div><div id="00:40:34.080" class="transcript_line"> always said if they&#039;ve asked me to do a video they&#039;ve said if you don&#039;t want to do it you don&#039;t</div><div id="00:40:36.960" class="transcript_line"> have to do it like there&#039;s no pressure to do anything and it is great I mean I&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:40:46.480" class="transcript_line"> fingers crossed Sunday next Sunday Sunday the fourth supposed to be going on an outdoor</div><div id="00:40:52.000" class="transcript_line"> distance bike ride and picnic with QB which is the younger which is Quest Busters they&#039;re the younger</div><div id="00:40:58.080" class="transcript_line"> group they&#039;re eight to seventeen so I&#039;ve been asked if I&#039;ll go there and say hi to the families</div><div id="00:41:04.480" class="transcript_line"> and just make myself known because a lot of the families don&#039;t know who I am because a lot of</div><div id="00:41:08.400" class="transcript_line"> them have only seen me over like a zoom call or something like I haven&#039;t really seen you face to</div><div id="00:41:14.560" class="transcript_line"> face but no I am so so lucky in the fact that my um my what you call it my line manager so to say</div><div id="00:41:26.240" class="transcript_line"> although we don&#039;t really use that word we just my um my point of contact is is Lisa and the great</div><div id="00:41:33.840" class="transcript_line"> thing about it is that a with children knows me really well and b I can ring her and just be like</div><div id="00:41:39.040" class="transcript_line"> this is going on and she&#039;ll be like it&#039;s fine we&#039;ll work through it so I as well as the fact that</div><div id="00:41:44.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m employed by them they&#039;re also very very aware that this time although it&#039;s</div><div id="00:41:52.880" class="transcript_line"> an anxiety broken time for many it&#039;s more so for something like me so they&#039;re very aware of that</div><div id="00:41:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ll always say like they&#039;ll ring in and check in on me or they&#039;ll send me a message say</div><div id="00:42:01.440" class="transcript_line"> how are you doing today you know how&#039;s it going and they&#039;ve always said never be afraid to tell</div><div id="00:42:05.680" class="transcript_line"> us that you&#039;re having a hard time because that&#039;s when you need us most so just just tell us if</div><div id="00:42:10.880" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re having a difficult time or if things are too much or if you&#039;re worried should not know and</div><div id="00:42:16.400" class="transcript_line"> should not know questions a silly question I&#039;d rather you ask and then be able to tell you then</div><div id="00:42:21.920" class="transcript_line"> not know so yeah work&#039;s really really helped me to even to have employment in this house</div><div id="00:42:28.080" class="transcript_line"> think if I had no employment during this time I think I&#039;d be lost because although dance is an</div><div id="00:42:33.040" class="transcript_line"> outlet I like having different people to talk to different faces and different things to do</div><div id="00:42:38.960" class="transcript_line"> so yes they&#039;ve really helped and one of the things that we um chatted about last week was</div><div id="00:42:50.880" class="transcript_line"> about um sort of studio with dance and sort of physical contact is that something you&#039;ve missed</div><div id="00:42:55.600" class="transcript_line"> physical absolutely 100% I mean with dancing at the moment when you&#039;re in venues it&#039;s okay with</div><div id="00:43:03.360" class="transcript_line"> like Sophie&#039;s classes with Zumba and fit steps because you&#039;re not it&#039;s not contact anyway you&#039;re</div><div id="00:43:07.280" class="transcript_line"> just copying something but with my contemporary classes everything is contact based and we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:43:12.800" class="transcript_line"> been told obviously none of what we do is to be caught so we&#039;re having to do things separate but</div><div id="00:43:18.800" class="transcript_line"> together but it it works but for me I&#039;m such a contact person and we had to do a task for</div><div id="00:43:30.640" class="transcript_line"> when we went into our venue and that was to do she said oh there&#039;s three things in the room have a</div><div id="00:43:35.120" class="transcript_line"> look you know take any three things in your room describe them so I described them you know one</div><div id="00:43:39.920" class="transcript_line"> word for each thing in the room and then you had to do you had to translate that into a dance move</div><div id="00:43:43.840" class="transcript_line"> to three dances and put them together every single person that was on that zoom meeting</div><div id="00:43:49.520" class="transcript_line"> and in that room had a move that connected with themselves physically and it just it</div><div id="00:43:57.840" class="transcript_line"> everybody realized when the videos were played back as we recorded it they said</div><div id="00:44:01.680" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t that just go to show how much people are missing physical contact with another person and</div><div id="00:44:06.720" class="transcript_line"> I said well I didn&#039;t at first I didn&#039;t give a thought to it but it it really is I said to</div><div id="00:44:12.000" class="transcript_line"> people I said the thing with me is if I know you really really well like if you&#039;ve your friends or</div><div id="00:44:18.560" class="transcript_line"> whatever my immediate thing is for hi how are you and to hug you that is my immediate response</div><div id="00:44:25.680" class="transcript_line"> and to not be able to do that I&#039;m like it is really difficult because then I&#039;m like</div><div id="00:44:31.760" class="transcript_line"> is there going to be a time where they go hugging is okay or is this it now we&#039;ve lost the ability</div><div id="00:44:36.080" class="transcript_line"> to be able to hug each other period you know and in my head I&#039;m like please tell me there comes a</div><div id="00:44:40.000" class="transcript_line"> point where they go it&#039;s safe you can hug somebody because I&#039;m like I think god what&#039;s it being now</div><div id="00:44:46.000" class="transcript_line"> six months over six months you know and I mean yes I&#039;ve hugged my mum and my dad but that&#039;s been it</div><div id="00:44:52.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean I haven&#039;t I haven&#039;t hugged my that&#039;s where I hugged my best friend was right at the start of</div><div id="00:44:58.000" class="transcript_line"> March so it&#039;s been six months and we all the time we&#039;re always high-fiving and hugging each other</div><div id="00:45:03.920" class="transcript_line"> and to not be able to do that we just we ear hug now we&#039;re like ear hug that&#039;s all you can do like</div><div id="00:45:10.400" class="transcript_line"> a thing but yeah it&#039;s strange it&#039;s strange to dance but not not do the contact bit when it&#039;s</div><div id="00:45:17.920" class="transcript_line"> contemporary but yeah it works we&#039;ve made it work I know um back when we did the interview with you</div><div id="00:45:24.880" class="transcript_line"> and Emily you were single um are you you&#039;re not in a relationship at the moment absolutely not</div><div id="00:45:34.000" class="transcript_line"> that is the last of my things and to be quite honest I said this to somebody the other day</div><div id="00:45:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if I ever want to be in a relationship I quite like me myself and I know it sounds really</div><div id="00:45:47.600" class="transcript_line"> vain it&#039;s not that I I just I find guys really I know guys say we&#039;re confusing but I find them</div><div id="00:45:55.520" class="transcript_line"> really confusing people because they they they think they think they&#039;re after simplicity they</div><div id="00:46:02.880" class="transcript_line"> want a simple life yeah they&#039;re the ones that confuse everything like I&#039;m just like I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:46:07.760" class="transcript_line"> understand guys I just I understand obviously I understand but I mean like I just my life without</div><div id="00:46:15.200" class="transcript_line"> a guy I just it sounds awful but I don&#039;t have time to put a man in my relation within my world</div><div id="00:46:23.200" class="transcript_line"> because to me then I have to make time for that person and it sounds strange because yes I make</div><div id="00:46:28.720" class="transcript_line"> time for my friends but that&#039;s natural that&#039;s been six years it&#039;s a natural thing whereas</div><div id="00:46:33.840" class="transcript_line"> a relationship with a guy is the most unnatural thing in the world to me so I don&#039;t know if I</div><div id="00:46:38.800" class="transcript_line"> ever will have a relationship or whether I will have children of my own but I&#039;m quite happy with</div><div id="00:46:44.000" class="transcript_line"> that at the moment like I don&#039;t I don&#039;t

just not in a deep and emotional way if that makes sense like she gives</div><div id="00:47:24.080" class="transcript_line"> me the friendship she gives me the banter she gives me the closeness you know I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:47:29.120" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s nothing that a guy would give me extra other than a children and be the emotional and</div><div id="00:47:35.040" class="transcript_line"> sexual side of things she you know Sophie gives me everything else why would I then want to add a man</div><div id="00:47:40.880" class="transcript_line"> into something that&#039;s already great like I don&#039;t yeah I don&#039;t know do you know you&#039;re not tempted</div><div id="00:47:47.280" class="transcript_line"> by the emotional and sexual side of things then it&#039;s not something that you feel no not really</div><div id="00:47:52.560" class="transcript_line"> I know well no because people go to me oh you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing and I&#039;m like well</div><div id="00:47:56.560" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s like saying to somebody who can never eat ice cream always allergic to chocolate you don&#039;t</div><div

class="transcript_line"> well if I&#039;ve never been there and done it you&#039;re right I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m missing so as much as</div><div id="00:48:11.040" class="transcript_line"> you keep saying you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing you&#039;re quite right I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m missing</div><div id="00:48:15.840" class="transcript_line"> you feel okay with that absolutely I&#039;ve never felt more free I&#039;m not tied down to anything</div><div id="00:48:21.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have to go home and answer to anybody I don&#039;t have to go go home and cook for a guy</div><div id="00:48:27.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not saying every guy you know every woman cooks for a man but like I don&#039;t have to go home</div><div id="00:48:31.440" class="transcript_line"> and think about someone else it&#039;s not my mum my dad my brother you know I don&#039;t have to go and go</div><div id="00:48:36.320" class="transcript_line"> oh okay maybe I should contact you or you know maybe I should meet up with you there&#039;s none of</div><div id="00:48:42.320" class="transcript_line"> that I don&#039;t have to you know it&#039;s all yeah I don&#039;t know I&#039;ve tried relationships a few times</div><div id="00:48:47.120" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ve just they&#039;ve just not worked for me fair enough so yeah so it&#039;s not like you&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:48:55.280" class="transcript_line"> kind of during this period um thinking about relationships or no because I&#039;ve not been I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:49:02.320" class="transcript_line"> not truly been lonely funnily enough not even like it&#039;s strange because you think I feel more</div><div id="00:49:10.480" class="transcript_line"> lonely because I&#039;m not I&#039;m seeing less of people but I feel I feel more connected to people now</div><div id="00:49:16.960" class="transcript_line"> than I did once didn&#039;t have any friends um when we were able to go and just go and hug somebody</div><div id="00:49:23.520" class="transcript_line"> and say hello now I feel more connected with the world than I&#039;ve ever been and whether it&#039;s because</div><div id="00:49:28.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve realised how lucky I am because I&#039;ve been at that place where I&#039;ve had nothing and now I have</div><div id="00:49:34.320" class="transcript_line"> everything and whether I&#039;ve whether it&#039;s because it&#039;s all coming to perspective and I&#039;m thinking</div><div id="00:49:38.880" class="transcript_line"> oh actually I have it pretty good right now you know I didn&#039;t have it good I have it pretty good</div><div id="00:49:44.960" class="transcript_line"> right now even though even though I&#039;m seeing less of people I&#039;m still I still have it good I could</div><div id="00:49:48.640" class="transcript_line"> have been in a way worse position you know so yeah. So finally in terms of like the um the practical</div><div id="00:49:59.200" class="transcript_line"> sides of all of these things like with all the rules and everything like that how have you found</div><div id="00:50:05.840" class="transcript_line"> kind of making sense of of some of that side of things? Well I um for me the rules have always</div><div id="00:50:15.520" class="transcript_line"> been they contradict every rule not every rule but most rules they make contradict themselves</div><div id="00:50:21.680" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s like you say one thing but you like I can&#039;t wrap my head around I understand</div><div id="00:50:27.840" class="transcript_line"> the economy is important but so are people you know people are more so important than</div><div id="00:50:32.800" class="transcript_line"> the economy but I know why they&#039;re doing things but they&#039;re saying you you know if you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:50:37.280" class="transcript_line"> restrictions you can&#039;t meet people any more than six people at a go um I&#039;m sorry if you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:50:47.120" class="transcript_line"> restrictions you can&#039;t meet anybody you don&#039;t live with but yeah I can go down the local pub</div><div id="00:50:51.440" class="transcript_line"> as long as I&#039;m out by 10 and I&#039;m like I don&#039;t understand the logic I understand they&#039;re trying</div><div id="00:50:56.880" class="transcript_line"> to keep the economy going and they want people to because what they&#039;re saying is we want people to</div><div id="00:51:00.800" class="transcript_line"> have that we want people to go to these places because people&#039;s mental health is suffering</div><div id="00:51:05.360" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;re staying indoors I get that but by saying don&#039;t go and have people in your house that</div><div id="00:51:11.680" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t live with you&#039;re not eliminating the problem because the problem doesn&#039;t stem from</div><div id="00:51:16.880" class="transcript_line"> households the problem stems from people going into pubs and restaurants I said if you&#039;d have</div><div id="00:51:22.080" class="transcript_line"> just kept it outdoors I know it&#039;s freezing cold now but even if you&#039;d if people really wanted a</div><div id="00:51:27.040" class="transcript_line"> drink they&#039;d wrap up you&#039;d wear warm clothes you know if you really wanted to I mean I&#039;ve not been</div><div id="00:51:31.680" class="transcript_line"> in the first time I went in a restaurant was in Temby just um just gone yesterday and what day</div><div id="00:51:38.320" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d say Monday not yesterday Saturday and I was petrified I&#039;d never eaten I almost didn&#039;t digest</div><div id="00:51:46.800" class="transcript_line"> my food um and almost bought it straight back up because I was that anxious I was eating it that</div><div id="00:51:50.720" class="transcript_line"> quick because I wanted to get my face mask on because I was so petrified I said to mum what if</div><div id="00:51:55.920" class="transcript_line"> we go home and they tell us I&#039;ve been in contact with someone they said that&#039;s 14 days I&#039;ve got to</div><div id="00:52:00.320" class="transcript_line"> not leave this house I said I can&#039;t do that I mean I would have to but like the the anxiety of being</div><div id="00:52:05.360" class="transcript_line"> forced to stay in in your own four walls for for however many days was like but no the rules are</div><div id="00:52:12.960" class="transcript_line"> really I mean I have been lucky in a way and I know this person won&#039;t mind me mentioning</div><div id="00:52:18.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been so so lucky that Gwen and I have kept contact the way we have just through messages</div><div id="00:52:25.360" class="transcript_line"> literally as soon as there&#039;s an update even if it doesn&#039;t relate to me Gwen literally my phone will</div><div id="00:52:30.000" class="transcript_line"> go and I&#039;ll be like I can see it on the computer and I&#039;m like any minute now and like it happens I</div><div id="00:52:34.880" class="transcript_line"> always get one and Gwen&#039;s like you don&#039;t need to worry this is what it means and it&#039;s great</div><div id="00:52:38.960" class="transcript_line"> because I don&#039;t I don&#039;t listen to any of the conferences because there&#039;s too much information</div><div id="00:52:42.560" class="transcript_line"> given out at the same time whereas Gwen will listen to all the conferences but will only tell</div><div id="00:52:46.960" class="transcript_line"> me things that will affect me whereas if it&#039;s not relevant to me she won&#039;t tell me because she&#039;s like</div><div id="00:52:53.200" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no need for me to tell you something that doesn&#039;t involve you so if it involves you</div><div id="00:52:56.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you so it&#039;s great because then I&#039;m literally Gwen&#039;s now become my little messenger</div><div id="00:53:01.200" class="transcript_line"> of all things role related because then I&#039;m like I don&#039;t need to worry no Gwen&#039;s like no you&#039;re</div><div id="00:53:05.760" class="transcript_line"> fine you&#039;re good this is what you need to do to make sure you&#039;re you&#039;re safe and that&#039;s it you</div><div id="00:53:10.320" class="transcript_line"> know so I&#039;m I am really lucky. How do you think other people have managed with that side of things?</div><div id="00:53:18.640" class="transcript_line"> I think other people have struggled because I think not everybody has I mean even my parents</div><div id="00:53:22.960" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t understand it they&#039;re like have you got a Gwen update yet because they wait for me to</div><div id="00:53:27.600" class="transcript_line"> like it&#039;s become a thing in our house they&#039;re like oh is there a Gwen update and I&#039;m like and she knows</div><div id="00:53:32.160" class="transcript_line"> she thinks it&#039;s the sweetest thing ever and I&#039;m like no no Gwen update yet and then I&#039;m like oh</div><div id="00:53:36.080" class="transcript_line"> mum we&#039;ve had an update because they mum and dad don&#039;t even watch the telling out to the news</div><div id="00:53:39.760" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s too confusing mum&#039;s like I don&#039;t understand what applies to us and what applies</div><div id="00:53:44.000" class="transcript_line"> to us and what doesn&#039;t so but I think for other people particularly those in my position those</div><div id="00:53:48.960" class="transcript_line"> with a learning disability that works with any additional need I think it&#039;s increasingly because</div><div id="00:53:54.160" class="transcript_line"> nothing is easy read sit there and listen is is really hard because you don&#039;t and the big fancy</div><div id="00:54:00.960" class="transcript_line"> words and you know and I&#039;m like just tell me you know what what is it exactly that I need to do</div><div id="00:54:08.080" class="transcript_line"> to make sure that I&#039;m sticking with the rules here you know and and then I think</div><div id="00:54:15.440" class="transcript_line"> people like me are very easily drawn into the fact that yes I&#039;ve got social media but social media</div><div id="00:54:21.760" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t be a negative thing in a situation like this because I have seen so many people that have</div><div id="00:54:25.920" class="transcript_line"> gone oh how ridiculous is this and they&#039;re venting out things out but they don&#039;t realize that by</div><div id="00:54:31.680" class="transcript_line"> venting and trying to make justification of a rule that&#039;s been that&#039;s been put there anybody else</div><div id="00:54:38.720" class="transcript_line"> seen that they you know for the likes of me I&#039;m like I don&#039;t know why you&#039;re trying the rules there</div><div id="00:54:43.600" class="transcript_line"> the rules there don&#039;t try and make sense of it because you won&#039;t make sense of it none of it</div><div id="00:54:47.040" class="transcript_line"> makes sense I don&#039;t even think those that made the rules fully understand what sense can make</div><div id="00:54:51.520" class="transcript_line"> sense and if you&#039;ve asked them and said where&#039;s the common sense in it they wouldn&#039;t be able to</div><div id="00:54:55.440" class="transcript_line"> tell you because they&#039;re trying at the same time people don&#039;t realize yeah okay you know I&#039;m not</div><div id="00:55:01.520" class="transcript_line"> pinning blame on anybody but you&#039;ve got to realize they&#039;re learning at the same time people that are</div><div id="00:55:05.680" class="transcript_line"> governing the world have never had to govern it in quite the way they are now you know so I&#039;m just</div><div id="00:55:10.240" class="transcript_line"> it makes me laugh people go oh what&#039;s the point it&#039;s ridiculous I might as well go down the</div><div id="00:55:14.560" class="transcript_line"> pub and get plastered and I&#039;m like get down the pub and get plastered everyone they haven&#039;t stopped</div><div id="00:55:18.480" class="transcript_line"> you what
