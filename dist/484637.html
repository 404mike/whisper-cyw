Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:07.140" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Tony Charles.</div><div id="00:00:10.040" class="transcript_line"> The location of the interview is the Swicker office</div><div id="00:00:13.040" class="transcript_line"> and today&#039;s date is the 13th of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:17.480" class="transcript_line"> Before we start Tony, would you be kind enough for the record</div><div id="00:00:20.320" class="transcript_line"> to spell your name in full please?</div><div id="00:00:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so it&#039;s Tony.</div><div id="00:00:24.080" class="transcript_line"> T-O-N-Y</div><div id="00:00:25.680" class="transcript_line"> and Charles</div><div id="00:00:27.120" class="transcript_line"> C-H-A-R-L-E-S.</div><div id="00:00:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Tony Charles.</div><div id="00:00:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Tony, tell us how did you first become involved in Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:36.880" class="transcript_line"> It goes back a long way actually because it goes back to the 1970s</div><div id="00:00:42.220" class="transcript_line"> when we had the Lord Mayor&#039;s Parade</div><div id="00:00:45.360" class="transcript_line"> which was a very different type of carnival to what we see in more recent years in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:50.360" class="transcript_line"> And that came about as a result of a small group of us</div><div id="00:00:53.640" class="transcript_line"> started the South Wales Talking Magazine Association for the Blind in 1971</div><div id="00:00:58.960" class="transcript_line"> and we were partly charged with capturing the sights and sounds of South Wales</div><div id="00:01:06.460" class="transcript_line"> for the blind and partially sighted as part of our objective.</div><div id="00:01:10.700" class="transcript_line"> And so things like that going on were very important and popular at the time.</div><div id="00:01:16.380" class="transcript_line"> And what I remember about the Lord Mayor&#039;s Parade was</div><div id="00:01:19.140" class="transcript_line"> it was much more commercial in those days.</div><div id="00:01:20.880" class="transcript_line"> I suppose businesses were putting more money into things like this</div><div id="00:01:24.320" class="transcript_line"> and had greater publicity budgets.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you had floats, lorries, flatbed lorries.</div><div id="00:01:30.100" class="transcript_line"> It was very much motorised wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:31.780" class="transcript_line"> Yes and you know you had people on lorries, on the back of lorries,</div><div id="00:01:36.500" class="transcript_line"> commercial lorries, the businesses promoting their names through their logos on their lorries.</div><div id="00:01:41.540" class="transcript_line"> And also the other thing was we had the military tattoo in those days</div><div id="00:01:46.920" class="transcript_line"> and the military bands participated in the Lord Mayor&#039;s Parade.</div><div id="00:01:50.660" class="transcript_line"> So that was the beginning and I guess from those early days</div><div id="00:01:55.160" class="transcript_line"> my interest in carnival developed.</div><div id="00:01:57.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic and of course along comes 1990</div><div id="00:02:00.760" class="transcript_line"> and Swicker starts the furthest ever Cardiff Mars Carnival</div><div id="00:02:05.380" class="transcript_line"> coming from a very different place from the junior Chamber of Trade</div><div id="00:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> who used to organise the Lord Mayor&#039;s Parade.</div><div id="00:02:11.620" class="transcript_line"> I mean first and foremost everything was at a human level</div><div id="00:02:15.560" class="transcript_line"> so we deliberately went for the non-motorised,</div><div id="00:02:19.240" class="transcript_line"> being closer to our audience type feel as it were.</div><div id="00:02:23.880" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve seen...</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes it&#039;s been quite a bit of change.</div><div id="00:02:28.600" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s been a lot of change and are you able to tell us roughly when you first</div><div id="00:02:33.480" class="transcript_line"> started taking photographs of Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:02:37.400" class="transcript_line"> I think I took photographs from very much the early days.</div><div id="00:02:40.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean I&#039;ve been taking photographs since I was eight years old which is a very long time ago</div><div id="00:02:45.880" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s always been for me an audio visual event, audio for reportage for the</div><div id="00:02:52.200" class="transcript_line"> South Wales Talking Magazine for the Blind, our monthly sound magazine</div><div id="00:02:55.400" class="transcript_line"> and photography being my hobby and the remarkable thing for me was and quite</div><div id="00:03:00.040" class="transcript_line"> astonishing was that in the late 70s doing the audio side I won a national tape recording</div><div id="00:03:06.760" class="transcript_line"> award for a documentary tape on the Lord Mayor&#039;s Parade</div><div id="00:03:10.360" class="transcript_line"> and so it was very much for me audio in the early days but then</div><div id="00:03:14.520" class="transcript_line"> photography I think developed.</div><div id="00:03:16.760" class="transcript_line"> What I find interesting is if you try and do them both at the same time</div><div id="00:03:21.320" class="transcript_line"> on that day it gets a bit challenging because you&#039;re juggling your visual skills and then</div><div id="00:03:27.800" class="transcript_line"> you know you&#039;re trying to interview people and record material but it has changed a lot and</div><div id="00:03:32.760" class="transcript_line"> from that more commercial motorised approach and military approach we saw then particularly then as</div><div id="00:03:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Swicker Carnival emerged all those years ago you saw it become much closer to the public as you</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> say and more of a voluntary sector movement which I think has been fantastic for the community of</div><div id="00:03:54.360" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff both the viewers and the participants.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course Carnival is a democratic art form we like to talk about its powers of transformation</div><div id="00:04:05.960" class="transcript_line"> and in terms of art it&#039;s time-based art I mean because</div><div id="00:04:10.120" class="transcript_line"> and for that reason it&#039;s beautiful it&#039;s flamboyant it&#039;s of the moment but if it isn&#039;t captured on</div><div id="00:04:16.440" class="transcript_line"> film or still if it isn&#039;t documented then it&#039;s lost to future generations and so</div><div id="00:04:23.640" class="transcript_line"> I think we first met when I made contact with you as part of Cardiff Camera Club.</div><div id="00:04:31.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:04:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Because we thought that first of all very cost effective second of all we&#039;ve got the ultimate</div><div id="00:04:38.360" class="transcript_line"> subject and there&#039;s something about meeting you and hearing you talk about the membership and the</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> activities that made me realise that you know we&#039;re all part of the same thing here and it was</div><div id="00:04:51.240" class="transcript_line"> highly appropriate to actually have the Camera Club shooting the Carnival this seems quite natural</div><div id="00:05:00.040" class="transcript_line"> yes what was it like getting the idea I mean I know you&#039;ve been wonderful in sort of</div><div id="00:05:04.680" class="transcript_line"> asking as an interface between our two organisations I know you&#039;re grinning at the moment so yes</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> okay how did that all come about how easy was it to to to inspire the</div><div id="00:05:15.960" class="transcript_line"> the members to come out and and to shoot us en masse as it were I think it was a change in the</div><div id="00:05:21.400" class="transcript_line"> same way that the carnival has been through change uh Cardiff Camera Club has been through change I</div><div id="00:05:25.720" class="transcript_line"> mean traditionally it was very much a club where you went along one night a week sat down maybe</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> had a lecture or maybe a monthly competition or something like that and then you went home</div><div id="00:05:35.160" class="transcript_line"> and I think what tended to to to change things was that that the club started to become much more</div><div id="00:05:42.360" class="transcript_line"> involved with the community and my job as honorary press officer was not only to sort of liaise with</div><div id="00:05:47.480" class="transcript_line"> the media and raise the profile of the club but also to try and think about how we could work more</div><div id="00:05:52.920" class="transcript_line"> with community organisations and that had a you know a two-way street situation a win-win situation</div><div id="00:05:59.560" class="transcript_line"> because on the one hand it was giving amateur photographers a chance to do some good photography</div><div id="00:06:06.440" class="transcript_line"> hopefully giving them the the opportunity to shoot some interesting things but also then in</div><div id="00:06:12.200" class="transcript_line"> terms of the organisations the voluntary groups giving them some material that would help them</div><div id="00:06:17.960" class="transcript_line"> with their publicity no no and that&#039;s very true I mean one of the things I loved about yourself</div><div id="00:06:21.960" class="transcript_line"> and the Cardiff Camera Club is the quick turnaround I mean you know so we would do</div><div id="00:06:27.400" class="transcript_line"> carnival normally on a Saturday by Monday we would begin to have a flow of images</div><div id="00:06:33.160" class="transcript_line"> and certainly that would help beat the post-carnival blues where suddenly you&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:06:37.240" class="transcript_line"> through this experience and and you know bless them there&#039;s suddenly there&#039;s these discs arriving in</div><div id="00:06:41.640" class="transcript_line"> our pigeonhole in chapter and we&#039;re reliving the highlights of the weekend and so you know that was</div><div id="00:06:47.480" class="transcript_line"> one of the many things I enjoyed working with the Cardiff Camera Club. And the thing with amateur</div><div id="00:06:51.080" class="transcript_line"> photography is that you know you&#039;re not doing it commercially for a client where the client is</div><div id="00:06:56.360" class="transcript_line"> dictating what they need for example a wedding is a typical example you&#039;ve got to give the married</div><div id="00:07:01.480" class="transcript_line"> couple what they want. I think with amateur photography it can become much more of an art</div><div id="00:07:07.640" class="transcript_line"> because you have that freedom to do it how you like and I mean what I&#039;ve seen each year about a</div><div id="00:07:13.720" class="transcript_line"> dozen members of the club shoot the carnival from beginners to very experienced members some have</div><div id="00:07:19.080" class="transcript_line"> worked commercially as well as professionals in the past but what I see is a range of different</div><div id="00:07:24.760" class="transcript_line"> approaches by those people so you&#039;ve got people with different styles and for me what that gives</div><div id="00:07:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Swick a carnival is a spectrum of artistic output as opposed to perhaps one commercial photographer</div><div id="00:07:38.280" class="transcript_line"> doing a shoot in his particular style. Yes you might have one somebody&#039;s into portraiture</div><div id="00:07:43.320" class="transcript_line"> someone else is going for the crowd shots yeah and uh there was a you know obviously shooting in the</div><div id="00:07:49.720" class="transcript_line"> urban environment where we&#039;re parading through the streets of Cardiff I know that you and others</div><div id="00:07:54.680" class="transcript_line"> have found various vantage points but we still think uh that there&#039;s well there was a shot which</div><div id="00:08:00.840" class="transcript_line"> is known as Tony&#039;s shot uh and this is where you uh yeah what&#039;s it like from the keep of the castle</div><div id="00:08:06.840" class="transcript_line"> looking down St Mary&#039;s street at hundreds of costumes because it was it was a brainwave you</div><div id="00:08:12.760" class="transcript_line"> know we couldn&#039;t get you up in a helicopter you know you&#039;re too big for a drone I can&#039;t use a</div><div id="00:08:17.320" class="transcript_line"> drone no I think it was really probably going back to my commercial business background in the</div><div id="00:08:22.280" class="transcript_line"> second half of my career and you think you know you&#039;re a charity you&#039;re after sponsorship you&#039;re</div><div id="00:08:27.400" class="transcript_line"> after money and so what would somebody putting money into a carnival want they want the context</div><div id="00:08:33.320" class="transcript_line"> with when and it&#039;s not a couple of people on the pavement in church away Cardiff looking at a few</div><div id="00:08:39.320" class="transcript_line"> people going past it&#039;s thousands of people uh for example looking up from the top of Cardiff castle</div><div id="00:08:46.360" class="transcript_line"> entrance up St Mary&#039;s street uh High Street St Mary&#039;s street seeing you know the thousands of</div><div id="00:08:52.440" class="transcript_line"> people jammed you know up against the the the shop windows right up to the barriers the pavement</div><div id="00:08:58.920" class="transcript_line"> and then the carnival with lots of people in different groups coming down so that was almost</div><div id="00:09:03.720" class="transcript_line"> a helicopter view and then of course you&#039;ve got the up close um and personal um context as well</div><div id="00:09:11.320" class="transcript_line"> where you&#039;re looking at people in groups or individually which again with the colour</div><div id="00:09:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and costumes that so much thought and design goes into into them with your crew</div><div id="00:09:21.080" class="transcript_line"> it gives a very different visual experience but what I&#039;ve also seen is something that&#039;s quite</div><div id="00:09:27.640" class="transcript_line"> different and probably people don&#039;t acknowledge or don&#039;t see as one of the other benefits side</div><div id="00:09:35.560" class="transcript_line"> effects of Cardiff carnival and I&#039;ve talked to a lot of people in the carnival over the years</div><div id="00:09:40.920" class="transcript_line"> they say don&#039;t click uh with your camera until you&#039;ve clicked with the person you know so talk</div><div id="00:09:47.080" class="transcript_line"> to the person yeah yeah I talked to a lot of people over the years you know because if you&#039;re going to</div><div id="00:09:51.320" class="transcript_line"> shoot them you want to know a little bit about them perhaps and what I found is I&#039;ve had people</div><div id="00:09:56.120" class="transcript_line"> say to me I came into this as a volunteer and did this and it changed my life um I was down um I&#039;d</div><div id="00:10:04.040" class="transcript_line"> been through a bad experience something had happened in my life and by joining the Cardiff</div><div id="00:10:08.760" class="transcript_line"> carnival team going to the workshops and taking part in the preparation and being with those other</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> people actually got me back on my feet and I&#039;ve heard people say that sort of thing now most</div><div id="00:10:19.480" class="transcript_line"> people watching the carnival wouldn&#039;t realize but there are all sorts of if you like tangents</div><div id="00:10:24.840" class="transcript_line"> undercurrents going on within the carnival that I think too is is is absolutely fantastic in terms</div><div id="00:10:30.760" class="transcript_line"> of what the carnival does for Cardiff and individual people I think that&#039;s fantastic I mean I think</div><div id="00:10:35.240" class="transcript_line"> your reference to the the healing power of of creating things collectively and then twice</div><div id="00:10:41.560" class="transcript_line"> bless showing it in the in the public domain and adding a bit of color to our austerity struck</div><div id="00:10:46.760" class="transcript_line"> streets streets it&#039;s uh it&#039;s it&#039;s fantastic um well uh obviously uh this interview will form</div><div id="00:10:53.880" class="transcript_line"> part of the archive as will hundreds of thousands of photographs many of which you personally helped</div><div id="00:10:59.560" class="transcript_line"> us bring about through the relationship with the Cardiff camera club and we&#039;re very very grateful</div><div id="00:11:04.840" class="transcript_line"> for that uh obviously we sit here slightly saddened by the news that of course swicker carnival</div><div id="00:11:12.520" class="transcript_line"> with withdrawal of arts council funding will now be closing um what what are your what are your</div><div id="00:11:19.080" class="transcript_line"> thoughts on that I mean uh I&#039;m very sad about that because uh being part of the welsh charity</div><div id="00:11:24.200" class="transcript_line"> movement myself as a founder member and a volunteer for 44 years with the south wales talking</div><div id="00:11:29.880" class="transcript_line"> magazine association first of all I realize how important it is for voluntary and not-for-profit</div><div id="00:11:35.160" class="transcript_line"> groups to get funding these days so that is an issue in these times of difficulty and yet we&#039;re</div><div id="00:11:41.480" class="transcript_line"> one of the richest countries in the world so there&#039;s a you know a bit of a dilemma there in terms of</div><div id="00:11:47.320" class="transcript_line"> you think well what&#039;s going on now Cardiff is a very modern expanding progressive european capital</div><div id="00:11:54.120" class="transcript_line"> the foundations were laid through the wisdom of the city forefathers and we&#039;ve got to continue that</div><div id="00:11:59.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean over the last five years I&#039;ve traveled quite extensively uh particularly in europe and</div><div id="00:12:04.360" class="transcript_line"> abroad to cities like uh Rio in Brazil um Accra in Senegal a lot of the european cities Lisbon</div><div id="00:12:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Barcelona places like that and if somebody said to me Tony where would you prefer to be it would</div><div id="00:12:18.680" class="transcript_line"> always be Cardiff we&#039;re a modern european waterfront city and we have to invest in the</div><div id="00:12:24.840" class="transcript_line"> arts we have to invest in the future and I&#039;m very sad when I hear of arts and voluntary</div><div id="00:12:31.480" class="transcript_line"> organizations having these financial difficulties which seem to come up so often these days so I</div><div id="00:12:37.960" class="transcript_line"> would very much like to see some sort of rebirth some phoenix from the ashes come out of 26 years</div><div id="00:12:45.320" class="transcript_line"> of Cardiff carnival and see something continue in the future as we continue to try and develop</div><div id="00:12:51.640" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff as a leading european city on that hopeful and optimistic note can I just say</div><div id="00:12:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Tony it&#039;s been a joy working with you over the years and I wish to award you the invisible but</div><div id="00:13:02.920" class="transcript_line"> eternal accolade of a hereby W a Cardiff carnival hero thank you very much Tony thank you</div></div></p>
