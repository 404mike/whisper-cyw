    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, this is Catherine McShane interviewing for the SWCCR Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary</div><div id="00:00:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Project and I&#039;m here with Ray Thoburn in Trowbridge in Cardiff and it is the 15th of October</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Ray, could you spell your name for me?</div><div id="00:00:28.640" class="transcript_line"> R-A-Y T-H-O-B-U-R-N</div><div id="00:00:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Fab, thanks. So what&#039;s your involvement been with Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:42.720" class="transcript_line"> I tend to make the bigger puppets, the large, sometimes up to 11 foot puppets that you see</div><div id="00:00:52.040" class="transcript_line"> going around the streets.</div><div id="00:00:55.960" class="transcript_line"> When you say you make those, is that at the carnival camp or...?</div><div id="00:01:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Most of the big stuff, the actual joining of the aluminium is done down at the carnival</div><div id="00:01:09.200" class="transcript_line"> camp. But we make a lot of stuff at home in preparation for it, if it&#039;s needed, depending</div><div id="00:01:17.280" class="transcript_line"> on what we&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:01:18.280" class="transcript_line"> What sort of things do you make then?</div><div id="00:01:21.520" class="transcript_line"> I made a knight, I made Queen Elizabeth I, made a giant mermaid, made a lot of wings</div><div id="00:01:39.120" class="transcript_line"> and a lot of shoulder joints for different puppets and found new ways of making the wings</div><div id="00:01:47.560" class="transcript_line"> and the shoulder joints as well. Because the way they were being made was a little bit</div><div id="00:01:52.160" class="transcript_line"> difficult to use.</div><div id="00:01:54.640" class="transcript_line"> Is it that something you&#039;ve got a background in then or is it something you&#039;ve learnt there?</div><div id="00:01:59.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always looked for the easiest way to do things. I&#039;ve got a background in engineering</div><div id="00:02:05.520" class="transcript_line"> and when you&#039;re an engineer you look for the easiest way to do things at the time with</div><div id="00:02:11.800" class="transcript_line"> whatever you happen to have to hand.</div><div id="00:02:14.040" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s been the favourite thing that you&#039;ve made?</div><div id="00:02:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the favourite thing. I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ve enjoyed them all. I did enjoy making Queen</div><div id="00:02:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Elizabeth I because, well, it was the first major puppet that I got to pilot. I hadn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:36.600" class="transcript_line"> really done much of the performance side of it before I made her. I enjoyed the piloting</div><div id="00:02:44.200" class="transcript_line"> side of that one. It was a lot of fun.</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> So how did the crowd react to your puppetry?</div><div id="00:02:52.200" class="transcript_line"> I mean a lot of little girls screamed, which is quite a laugh really. And one gentleman</div><div id="00:03:01.200" class="transcript_line"> sticks out of your mind, he was clearly a disabled gentleman and he looked all forlorn</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> by himself. So I left the parade and went and teased him for a couple of minutes and</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> when I left he was laughing so I thought that&#039;ll do. That&#039;s him cheered up for the day.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fab.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoy that side of interaction with the crowd. Just sneaking up on young children</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> with a huge pair of hands stretched out in front of you. When they look up and see what&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:31.600" class="transcript_line"> coming they do scream.</div><div id="00:03:34.600" class="transcript_line"> So making children cry then?</div><div id="00:03:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, basically making children cry. It&#039;s my life&#039;s dream.</div><div id="00:03:42.600" class="transcript_line"> So how many have you done?</div><div id="00:03:45.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve not really kept a count. I&#039;ve done a few over the years but I&#039;ve made</div><div id="00:03:52.600" class="transcript_line"> stuff. Before Carnival it was quite big and quite meaty. I&#039;ve always had a handkerchief</div><div id="00:04:03.320" class="transcript_line"> to put things together and just do things. It hasn&#039;t always been practical, it hasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:04:10.320" class="transcript_line"> always been functional but I&#039;ve always made things and did things by hand. It&#039;s just the</div><div id="00:04:17.320" class="transcript_line"> way I&#039;ve been brought up.</div><div id="00:04:20.600" class="transcript_line"> I hear that you&#039;ve helped quite a few other people.</div><div id="00:04:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I don&#039;t enjoy that part of it at all. I get no thanks.</div><div id="00:04:28.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:04:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Not whatsoever. I don&#039;t think I bother next year. I&#039;ll leave them to rot.</div><div id="00:04:40.600" class="transcript_line"> So what do you enjoy most about it, about Carnival?</div><div id="00:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, to be honest, when I first went down, when I first walked in through the door, I</div><div id="00:04:51.600" class="transcript_line"> felt a little bit out of place. But there was a really nice girl there called Caroline</div><div id="00:05:01.600" class="transcript_line"> who she came straight over to us as new faces and she really made us feel welcome. She was</div><div id="00:05:09.600" class="transcript_line"> a star she was that year and we&#039;re still friends now. She proved herself to be a star, a real</div><div id="00:05:18.600" class="transcript_line"> team player that year and she really welcomed us on board. Which was something that some</div><div id="00:05:23.600" class="transcript_line"> of the others didn&#039;t really bother doing the first year. We were welcomed the second year</div><div id="00:05:28.600" class="transcript_line"> by. There was returning friends. But the first year, Caroline really came across and really</div><div id="00:05:34.600" class="transcript_line"> made us feel welcome. I was grateful for that, for that input. Without that I might not bother</div><div id="00:05:39.600" class="transcript_line"> for a second year.</div><div id="00:05:41.600" class="transcript_line"> And is it something you&#039;re likely to continue with?</div><div id="00:05:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I can&#039;t continue going down. Yeah, we&#039;ve been set on the right foot. There&#039;s a lot</div><div id="00:05:51.600" class="transcript_line"> of lovely people down there that we&#039;ve gotten to know over the years. It would be a shame</div><div id="00:05:56.600" class="transcript_line"> if we didn&#039;t get to see them every year.</div><div id="00:05:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any kind of memorable moments, either kind of carnival camp or on parade?</div><div id="00:06:07.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how memorable it is really, but there was an instance where I went up to one</div><div id="00:06:18.600" class="transcript_line"> of the guys that was making a structure and I pointed out a weak flaw in the design. And</div><div id="00:06:28.600" class="transcript_line"> I more or less got told, don&#039;t be silly, it&#039;s fine. But that person, she came and admitted</div><div id="00:06:34.600" class="transcript_line"> that she slept on that, woke up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night and said</div><div id="00:06:39.600" class="transcript_line"> that bugger&#039;s right. And she went and changed it and that worked. That costume worked because</div><div id="00:06:45.600" class="transcript_line"> of that. And I got thanked for that one as well. In a kind of backhanded sort of way.</div><div id="00:06:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, no one likes being told they&#039;re wrong, do they?</div><div id="00:06:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Everything else was perfect on it. It was just that one little part I could see it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:07:01.600" class="transcript_line"> going to feel. I could see it wouldn&#039;t work. But she put so much effort into everything</div><div id="00:07:07.600" class="transcript_line"> else that that little bit was just something she&#039;d missed. One little tiny detail. But</div><div id="00:07:14.600" class="transcript_line"> there we are. She&#039;s seen it now.</div><div id="00:07:19.600" class="transcript_line"> There we go. And friends you&#039;ve made, you mentioned friends that you&#039;ve made along the</div><div id="00:07:25.600" class="transcript_line"> way. Yeah, yeah, we&#039;ve made some lovely friends along the way. Some of us, well there&#039;s one</div><div id="00:07:32.600" class="transcript_line"> in particular, every year, carnival camp she comes and she actually stays here now for</div><div id="00:07:38.600" class="transcript_line"> the duration of the carnival camp. Then a week or two after. In fact you wonder when</div><div id="00:07:42.600" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s going to leave some years. Where&#039;s she from then? Is she not from Cardiff? No, she</div><div id="00:07:47.600" class="transcript_line"> comes from Penzance. Oh right, so quite a distance then. Quite a distance. But yeah,</div><div id="00:07:53.600" class="transcript_line"> she comes up and she&#039;s the perfect house guest. We don&#039;t know if she&#039;s there half</div><div id="00:07:58.600" class="transcript_line"> the time. So yeah, it&#039;s always nice to see her. And is she someone else who makes big</div><div id="00:08:06.600" class="transcript_line"> costumes then? She makes big costumes as well, yeah. She does a really good job of it. She</div><div id="00:08:12.600" class="transcript_line"> makes some belters, she does. Some real belters. Another really skillful individual. Nice to</div><div id="00:08:20.600" class="transcript_line"> see. Nice to see the results. And, because obviously all yours are sort of very big costumes.</div><div id="00:08:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Is it really tiring by the end of the parade? Are you worn out? It depends. The first year</div><div id="00:08:40.600" class="transcript_line"> I was Queen Elizabeth because of the way that the elder shawl adjoints had been created</div><div id="00:08:46.600" class="transcript_line"> using various bits of steel and screws. That was a nightmare to try and get any sort of</div><div id="00:08:52.600" class="transcript_line"> movement out of that. Because to move one area, the boxes were all turned in different</div><div id="00:09:03.600" class="transcript_line"> directions and they were starting to tighten up themselves and it was becoming really difficult</div><div id="00:09:06.600" class="transcript_line"> to move. And we had a discussion and we decided that from then on we wouldn&#039;t use aluminium</div><div id="00:09:15.600" class="transcript_line"> and stuff to make the adjoints. We would just use a piece of rope and from that day forward</div><div id="00:09:22.600" class="transcript_line"> all our costumes would be made with rope in the adjoints and we would not have had a single</div><div id="00:09:27.600" class="transcript_line"> problem with any mobility anywhere. It&#039;s been a lot easier since then hasn&#039;t it? A lot easier</div><div id="00:09:34.600" class="transcript_line"> to use them. So are they heavy? Some of them can be but if they&#039;re designed with enough</div><div id="00:09:42.600" class="transcript_line"> counter balance beneath them they sit really well. If they&#039;re top heavy they will tend to topple</div><div id="00:09:49.600" class="transcript_line"> over so you have to bear that in mind when you&#039;re making them. Make them heavier below your</div><div id="00:09:54.600" class="transcript_line"> shoulders so they won&#039;t topple off or topple over. So you can dance in them then? Well some of the</div><div id="00:10:02.600" class="transcript_line"> ones I&#039;ve made you can actually hold a dance in them. Some of the ones I&#039;ve made have been really</div><div id="00:10:06.600" class="transcript_line"> very big indeed. But yeah you can dance and sing and chat around. It was actually Caroline again</div><div id="00:10:14.600" class="transcript_line"> she wanted to do a bit of jiving with Queen Elizabeth the first on the way up to the big weekend.</div><div id="00:10:23.600" class="transcript_line"> So me and Caroline were jiving walking up the road and I was dancing in this big costume. That was a bit of fun.</div><div id="00:10:31.600" class="transcript_line"> That was alright. That was a laugh. Oh great. So would you recommend being involved in Carnival to other people?</div><div id="00:10:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Well yes I would. Anybody who&#039;s got any sort of aspirations to perform in any shape or form should get down to Carnival.</div><div id="00:10:56.600" class="transcript_line"> And just give it a try. At the end of the day those people are, each and every one of them is as different as</div><div id="00:11:06.600" class="transcript_line"> chalk and cheese from each other. But they all come under the main head of Carnival people.</div><div id="00:11:14.600" class="transcript_line"> And that is just a crack of bunch of guys and girls. They&#039;re a real treat to be around. It&#039;s a pleasure knowing them.</div><div id="00:11:23.600" class="transcript_line"> A real pleasure. Great. Thank you very much.</div></div></p>
