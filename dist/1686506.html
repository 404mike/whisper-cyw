    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> A thank you to Heritage Lottery for funding this short project on memories of people who are from,</div><div id="00:00:12.320" class="transcript_line"> lived in, a part of Butetown, Tiger Bay or Cardiff Docks. This episode is a brief conversation with</div><div id="00:00:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Peter Pepsi Findlayson. Oh yeah, that&#039;s true. Well, Pepsi is a nickname obviously. Well,</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> so I was born here in Cardiff, down in old Tiger Bay. My mother was born here in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:43.280" class="transcript_line"> My father was born in the western region of Jamaica. I lived here all my life.</div><div id="00:00:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so my mother is deceased now. My father, he died when I was one.</div><div id="00:01:04.560" class="transcript_line"> I left him on a ship in Scotland, which I didn&#039;t know anything about him.</div><div id="00:01:12.080" class="transcript_line"> That couldn&#039;t have been easy for your mom when, you know, when they&#039;re bringing you up. Was</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> they just you, Pepsi, or was they brothers and sisters? No, definitely, definitely, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:24.400" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, she was, she was all through the wall, you know. But I, well, I lived with my mother,</div><div id="00:01:33.280" class="transcript_line"> but I was with my grandmother. It was all from kind of Bay, so. So, what about school, mate?</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> School, I went to, I was a family-born school, South Church Street, which, you know,</div><div id="00:01:54.400" class="transcript_line"> from an infant, my father was 15. I went there, you know, and next to everybody, black and white,</div><div id="00:02:05.120" class="transcript_line"> but I didn&#039;t say that. Yeah. All that, all through my school days, you know, and still</div><div id="00:02:11.680" class="transcript_line"> remain friends with a lot of them, you know, today, you know, and I made me true, you know.</div><div id="00:02:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, religion and race didn&#039;t mean anything then, then? Well, no, not really,</div><div id="00:02:26.560" class="transcript_line"> you know. Well, you know, we, well, we are the way different, you know, we just play together and,</div><div id="00:02:33.200" class="transcript_line"> you know, go over together and, you know, we go over into the pub and drink together, you know,</div><div id="00:02:41.600" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s been a really fancy and meaningful today, you know, with all the lives, you know.</div><div id="00:02:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, when we, from the Bay over the bridge, like, you know, really sweet,</div><div id="00:02:58.560" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a little bit of conflict, I mean, like, in Newtown,</div><div id="00:03:06.960" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s nothing, well, myself personally, you know, I, I got on with everybody, really, you know,</div><div id="00:03:19.920" class="transcript_line"> conflict now and again, but nothing to really talk about.</div><div id="00:03:24.240" class="transcript_line"> So back, back to the school, what about people talk about the Whitsun treat?</div><div id="00:03:34.560" class="transcript_line"> What about that? Well, the Whitsun treat was one of our pleasures, you know,</div><div id="00:03:41.520" class="transcript_line"> um, it&#039;s, um, it&#039;s all this, it&#039;s sort of a, you know, the, the tents and, um, you know,</div><div id="00:03:51.840" class="transcript_line"> college, and everything like, you know, and, you know, that was, um, you know,</div><div id="00:03:59.920" class="transcript_line"> it was a great time, you know. Did you, did you go on the lorry trips?</div><div id="00:04:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, that&#039;s what I mean, you know, it&#039;s, uh, people, well, I do it myself,</div><div id="00:04:12.080" class="transcript_line"> in the very, you know, when I grew up and worked, I&#039;ve been a lorry driver, like, all my life,</div><div id="00:04:18.400" class="transcript_line"> and, um, I actually, you know, the commissioners and the boss, and get the lorry and</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> do a bit of the Whitsun treats, like, you know, so I knew all about that, you know.</div><div id="00:04:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Those early days, etc., what about families mixing and all that kind of stuff? Did, you know,</div><div id="00:04:41.200" class="transcript_line"> was there a lot of, you know, going into people&#039;s houses and eating?</div><div id="00:04:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh,

everything,</div><div id="00:08:43.360" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;m still, still grumpy.</div><div id="00:08:47.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a different,</div><div id="00:08:48.320" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a different feeling being a granddad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:51.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s not like being a,</div><div id="00:08:53.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s different to being a dad,</div><div id="00:08:55.720" class="transcript_line"> because you can be,</div><div id="00:08:56.800" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t have all the responsibility,</div><div id="00:08:58.880" class="transcript_line"> you can be a bit different.</div><div id="00:09:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, I really,</div><div id="00:09:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I really don&#039;t know about that,</div><div id="00:09:05.280" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m like that now, you know,</div><div id="00:09:11.600" class="transcript_line"> and I got two more kids now,</div><div id="00:09:15.600" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re doing their work from school,</div><div id="00:09:19.160" class="transcript_line"> you know, whatever they call it,</div><div id="00:09:21.800" class="transcript_line"> Homework area, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:23.240" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, they&#039;ve been asking me</div><div id="00:09:28.760" class="transcript_line"> any answers I&#039;ve ever had,</div><div id="00:09:30.200" class="transcript_line"> because, you know, I forgot an old school,</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, except for what you&#039;re asking, you know?</div><div id="00:09:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:39.280" class="transcript_line"> What, I mean, what do you,</div><div id="00:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> what about the changes to the Bay and Bute Town</div><div id="00:09:46.520" class="transcript_line"> and the neighborhood?</div><div id="00:09:48.320" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about that,</div><div id="00:09:49.920" class="transcript_line"> the way everything&#039;s been knocked down and changed?</div><div id="00:09:53.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, that&#039;s,</div><div id="00:09:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s terrible, you know,</div><div id="00:10:00.480" class="transcript_line"> as regards to, you know, the housing and,</div><div id="00:10:05.160" class="transcript_line"> and, well, when we were down at Bay,</div><div id="00:10:10.240" class="transcript_line"> you know, they,</div><div id="00:10:12.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when they just started building them</div><div id="00:10:15.920" class="transcript_line"> multi-story buildings and all that,</div><div id="00:10:17.800" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, I didn&#039;t like that,</div><div id="00:10:19.800" class="transcript_line"> because it dispersed a lot of families,</div><div id="00:10:24.040" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, I mean, when it was the Bay,</div><div id="00:10:27.360" class="transcript_line"> I knew where everybody lived, you know,</div><div id="00:10:31.840" class="transcript_line"> and now that they&#039;ve gone and had all these facts,</div><div id="00:10:35.880" class="transcript_line"> excuse me, I didn&#039;t know where anyone lived,</div><div id="00:10:38.880" class="transcript_line"> and then, you know, things like that.</div><div id="00:10:40.880" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, I mean, where I live now</div><div id="00:10:45.360" class="transcript_line"> in Palma Street,</div><div id="00:10:47.360" class="transcript_line"> as I said, I&#039;ve been here now for like 45, 46 years.</div><div id="00:10:53.120" class="transcript_line"> I know everybody, well, not everybody,</div><div id="00:10:56.880" class="transcript_line"> because people, different people moving in,</div><div id="00:10:59.920" class="transcript_line"> but down here it&#039;s quite nice, you know,</div><div id="00:11:02.720" class="transcript_line"> but up at Bay there now, I know, I know anyone, you know,</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> when I grew up, you know,</div><div id="00:11:12.120" class="transcript_line"> the shoes I live in, like, you know,</div><div id="00:11:13.480" class="transcript_line"> there was a lot of Samaritan people,</div><div id="00:11:16.720" class="transcript_line"> those lovely, lovely people, you know,</div><div id="00:11:19.320" class="transcript_line"> you got boating houses, and people went into them</div><div id="00:11:23.840" class="transcript_line"> and have a cup of tea, or they make a pop, you know,</div><div id="00:11:28.840" class="transcript_line"> and they were invited to eat, you know,</div><div id="00:11:31.760" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t, well, I will tell you,</div><div id="00:11:33.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want the Bay at all now,</div><div id="00:11:36.960" class="transcript_line"> but, you know, when I was there,</div><div id="00:11:41.040" class="transcript_line"> you go into people&#039;s houses and eat,</div><div id="00:11:43.800" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, like, what do they call them, cafes,</div><div id="00:11:47.240" class="transcript_line"> any, or boating houses, you know,</div><div id="00:11:49.960" class="transcript_line"> eat to them people, they&#039;ve invited me to eat,</div><div id="00:11:52.440" class="transcript_line"> but, you know, I don&#039;t want them now,</div><div id="00:11:54.960" class="transcript_line"> so, but I don&#039;t want them in like that happens today,</div><div id="00:11:58.440" class="transcript_line"> you know, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:11:59.520" class="transcript_line"> And everybody, all of those, all of those people,</div><div id="00:12:02.760" class="transcript_line"> even though they didn&#039;t have a lot of money,</div><div id="00:12:04.680" class="transcript_line"> they always seemed to dress smart,</div><div id="00:12:07.040" class="transcript_line"> do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:07.880" class="transcript_line"> They always seemed to look after themselves.</div><div id="00:12:11.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, they had their Sunday best, you know,</div><div id="00:12:17.480" class="transcript_line"> and as I mentioned, shoe, you know,</div><div id="00:12:21.240" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got the black ties and suits and everything,</div><div id="00:12:24.480" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, but it&#039;s a funny difference,</div><div id="00:12:28.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very, like, you know, I mean,</div><div id="00:12:32.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been to quite a lot of shoe houses,</div><div id="00:12:35.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always dressed myself, you know,</div><div id="00:12:38.320" class="transcript_line"> in an additional way, with black ties,</div><div id="00:12:40.720" class="transcript_line"> suits and tights, and everything,</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> but they just used casual things, you know, you know.</div><div id="00:12:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Funerals, funerals always were a big thing</div><div id="00:12:51.120" class="transcript_line"> in the Bay, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:12:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Always, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:55.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, yeah, and you know,</div><div id="00:12:58.520" class="transcript_line"> well, I work for the firm, you know,</div><div id="00:13:02.440" class="transcript_line"> and I just ask the boss, you know,</div><div id="00:13:06.480" class="transcript_line"> I say, well, there&#039;s a funeral, you know,</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> so he needs to make a joke for me,</div><div id="00:13:11.320" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, there&#039;s anybody left, like, you know,</div><div id="00:13:14.480" class="transcript_line"> but I mean, there&#039;s people&#039;s mothers and grandmothers</div><div id="00:13:20.200" class="transcript_line"> and fathers, you know, and you&#039;re going up to them,</div><div id="00:13:23.920" class="transcript_line"> and you tend to go to a mother or father</div><div id="00:13:28.920" class="transcript_line"> or grandfather&#039;s funeral, like, you know?</div><div id="00:13:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:31.440" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how it&#039;s always been, you know?</div><div id="00:13:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:39.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I, well, I mean, people have talked about stuff</div><div id="00:13:42.400" class="transcript_line"> like things like, you remember Chalky White&#039;s place,</div><div id="00:13:46.640" class="transcript_line"> the center?</div><div id="00:13:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:13:49.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, did you have anything to do with that?</div><div id="00:13:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go there or whatever?</div><div id="00:13:53.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I used to go there, yeah, as I go there, you know,</div><div id="00:13:57.640" class="transcript_line"> I used, I used to just, you know,</div><div id="00:14:01.960" class="transcript_line"> play games with table tennis or game a silver pool</div><div id="00:14:07.160" class="transcript_line"> or whatever, you know, and I never had a big interest in it,</div><div id="00:14:12.160" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;d go there just to meet friends and everything.</div><div id="00:14:16.120" class="transcript_line"> I knew Chalky White very well, you know?</div><div id="00:14:19.600" class="transcript_line"> People said he was an important man at the time</div><div id="00:14:23.160" class="transcript_line"> in terms of what he did for young people.</div><div id="00:14:25.680" class="transcript_line"> What did you, what do you think?</div><div id="00:14:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, I was saying, well,</div><div id="00:14:31.800" class="transcript_line"> I knew his name was Vivian White, you know?</div><div id="00:14:34.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:35.080" class="transcript_line"> They called him Chalky, you know?</div><div id="00:14:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, we are calling him Chalky White.</div><div id="00:14:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:41.280" class="transcript_line"> He was, he was a, he came running,</div><div id="00:14:44.280" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, he, if you wanna ask him anything, you know,</div><div id="00:14:49.600" class="transcript_line"> he told him and he helped him to,</div><div id="00:14:53.360" class="transcript_line"> if he could with anything, I mean,</div><div id="00:14:57.520" class="transcript_line"> if he wanted to, I don&#039;t know, whatever.</div><div id="00:15:03.520" class="transcript_line"> What do you call it?</div><div id="00:15:05.760" class="transcript_line"> Any inquiries.</div><div id="00:15:07.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Fill out any forms and all that kind of,</div><div id="00:15:10.800" class="transcript_line"> which, some things like that, you know?</div><div id="00:15:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:16.280" class="transcript_line"> And what about, you know, people have said, like,</div><div id="00:15:19.160" class="transcript_line"> when they were at school, there were certain teachers</div><div id="00:15:21.720" class="transcript_line"> that were important to them.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, some have mentioned Betty Campbell</div><div id="00:15:27.160" class="transcript_line"> and Owen Watkins and others, and I just wondered,</div><div id="00:15:30.120" class="transcript_line"> what about you?</div><div id="00:15:30.960" class="transcript_line"> Were there any teachers?</div><div id="00:15:31.800" class="transcript_line"> You, you, you kind of,</div><div id="00:15:34.880" class="transcript_line"> that you recall?</div><div id="00:15:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, I used to live in the same house as Betty Campbell</div><div id="00:15:40.240" class="transcript_line"> when I was, when I was young, you know, very young,</div><div id="00:15:44.400" class="transcript_line"> and I knew Owen Watkins very well.</div><div id="00:15:49.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, the lady kind of teachers when I was,</div><div id="00:15:52.280" class="transcript_line"> you know, when I was at school, like, you know?</div><div id="00:15:55.160" class="transcript_line"> But I used to go to all them houses, regular, like, you know?</div><div id="00:16:00.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, she was older than I was, and Betty Campbell,</div><div id="00:16:04.440" class="transcript_line"> but we made friends, and so, you know,</div><div id="00:16:07.480" class="transcript_line"> they would, they passed away, which was reasonable, you know?</div><div id="00:16:11.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:12.080" class="transcript_line"> And, and they were so good, the two of them,</div><div id="00:16:16.600" class="transcript_line"> which is that too, if you wanted to, you know,</div><div id="00:16:20.800" class="transcript_line"> fill out any forms, or say, you know,</div><div id="00:16:24.120" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s say that they, they help you,</div><div id="00:16:25.880" class="transcript_line"> and you can help, you know?</div><div id="00:16:27.720" class="transcript_line"> So, um.</div><div id="00:16:29.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what, if you were, you know,</div><div id="00:16:32.160" class="transcript_line"> imagine somebody&#039;s having a cup of coffee</div><div id="00:16:35.800" class="transcript_line"> in those new, those new places,</div><div id="00:16:38.920" class="transcript_line"> and down the, what they now call the Bay,</div><div id="00:16:44.760" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s a tourist, and they don&#039;t know anything</div><div id="00:16:47.320" class="transcript_line"> about the life that went on, you know, before.</div><div id="00:16:52.640" class="transcript_line"> What would you say to them that they should know</div><div id="00:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> about the people that lived, grew up,</div><div id="00:17:00.240" class="transcript_line"> and were in the Bay, and in Butetown?</div><div id="00:17:03.760" class="transcript_line"> What would you say to them, if you had a chance?</div><div id="00:17:07.200" class="transcript_line"> If I had a chance, I will.</div><div id="00:17:09.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, well, I was,</div><div id="00:17:13.560" class="transcript_line"> oh, I was brought up, you know, I mean,</div><div id="00:17:17.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, well, our manners,</div><div id="00:17:20.720" class="transcript_line"> we respect the people, and,</div><div id="00:17:24.200" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what we were taught, you know?</div><div id="00:17:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why I try to tell my grandchildren,</div><div id="00:17:31.960" class="transcript_line"> no, you know, we have to be respectful,</div><div id="00:17:36.160" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, something like that.</div><div id="00:17:40.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:41.080" class="transcript_line"> I try.</div><div id="00:17:42.920" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all of, what about all of the,</div><div id="00:17:44.880" class="transcript_line"> you know, you said about, you know, music and that,</div><div id="00:17:47.040" class="transcript_line"> and all of the pubs, I think there&#039;s only the packet</div><div id="00:17:50.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s left, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:17:53.080" class="transcript_line"> You mean, you know, pubs, yes, um, yes.</div><div id="00:17:57.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s only a packet down here, no.</div><div id="00:17:59.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, um, I mean,</div><div id="00:18:03.800" class="transcript_line"> the only thing when we used to all meet together,</div><div id="00:18:06.280" class="transcript_line"> which is, but there&#039;s just pubs,</div><div id="00:18:09.240" class="transcript_line"> but you know, I think you see,</div><div id="00:18:11.760" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re all school friends, and, you know,</div><div id="00:18:14.400" class="transcript_line"> and people like that, but,</div><div id="00:18:18.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think you can even do that in Great Nile.</div><div id="00:18:20.360" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:21.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, or you can meet outside, or in a corner,</div><div id="00:18:25.360" class="transcript_line"> you know, I don&#039;t know where they live off it,</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> or in their house and everything, and that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="00:18:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:33.720" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:18:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you, Pepsi, for sparing some time with me.</div><div id="00:18:39.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m grateful, mate.</div><div id="00:18:40.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:41.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s nice to hear your memories, as I say.</div><div id="00:18:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, I hope, you know, I mean,</div><div id="00:18:51.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a bit forgetful, you know,</div><div id="00:18:55.720" class="transcript_line"> but I do try.</div><div id="00:18:57.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re still around, man.</div><div id="00:18:59.840" class="transcript_line"> The thing is that we&#039;re still around.</div><div id="00:19:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, yes.</div><div id="00:19:04.640" class="transcript_line"> There were times when we were younger,</div><div id="00:19:06.240" class="transcript_line"> we more than likely would have thought,</div><div id="00:19:08.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll never get to be there at these ages.</div><div id="00:19:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I would say,</div><div id="00:19:14.080" class="transcript_line"> 82, you know, type of athlete,</div><div id="00:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what I would like to do.</div><div id="00:19:21.480" class="transcript_line"> You know, but, well,</div><div id="00:19:24.080" class="transcript_line"> too bad.</div><div id="00:19:24.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, I said again, I was wondering why you asked me here,</div><div id="00:19:30.440" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m not too swift myself, really,</div><div id="00:19:34.800" class="transcript_line"> but I do try.</div><div id="00:19:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:37.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, when all&#039;s said and done,</div><div id="00:19:39.440" class="transcript_line"> if somebody had said to you 60 years ago,</div><div id="00:19:43.280" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll have children, and you&#039;ll have grandchildren,</div><div id="00:19:47.720" class="transcript_line"> and two of them will be sitting in your place,</div><div id="00:19:53.680" class="transcript_line"> doing their own work.</div><div id="00:19:56.560" class="transcript_line"> You might not believe them, but, you know.</div><div id="00:19:59.400" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I wouldn&#039;t have, I wouldn&#039;t have.</div><div id="00:20:02.200" class="transcript_line"> But now I know how true it is.</div><div id="00:20:03.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, now,</div><div id="00:20:07.040" class="transcript_line"> my younger sister&#039;s father,</div><div id="00:20:09.600" class="transcript_line"> truly not a nurse,</div><div id="00:20:11.440" class="transcript_line"> but in the school, I know,</div><div id="00:20:14.200" class="transcript_line"> and as I say, the truth,</div><div id="00:20:15.880" class="transcript_line"> and my kids know, and they&#039;re confused, you know,</div><div id="00:20:19.320" class="transcript_line"> in their work, so.</div><div id="00:20:21.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lovely feeling having them, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:20:25.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the best in the world.</div><div id="00:20:27.760" class="transcript_line"> The best in the world, you know.</div><div id="00:20:30.520" class="transcript_line"> I live extremely alone,</div><div id="00:20:31.920" class="transcript_line"> and every morning, you know,</div><div id="00:20:36.040" class="transcript_line"> I think of the day, you know,</div><div id="00:20:38.520" class="transcript_line"> I see my wife, and then I go on the bed,</div><div id="00:20:42.040" class="transcript_line"> and I can&#039;t go to the bathroom,</div><div id="00:20:44.120" class="transcript_line"> because they get on my nerves,</div><div id="00:20:46.120" class="transcript_line"> but, you know, I&#039;m just terrible.</div><div id="00:20:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, all I&#039;d say is, man,</div><div id="00:20:54.680" class="transcript_line"> just keep telling them,</div><div id="00:20:56.720" class="transcript_line"> because those memories, those memories of,</div><div id="00:21:01.240" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the same as you and your mum,</div><div id="00:21:03.400" class="transcript_line"> those memories of the conversations you had with them,</div><div id="00:21:08.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re precious, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:21:10.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, when you...</div><div id="00:21:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, definitely.</div><div id="00:21:14.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, most definitely.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you, sir,</div><div id="00:21:18.960" class="transcript_line"> for spending some time with me.</div><div id="00:21:20.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m grateful.</div><div id="00:21:23.120" class="transcript_line"> I hope I&#039;ve done it.</div><div id="00:21:24.960" class="transcript_line"> I hope that I did.</div><div id="00:21:25.800" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been fine.</div><div id="00:21:26.640" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been fine, man.</div><div id="00:21:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, thank you very much.</div><div id="00:21:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:21:30.400" class="transcript_line"> Good to speak to you.</div></div></p>
