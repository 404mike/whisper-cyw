I&#039;m just going to say I&#039;m with Martin Morgan at</div><div id="00:00:06.920" class="transcript_line"> Black Rock Fishery near Chepstone. I&#039;m okay to say near Chepstone. Yeah. Monday</div><div id="00:00:16.440" class="transcript_line"> January the 21st I think. I think. Right. Okay. Yeah this fishery was...</div><div id="00:00:24.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to sit a bit closer. There were three fisheries on the 7 Estuary of the Esk District.</div><div id="00:00:31.640" class="transcript_line"> The 7 District and the Wye District. So it was basically that the Estuary, there was lines drawn</div><div id="00:00:38.680" class="transcript_line"> of the Estuary and you&#039;d have the 7, the Esk and the Wye Districts. People often</div><div id="00:00:45.320" class="transcript_line"> you know sort of misled into thinking we were fishing on the Wye because people</div><div id="00:00:49.720" class="transcript_line"> would be told they fish on the Wye but they would actually say in the Wye</div><div id="00:00:52.480" class="transcript_line"> District. The Black Rock Lave Net Fishery is the last fishery remaining on</div><div id="00:00:59.360" class="transcript_line"> what was fished in the Wye District. There were stop boats, tuck nets,</div><div id="00:01:06.160" class="transcript_line"> sane nets. Lave nets actually on the Wye but we fish in the Estuary and it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:01:12.640" class="transcript_line"> defined area called Gruggy Rocks and that&#039;s the last of the Wye District.</div><div id="00:01:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Fishermen from the past there was a guy called Ron, Ron Williams and I actually</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> had his license. When Ron dropped the license he wasn&#039;t actually dead. He was one of the</div><div id="00:01:30.440" class="transcript_line"> few that sort of gave up a license without dying. But Ron was a character, he was an ex-Royal Marine and one of the</div><div id="00:01:38.640" class="transcript_line"> stories he told me years ago was that when he was a boy growing up in the</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> village he came home on a weekend on a Sunday with a salmon under his arm. He</div><div id="00:01:50.880" class="transcript_line"> found in one of the pools, brought it home to the house and his father gave</div><div id="00:01:56.840" class="transcript_line"> him a good hammering and he said why do you do that? He said he wasn&#039;t for bringing the</div><div id="00:02:03.920" class="transcript_line"> fish home at all, he was for bringing it home on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:02:08.760" class="transcript_line"> He did sabbath. So he was a sabbath and he gave him a hammering but a clip-row mirror and it was purely because he did it on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:02:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Mentioned it on Sundays, Doug Brown another old fisherman, picture of him on the wall there through his years.</div><div id="00:02:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Dougie was a keen fisherman, sort of started off when he was a young boy, sort of</div><div id="00:02:36.520" class="transcript_line"> coming down with the older fishermen, sort of looking after the boat and it was a habit of</div><div id="00:02:42.680" class="transcript_line"> them to go across the estuary from Black Rock to the English side, there&#039;s a hotel,</div><div id="00:02:48.520" class="transcript_line"> what they call the New Passage Hotel and they would go over there for a pint on a Sunday and any other day they could as well I think.</div><div id="00:02:56.520" class="transcript_line"> But especially on a Sunday because Wales was dry and pubs weren&#039;t open on a Sunday and Dougie used to say</div><div id="00:03:05.520" class="transcript_line"> they would go across on a boat, row across on the path of the New Passage and Doug would be left at the pill there on the other side to look after the boat</div><div id="00:03:15.520" class="transcript_line"> once they went in through the booze up and then come back.</div><div id="00:03:20.520" class="transcript_line"> And they would also, with the boat they would go upstream as well and there&#039;s a per-but, I can&#039;t remember the name of it but there&#039;s a per-what&#039;s it called?</div><div id="00:03:32.520" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it wasn&#039;t unusual for them to travel around the estuary for their fun and having a drink and meeting other fishermen.</div><div id="00:03:44.520" class="transcript_line"> It was a different time.</div><div id="00:03:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Ron, well Ron will get up to another story.</div><div id="00:03:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Bob Leonard and Pete Leonard were fishermen in my day.</div><div id="00:04:00.520" class="transcript_line"> Their father Grant Lee also fished.</div><div id="00:04:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Grant Lee was a bit of a character. Bob used to say he liked a beer, he liked a butcher, a coalman, sort of everything really, jack of all trades but also a fisherman.</div><div id="00:04:17.520" class="transcript_line"> When Grant Lee died, on the day he died, there used to be a path from Blackrock through to Port Scud and Subrock.</div><div id="00:04:25.520" class="transcript_line"> You could get a car along before the cliff all fell in.</div><div id="00:04:29.520" class="transcript_line"> They were taking Grant Lee&#039;s coffin along the cliff path there.</div><div id="00:04:35.520" class="transcript_line"> I always think of it as Grant Lee&#039;s last fish because as they were going across up the path they looked over to what we call the salmon pools and there was a fish kicking up in the pool.</div><div id="00:04:46.520" class="transcript_line"> Bob said he looked at Pete, Pete looked at Bob and Pete had run back to the house, got his waders and his net and went down and picked the fish up on the day Grant Lee&#039;s been gone.</div><div id="00:05:00.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:05:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what a good story.</div><div id="00:05:05.520" class="transcript_line"> I told you the one about Bob and the...</div><div id="00:05:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Prince Philip?</div><div id="00:05:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Prince Philip, yeah, I told you that.</div><div id="00:05:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Bob was back in the 50s when my great grandfather caught the monster fish.</div><div id="00:05:20.520" class="transcript_line"> I told you that story.</div><div id="00:05:22.520" class="transcript_line"> He actually said that the following day he went down there and he seen an even bigger fish.</div><div id="00:05:27.520" class="transcript_line"> He said he stood there in the same place, in the hole, just off Subrock, and a fish came through at about half tide and he said the water, as the fish was coming through the shallows,</div><div id="00:05:40.520" class="transcript_line"> was going as high as the top of a Land Rover, sort of, with the power of the fish going through and he reckons that was bigger.</div><div id="00:05:46.520" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a shark.</div><div id="00:05:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that big old fish.</div><div id="00:05:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever found any unusual fish out there?</div><div id="00:05:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the most unusual fish I ever caught out there was a common carp in the 7S tree, which is, you know, only the year of it I&#039;d seen one once and it was on.</div><div id="00:06:09.520" class="transcript_line"> On an occasion that my brother and I had been fishing down the hole, again, down off Subrock, and we caught a salmon.</div><div id="00:06:19.520" class="transcript_line"> We had a salmon with us and we were coming back, part of the boat up in the bay at Black Rock, and we were walking past what we called the pool, and there was a fish moving in the pool.</div><div id="00:06:32.520" class="transcript_line"> I can see the mark of it, sort of a bit of a ripple on the surface.</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> So we opened the net out and jumped in, scooped the fish up, and to my great surprise, at the bottom of the net was a carp about four and a half, five pound.</div><div id="00:06:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not something you would usually get in the 7S tree, but at that time we were having torrential rain, constant torrential rain, and when we were actually fishing in the S tree,</div><div id="00:07:00.520" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d be stood mid-channel and looking back upstream to the old bridge and it would just be like a forest with the amount of wood washed out of the rivers.</div><div id="00:07:11.520" class="transcript_line"> There was so much wood being washed out, so much fresh water coming into the S tree.</div><div id="00:07:18.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was just hundreds and hundreds of trees and branches and, you name it, it was in the beer garden tables.</div><div id="00:07:26.520" class="transcript_line"> So what had happened there was a fish somewhere along the line had been washed out of a river.</div><div id="00:07:32.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s someone&#039;s pond.</div><div id="00:07:35.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit of the most unusual fish I&#039;ve ever seen out there.</div><div id="00:07:38.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve seen porpoise out there, you know, whilst we&#039;ve been going fishing.</div><div id="00:07:43.520" class="transcript_line"> Seals, seals have come through one day. I wasn&#039;t actually fishing, but there were three or four of them stood in what we call the gut.</div><div id="00:07:51.520" class="transcript_line"> There was a massive seal that went through there, sort of, we don&#039;t know how much water it got through there, I don&#039;t know, but it went between the fishermen.</div><div id="00:07:59.520" class="transcript_line"> Then it was as big as the fishermen as well, it was huge.</div><div id="00:08:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:03.520" class="transcript_line"> But we often see a seal out there during the season.</div><div id="00:08:09.520" class="transcript_line"> I noticed there was somebody put something up on one of your Facebook posts and it was a woman talking about nets at Camp Road or something.</div><div id="00:08:20.520" class="transcript_line"> She, I can&#039;t remember the name of the woman.</div><div id="00:08:23.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she bought my great-grandfather&#039;s, my grandparents&#039; house, 13 Camp Road, which I say back in the day was called HQ.</div><div id="00:08:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And there had always been laid nets at the back, sort of left there.</div><div id="00:08:41.520" class="transcript_line"> And when they bought the house, there must have been a couple of old nets left there.</div><div id="00:08:45.520" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, the back kitchen was where they brought the fish and put them in a tin bath.</div><div id="00:08:52.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s enough back in the day.</div><div id="00:08:55.520" class="transcript_line"> But the back of that garden comes out onto the sub rock camp and then it was a short walk down for them down onto the cliff, down onto what we call the Winkle Beds.</div><div id="00:09:06.520" class="transcript_line"> The Winkle Beds, which is a little reef just basically right in front of the house sort of thing in the estuary.</div><div id="00:09:16.520" class="transcript_line"> So you were going Winkle Picking then?</div><div id="00:09:18.520" class="transcript_line"> Winkle Bed, no.</div><div id="00:09:21.520" class="transcript_line"> There were Winkles there, not in any great quantities when I was a kid.</div><div id="00:09:25.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you did see the shells and you could, if you wanted to, guess, but I&#039;ve never done it.</div><div id="00:09:29.520" class="transcript_line"> But somebody at some point in time must have collected Winkles down there.</div><div id="00:09:34.520" class="transcript_line"> The pollution situation down there was so bad, I can&#039;t imagine in the 60s and 70s anybody would want to eat a Winkle.</div><div id="00:09:41.520" class="transcript_line"> Is that because the ship building nearby?</div><div id="00:09:44.520" class="transcript_line"> No, it was the paper mill discharge point was not too far from there.</div><div id="00:09:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And that area was heavily polluted, very heavily polluted.</div><div id="00:09:52.520" class="transcript_line"> And you had Britannia Sink in the estuary opposite.</div><div id="00:09:55.520" class="transcript_line"> I read a book recently, a MacGreen piecebook, and it recommended that basically you don&#039;t eat the fish.</div><div id="00:10:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Or if you did, you don&#039;t eat very much of it.</div><div id="00:10:07.520" class="transcript_line"> You know, sort of the, you know, the cellulose flounders, things that live in the estuary, shellfish, daffodil would be a big no-no.</div><div id="00:10:14.520" class="transcript_line"> I was speaking to somebody last week and his great-grandfather used to climb the cliffs that overlook the Wye towards Chepstone.</div><div id="00:10:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Towards Chepstone for seagulls eggs. Did anyone ever do that?</div><div id="00:10:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was my great-grandfather William Corbyn.</div><div id="00:10:33.520" class="transcript_line"> Their family is from Chepstone and he got his nickname Nester from his habit of climbing the cliffs in Chepstone collecting seagulls eggs.</div><div id="00:10:44.520" class="transcript_line"> And he used to do that and also used to dive or jump off the old rowey bridge, crossing the Wye as well.</div><div id="00:10:52.520" class="transcript_line"> He also with Nester, William Corbyn, my great-grandfather, there&#039;s a rock named after him out in what we call the hole.</div><div id="00:11:04.520" class="transcript_line"> And Nester&#039;s rock is the name of the rock and all it is really is a small rock about three foot by three foot, 18 inches high.</div><div id="00:11:17.520" class="transcript_line"> And he was quite short, he was perhaps, I don&#039;t know exactly, five foot four, five foot five, a worry little fella.</div><div id="00:11:30.520" class="transcript_line"> And he would always be last out of the boat and he would always stand on that rock because it just allowed him to get out of the boat a little bit earlier.</div><div id="00:11:39.520" class="transcript_line"> When you start fishing the water is sort of up to the top of your chest where you just put it.</div><div id="00:11:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Nester&#039;s rock and that rock is named after him.</div><div id="00:11:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you know anything about the fisheries that are downstream like Goldcliff?</div><div id="00:11:54.520" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t know a huge amount about them really. They were mainly basket fisheries.</div><div id="00:12:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And by that do you mean like putcher?</div><div id="00:12:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Putchers, yeah, conical baskets originally made from willow and hazel.</div><div id="00:12:15.520" class="transcript_line"> There will be hundreds of baskets in some ranks set to a scaffold usually facing the ebb tide.</div><div id="00:12:23.520" class="transcript_line"> They aren&#039;t set on a slight incline and the salmon swim in, they&#039;ve got no reverse gear, they can&#039;t get back out.</div><div id="00:12:30.520" class="transcript_line"> The tide goes out and the fisherman comes along and collects the catch.</div><div id="00:12:34.520" class="transcript_line"> The ones in sort of recent times, not recent times, in memory then, the Undy putcher rank, the Porton putcher rank and the Goldcliff putcher rank.</div><div id="00:12:47.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s three main ones.</div><div id="00:12:49.520" class="transcript_line"> And they know that the Undy rank was, what happened there was that the number of baskets was reduced down to 150 baskets,</div><div id="00:13:01.520" class="transcript_line"> perhaps in the 60s by the Natural Rivers Authority and it became uneconomic to use.</div><div id="00:13:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Porton, I&#039;m not sure when that closed, but Goldcliff closed in 1995, bought out by Anglin Interests and the Environment Agency, but closed down, all never to return.</div><div id="00:13:26.520" class="transcript_line"> The other basket fishery was not salmon fishery, it was putts or kipes.</div><div id="00:13:33.520" class="transcript_line"> They were medieval baskets fished in groups of perhaps six, seven, eight and they were used to catch white fish made from hazeln and willow as well in three sections.</div><div id="00:13:46.520" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the four wheel, I can&#039;t remember the names of them, but a kite or putt was used to catch white fish and shrimp.</div><div id="00:13:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Same thing applies with face the ebb tide, the fish pushed in by the tide and then the fish will come along at low tide when they&#039;re dry and take the end basket off and take the catcher.</div><div id="00:14:10.520" class="transcript_line"> We found baskets buried in the clay that are kipes and putts or these things at hundreds if not a thousand years old on the estuary.</div><div id="00:14:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Just amazing. Did you ever lay eel traps on the reams?</div><div id="00:14:29.520" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. We&#039;ve never trapped fish in the reams, but as a kid we would catch stiltbacks and eels and newts and the like in the reams. They seemed to be a lot cleaner back then.</div><div id="00:14:44.520" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve never seen locally anybody trap fish like that.</div><div id="00:14:49.520" class="transcript_line"> We used to fish, as kids we&#039;d go fishing in the in the in the pills we used to call them sort of San Pierre pill was a good one, sort of very natural sort of pill.</div><div id="00:15:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Not been evened out, scraped out, it was just like a meandering sort of brook really, but still a pill.</div><div id="00:15:15.520" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d fish with a rod and line for you get flounders and little eels and things up in those.</div><div id="00:15:22.520" class="transcript_line"> The only other fishing we really done sort of, you know, obviously rod and line fishing, but we&#039;d also go congering years ago, sort of out on the bedwinds at low tide.</div><div id="00:15:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And that involved walking out to rocky areas in the estuary with a bar, iron bar and poking it under a rock, rattling the rock about and then hopefully there&#039;d be an eel under there.</div><div id="00:15:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come out and you&#039;d take it and kill it at the table.</div><div id="00:15:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Into an egg?</div><div id="00:15:53.520" class="transcript_line"> No, just that it would wriggle out onto the stones, onto the shingle or whatever and you&#039;d just dump him on the head and take him out.</div><div id="00:16:02.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have to be quick wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:16:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Once they&#039;re out there they&#039;ve got nowhere to go.</div><div id="00:16:07.520" class="transcript_line"> Right, they&#039;re really quick.</div><div id="00:16:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Is a conger eel different to an eel?</div><div id="00:16:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Just bigger generally.</div><div id="00:16:16.520" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t get those up in the reams then?</div><div id="00:16:19.520" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, not in a ream. You&#039;d have a green eel, what you&#039;d call a green eel, and silver reels, hidden reams and alvers, live in reams.</div><div id="00:16:29.520" class="transcript_line"> But do you know that reams, they&#039;re very unique to this area, aren&#039;t they really?</div><div id="00:16:34.520" class="transcript_line"> So is it something as a kid, young children did, they just played in around the reams?</div><div id="00:16:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I think they would.</div><div id="00:16:41.520" class="transcript_line"> Were there many reams? Do they have different names?</div><div id="00:16:43.520" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t think of any names from reams at all. It would just be pills.</div><div id="00:16:49.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all the reams run out of the pills then into the estuary.</div><div id="00:16:56.520" class="transcript_line"> As far as the Black Rock, Lavenette fishing grounds go in the surrounding areas, I mean you&#039;ve got San Pierre pill, and reams would run into that.</div><div id="00:17:11.520" class="transcript_line"> The pill is the outlet to the estuary, isn&#039;t it? But the reams run into the pill.</div><div id="00:17:16.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got what we call little pill, again, reams run into that.</div><div id="00:17:21.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got Calicot pill.</div><div id="00:17:26.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you might have got, after that, no sorry, going back that way again towards Chepstow you&#039;ve got Mathen pill.</div><div id="00:17:36.520" class="transcript_line"> So west of the sub-rook you&#039;ve got Calicot pill, Collister pill, and then Magor pill.</div><div id="00:17:44.520" class="transcript_line"> Might be a couple more further west again. But basically all the reams run into those, and that&#039;s the end left of the estuary.</div><div id="00:17:50.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite interesting, Calicot pill, when the, what was it, the Troggy River, Troggy, T-R-O-W-G-Y, was diverted.</div><div id="00:18:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t ask me when. Then it was diverted into Calicot pill.</div><div id="00:18:10.520" class="transcript_line"> And Calicot pill runs out across the foreshore, through the seawall, and then out across the mud to the black bed winds.</div><div id="00:18:23.520" class="transcript_line"> And then empties a mile offshore into a fishing place we call the Luby, which is a pretty popular,</div><div id="00:18:33.520" class="transcript_line"> it used to be a popular, a pretty popular fishing place.</div><div id="00:18:36.520" class="transcript_line"> Out there you&#039;ve got various gullies that used to be used for fishing, for whitefish.</div><div id="00:18:44.520" class="transcript_line"> One is called the cannibal gut. And cannibal gut, gut is a name we use for a channel basically.</div><div id="00:18:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Is that G-U-T-T? Yeah, G-U-T, just gut.</div><div id="00:18:56.520" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the channel used for, we fish in.</div><div id="00:19:00.520" class="transcript_line"> And that cannibal gut, we call that the cannibal gut because it&#039;s about the only area on the estuary we find cannibals, obviously.</div><div id="00:19:08.520" class="transcript_line"> So hence the cannibal gut. You find cannibals? Yeah, lots of cannibals out there.</div><div id="00:19:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Really? When we were kids we tried to carry them back and sort of get halfway back and just dump them.</div><div id="00:19:18.520" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, there&#039;s two sizes, one&#039;s just behind you there, there&#039;s two behind me.</div><div id="00:19:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god. We&#039;re not sure if a ship sunk or if it was, we just don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:19:32.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one specific area covering five or six hundred meters, sort of where there&#039;s cannibals.</div><div id="00:19:40.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing. Do you ever find the remains of old boats or anything like that?</div><div id="00:19:44.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s one, the John, that was run aground on gruggy rocks in, I think it was 1942.</div><div id="00:19:52.520" class="transcript_line"> She was, I think carrying coal, wrecked on the rocks.</div><div id="00:19:58.520" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s well broken up now, but you can still identify the riveted construction, the portals, the chain.</div><div id="00:20:06.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh. We found a wooden boat or parts of a wooden boat in the sands, on the Bedwind Sands.</div><div id="00:20:16.520" class="transcript_line"> It was out there recently actually and she&#039;s covered up again.</div><div id="00:20:20.520" class="transcript_line"> You put that on Facebook, didn&#039;t you? Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:24.520" class="transcript_line"> You can just see the keel. No, no, no, that was a rib, we found that was just a rib.</div><div id="00:20:30.520" class="transcript_line"> It is on Facebook somewhere, but that was just a rib we found.</div><div id="00:20:36.520" class="transcript_line"> I was walking out there and I found a rib of a boat.</div><div id="00:20:40.520" class="transcript_line"> But also in another spot, there&#039;s a wooden boat, plenty of iron on it, sort of the brackets that&#039;s what we first spotted.</div><div id="00:20:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Went back out there and then more of the boat had been exposed, but a few weeks ago she&#039;d been covered up again.</div><div id="00:20:59.520" class="transcript_line"> So things on the sands, it&#039;s constantly changing.</div><div id="00:21:03.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a shifting sand type there, isn&#039;t it? Yeah, it changes every day.</div><div id="00:21:06.520" class="transcript_line"> It depends which way the wind is blowing.</div><div id="00:21:08.520" class="transcript_line"> And part of the fishing is keeping an eye on things every season.</div><div id="00:21:13.520" class="transcript_line"> We like going out there, not all of us, but there&#039;s three or four of us that spend quite a bit of time out there.</div><div id="00:21:20.520" class="transcript_line"> We look after it, make sure there&#039;s no netting and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:21:25.520" class="transcript_line"> But of interest is things you find.</div><div id="00:21:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Clay pipes, Roman pottery, all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:21:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just people are going out there forever.</div><div id="00:21:38.520" class="transcript_line"> A couple of weeks ago, it was quite funny really.</div><div id="00:21:45.520" class="transcript_line"> I was out there and I found a pelvic, like a bonesy pelvis sort of thing.</div><div id="00:21:52.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re joking.</div><div id="00:21:54.520" class="transcript_line"> I found a few things and I was carrying it around.</div><div id="00:21:58.520" class="transcript_line"> So I got back to the car and I found, I think it&#039;s something to do with target practice on airplanes, but again I put it on Facebook.</div><div id="00:22:12.520" class="transcript_line"> And I sent two photographs to one of the boys.</div><div id="00:22:16.520" class="transcript_line"> We got like a WhatsApp thing for photographs.</div><div id="00:22:20.520" class="transcript_line"> So I sent it to him.</div><div id="00:22:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t pick these up.</div><div id="00:22:24.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s afternoon.</div><div id="00:22:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, within 15 minutes, Matthew, one of them, come back.</div><div id="00:22:32.520" class="transcript_line"> He sent me some pictures.</div><div id="00:22:35.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s human.</div><div id="00:22:37.520" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m looking at these pictures now and I&#039;m looking at the bone and the sockets and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:22:43.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s weird, Martin.</div><div id="00:22:45.520" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:22:46.520" class="transcript_line"> What are you doing?</div><div id="00:22:47.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m looking at it.</div><div id="00:22:49.520" class="transcript_line"> So I found, we got in contact with one of the Coast Guard guys.</div><div id="00:22:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Richard, he always wants, if you find a bomb, he wants to know and stuff like this.</div><div id="00:22:58.520" class="transcript_line"> He keeps them in work.</div><div id="00:23:01.520" class="transcript_line"> So I said, Rich, I think, I&#039;m not sure I said, but one of the boys has just sent me a picture.</div><div id="00:23:06.520" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve just phoned somebody.</div><div id="00:23:07.520" class="transcript_line"> They might be human.</div><div id="00:23:10.520" class="transcript_line"> He said, right.</div><div id="00:23:11.520" class="transcript_line"> He said, well, do you want us to come down now?</div><div id="00:23:13.520" class="transcript_line"> I said, no.</div><div id="00:23:14.520" class="transcript_line"> He said, not tonight.</div><div id="00:23:15.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:23:16.520" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t have the police up my house.</div><div id="00:23:18.520" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d sort it out tomorrow.</div><div id="00:23:20.520" class="transcript_line"> So they come down to Blackrock.</div><div id="00:23:22.520" class="transcript_line"> I brought it down there and they took it off.</div><div id="00:23:24.520" class="transcript_line"> But only yesterday.</div><div id="00:23:25.520" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t say nothing about it.</div><div id="00:23:26.520" class="transcript_line"> But yesterday, he texted and said, it&#039;s not a human remains.</div><div id="00:23:30.520" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s not.</div><div id="00:23:31.520" class="transcript_line"> God knows what it is.</div><div id="00:23:33.520" class="transcript_line"> It is then.</div><div id="00:23:34.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be a big, big cow or something.</div><div id="00:23:36.520" class="transcript_line"> A sheep or something.</div><div id="00:23:38.520" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:23:39.520" class="transcript_line"> No, you wouldn&#039;t, would you?</div><div id="00:23:41.520" class="transcript_line"> And the more you looked at the pictures, it looked...</div><div id="00:23:44.520" class="transcript_line"> You were convinced.</div><div id="00:23:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we all...</div><div id="00:23:47.520" class="transcript_line"> And Matthew then texted me.</div><div id="00:23:49.520" class="transcript_line"> He was still out there.</div><div id="00:23:51.520" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ve got it in the back of the car.</div><div id="00:23:53.520" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ve been carrying it around for now.</div><div id="00:23:55.520" class="transcript_line"> And he said, how big is it?</div><div id="00:23:58.520" class="transcript_line"> And I put a tape on it when I got home.</div><div id="00:24:02.520" class="transcript_line"> And I sent it in the measurements.</div><div id="00:24:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And I woked it off my phone, but it was absolutely comical.</div><div id="00:24:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Matthew was a big lump.</div><div id="00:24:12.520" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s there in his kitchen now.</div><div id="00:24:14.520" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s measuring it.</div><div id="00:24:17.520" class="transcript_line"> And then he said, I think it&#039;s human.</div><div id="00:24:20.520" class="transcript_line"> The way he said it.</div><div id="00:24:22.520" class="transcript_line"> See, that thing&#039;s just...</div><div id="00:24:24.520" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, a day in the life of somebody.</div><div id="00:24:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen bodies out there?</div><div id="00:24:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Richard found one, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Richard found Derek Upton.</div><div id="00:24:32.520" class="transcript_line"> He found two.</div><div id="00:24:33.520" class="transcript_line"> He found one on the way.</div><div id="00:24:34.520" class="transcript_line"> He was canoeing, kayaking up the way.</div><div id="00:24:36.520" class="transcript_line"> And he came across one.</div><div id="00:24:38.520" class="transcript_line"> And he phoned the coast guard.</div><div id="00:24:41.520" class="transcript_line"> And they sent Sarah out.</div><div id="00:24:43.520" class="transcript_line"> And they said, can you hold on to it?</div><div id="00:24:45.520" class="transcript_line"> He said he&#039;s drifting away.</div><div id="00:24:47.520" class="transcript_line"> So you have to sort of catch hold of it with a stick or something.</div><div id="00:24:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, dear.</div><div id="00:24:52.520" class="transcript_line"> And then, a few years back now, Richard was...</div><div id="00:24:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Derek Upton, I don&#039;t know if you heard of him.</div><div id="00:24:57.520" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a big guy.</div><div id="00:24:59.520" class="transcript_line"> He was involved with a lot of the findings out there.</div><div id="00:25:02.520" class="transcript_line"> He was kind of like a pill fella.</div><div id="00:25:04.520" class="transcript_line"> And he used to take the archaeologists out there.</div><div id="00:25:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Sort of off Goldcliff.</div><div id="00:25:10.520" class="transcript_line"> They found these footprints and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:25:13.520" class="transcript_line"> And he spent a lot of time out there.</div><div id="00:25:15.520" class="transcript_line"> He knew it like the back of his hand.</div><div id="00:25:18.520" class="transcript_line"> Like if you were arrested.</div><div id="00:25:20.520" class="transcript_line"> And he don&#039;t know what happened.</div><div id="00:25:22.520" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t know the personal side of it.</div><div id="00:25:24.520" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, eventually he went down there.</div><div id="00:25:26.520" class="transcript_line"> He shot himself.</div><div id="00:25:28.520" class="transcript_line"> So he shot himself down on the foreshore.</div><div id="00:25:32.520" class="transcript_line"> And I think they found the rifle.</div><div id="00:25:35.520" class="transcript_line"> But they couldn&#039;t find his body.</div><div id="00:25:37.520" class="transcript_line"> So they searched around a bit for it.</div><div id="00:25:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Sent a few search parties down there for a week or so.</div><div id="00:25:44.520" class="transcript_line"> And no sign of him.</div><div id="00:25:46.520" class="transcript_line"> They just assumed he&#039;d gone.</div><div id="00:25:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, my brother was down there doing what we do, I think.</div><div id="00:25:51.520" class="transcript_line"> And he found the body.</div><div id="00:25:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t have a mobile.</div><div id="00:25:57.520" class="transcript_line"> So we walked up to the phone box.</div><div id="00:26:00.520" class="transcript_line"> Said he found the body.</div><div id="00:26:02.520" class="transcript_line"> And within seconds he was like, please guess.</div><div id="00:26:05.520" class="transcript_line"> A grim discovery though.</div><div id="00:26:07.520" class="transcript_line"> That must impact on him a bit.</div><div id="00:26:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Not very nice.</div><div id="00:26:13.520" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, Richard, when we was talking to him.</div><div id="00:26:16.520" class="transcript_line"> He said there&#039;s still, when we set up the pelvic bone.</div><div id="00:26:19.520" class="transcript_line"> He said there&#039;s still three or four in the cabinet for us.</div><div id="00:26:23.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s people jumping off the bridges all over the place.</div><div id="00:26:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Did people jump off the bridge?</div><div id="00:26:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh God, yeah. All the time.</div><div id="00:26:30.520" class="transcript_line"> What, the Seven Bridge?</div><div id="00:26:32.520" class="transcript_line"> No, the other one generally.</div><div id="00:26:34.520" class="transcript_line"> I think he said about the Clifton Bridge.</div><div id="00:26:37.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if they put barriers up on the Clifton.</div><div id="00:26:40.520" class="transcript_line"> They try and stop people jumping off.</div><div id="00:26:42.520" class="transcript_line"> But they don&#039;t publicise it anymore.</div><div id="00:26:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Because it happens quite often.</div><div id="00:26:47.520" class="transcript_line"> It puts it in people&#039;s minds, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:50.520" class="transcript_line"> I had no idea that happened.</div><div id="00:26:52.520" class="transcript_line"> People are jumping off every day, but it&#039;s several a year.</div><div id="00:26:55.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very sad. Desperate people must feel to do that.</div><div id="00:26:59.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is sad.</div><div id="00:27:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Changing subject.</div><div id="00:27:04.520" class="transcript_line"> What about knots? Were you taught knots?</div><div id="00:27:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Because you were using your boat in your morgue.</div><div id="00:27:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Obviously to knit the nets.</div><div id="00:27:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Using the sheet bend to knit the nets.</div><div id="00:27:20.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re using a sheet bend.</div><div id="00:27:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Sheet bend.</div><div id="00:27:24.520" class="transcript_line"> As in bed sheet.</div><div id="00:27:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Knitting the net around the wand and the needle and everything.</div><div id="00:27:30.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s basically as far as late net fishing.</div><div id="00:27:34.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only knot you need to know.</div><div id="00:27:37.520" class="transcript_line"> Because I got an interest in boats.</div><div id="00:27:40.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean bow lines and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:27:43.520" class="transcript_line"> Clove hitches.</div><div id="00:27:45.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s part of it.</div><div id="00:27:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Boating.</div><div id="00:27:50.520" class="transcript_line"> About women. Did you ever get women to knit fish?</div><div id="00:27:53.520" class="transcript_line"> No, never.</div><div id="00:27:55.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not a reason why they couldn&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:27:58.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not a reason why they couldn&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:28:01.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never known anybody, not a woman, do that.</div><div id="00:28:05.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:28:07.520" class="transcript_line"> What about words that go with the area?</div><div id="00:28:10.520" class="transcript_line"> The estuary, the black rock, the levels.</div><div id="00:28:13.520" class="transcript_line"> Any particular words that, like you said about the guts for example?</div><div id="00:28:17.520" class="transcript_line"> Well yeah, I mean there&#039;s the monkey temp.</div><div id="00:28:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Which is behind a reef that&#039;s behind that hole.</div><div id="00:28:26.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s quite an interesting story with that.</div><div id="00:28:32.520" class="transcript_line"> What year it would have been I just don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:28:34.520" class="transcript_line"> But around war time, sort of that time.</div><div id="00:28:38.520" class="transcript_line"> Four soldiers stole the boat from the fishermen.</div><div id="00:28:44.520" class="transcript_line"> And they tried to get a couple of girls from the village to sort of go in the boat with them.</div><div id="00:28:52.520" class="transcript_line"> And in the end the girls didn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:28:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Anyway the soldiers went off in the boats.</div><div id="00:28:59.520" class="transcript_line"> And the guests from the bay.</div><div id="00:29:02.520" class="transcript_line"> And rode out into the estuary.</div><div id="00:29:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And landed on what they call the monkey temp.</div><div id="00:29:08.520" class="transcript_line"> At lower tide.</div><div id="00:29:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Got out of the boats.</div><div id="00:29:16.520" class="transcript_line"> Started to walk around the reef, the island.</div><div id="00:29:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t secure the boat.</div><div id="00:29:21.520" class="transcript_line"> The tide started to come back in and wash the boat away.</div><div id="00:29:25.520" class="transcript_line"> And Bob used to say that if they watched them, they couldn&#039;t do nothing.</div><div id="00:29:32.520" class="transcript_line"> So the tide came in and people were saying, get another boat, go and get them.</div><div id="00:29:39.520" class="transcript_line"> They just sort of said, too late.</div><div id="00:29:42.520" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:29:43.520" class="transcript_line"> Too late, they couldn&#039;t get to them.</div><div id="00:29:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Because the tide is so strong?</div><div id="00:29:47.520" class="transcript_line"> Because the tide is coming in so fast.</div><div id="00:29:49.520" class="transcript_line"> And they just watched them.</div><div id="00:29:51.520" class="transcript_line"> How awful.</div><div id="00:29:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god.</div><div id="00:29:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Drammed all of them.</div><div id="00:29:55.520" class="transcript_line"> All of them lost.</div><div id="00:29:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Was it called monkey temp before that?</div><div id="00:30:00.520" class="transcript_line"> No, we don&#039;t know where the name monkey temp came from.</div><div id="00:30:03.520" class="transcript_line"> But generally the monkey temp comes up.</div><div id="00:30:06.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an indication of the time when you start to see the monkey temp come up in the distance.</div><div id="00:30:12.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when you set off from the bay to go to the hole in the boat to start fishing.</div><div id="00:30:19.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another stone out there called, just again close to the hole.</div><div id="00:30:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Called the sugar cube.</div><div id="00:30:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Sugar cube.</div><div id="00:30:27.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a big, massive square rock.</div><div id="00:30:30.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two ways of getting out to the fishing.</div><div id="00:30:33.520" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re going to fish a grand stand in the hole.</div><div id="00:30:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And that was either by boat and you&#039;re looking for the monkey temp coming up.</div><div id="00:30:43.520" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re wading from the shore outwards, you stand on the edge of the water as the tide is going out.</div><div id="00:30:51.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you start to see the top of the sugar cube up here.</div><div id="00:30:55.520" class="transcript_line"> As the tide is ebbing.</div><div id="00:30:57.520" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as the top of that stone starts to show, that&#039;s when you&#039;re starting to wade out.</div><div id="00:31:03.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for all the time.</div><div id="00:31:06.520" class="transcript_line"> So you know exactly the right signs and timings.</div><div id="00:31:09.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re reading it all the time, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:31:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:13.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s certain things you look for all the time.</div><div id="00:31:15.520" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re fishing out in Gruggy, which is mid-channel, close to the main shipping channel.</div><div id="00:31:24.520" class="transcript_line"> You can get cut off quite easily.</div><div id="00:31:26.520" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re on foot, you&#039;re going to drown if you don&#039;t come back at the right time.</div><div id="00:31:31.520" class="transcript_line"> So what you&#039;re looking for is the tide rising in the shipping channel.</div><div id="00:31:38.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what you do.</div><div id="00:31:39.520" class="transcript_line"> People, if you&#039;re looking around you, you think the tide is not coming in.</div><div id="00:31:42.520" class="transcript_line"> But what we do is pick out black.</div><div id="00:31:45.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re looking for black.</div><div id="00:31:46.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what they say.</div><div id="00:31:47.520" class="transcript_line"> Look for the black, which is stone.</div><div id="00:31:51.520" class="transcript_line"> So as the tide is ebbing, you can imagine, you get a rock shot.</div><div id="00:31:58.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you wait a little bit longer.</div><div id="00:32:01.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you look beyond that for another rock.</div><div id="00:32:04.520" class="transcript_line"> And then another rock will start to show.</div><div id="00:32:06.520" class="transcript_line"> And you keep looking beyond and beyond and beyond.</div><div id="00:32:08.520" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re looking down into the shipping channel.</div><div id="00:32:11.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;re looking around.</div><div id="00:32:14.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you look glanced back.</div><div id="00:32:16.520" class="transcript_line"> And that rock is gone.</div><div id="00:32:18.520" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the only indication you&#039;ve got that the tide is coming in.</div><div id="00:32:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Because you can&#039;t see around you, where you&#039;ve come from, to the east or the west.</div><div id="00:32:27.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re just looking at that.</div><div id="00:32:28.520" class="transcript_line"> So when the tide is starting to rise now,</div><div id="00:32:31.520" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s your first indication of you&#039;ve got to be thinking of leaving.</div><div id="00:32:35.520" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re reading that all the time?</div><div id="00:32:37.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:38.520" class="transcript_line"> The most important thing is safety.</div><div id="00:32:41.520" class="transcript_line"> And they say if you see a fish at the end,</div><div id="00:32:45.520" class="transcript_line"> when the time comes to leave, you leave.</div><div id="00:32:47.520" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t sort of hang about.</div><div id="00:32:49.520" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re constantly reading the water, looking at the turn of the tide.</div><div id="00:32:54.520" class="transcript_line"> And when I was a kid, I mean, you could actually hear it.</div><div id="00:32:58.520" class="transcript_line"> I can always remember, I&#039;m going back a long time, but...</div><div id="00:33:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Before the bridges?</div><div id="00:33:03.520" class="transcript_line"> Before the bridges.</div><div id="00:33:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Before the bridge.</div><div id="00:33:05.520" class="transcript_line"> If you hear the bridge now, you can hear the drone and the traffic.</div><div id="00:33:08.520" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes it&#039;s a lot worse than that in the fishing areas.</div><div id="00:33:12.520" class="transcript_line"> You can be stood in the hole and fishing,</div><div id="00:33:15.520" class="transcript_line"> and I could be there with my eyes closed,</div><div id="00:33:17.520" class="transcript_line"> and I would know exactly when to come back.</div><div id="00:33:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Because not only are you looking, I would know exactly when to come back.</div><div id="00:33:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Because what happens in the estuary is that when the tide starts to flood,</div><div id="00:33:28.520" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t sort of just pour in straight away.</div><div id="00:33:31.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s as if you reach a sort of a level.</div><div id="00:33:34.520" class="transcript_line"> The tide starts to rise and rise and rise and rise,</div><div id="00:33:37.520" class="transcript_line"> and then it reaches a point and it goes...</div><div id="00:33:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Like that, and it starts to come in.</div><div id="00:33:42.520" class="transcript_line"> So, as long as it&#039;s flowing, flowing out,</div><div id="00:33:46.520" class="transcript_line"> you will always hear the water going over the rocks.</div><div id="00:33:50.520" class="transcript_line"> All right? So you&#039;re listening.</div><div id="00:33:52.520" class="transcript_line"> So if you were blind, you couldn&#039;t see, you would hear it.</div><div id="00:33:56.520" class="transcript_line"> That ripple in, that water going over the rocks.</div><div id="00:34:00.520" class="transcript_line"> When everything becomes equal,</div><div id="00:34:03.520" class="transcript_line"> for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, there&#039;s no noise.</div><div id="00:34:09.520" class="transcript_line"> So you know then, just before it&#039;s going to tip.</div><div id="00:34:13.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:34:15.520" class="transcript_line"> So that sense was heightened even more so when the bridge wasn&#039;t there.</div><div id="00:34:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, exactly.</div><div id="00:34:20.520" class="transcript_line"> You could hear it much better.</div><div id="00:34:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a definite sort of thing that you would listen for.</div><div id="00:34:27.520" class="transcript_line"> The turn of the tide sort of thing.</div><div id="00:34:30.520" class="transcript_line"> But with the background noise, that&#039;s sort of lost now.</div><div id="00:34:34.520" class="transcript_line"> If you really, really sort of listen for it, you can...</div><div id="00:34:38.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was, like you say, well defined and sort of before the bridge was there.</div><div id="00:34:44.520" class="transcript_line"> So this is your chance now to tell me anything I haven&#039;t asked.</div><div id="00:34:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Or also what this place means to you.</div><div id="00:34:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, the fishing.</div><div id="00:34:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Black rock.</div><div id="00:34:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Black rock, it means everything to me.</div><div id="00:35:00.520" class="transcript_line"> It really does. It&#039;s sort of...</div><div id="00:35:03.520" class="transcript_line"> Had I not been taken out fishing when I was a kid,</div><div id="00:35:06.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean none of this would be here.</div><div id="00:35:09.520" class="transcript_line"> I never thought it at the time that I&#039;d ever be here,</div><div id="00:35:13.520" class="transcript_line"> all these years trying to hang on to the fishing.</div><div id="00:35:17.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a massive part of my life sort of thing now.</div><div id="00:35:21.520" class="transcript_line"> And who would have ever thought it?</div><div id="00:35:25.520" class="transcript_line"> It was tetra on the brink of going.</div><div id="00:35:28.520" class="transcript_line"> And the hard work that I put in, my brothers put in, the other fishermen have put in.</div><div id="00:35:34.520" class="transcript_line"> And sort of it just means everything to me, really.</div><div id="00:35:39.520" class="transcript_line"> And I just hope it stays forever.</div><div id="00:35:44.520" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, a massive part of my life.</div><div id="00:35:47.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s become more so as I&#039;ve got older.</div><div id="00:35:50.520" class="transcript_line"> When you appreciate things that have, you know...</div><div id="00:35:54.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a material world, but some things are worth more than money.</div><div id="00:35:59.520" class="transcript_line"> And this is a gift to me, really.</div><div id="00:36:04.520" class="transcript_line"> When the fishing time comes, you can&#039;t think of anything else, really.</div><div id="00:36:10.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like drawn.</div><div id="00:36:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Like the moon draws and the sun controls the tides, the drag.</div><div id="00:36:19.520" class="transcript_line"> The tide, you sort of get drawn to the estuary as well.</div><div id="00:36:24.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a massive part.</div><div id="00:36:27.520" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;d be lost without it, but it would be a crying shame if it went.</div><div id="00:36:33.520" class="transcript_line"> It really would.</div><div id="00:36:35.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no reason for it to go.</div><div id="00:36:37.520" class="transcript_line"> We have no effect on stock at all.</div><div id="00:36:39.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m proud of the way things are now.</div><div id="00:36:42.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s become not just a big thing for me, it&#039;s become a big thing for the village, the county, everything.</div><div id="00:36:50.520" class="transcript_line"> I could never have imagined how things would have turned out.</div><div id="00:36:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Heritage fishery, tourist attraction, I suppose.</div><div id="00:37:04.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve given a lot back to Mormon ship, one way or another, and Wales.</div><div id="00:37:13.520" class="transcript_line"> It does really mean everything to me.</div><div id="00:37:16.520" class="transcript_line"> It really does.</div><div id="00:37:18.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing else I&#039;d rather be doing, really, than leave the estates.</div><div id="00:37:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:37:26.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only been quite emotional.</div><div id="00:37:29.520" class="transcript_line"> It is, I mean, it is.</div><div id="00:37:33.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite an emotional subject, really.</div><div id="00:37:35.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot to lose.</div><div id="00:37:38.520" class="transcript_line"> We fought hard to keep it, and we&#039;re still fighting even now.</div><div id="00:37:43.520" class="transcript_line"> Who knows?</div><div id="00:37:45.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s out of my hands.</div><div id="00:37:47.520" class="transcript_line"> What will be will be.</div><div id="00:37:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Watch this space.</div><div id="00:37:52.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll give it your best shot next week.</div><div id="00:37:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we do.
