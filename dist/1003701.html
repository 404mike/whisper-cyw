another marketing survey,</div><div id="00:00:08.320" class="transcript_line"> but it is traditional at this point in the program</div><div id="00:00:12.360" class="transcript_line"> to recognize people who&#039;ve traveled some distances</div><div id="00:00:16.200" class="transcript_line"> to come and be with us today.</div><div id="00:00:18.520" class="transcript_line"> So first of all, would the people from Portland</div><div id="00:00:22.040" class="transcript_line"> or other points in Oregon please stand and be recognized?</div><div id="00:00:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s give them a round of applause.</div><div id="00:00:29.720" class="transcript_line"> Now, I know that we&#039;ve got people here from Vancouver also.</div><div id="00:00:39.520" class="transcript_line"> Would they please stand?</div><div id="00:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> British Columbia, yes.</div><div id="00:00:54.800" class="transcript_line"> We have people here from Victoria.</div><div id="00:00:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Would they please stand?</div><div id="00:00:59.720" class="transcript_line"> Hey, good job.</div><div id="00:01:07.320" class="transcript_line"> Now, we also have people from California.</div><div id="00:01:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Could they please stand?</div><div id="00:01:19.240" class="transcript_line"> Any other states?</div><div id="00:01:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Anybody here from Wales?</div><div id="00:01:35.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean more recently than that.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> We covered Algeria.</div><div id="00:01:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Algeria.</div><div id="00:01:49.360" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:01:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Now, I think the next thing is the announcements.</div><div id="00:01:54.200" class="transcript_line"> And I have several announcements here.</div><div id="00:01:58.400" class="transcript_line"> First of all, I understand Sally Brinkley,</div><div id="00:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> the president of the Victoria Welsh Society,</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> would like to say a few words.</div><div id="00:02:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Sally here?</div><div id="00:02:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Ah, there she is.</div><div id="00:02:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Sally, do you want to come up front,</div><div id="00:02:14.240" class="transcript_line"> or can you do it from there?</div><div id="00:02:15.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how to say it.</div><div id="00:02:16.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:02:19.240" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re so glad that you&#039;re here.</div><div id="00:02:22.240" class="transcript_line"> We knew all the people from the Florida Society.</div><div id="00:02:27.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re very sorry that you missed your last announcement.</div><div id="00:02:30.520" class="transcript_line"> But please, we&#039;re strangers.</div><div id="00:02:32.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to take you off the road.</div><div id="00:02:34.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:02:35.520" class="transcript_line"> But we know that you have a very lovely family.</div><div id="00:02:39.520" class="transcript_line"> And I hope next year we&#039;ll give you a journey.</div><div id="00:02:42.520" class="transcript_line"> But maybe you&#039;ll come over to join us in a photographic</div><div id="00:02:45.520" class="transcript_line"> trip on our barbecue.</div><div id="00:02:48.520" class="transcript_line"> That would be in July.</div><div id="00:02:50.520" class="transcript_line"> And hopefully, six of you are.</div><div id="00:02:53.520" class="transcript_line"> I have one day.</div><div id="00:02:55.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m counting on you to come to see it on our trip.</div><div id="00:02:58.320" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s lovely to see you all.</div><div id="00:03:01.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the word.</div><div id="00:03:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, Sally.</div><div id="00:03:05.320" class="transcript_line"> The next announcement I have is from the Welsh Society of</div><div id="00:03:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Vancouver, B.C.</div><div id="00:03:15.320" class="transcript_line"> They wish to extend a warm and very special invitation to all</div><div id="00:03:19.320" class="transcript_line"> their friends in Seattle to join them in celebrating in June</div><div id="00:03:25.120" class="transcript_line"> 1989, the 60th anniversary of the Cambrian Hall.</div><div id="00:03:29.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on Saturday, June 17th.</div><div id="00:03:32.120" class="transcript_line"> They will have a Norsen Lauen.</div><div id="00:03:34.120" class="transcript_line"> And on Sunday, June 18th, at 11 a.m., a bilingual service</div><div id="00:03:38.120" class="transcript_line"> which will be led by the Reverend Berwyn Roberts.</div><div id="00:03:42.120" class="transcript_line"> There will also be a lunch.</div><div id="00:03:44.120" class="transcript_line"> And then at 2 o&#039;clock, there will be a Gamandagany followed</div><div id="00:03:47.120" class="transcript_line"> by, of course, the Te Ba.</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Next announcement.</div><div id="00:03:51.920" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s going to be a Worldfest 89 at Northgate Mall next</div><div id="00:03:56.920" class="transcript_line"> weekend.</div><div id="00:03:57.920" class="transcript_line"> It used to be called the Ethnic Fair, I believe.</div><div id="00:04:00.920" class="transcript_line"> And the Welsh group is going to participate.</div><div id="00:04:05.920" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re going to have a booth there.</div><div id="00:04:07.920" class="transcript_line"> We need some more volunteers to work at the booth.</div><div id="00:04:09.920" class="transcript_line"> I think there are some sign-up seats here somewhere today.</div><div id="00:04:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Is that correct?</div><div id="00:04:13.920" class="transcript_line"> Anybody have those?</div><div id="00:04:15.920" class="transcript_line"> Kayla Ware had them out front.</div><div id="00:04:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Kayla has them.</div><div id="00:04:20.920" class="transcript_line"> So you can see here after we finish here.</div><div id="00:04:24.920" class="transcript_line"> We would like some volunteers to make Welsh cakes.</div><div id="00:04:27.920" class="transcript_line"> If you know how to do that.</div><div id="00:04:28.920" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t, we do have recipes.</div><div id="00:04:29.920" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re very easy to make.</div><div id="00:04:30.920" class="transcript_line"> Even I can do it.</div><div id="00:04:33.920" class="transcript_line"> One other call for help.</div><div id="00:04:35.920" class="transcript_line"> If you have a pickup or a van, then we could certainly use</div><div id="00:04:40.920" class="transcript_line"> some help to transport our booth to the Worldfest.</div><div id="00:04:43.920" class="transcript_line"> We would need it late Thursday evening or early Friday morning.</div><div id="00:04:47.920" class="transcript_line"> And then we would need it again on Sunday evening to take</div><div id="00:04:49.920" class="transcript_line"> everything back down again.</div><div id="00:04:50.920" class="transcript_line"> So please see Kayla Ware during the tear back if you can help.</div><div id="00:04:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Lots of announcements here.</div><div id="00:04:57.920" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve lost one.</div><div id="00:04:59.920" class="transcript_line"> Here it is.</div><div id="00:05:05.920" class="transcript_line"> May 7th at the Lake City Presbyterian Church here.</div><div id="00:05:09.920" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to have a service where the Corcum Righ is going to</div><div id="00:05:14.920" class="transcript_line"> join with the choir of the Lake City Church and sing together.</div><div id="00:05:18.920" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re singing Mordechristi I believe.</div><div id="00:05:21.920" class="transcript_line"> And what else?</div><div id="00:05:23.920" class="transcript_line"> It will be a very good program.</div><div id="00:05:31.920" class="transcript_line"> I can promise you that.</div><div id="00:05:33.920" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s at 10 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:05:35.920" class="transcript_line"> AM.</div><div id="00:05:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:05:44.920" class="transcript_line"> Did I miss any announcements?</div><div id="00:05:46.920" class="transcript_line"> Anybody got anything else they want to announce?</div><div id="00:05:48.920" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to say if anybody has a young child or a grandchild or</div><div id="00:05:53.920" class="transcript_line"> nephew or niece or child of a friend or any child in their life</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> that they would consider teaching to respond for next year&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:00.920" class="transcript_line"> children of the same.</div><div id="00:06:02.920" class="transcript_line"> Please contact my mother.</div><div id="00:06:05.920" class="transcript_line"> And I want to add, she paid for taking us.</div><div id="00:06:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Got all these songs for me.</div><div id="00:06:09.920" class="transcript_line"> And it might not be serious because we were very proud.</div><div id="00:06:11.920" class="transcript_line"> It was not easy.</div><div id="00:06:12.920" class="transcript_line"> But she got us to teach us.</div><div id="00:06:14.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a wonderful thing to teach these children.</div><div id="00:06:16.920" class="transcript_line"> And if you really want to do it, my mother will help buy a</div><div id="00:06:20.920" class="transcript_line"> tape or whatever else.</div><div id="00:06:21.920" class="transcript_line"> So if you have any children, and I want to add also that these</div><div id="00:06:24.920" class="transcript_line"> children are our future and they&#039;re going to be enjoying the</div><div id="00:06:27.920" class="transcript_line"> future to listen to the things we&#039;ve taught.</div><div id="00:06:29.920" class="transcript_line"> So make the effort if you know anybody who you think you could</div><div id="00:06:31.920" class="transcript_line"> teach these to who might be able to be here next year and join</div><div id="00:06:34.920" class="transcript_line"> one day with them.</div><div id="00:06:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Real children&#039;s choir going on here.</div><div id="00:06:37.920" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:06:38.920" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Martha.</div><div id="00:06:40.920" class="transcript_line"> And now a short commercial break, folks.</div><div id="00:06:45.920" class="transcript_line"> Most people realize that when you put on an event like this,</div><div id="00:06:48.920" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of work going on behind the scenes.</div><div id="00:06:53.920" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, it&#039;s all volunteer.</div><div id="00:06:55.920" class="transcript_line"> But what some people don&#039;t realize is that it does cost</div><div id="00:06:58.920" class="transcript_line"> quite a bit of money to put on an event like this.</div><div id="00:07:01.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not going to bore you with all the details of that,</div><div id="00:07:04.920" class="transcript_line"> but believe me, it does cost quite a bit of money.</div><div id="00:07:07.920" class="transcript_line"> One of the major expenses, not surprisingly, is the program.</div><div id="00:07:11.920" class="transcript_line"> We do ask that you make a donation.</div><div id="00:07:16.920" class="transcript_line"> There will be, the baskets will be passed around while the choir</div><div id="00:07:19.920" class="transcript_line"> sings the obituary to be a rave iced.</div><div id="00:07:23.920" class="transcript_line"> But please, please give generously.</div><div id="00:07:25.920" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t try to make money on this,</div><div id="00:07:27.920" class="transcript_line"> but we do want to cover our expenses so that we can maintain</div><div id="00:07:31.920" class="transcript_line"> a fund so that each year we can put on a gamanba like this.</div><div id="00:07:36.920" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:07:37.920" class="transcript_line"> And now the choir will sing Tadi Arad iced</div><div id="00:07:41.920" class="transcript_line"> while the ushers will pass the collection baskets around.</div></div></p>
