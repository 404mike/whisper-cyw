    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jill Willie and it&#039;s the 20th of February 2019.</div><div id="00:00:05.380" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m here talking to Doreen Price</div><div id="00:00:07.240" class="transcript_line"> at her home in Bringuirada.</div><div id="00:00:10.160" class="transcript_line"> And our aim is to seek out Doreen&#039;s memories</div><div id="00:00:13.500" class="transcript_line"> of the use of Riddikai Ross</div><div id="00:00:16.480" class="transcript_line"> and from there to learn something about the Ross management</div><div id="00:00:20.080" class="transcript_line"> and stories generally in the area.</div><div id="00:00:22.640" class="transcript_line"> And it was in 1947, you said Doreen,</div><div id="00:00:25.920" class="transcript_line"> that your husband&#039;s family bought Riddikai.</div><div id="00:00:29.540" class="transcript_line"> So let&#039;s start now with the description</div><div id="00:00:32.180" class="transcript_line"> of the Ross pasture and particularly that of Riddikai.</div><div id="00:00:37.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:38.180" class="transcript_line"> Whether it&#039;s wet, you know, whether it&#039;s been useful.</div><div id="00:00:41.140" class="transcript_line"> Could you advise?</div><div id="00:00:42.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, it&#039;s beyond improvement</div><div id="00:00:44.540" class="transcript_line"> because it was so flat there.</div><div id="00:00:46.740" class="transcript_line"> You could never drain that, you see, it was too flat.</div><div id="00:00:50.220" class="transcript_line"> But it was a useful as a run with the fields above,</div><div id="00:00:53.820" class="transcript_line"> you see, it was especially for the sheep, mountain sheep,</div><div id="00:00:56.980" class="transcript_line"> they like to wander around,</div><div id="00:00:59.420" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t like to be penned up anywhere.</div><div id="00:01:02.820" class="transcript_line"> So it was a useful place and in the spring,</div><div id="00:01:07.100" class="transcript_line"> they could have some water there, you see,</div><div id="00:01:09.700" class="transcript_line"> in the puddles and things when they were producing milk</div><div id="00:01:12.980" class="transcript_line"> for their lambs.</div><div id="00:01:14.980" class="transcript_line"> So it was a useful piece of ground that way, yes.</div><div id="00:01:18.940" class="transcript_line"> And was it a useful resource</div><div id="00:01:20.980" class="transcript_line"> for a summer grazing cattle tour?</div><div id="00:01:24.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:01:25.540" class="transcript_line"> We used to put the cattle out there beginning of May, say,</div><div id="00:01:29.620" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d feed them for the time.</div><div id="00:01:31.340" class="transcript_line"> But as the millennium grass started to grow,</div><div id="00:01:35.220" class="transcript_line"> it was sweet then, you see.</div><div id="00:01:37.420" class="transcript_line"> And they grazed that, it was nice grazing,</div><div id="00:01:41.900" class="transcript_line"> but once it gets stale, nothing wants to eat it, you see.</div><div id="00:01:45.860" class="transcript_line"> So it was useful that way, yes.</div><div id="00:01:48.780" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:01:49.620" class="transcript_line"> And did you harvest any rushes for animal bedding?</div><div id="00:01:54.900" class="transcript_line"> Not off that, not off that, no.</div><div id="00:01:56.900" class="transcript_line"> What about digging turf or peat for fuel?</div><div id="00:01:59.180" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, we never did that, no.</div><div id="00:02:01.980" class="transcript_line"> Gathering rushes for rush lights?</div><div id="00:02:04.700" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="00:02:05.540" class="transcript_line"> Nothing like that.</div><div id="00:02:06.380" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s right, no.</div><div id="00:02:07.220" class="transcript_line"> What about ponies in summer?</div><div id="00:02:09.380" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, my husband had a riding pony,</div><div id="00:02:12.100" class="transcript_line"> but we never put him out on that, no.</div><div id="00:02:15.940" class="transcript_line"> So, no.</div><div id="00:02:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Now then, what about medicinal properties?</div><div id="00:02:21.620" class="transcript_line"> Was this pasture deemed to have medicinal properties,</div><div id="00:02:26.220" class="transcript_line"> and did you put sickly animals on it to graze?</div><div id="00:02:29.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, definitely not.</div><div id="00:02:30.780" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d want those near to where we lived, you see,</div><div id="00:02:33.300" class="transcript_line"> to look after them, or in the building.</div><div id="00:02:35.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we know we never put a sickly animal out there.</div><div id="00:02:39.780" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:02:41.860" class="transcript_line"> Now, regarding the activities on the Riddikarp Ross,</div><div id="00:02:46.860" class="transcript_line"> how exactly did you organize these activities?</div><div id="00:02:50.500" class="transcript_line"> For instance, were the farms cattle kept indoors</div><div id="00:02:53.580" class="transcript_line"> through the winter?</div><div id="00:02:54.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:55.660" class="transcript_line"> And then?</div><div id="00:02:56.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, and then as the spring developed,</div><div id="00:02:59.860" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d have them outdoors for the summer.</div><div id="00:03:02.220" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:03:05.060" class="transcript_line"> And they stayed all summer, Doreen, did they?</div><div id="00:03:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, not necessarily.</div><div id="00:03:09.260" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d move them to other pastures, you see.</div><div id="00:03:12.220" class="transcript_line"> We wouldn&#039;t keep so many there all the time.</div><div id="00:03:15.420" class="transcript_line"> You know, it would come and go,</div><div id="00:03:16.940" class="transcript_line"> according to how the grass was there, you see.</div><div id="00:03:21.220" class="transcript_line"> So, no, we didn&#039;t keep them there all the time, no, too.</div><div id="00:03:25.140" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:03:25.980" class="transcript_line"> Now, was there any risk attached</div><div id="00:03:28.300" class="transcript_line"> to putting the stock on the Riddikai Ross, for instance?</div><div id="00:03:31.740" class="transcript_line"> Did they get stuck in the bogs?</div><div id="00:03:33.660" class="transcript_line"> Well, the last, well, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:03:37.660" class="transcript_line"> was it three or four years that we had stock there?</div><div id="00:03:42.300" class="transcript_line"> For the first time ever, we had two cows stuck in the bog,</div><div id="00:03:46.420" class="transcript_line"> and never since 1947 until about 2002 or 2003.</div><div id="00:03:55.660" class="transcript_line"> And we had two, one each year,</div><div id="00:03:57.780" class="transcript_line"> and we had to get the fire engine from Raider to get them out.</div><div id="00:04:01.820" class="transcript_line"> Did you really?</div><div id="00:04:02.660" class="transcript_line"> I presume they did a wonderful job.</div><div id="00:04:04.420" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, they do, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:04:07.220" class="transcript_line"> What about diseases, Doreen?</div><div id="00:04:10.900" class="transcript_line"> Did the cattle suffer from fluke, liver fluke, anything?</div><div id="00:04:14.460" class="transcript_line"> No, there was a disease called black water,</div><div id="00:04:19.460" class="transcript_line"> and on odd time, we&#039;d have a cow with that.</div><div id="00:04:23.260" class="transcript_line"> But it was very rare, but I can&#039;t really say</div><div id="00:04:26.300" class="transcript_line"> whether they were grazing there or on another pasture.</div><div id="00:04:30.540" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where they were grazing, you see.</div><div id="00:04:32.740" class="transcript_line"> So, but there was that, that&#039;s what they called it anyway,</div><div id="00:04:38.420" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, too.</div><div id="00:04:39.740" class="transcript_line"> I see, now, regarding the drainage of the Riddikairoas,</div><div id="00:04:45.860" class="transcript_line"> did you drain at all?</div><div id="00:04:47.180" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, you couldn&#039;t drain it,</div><div id="00:04:49.860" class="transcript_line"> it was too flat, you see, going to the stream at the bottom.</div><div id="00:04:53.340" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s a SSSI, you see,</div><div id="00:04:58.620" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t a piece of ground that you could drain.</div><div id="00:05:02.460" class="transcript_line"> It was too flat.</div><div id="00:05:06.380" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:05:07.540" class="transcript_line"> And was the Riddikairoas a lot bigger</div><div id="00:05:11.020" class="transcript_line"> before the forestry came?</div><div id="00:05:13.340" class="transcript_line"> Was there generally more roast pasture</div><div id="00:05:15.740" class="transcript_line"> throughout the district in the past,</div><div id="00:05:18.460" class="transcript_line"> prior to forestry coming?</div><div id="00:05:21.060" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t have thought so.</div><div id="00:05:22.780" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a little bit, you see, over on that goitre</div><div id="00:05:26.940" class="transcript_line"> where you&#039;d cross when you were going with the,</div><div id="00:05:29.980" class="transcript_line"> walking up into the forestry, at the bottom of that neck,</div><div id="00:05:33.500" class="transcript_line"> down next to the brook, there&#039;s a little bit there.</div><div id="00:05:36.300" class="transcript_line"> But no, I can&#039;t say that that made any difference, really.</div><div id="00:05:42.700" class="transcript_line"> I see, yes.</div><div id="00:05:44.340" class="transcript_line"> And so why do you think the roast is still there then, Doreen?</div><div id="00:05:48.540" class="transcript_line"> What reason do you think it&#039;s still there for?</div><div id="00:05:50.860" class="transcript_line"> Is it too difficult to drain?</div><div id="00:05:52.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, that&#039;s right, yes,</div><div id="00:05:53.780" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the natural state of the piece of ground.</div><div id="00:05:57.660" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, you know, like where these boggy places are,</div><div id="00:06:02.740" class="transcript_line"> you know, yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:05.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that the soil is too poor to use there?</div><div id="00:06:12.260" class="transcript_line"> Well, and it&#039;s wet, you see, you wouldn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:06:17.540" class="transcript_line"> you couldn&#039;t improve it in any, you see,</div><div id="00:06:19.660" class="transcript_line"> it isn&#039;t a place you could plough or anything like that,</div><div id="00:06:22.100" class="transcript_line"> you see, to improve it.</div><div id="00:06:23.780" class="transcript_line"> So really, it doesn&#039;t have an awful lot of use,</div><div id="00:06:27.020" class="transcript_line"> you know, is there?</div><div id="00:06:28.660" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, it&#039;s for these certain plants and that,</div><div id="00:06:34.260" class="transcript_line"> they found there was 122 different species</div><div id="00:06:39.460" class="transcript_line"> of plant life on there.</div><div id="00:06:42.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it&#039;s famous for.</div><div id="00:06:45.780" class="transcript_line"> So I would think so.</div><div id="00:06:48.500" class="transcript_line"> And following on from that,</div><div id="00:06:49.980" class="transcript_line"> did you have personal memories of wildlife</div><div id="00:06:54.380" class="transcript_line"> such as lapwings, butterflies?</div><div id="00:06:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, lapwings and curlews used to be out there</div><div id="00:06:59.860" class="transcript_line"> and nested and we did see some wild geese</div><div id="00:07:03.940" class="transcript_line"> with their gullies out there.</div><div id="00:07:06.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, they probably came from Lingwin,</div><div id="00:07:09.540" class="transcript_line"> but we never saw them, I think Mr. Raynard had them before,</div><div id="00:07:14.340" class="transcript_line"> they were able to fly from there.</div><div id="00:07:16.180" class="transcript_line"> We never saw them bigger than good lumps like this,</div><div id="00:07:20.700" class="transcript_line"> you know, yes, but we&#039;ve seen wild geese out there as well.</div><div id="00:07:25.060" class="transcript_line"> But oh yes, and we&#039;d hear the birds singing, you know,</div><div id="00:07:29.180" class="transcript_line"> cause there was quite a few trees there, you know,</div><div id="00:07:31.060" class="transcript_line"> if you walk about now in the spring and summertime,</div><div id="00:07:34.260" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d be in full song out there, yes.</div><div id="00:07:38.660" class="transcript_line"> And do you feel there was more wildlife,</div><div id="00:07:43.340" class="transcript_line"> more plentiful wildlife when you were younger?</div><div id="00:07:46.820" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel there was more wildlife, more flowers,</div><div id="00:07:48.740" class="transcript_line"> more everything?</div><div id="00:07:49.940" class="transcript_line"> Well, we didn&#039;t really study the flowers a lot, you know.</div><div id="00:07:54.940" class="transcript_line"> There used to be those,</div><div id="00:07:57.500" class="transcript_line"> we used to call them golden globes next to that stream,</div><div id="00:08:01.300" class="transcript_line"> well, you&#039;d never see those now,</div><div id="00:08:03.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how they&#039;ve disappeared.</div><div id="00:08:05.260" class="transcript_line"> You see, they were a nice little yellow,</div><div id="00:08:07.980" class="transcript_line"> almost like a big buttercup and it was like a global flower,</div><div id="00:08:13.540" class="transcript_line"> but and king cups and you know, different things like that.</div><div id="00:08:17.140" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, though that sort, and we used to see,</div><div id="00:08:21.020" class="transcript_line"> well, we used to call them shivery shakes,</div><div id="00:08:26.260" class="transcript_line"> they were like a grass with a circular,</div><div id="00:08:32.060" class="transcript_line"> silvery vertical on the top.</div><div id="00:08:34.540" class="transcript_line"> And you see in the wind, they&#039;d fly like that</div><div id="00:08:37.900" class="transcript_line"> and they were shimmering.</div><div id="00:08:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, we never see those now,</div><div id="00:08:41.140" class="transcript_line"> I hadn&#039;t seen those for a long time.</div><div id="00:08:43.420" class="transcript_line"> So how, why they disappeared, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:08:46.700" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:08:47.940" class="transcript_line"> And as we were hearing last night at Raider by Nature,</div><div id="00:08:51.140" class="transcript_line"> hopefully the marsh artillery will make.</div><div id="00:08:53.900" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:08:56.420" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the marsh artillery in your younger days?</div><div id="00:09:00.100" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember those butterflies?</div><div id="00:09:00.940" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t, but do you see,</div><div id="00:09:02.420" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t so much into wildlife then, you see,</div><div id="00:09:05.580" class="transcript_line"> we were farming and looking at animals</div><div id="00:09:07.820" class="transcript_line"> and to see that their wellbeing was all right, you see.</div><div id="00:09:11.820" class="transcript_line"> And if they were lambing,</div><div id="00:09:12.940" class="transcript_line"> we were looking for young lambs and something like that.</div><div id="00:09:16.180" class="transcript_line"> You see, I can&#039;t say that I ever looked really</div><div id="00:09:18.740" class="transcript_line"> for things like that.</div><div id="00:09:20.100" class="transcript_line"> Things like that, not a priority, I suppose,</div><div id="00:09:22.540" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re a busy farmer.</div><div id="00:09:24.100" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s right, no.</div><div id="00:09:25.380" class="transcript_line"> So then.</div><div id="00:09:26.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, we have to ask this question now.</div><div id="00:09:29.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you recall or have you heard stories of children</div><div id="00:09:33.220" class="transcript_line"> playing in the Riddikar-Ross?</div><div id="00:09:35.620" class="transcript_line"> What did they get up to?</div><div id="00:09:36.780" class="transcript_line"> No, well, I didn&#039;t, yeah, but you see,</div><div id="00:09:39.740" class="transcript_line"> like as I say, my husband was grown up before they had,</div><div id="00:09:43.500" class="transcript_line"> they bought that, so you see,</div><div id="00:09:44.940" class="transcript_line"> and I never ever heard him saying anything about that, no.</div><div id="00:09:49.540" class="transcript_line"> So he used to collect birds&#039; eggs, you know,</div><div id="00:09:54.180" class="transcript_line"> when he was young, he got quite a good selection</div><div id="00:09:57.900" class="transcript_line"> at Ashfield and he got them all labeled and everything.</div><div id="00:10:02.460" class="transcript_line"> So, but I mean, you could do it in those days, you see, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:05.500" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:10:07.060" class="transcript_line"> Very nice to have a sort of a hobby like that.</div><div id="00:10:09.140" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:09.980" class="transcript_line"> To have that interest.</div><div id="00:10:10.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:10:13.660" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:10:14.780" class="transcript_line"> Well, Doreen, thanks very much for sharing your experiences</div><div id="00:10:19.420" class="transcript_line"> and your knowledge and your interest in the Riddikar-Ross.</div><div id="00:10:23.700" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure it&#039;s enlightened us quite a lot.</div><div id="00:10:25.740" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:26.580" class="transcript_line"> Many, many thanks.</div><div id="00:10:27.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:30.020" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s all right with you,</div><div id="00:10:31.180" class="transcript_line"> perhaps we could just speak generally</div><div id="00:10:33.420" class="transcript_line"> about your earlier life in Radnorshire,</div><div id="00:10:37.020" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re a Radnorshire lady through and through.</div><div id="00:10:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was born on a farm out in Bister area,</div><div id="00:10:42.860" class="transcript_line"> and I mean miles from everywhere.</div><div id="00:10:46.660" class="transcript_line"> But in our young days, we had to make our own fun, you see.</div><div id="00:10:51.140" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was no television.</div><div id="00:10:52.940" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had a radio,</div><div id="00:10:54.140" class="transcript_line"> but we didn&#039;t used to listen to that much.</div><div id="00:10:56.740" class="transcript_line"> But I can remember my brother,</div><div id="00:10:58.700" class="transcript_line"> there wasn&#039;t a lot of difference</div><div id="00:11:00.140" class="transcript_line"> between my brother and myself.</div><div id="00:11:02.500" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d have an old bicycle, no, no, a rusty thing,</div><div id="00:11:07.700" class="transcript_line"> no tires or anything in it.</div><div id="00:11:09.860" class="transcript_line"> And our yard was a bit of an incline at my home.</div><div id="00:11:13.860" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;d push this,</div><div id="00:11:15.980" class="transcript_line"> push bike up to the top of this incline, get on that.</div><div id="00:11:19.420" class="transcript_line"> There was no brakes or anything on it.</div><div id="00:11:21.940" class="transcript_line"> We used to come down around the corner of the house</div><div id="00:11:24.260" class="transcript_line"> and to stop, we used to go into the manure heap.</div><div id="00:11:28.780" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s one way of stopping, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:11:30.660" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:11:32.300" class="transcript_line"> And another thing, and my brother was very good,</div><div id="00:11:34.780" class="transcript_line"> what he&#039;d call cobbling up things.</div><div id="00:11:37.140" class="transcript_line"> We had a chassis of a pram,</div><div id="00:11:40.380" class="transcript_line"> and he put a piece of board on the chassis</div><div id="00:11:43.740" class="transcript_line"> and a piece of binder twine or something</div><div id="00:11:45.900" class="transcript_line"> to turn the wheels in the front.</div><div id="00:11:48.580" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d ride on this,</div><div id="00:11:50.620" class="transcript_line"> go up the top of the yard again</div><div id="00:11:52.620" class="transcript_line"> and go down as far as we could go.</div><div id="00:11:54.580" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, we wouldn&#039;t go as far on that</div><div id="00:11:56.940" class="transcript_line"> as we would on the old bicycle.</div><div id="00:12:00.620" class="transcript_line"> But you see, we had to make our own fun.</div><div id="00:12:03.300" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember we&#039;d make a playhouse,</div><div id="00:12:07.540" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d have little sticks like that and make little rooms.</div><div id="00:12:11.980" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d go and make mud pies</div><div id="00:12:14.900" class="transcript_line"> for pretending to have tea.</div><div id="00:12:17.020" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d find some old little tins or something</div><div id="00:12:20.620" class="transcript_line"> and put this in and leave them, bake, turn them out.</div><div id="00:12:24.540" class="transcript_line"> That was our way of tea.</div><div id="00:12:27.140" class="transcript_line"> Well, we got to make our own fun.</div><div id="00:12:29.100" class="transcript_line"> And then as soon as we were able to do little jobs,</div><div id="00:12:32.340" class="transcript_line"> we were always given jobs to do on the farm, you see.</div><div id="00:12:36.300" class="transcript_line"> I can remember my mother, she was very good that way.</div><div id="00:12:40.380" class="transcript_line"> We used to have to carry our water about 100 yards,</div><div id="00:12:44.540" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it might&#039;ve been 150.</div><div id="00:12:46.860" class="transcript_line"> Well, as soon as we were able to,</div><div id="00:12:49.660" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d carry half a bucketful to start with from the well.</div><div id="00:12:54.180" class="transcript_line"> And then as we&#039;d get a bit stronger,</div><div id="00:12:56.700" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d have two half bucketfuls to balance either side.</div><div id="00:13:01.340" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d progress to three quarters of a bucketful.</div><div id="00:13:05.500" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d be able to carry two bucketfuls</div><div id="00:13:08.220" class="transcript_line"> down to the farmhouse.</div><div id="00:13:11.660" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:13:13.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, for those days to return.</div><div id="00:13:15.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:13:17.460" class="transcript_line"> Wouldn&#039;t it be nice?</div><div id="00:13:18.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, we had such a carefree year.</div><div id="00:13:21.180" class="transcript_line"> And then we were, my mother especially,</div><div id="00:13:23.420" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;d learn me to teach me how to iron,</div><div id="00:13:26.540" class="transcript_line"> start off with handkerchiefs.</div><div id="00:13:28.100" class="transcript_line"> And you see, we used to heat the flat iron</div><div id="00:13:32.660" class="transcript_line"> on an open fire, you see.</div><div id="00:13:35.100" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d have a shield to put the iron in.</div><div id="00:13:38.540" class="transcript_line"> Well, she put it all ready for me,</div><div id="00:13:40.300" class="transcript_line"> but she&#039;d encouraged me to iron little things</div><div id="00:13:43.660" class="transcript_line"> on the table, you see.</div><div id="00:13:44.940" class="transcript_line"> And then for rabbits, to get me to skin a rabbit,</div><div id="00:13:49.020" class="transcript_line"> well, a little, like a young one,</div><div id="00:13:51.860" class="transcript_line"> about something three quarters grown.</div><div id="00:13:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was easy to skin then.</div><div id="00:13:57.100" class="transcript_line"> And if I did something, well, she praised me so much,</div><div id="00:13:59.820" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d achieve something if I could do that.</div><div id="00:14:02.580" class="transcript_line"> She was very good at encouraging us</div><div id="00:14:05.900" class="transcript_line"> to do little jobs like that,</div><div id="00:14:07.660" class="transcript_line"> because we were helping them,</div><div id="00:14:08.780" class="transcript_line"> and it was teaching us how to do something</div><div id="00:14:13.180" class="transcript_line"> in the future, you see.</div><div id="00:14:14.740" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:14:15.780" class="transcript_line"> Making you very resourceful, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:14:17.420" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:14:19.500" class="transcript_line"> And then in the harvesting time,</div><div id="00:14:21.060" class="transcript_line"> but I was never very good with the harvest.</div><div id="00:14:24.100" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit of a weekly one,</div><div id="00:14:26.340" class="transcript_line"> and I was a duffer with a pike or a rake, really,</div><div id="00:14:31.060" class="transcript_line"> for raking up, because I wasn&#039;t doing it right,</div><div id="00:14:34.580" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;d have a pain up the side of my head.</div><div id="00:14:37.460" class="transcript_line"> But we used to be able to take out,</div><div id="00:14:39.380" class="transcript_line"> when the men were out on fields,</div><div id="00:14:41.780" class="transcript_line"> we take their tea or their food out for them.</div><div id="00:14:44.860" class="transcript_line"> Well, no flasks in those days.</div><div id="00:14:47.100" class="transcript_line"> We used to make it in bottles.</div><div id="00:14:49.020" class="transcript_line"> Well, the tea would only be lukewarm,</div><div id="00:14:51.220" class="transcript_line"> because otherwise it would be,</div><div id="00:14:53.020" class="transcript_line"> but with milk in it.</div><div id="00:14:54.300" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, that was acceptable,</div><div id="00:14:56.060" class="transcript_line"> and they had that, and we&#039;d take that out for them</div><div id="00:14:59.260" class="transcript_line"> to wherever the hay field was,</div><div id="00:15:01.420" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d eat that,</div><div id="00:15:02.580" class="transcript_line"> and then we&#039;d bring the empties back home with us.</div><div id="00:15:07.100" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:15:08.660" class="transcript_line"> Yes, as you say, a more carefree existence,</div><div id="00:15:11.220" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s the way things were then, I suppose.</div><div id="00:15:12.900" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:15:15.340" class="transcript_line"> Special days in the year,</div><div id="00:15:18.020" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you&#039;ve mentioned Mayfair.</div><div id="00:15:19.860" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:20.700" class="transcript_line"> Were there any particular occasions</div><div id="00:15:22.340" class="transcript_line"> that really stick out in your memory?</div><div id="00:15:25.420" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was, we used to go to Knighton,</div><div id="00:15:27.660" class="transcript_line"> was our market town,</div><div id="00:15:32.660" class="transcript_line"> and Mayfair, there was the 17th of May,</div><div id="00:15:35.460" class="transcript_line"> where we always went there,</div><div id="00:15:37.140" class="transcript_line"> but I never liked Mayfair myself.</div><div id="00:15:40.300" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, it didn&#039;t appeal to me.</div><div id="00:15:42.980" class="transcript_line"> I liked the journey there,</div><div id="00:15:44.420" class="transcript_line"> because we used to go by car,</div><div id="00:15:45.820" class="transcript_line"> and we thought it was such a long way.</div><div id="00:15:50.380" class="transcript_line"> But I never enjoyed Mayfair myself,</div><div id="00:15:53.180" class="transcript_line"> but we&#039;d go on the rides and things, you know,</div><div id="00:15:55.580" class="transcript_line"> but I was always glad to get back home.</div><div id="00:15:59.060" class="transcript_line"> So, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:16:01.980" class="transcript_line"> I remember the Red Mayfair,</div><div id="00:16:03.980" class="transcript_line"> that was May the 12th, of course.</div><div id="00:16:05.580" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:16:08.020" class="transcript_line"> And we used to, I used to go to Sunday school.</div><div id="00:16:11.860" class="transcript_line"> We used to walk to a Baptist Sunday school then,</div><div id="00:16:14.820" class="transcript_line"> because my mother was Stonch Baptist,</div><div id="00:16:16.780" class="transcript_line"> well, and it was the nearest to walk to.</div><div id="00:16:18.940" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d always have a children&#039;s anniversary in the autumn,</div><div id="00:16:22.460" class="transcript_line"> you see, where we&#039;d practice singing,</div><div id="00:16:24.700" class="transcript_line"> or recitations or something.</div><div id="00:16:26.340" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d get up on the platform and do our duties there.</div><div id="00:16:30.300" class="transcript_line"> But that was a special occasion.</div><div id="00:16:34.380" class="transcript_line"> Which Baptist chapel was that then?</div><div id="00:16:36.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the Pound Baptist Chapel.</div><div id="00:16:38.340" class="transcript_line"> The Pound?</div><div id="00:16:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Pound, yes.</div><div id="00:16:40.340" class="transcript_line"> You go up to Lombister,</div><div id="00:16:41.740" class="transcript_line"> and over the top and down the other side.</div><div id="00:16:45.100" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:16:46.380" class="transcript_line"> Is it still a working chapel?</div><div id="00:16:47.820" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, yes, it&#039;s still, yes.</div><div id="00:16:49.980" class="transcript_line"> And they still have an anniversary,</div><div id="00:16:51.940" class="transcript_line"> but I mean, they have about three children</div><div id="00:16:54.380" class="transcript_line"> on the platform now.</div><div id="00:16:56.340" class="transcript_line"> Things have certainly changed.</div><div id="00:16:57.540" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:16:58.380" class="transcript_line"> As far as churches have changed.</div><div id="00:16:59.620" class="transcript_line"> The chapels have concerned, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:17:02.460" class="transcript_line"> And we used to, well, you see, my primary school,</div><div id="00:17:07.220" class="transcript_line"> we could go home for our lunch from where I lived,</div><div id="00:17:10.020" class="transcript_line"> go up to school, it was only about half a mile,</div><div id="00:17:12.700" class="transcript_line"> to walk to the primary school.</div><div id="00:17:15.020" class="transcript_line"> Well then, of course, we never had lunch break.</div><div id="00:17:19.060" class="transcript_line"> You see, by the time we&#039;d walk home and have our dinner,</div><div id="00:17:22.540" class="transcript_line"> and walk back up, it was time to go back into school.</div><div id="00:17:24.300" class="transcript_line"> So we never had any playtime to play with the other children.</div><div id="00:17:28.540" class="transcript_line"> And one bone of contention for me was that mother</div><div id="00:17:33.500" class="transcript_line"> always supplied the school teacher&#039;s wife with milk.</div><div id="00:17:39.820" class="transcript_line"> So much skim milk and so much full fat.</div><div id="00:17:45.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, I got to carry those tins up in the morning.</div><div id="00:17:48.820" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t mind doing it in the morning,</div><div id="00:17:51.060" class="transcript_line"> but coming home at night,</div><div id="00:17:52.780" class="transcript_line"> we could have played with some of the other children,</div><div id="00:17:54.780" class="transcript_line"> but the one was enamel.</div><div id="00:17:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, you see, I got to be very careful with that</div><div id="00:17:59.740" class="transcript_line"> because otherwise I would have chipped it.</div><div id="00:18:02.180" class="transcript_line"> So that, I always hated having to carry those home with me.</div><div id="00:18:07.020" class="transcript_line"> So, yes.</div><div id="00:18:07.860" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we could talk for so long, couldn&#039;t we,</div><div id="00:18:10.020" class="transcript_line"> about days gone by. Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:18:11.340" class="transcript_line"> Bye, yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:18:13.580" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, thank you very, very much indeed, Doreen,</div><div id="00:18:16.740" class="transcript_line"> for your time, for your knowledge,</div><div id="00:18:19.220" class="transcript_line"> and for sharing your memories with us,</div><div id="00:18:21.900" class="transcript_line"> which allowed us to record.</div><div id="00:18:23.900" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:18:25.540" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ll say thank you very, very much indeed.</div></div></p>
