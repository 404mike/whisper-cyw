    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> yourself okay and tell their names. Okay good afternoon I&#039;m Mrs Christina Roy. Today we are</div><div id="00:00:10.240" class="transcript_line"> going to organize an oral history interview with Mr and Mrs Majumdar for the Wales Puja Committee</div><div id="00:00:21.760" class="transcript_line"> for taking the past memories and the history of heritage of Dugga Puja in Wales. Good afternoon</div><div id="00:00:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Mrs Majumdar. How and when did you get involved in the festival for Wales Puja Committee? Okay I</div><div id="00:00:46.480" class="transcript_line"> think to be honest you know to remember because it&#039;s such a long time ago but as far as I remember</div><div id="00:00:53.240" class="transcript_line"> I got a phone call one day I think from in Cardiff you know there were two gentlemen Mr Goddok and</div><div id="00:01:00.280" class="transcript_line"> I think Mr Shambu Dars all of a sudden they saying that the Bodhi I need you we need your help I said</div><div id="00:01:08.240" class="transcript_line"> what why what sort of help my husband was busy at that time you know he&#039;s a single-handedly</div><div id="00:01:13.880" class="transcript_line"> practitioner he was so unfortunately he was in you know not home so I had to answer the</div><div id="00:01:21.080" class="transcript_line"> phone and everything so he said could you please we&#039;re going to start the Puja in</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff but we need some stuff for the Puja have you got this Kosha Kushi Chandan card all the</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Puja thing you know utensils for Puja, Allah shak all these things so I mentioned whatever I</div><div id="00:01:39.080" class="transcript_line"> got and this decided the day I mentioned that all that was fixed in any way at that time there</div><div id="00:01:46.800" class="transcript_line"> was no committee no meeting nobody only few family the initial started Mr Goddok and Mr Shambu Dars</div><div id="00:01:53.080" class="transcript_line"> but they invited few family I think you will know already you know perhaps Mr. Miseskaw,</div><div id="00:01:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Mishro, Dr. Animesh Dars, Mr. Palit, ourself and Dr. Barsak all this family the only the</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> whole estate and if I were Mr. Mishro I told you so a few family they invited and I think Dr.</div><div id="00:02:21.440" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Haldar whether they were there as well isn&#039;t it Amadar so they were involved in the beginning so</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> few families came and they said that whoever the Bengali or Indian you know you tell them we are</div><div id="00:02:36.400" class="transcript_line"> doing the Puja so instead of family oriented Puja only few families started so we didn&#039;t know anybody</div><div id="00:02:43.480" class="transcript_line"> how is what&#039;s going to be like that and all so whatever I thought I saw the Puja in our house</div><div id="00:02:49.480" class="transcript_line"> in India my mother or grandmother whatever they used to do a Lohi Puja or any other Puja Sharswati</div><div id="00:02:55.480" class="transcript_line"> Puja we had in our house Durga Puja also in our Desh so I remember all the things you know Puja</div><div id="00:03:01.880" class="transcript_line"> fruits cuttings and what sort of things we need five fruits and sweets and things like that so</div><div id="00:03:09.440" class="transcript_line"> that was arranged few people took Shardar but most of all arranging and telling everybody what to do</div><div id="00:03:17.520" class="transcript_line"> not to do those two gentlemen was doing and we are sort of working whatever but it was nice good</div><div id="00:03:23.960" class="transcript_line"> experience and we&#039;re excited that we&#039;re going to have the Puja there and we had the Prithima the</div><div id="00:03:29.840" class="transcript_line"> first one someone came I can&#039;t remember the name the gentleman you might know after what Mr.</div><div id="00:03:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Parth she had a picture a painted picture the first one I think you might have in our old</div><div id="00:03:43.840" class="transcript_line"> pictures that the first Prithima was painted they brought it in parade and we started the Puja there</div><div id="00:03:54.160" class="transcript_line"> first memory what she has done she has jumped few stages yeah but there are other things happen</div><div id="00:04:05.520" class="transcript_line"> yeah whatever is in the school and other things then you can&#039;t get parade like that you have to</div><div id="00:04:12.600" class="transcript_line"> we did series of places then came the back it&#039;s good art come again okay the same so what were</div><div id="00:04:26.120" class="transcript_line"> the major challenges you faced while arranging or organizing the Puja around those times I</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> think the the beginning it was the main factor that when we started finding that you know we</div><div id="00:04:40.640" class="transcript_line"> spent quite a lot of time in the morning and in the evening time the first thing obviously everybody</div><div id="00:04:46.400" class="transcript_line"> gets hungry so food was the main thing factor we get the Prasad fall and fruits and everything</div><div id="00:04:52.480" class="transcript_line"> but gradually we started you know thinking in the evening time a lot of people started coming I</div><div id="00:04:57.400" class="transcript_line"> mean outside Kadi the Bristol Newport so the audience was coming up so then everybody thought</div><div id="00:05:04.560" class="transcript_line"> the collection was also coming up so we thought we better give the order the food and with the</div><div id="00:05:10.880" class="transcript_line"> few family member that we were paying more contribution at that time for the meeting the</div><div id="00:05:15.800" class="transcript_line"> cost so the food was coming and then gradually when the member came quite a lot and we decided</div><div id="00:05:21.960" class="transcript_line"> to you know make up you know the formative committee was formed is the main factor was</div><div id="00:05:27.760" class="transcript_line"> beginning you know the food that started with that then you need money so there how to get</div><div id="00:05:35.040" class="transcript_line"> about that so everybody had a decision ask him community was not formed so easily there are always</div><div id="00:05:49.760" class="transcript_line"> a controversy that and one person I don&#039;t want to name he doesn&#039;t like the committee so</div><div id="00:06:02.360" class="transcript_line"> he said no we are doing puja and we are collecting money everything they let the people come and</div><div id="00:06:13.040" class="transcript_line"> enjoy it and whatever confidence and this is only we will control not the committee</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> so whether there is issues of money then the some or other that gentleman is gone out and then came</div><div id="00:06:37.680" class="transcript_line"> to other people they said yes there is a committee to be formed and especially Dr.</div><div id="00:06:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Banerjee was came without how can you and how you can handle public money and the public has</div><div id="00:06:54.440" class="transcript_line"> every right to know how you spend that money so you will have to give a chart after the puja</div><div id="00:07:01.240" class="transcript_line"> and let them see what you have spent so everybody thought it was a very rational and reasonable</div><div id="00:07:08.800" class="transcript_line"> judgment so some or other the conquevers and that&#039;s it so what collecting the money what would</div><div id="00:07:22.800" class="transcript_line"> you think like the money came through like did all the members put in the money or was there a</div><div id="00:07:28.720" class="transcript_line"> policy to get money in our fund whatever we got the fund at the end you will see there was always</div><div id="00:07:39.880" class="transcript_line"> a deficit so we managed the deficit ourselves so at the end they decided that you you better go</div><div id="00:07:50.440" class="transcript_line"> everybody&#039;s house and collect the money initially you can see that who are the people who has much</div><div id="00:07:59.480" class="transcript_line"> interest in the puja and come with a much more reverence and what you call Bhakti they are the</div><div id="00:08:08.760" class="transcript_line"> people they are with us so we go first and then you go other people so we started so we form a</div><div id="00:08:18.680" class="transcript_line"> group three or four four or five and in the car they will go and the response was that nearly 50</div><div id="00:08:29.560" class="transcript_line"> 50 I don&#039;t want to say anymore because few checks are bounced so so we don&#039;t want anymore</div><div id="00:08:39.880" class="transcript_line"> and somebody may say by check I can&#039;t see it finally any check book so these are the experience</div><div id="00:08:48.680" class="transcript_line"> we had somebody said well next hour another puja is our puja that is number of three their food is</div><div id="00:08:57.800" class="transcript_line"> better than yours so no so these are the experience we had and we have to say when you get your check</div><div id="00:09:06.800" class="transcript_line"> book we&#039;ll come again so this is our experience but there are people who lavishly give the money</div><div id="00:09:15.560" class="transcript_line"> without any question so there is a two contrast between the two anyway this was the collection</div><div id="00:09:24.440" class="transcript_line"> started but at the end when our fund has grown up gradually and people are coming and coming only</div><div id="00:09:33.200" class="transcript_line"> 20 people started now there is 50 60 70 80 people then he said we stop collection let them come and</div><div id="00:09:44.560" class="transcript_line"> whoever like to give money collection of the whole yeah so that&#039;s and we should appoint</div><div id="00:09:53.280" class="transcript_line"> chairman vice chairman account accountant there is a controversy whether you should</div><div id="00:10:02.560" class="transcript_line"> appointed accountant some says there is no need the treasurer will do the job both and you must</div><div id="00:10:10.200" class="transcript_line"> show that that there is account to be shown to the public and let the public have the say in the</div><div id="00:10:21.400" class="transcript_line"> annual general meeting then the conception of the registration of the</div><div id="00:10:33.040" class="transcript_line"> friends one or two friends they started with solicitor and with a discussion with him but</div><div id="00:10:53.560" class="transcript_line"> ultimately it was rejected in the car the registration of the sink in Liverpool they said that it doesn&#039;t</div><div id="00:11:02.560" class="transcript_line"> comply with the regulations and others so it can&#039;t be registered then at the time one member of that</div><div id="00:11:11.800" class="transcript_line"> committee died and that is lost work to me was that I can&#039;t do it and I&#039;m going now in</div><div id="00:11:23.360" class="transcript_line"> within that hospital so you take this charge and do the registration as you can so I said well when</div><div id="00:11:33.840" class="transcript_line"> you fail how can I how can I do it how can I do these things all right then I I took it and he</div><div id="00:11:44.200" class="transcript_line"> died next day then I thought very much then I went to the country so much they registered then</div><div id="00:11:56.680" class="transcript_line"> the other those who were registered I took a note from them these are the way to proceed and then</div><div id="00:12:04.440" class="transcript_line"> same solicitor then I invited Dr Sharma and we had a meeting in our house here number of times</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and again with the row mr. Rowan row solicitor&#039;s name Roger Walter he said oh well it can&#039;t be</div><div id="00:12:30.960" class="transcript_line"> done I said yes it can be done this is the way to go through so he had a thought about it and he then</div><div id="00:12:39.320" class="transcript_line"> he corrected all the forms and applications and everything then there is a covenant that you got</div><div id="00:12:46.680" class="transcript_line"> to pay contribution to any earthquake already anything you got to show that you have given them</div><div id="00:12:55.440" class="transcript_line"> and you want to show cultural things something cultural going on and you must keep accounting</div><div id="00:13:03.600" class="transcript_line"> or accounts and then it will be passed then ultimately passed. Ask a question. I think the</div><div id="00:13:13.440" class="transcript_line"> constitution here I think we told already about constitution all the things here okay I know the</div><div id="00:13:19.480" class="transcript_line"> committee was formed after a while but did you have to form a new constitution to run the</div><div id="00:13:25.800" class="transcript_line"> When the this question of charity when arose and deeply we thought about it the first important</div><div id="00:13:36.960" class="transcript_line"> part of the charity in the registered office in Liverpool they will ask the constitution so we</div><div id="00:13:45.680" class="transcript_line"> got to run up constitution and as Sandeep has said the meeting was first arranged in our house</div><div id="00:13:58.080" class="transcript_line"> and we started drawn up all the process and back to this solicitor and then we sent to Liverpool</div><div id="00:14:10.280" class="transcript_line"> for their consideration. Okay we are starting now. How do you think Durga Puja and festival</div><div id="00:14:19.160" class="transcript_line"> has evolved over the period? As you know the lot of people come from UK and other parts of the country</div><div id="00:14:29.720" class="transcript_line"> like Middle East and others they didn&#039;t have much place to go there and offer their offerings to</div><div id="00:14:38.800" class="transcript_line"> God and this is the place they find apart from London Liverpool Glasgow they&#039;re too far from</div><div id="00:14:46.560" class="transcript_line"> them so they came with their own mind that after all God will bless me if I attain and if I get</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> some holy water then it will be prosperous in my life but that is the fall and everybody some</div><div id="00:15:09.280" class="transcript_line"> friends have gone there and attended the puja they liked it very much they attended Pushpanjali they</div><div id="00:15:15.600" class="transcript_line"> attend prasad and meet so many people introduce themselves and they go back and to their place</div><div id="00:15:24.440" class="transcript_line"> and talk to other friends but have you seen all this yes we will also go with you this is the way</div><div id="00:15:32.520" class="transcript_line"> it evolved. So what do you think brought the group together and were like able to hold together now</div><div id="00:15:42.360" class="transcript_line"> like how it&#039;s been able to sustain till now? Because the group has developed a confidence and</div><div id="00:15:52.480" class="transcript_line"> strength in their mind that after all the God is there and God will bring us together this is the</div><div id="00:16:03.040" class="transcript_line"> main theme not that the so many people coming introducing ourselves and making friends and</div><div id="00:16:10.560" class="transcript_line"> go up is not that it is not seeing the prithima and the image of the prithima and all the</div><div id="00:16:20.160" class="transcript_line"> paraphernalia of the offering and anjuli and then home then the fire after the puja and putting</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> fire on the head these all the things evolved and joined together harmoniously rather than anything</div><div id="00:16:42.520" class="transcript_line"> else no criticize to each other no nothing no this is the main thing and after that whatever you</div><div id="00:16:50.160" class="transcript_line"> think. Would you like to comment anything about the overall feeling about the festival?</div><div id="00:16:57.080" class="transcript_line"> My feeling is this the puja will prosper you cannot stop I cannot stop it is God who will</div><div id="00:17:07.200" class="transcript_line"> move the wheel over the head and doing everything in their own way so that the people come and give their</div><div id="00:17:16.160" class="transcript_line"> offerings and to them and she or he will bless us that is she is there on the heaven and the</div><div id="00:17:29.080" class="transcript_line"> come for one day in a ostomy and they look each other what we are doing that is the</div><div id="00:17:38.880" class="transcript_line"> conception people come and offering their medications and everything and puja and</div><div id="00:17:48.280" class="transcript_line"> anjuli and that is the way people are coming and coming and also you can see the other part of</div><div id="00:18:00.160" class="transcript_line"> this cultural side lot of people like songs lot of people like dance lot of people like chandalika</div><div id="00:18:09.520" class="transcript_line"> and all these things they never seen this ago in UK I can see what a great pleasure that is the</div><div id="00:18:17.440" class="transcript_line"> Ravindra sumi and not only that the puja brings all the big artists from different parts of</div><div id="00:18:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Calcutta or any other parts and they hear their songs they enjoy themselves and that is the cultural</div><div id="00:18:32.120" class="transcript_line"> part side of it and not least good food food to morning and lunchtime and night that is a great</div><div id="00:18:45.400" class="transcript_line"> enjoyment and all are ready-made and hot they say oh lovely food we are getting that is also</div><div id="00:18:54.240" class="transcript_line"> attraction that&#039;s it are there any other things which you would like to share yeah that you</div><div id="00:19:00.320" class="transcript_line"> want to come back again on it here so would you like to comment anything else on all your overall</div><div id="00:19:08.480" class="transcript_line"> feelings about the festival within Kharif yeah I think as I said it before you know the you</div><div id="00:19:16.440" class="transcript_line"> heard the first part of that how we struggle but gradually when we had a lot of member came in</div><div id="00:19:21.520" class="transcript_line"> youngster got interested then the committee was formed everybody got there took their</div><div id="00:19:29.920" class="transcript_line"> responsibility doing the frame but then one person had to do a lot of thing so the variety</div><div id="00:19:36.120" class="transcript_line"> program was nice the we have a catering officer who talked about good things and doing that</div><div id="00:19:43.360" class="transcript_line"> obviously it&#039;s a group activity not individual so everybody worked very hard I wouldn&#039;t say</div><div id="00:19:49.640" class="transcript_line"> on that gradually gradually it&#039;s sort of homo shape and main thing we kept it one thing that</div><div id="00:19:59.240" class="transcript_line"> will do the puja as we have done the religious part should be kept it wasn&#039;t the change you</div><div id="00:20:05.640" class="transcript_line"> know that religious part was done the same but we added doing the cultural program and encouraging</div><div id="00:20:12.040" class="transcript_line"> the children to take the part they are also took the responsibility and the decorations and all</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> a different activity which they more interested you know then to take part otherwise they would</div><div id="00:20:26.200" class="transcript_line"> have been bored so those are thing you know gradually gradually we sort of people thought</div><div id="00:20:32.280" class="transcript_line"> how to improve the committee&#039;s activity to part in it so the youngster came up so the older people</div><div id="00:20:40.480" class="transcript_line"> also little bit took little bit backside but they were there to give the advice through the</div><div id="00:20:46.080" class="transcript_line"> double collection in the hall came up money came up now now we can it&#039;s nice to see that</div><div id="00:20:52.560" class="transcript_line"> committee going stronger people are more interested outside of Cardiff I think in Cardiff people</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> outside of Cardiff when we see the picture in computer people phone from London we saw you in</div><div id="00:21:05.400" class="transcript_line"> the puja that&#039;s nice to know it&#039;s coming up and all this so that at that time we think that few</div><div id="00:21:13.080" class="transcript_line"> family worked very hard beginning that&#039;s why we kept the puja going and it&#039;s now rewarding to see</div><div id="00:21:19.600" class="transcript_line"> the younger generation is following keeping our tradition and I hope at least you know they won&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:26.520" class="transcript_line"> forget about the puja part as much as they can I know you have to time to time with the time you</div><div id="00:21:32.560" class="transcript_line"> might have to change something perhaps the time exact time we can&#039;t do but as long as we can keep</div><div id="00:21:38.800" class="transcript_line"> some of the parties right then I think people won&#039;t lose the interest you know that&#039;s the main</div><div id="00:21:44.760" class="transcript_line"> part of the younger generation now to keep it together not to have a division anymore what I</div><div id="00:21:51.040" class="transcript_line"> find myself that I always used to tell that to be a good committee member that you always must</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> think that we must agree to be thought to you know to have a disagreement if we agree on that</div><div id="00:22:05.640" class="transcript_line"> point everybody will have to be agreeing in all point you know but we have a right to disagree</div><div id="00:22:11.560" class="transcript_line"> some of the point and contribute our you know comment on that keeping in mind that we are all</div><div id="00:22:18.640" class="transcript_line"> doing voluntary job it&#039;s not a big job so we shouldn&#039;t bring any conflict in ourselves</div><div id="00:22:24.120" class="transcript_line"> whenever we are there in the puja committee meeting or doing about the puja everybody giving</div><div id="00:22:29.440" class="transcript_line"> their time free everybody thinking about the puja nobody is paid it&#039;s not a paid worker so</div><div id="00:22:35.040" class="transcript_line"> nobody blamed to every one of the people if somebody fight is wrong very politely they said</div><div id="00:22:40.640" class="transcript_line"> that if I were you I would do like that not commenting criticizing and backbiting I think</div><div id="00:22:47.600" class="transcript_line"> that is now got to think that if we want to keep up going on next 20 years to what we have done</div><div id="00:22:53.720" class="transcript_line"> before we should learn from our mistake I know we haven&#039;t done all correct things we have learned</div><div id="00:22:59.480" class="transcript_line"> from our mistake every year to year how to improve the thing how to you know get the sweet how to</div><div id="00:23:05.560" class="transcript_line"> cut the cost-cutting thing when we started cooking our food on premises we started saving money</div><div id="00:23:12.160" class="transcript_line"> previously we used to pay the money for the caterer but a lot of money then remember thought</div><div id="00:23:17.800" class="transcript_line"> how to collect the money so this sort of thing came up and now the people are thinking they&#039;re</div><div id="00:23:24.200" class="transcript_line"> thinking how to improve the youngster doing the same thing now the computer age has come is much</div><div id="00:23:29.880" class="transcript_line"> easier previously we used to pay a lot of phone charges phone call we invited people to our own</div><div id="00:23:36.400" class="transcript_line"> phone call so we also paid a lot of money from our own but we didn&#039;t think about that we thought</div><div id="00:23:41.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re doing something you know that for our own enjoyment and that is I think kept us going on</div><div id="00:23:49.040" class="transcript_line"> which we I think there were some good day bad days but well at the end you know to see mother</div><div id="00:23:56.880" class="transcript_line"> got still in Cardiff and now new images being formed new image coming up to the put him up being</div><div id="00:24:02.120" class="transcript_line"> built and the card for the children&#039;s you know this country&#039;s children also know you were all</div><div id="00:24:08.320" class="transcript_line"> working very hard for the school project it&#039;s nice to see and I&#039;m sorry we are getting older</div><div id="00:24:14.360" class="transcript_line"> obvious that we can&#039;t help physically be there but I think we have done our share and I think we</div><div id="00:24:20.760" class="transcript_line"> should leave it to the younger people and I always salute and I always respect what is there doing</div><div id="00:24:25.640" class="transcript_line"> because I we can&#039;t do now much so we shouldn&#039;t resize but at least we can say time to time</div><div id="00:24:33.040" class="transcript_line"> whatever we feel better sort of notice advice I&#039;d say that if you feel it will be nice or if I see</div><div id="00:24:41.200" class="transcript_line"> something going wrong I can politely say that that liberty should be that should be given to the</div><div id="00:24:47.320" class="transcript_line"> older generation I mean younger people think that all the world they are gone the we won&#039;t take</div><div id="00:24:53.720" class="transcript_line"> their advice that shouldn&#039;t be that would be for the younger generation part that that the older</div><div id="00:24:58.600" class="transcript_line"> generation are there if they need some any advice they have to give it they because their</div><div id="00:25:04.200" class="transcript_line"> experience is important whoever maybe who have worked very hard I know this is how the</div><div id="00:25:10.600" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Chaudhary is not the number five and number 11 I wanted to say that Mrs. Chaudhary they are</div><div id="00:25:18.240" class="transcript_line"> the people who are there in the beginning they also very hard with us so I&#039;m sure they will be</div><div id="00:25:24.040" class="transcript_line"> so all the members were not there that doctor I said either not there this is a Mrs. Acharya</div><div id="00:25:32.280" class="transcript_line"> I said you will be managing the energy body all the members were really in the beginning they</div><div id="00:25:37.400" class="transcript_line"> quite hard who just write and advise and working and Dr. Shambhu Pata passed away who else now</div><div id="00:25:44.220" class="transcript_line"> our friend I think we&#039;ll mention after and Shambhu Pata I said Dr. Shambhu Pata that one he was our</div><div id="00:25:52.040" class="transcript_line"> member so he worked and he passed away so all the members who were there Dr. Ganguly was the</div><div id="00:25:58.480" class="transcript_line"> beginning and the member not long he stayed actively but he was also the founder member one</div><div id="00:26:04.720" class="transcript_line"> of the Mr. Siendars they were all not actively but in the beginning they all passed away so</div><div id="00:26:11.120" class="transcript_line"> with you know you always remember them and whoever did it little bit of contribution I think we</div><div id="00:26:16.880" class="transcript_line"> should remember I think we all are human being obviously we&#039;ll have a different opinion everything</div><div id="00:26:23.800" class="transcript_line"> but at least we will try and that is my prayer to everybody pray to God that everybody in Bengali</div><div id="00:26:30.680" class="transcript_line"> group should not only Bengali group or Indian group here they will sort of share their views and</div><div id="00:26:37.800" class="transcript_line"> walk together that is the only thing that&#039;s the way to prosper I think whatever we are doing and</div><div id="00:26:43.680" class="transcript_line"> we are doing we are doing very well so I hope we haven&#039;t got any complaint on that I hope</div><div id="00:26:49.880" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll stay a few years more to enjoy your festivity the things you do that&#039;s all I think</div><div id="00:26:56.880" class="transcript_line"> that I would say at the end number 11 anything else you like to talk about yeah number five</div><div id="00:27:13.120" class="transcript_line"> is the what major challenges you faced while arranging or organizing puja the these challenges</div><div id="00:27:27.000" class="transcript_line"> are really very controversial as we are very old and afraid and we can&#039;t do physically lot of work</div><div id="00:27:38.400" class="transcript_line"> for the puja which we did before lot of challenges and criticism come and to say a few words what</div><div id="00:27:52.480" class="transcript_line"> challenges are coming major challenges those who are religious and Brahmin and doing puja they are</div><div id="00:28:03.200" class="transcript_line"> telling why you were out the we do person to do vogue we do that&#039;s not our sastra that not our</div><div id="00:28:14.760" class="transcript_line"> sastra written that they will go I said look don&#039;t criticize this thing we short of people we can&#039;t</div><div id="00:28:22.720" class="transcript_line"> get any people and she&#039;s religious she comes and does these things so forget about it no we can&#039;t</div><div id="00:28:31.360" class="transcript_line"> forget these things second thing is this again they said that their widow why you allow in the</div><div id="00:28:38.880" class="transcript_line"> presence to touch the bit and the ingredients and all the pots and everything I said there they came</div><div id="00:28:50.680" class="transcript_line"> they they offered their offerings so the religious people also forget about this with a mature and</div><div id="00:28:58.600" class="transcript_line"> intelligent judgment you will have to proceed and console them that forget these things these are</div><div id="00:29:07.000" class="transcript_line"> the these we listen as long as all are offering our puja in the same manner so let them do it they are</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> also human being unfortunate their widow so you can&#039;t send them there you can&#039;t do it you just</div><div id="00:29:25.480" class="transcript_line"> you put a fight shall you with a black border and side one side don&#039;t touch any and make</div><div id="00:29:34.160" class="transcript_line"> matrimonial affair don&#039;t touch it because this is auspicious the war auspicious doesn&#039;t come here</div><div id="00:29:41.560" class="transcript_line"> so forget this thing so these are the preliminary challenge we always listen and console them in a</div><div id="00:29:51.320" class="transcript_line"> proper way so that we could work together in a harmonious way and sustain these things so</div><div id="00:29:59.400" class="transcript_line"> that it can continue for a long long time and now the 11th anything else you like to talk about</div><div id="00:30:08.520" class="transcript_line"> well as Krishna you always you mentioned about the venue venue we talked time and again some</div><div id="00:30:19.520" class="transcript_line"> people are willing to give quite a bit of fun to buy land but land is not the only answer you</div><div id="00:30:30.960" class="transcript_line"> will have to prepare the whole building then comes it and their building is done then electricity</div><div id="00:30:40.640" class="transcript_line"> then rate rain then the priest who will where you stay these are all these things come sing and</div><div id="00:30:49.760" class="transcript_line"> it is a very difficult task as we see in Indian culture there is a priest and they have been</div><div id="00:30:57.840" class="transcript_line"> permanent they are so all these things are very difficult as so deep says the puja pretty by is</div><div id="00:31:06.920" class="transcript_line"> now been making so the priests come from India they got to think where they will stay where they</div><div id="00:31:17.240" class="transcript_line"> will eat where they will they apart from their journey from going from Calcutta to UK UK to</div><div id="00:31:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Calcutta back all these things suppose they are ill who will stand together and do all these things</div><div id="00:31:33.920" class="transcript_line"> you got to think a lot of things so we love to have some our own venue so we can say that</div><div id="00:31:42.400" class="transcript_line"> well as Pujya Comte has this venue we never had to think separate kitchen separate venue for the</div><div id="00:31:52.400" class="transcript_line"> for the home another kitchen and the long waiting room and stage where the cultural function will</div><div id="00:32:01.760" class="transcript_line"> be dressing changing room from one actor to the other actor so many things in a minute so it is not very easy</div></div></p>
