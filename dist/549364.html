id="00:24:15.300" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:24:17.300" class="transcript_line"> There was my desk, and in the middle then, it was like an old table, and then there was Eileen&#039;s desk.</div><div id="00:24:23.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and that&#039;s right, we had the typewriter there, so I&#039;d work there.</div><div id="00:24:27.300" class="transcript_line"> And I got pictures of me in it, and I&#039;m knitting,</div><div id="00:24:31.300" class="transcript_line"> because I used to have the fortnight of the factory holidays to go down</div><div id="00:24:37.300" class="transcript_line"> and man the phones and see to the mail.</div><div id="00:24:40.300" class="transcript_line"> So, of course, there was nothing else to do, so I&#039;d sit and knit.</div><div id="00:24:44.300" class="transcript_line"> And then I had my holidays in July.</div><div id="00:24:48.300" class="transcript_line"> I was at the fortnight before they did.</div><div id="00:24:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;ll talk to you about that in a minute.</div><div id="00:24:54.300" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted to say, what about toilets and facilities like that?</div><div id="00:24:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was a toilet, and we didn&#039;t have hot water.</div><div id="00:25:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Did we have a geezer?</div><div id="00:25:04.300" class="transcript_line"> Ah, there was a very old geezer then, it went wrong, and he did buy us a new geezer,</div><div id="00:25:09.300" class="transcript_line"> for fashion geezers, for the hot water without hands.</div><div id="00:25:15.300" class="transcript_line"> We had to go in, and there were two toilets and a hand wash basin.</div><div id="00:25:19.300" class="transcript_line"> But then there was nothing to put your towel on,</div><div id="00:25:22.300" class="transcript_line"> so I said, I&#039;m going to buy a roller, and I&#039;m going to get roller towel,</div><div id="00:25:28.300" class="transcript_line"> because I hate towels in a ball lamp.</div><div id="00:25:31.300" class="transcript_line"> So I did that when I went there after a bit.</div><div id="00:25:34.300" class="transcript_line"> And then another thing then, with all our tea things,</div><div id="00:25:39.300" class="transcript_line"> they were using the bottle, and they were using, it was tea then,</div><div id="00:25:44.300" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t tea bags, of course.</div><div id="00:25:46.300" class="transcript_line"> So I got a milk jug, and I got, oh, you would have cups and saucers.</div><div id="00:25:52.300" class="transcript_line"> The boss would have cups and saucers, we did have cups and saucers.</div><div id="00:25:56.300" class="transcript_line"> But then I bought a teapot, and I got tea cozy, I made a tea cozy,</div><div id="00:26:02.300" class="transcript_line"> and I did that.</div><div id="00:26:04.300" class="transcript_line"> Then what else did I do then to try and bring it up to date?</div><div id="00:26:08.300" class="transcript_line"> No, it was very sparse, nothing sort of, no lecturies at all, no.</div><div id="00:26:15.300" class="transcript_line"> So no canteen?</div><div id="00:26:17.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, the boys out there, they had a room, a mess room,</div><div id="00:26:20.300" class="transcript_line"> and we did have, he did have a little portable, not a portable,</div><div id="00:26:24.300" class="transcript_line"> table gas stove, which would strike the match,</div><div id="00:26:29.300" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d go and walk him out to make fees one day.</div><div id="00:26:32.300" class="transcript_line"> You could warm something.</div><div id="00:26:34.300" class="transcript_line"> And then on the top, the boys, did they ever let, no,</div><div id="00:26:38.300" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d buy the kettle on the top, we didn&#039;t let the kettles.</div><div id="00:26:41.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, the boys did not.</div><div id="00:26:45.300" class="transcript_line"> Did the factory floor workers and you used to mix at all?</div><div id="00:26:49.300" class="transcript_line"> I mean, how about Eileen, did she used to mix with you, or did she?</div><div id="00:26:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, Eileen and me, we&#039;d go out to the boys, you know,</div><div id="00:26:57.300" class="transcript_line"> and the foremen then would come in to see and do and want to know</div><div id="00:27:01.300" class="transcript_line"> everything, and they heard foremen.</div><div id="00:27:04.300" class="transcript_line"> And oh, I&#039;d go into the mess room and the lunchtime to them</div><div id="00:27:09.300" class="transcript_line"> because it was quiet then, you see, the machines were all shut off.</div><div id="00:27:14.300" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, but yeah, they were all right, all the boys were all right to me.</div><div id="00:27:21.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:23.300" class="transcript_line"> And there was one in particular, he was like a, what was it?</div><div id="00:27:27.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, Len, he wasn&#039;t a general ham, but he&#039;d do anything.</div><div id="00:27:31.300" class="transcript_line"> If you needed something done, say, oh Len, has something gone wrong now</div><div id="00:27:36.300" class="transcript_line"> with the latch on the door, and oh, he&#039;d say, I&#039;m not coming now,</div><div id="00:27:40.300" class="transcript_line"> and all the time he&#039;d be behind me with a hammer and something or a drill,</div><div id="00:27:44.300" class="transcript_line"> he was wonderful, he was, Len was, yeah, but he left,</div><div id="00:27:48.300" class="transcript_line"> then I went out to play with him and work.</div><div id="00:27:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were from Tree Harvard, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:55.300" class="transcript_line"> So how would you say you got on with the men?</div><div id="00:27:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, all right, all of them, yeah, yeah, all of them all right.</div><div id="00:28:02.300" class="transcript_line"> What about the women? Did you used to go out socially with them?</div><div id="00:28:07.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no. We did have a Christmas get-together,</div><div id="00:28:12.300" class="transcript_line"> which Eileen and myself, we&#039;d arrange it.</div><div id="00:28:16.300" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, we wouldn&#039;t have had anything for Christmas,</div><div id="00:28:18.300" class="transcript_line"> but we did that, and we went to a few places for a few Christmas,</div><div id="00:28:24.300" class="transcript_line"> but we had to pay for it ourselves, like the boss wouldn&#039;t pay for it,</div><div id="00:28:27.300" class="transcript_line"> and we did that, and, oh yes, it was quite nice to get together like that,</div><div id="00:28:34.300" class="transcript_line"> because you couldn&#039;t go talking out in the factory,</div><div id="00:28:37.300" class="transcript_line"> because one morning I was out there, and he said, oh, come on,</div><div id="00:28:41.300" class="transcript_line"> he said those girls were at me, and they were talking to me,</div><div id="00:28:44.300" class="transcript_line"> but he wouldn&#039;t allow socialising on the shop floor, no.</div><div id="00:28:49.300" class="transcript_line"> So were the workers allowed to talk to each other while they were working?</div><div id="00:28:54.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, I think they would, yeah, but then they needed it to watch, you see,</div><div id="00:29:01.300" class="transcript_line"> because these needles, if one went, you&#039;d have a big ladder all the way down in the material,</div><div id="00:29:07.300" class="transcript_line"> so they had to sort of keep their eye on that all the time, and they were working like all the time.</div><div id="00:29:13.300" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they did in the break time in the morning and lunch time.</div><div id="00:29:21.300" class="transcript_line"> What about music? Did they...?</div><div id="00:29:23.300" class="transcript_line"> No, the boss wouldn&#039;t have music. No, nothing, no, nothing at all.</div><div id="00:29:30.300" class="transcript_line"> In any case, if they did in the factory, they wouldn&#039;t have heard it,</div><div id="00:29:32.300" class="transcript_line"> because of the noise of the machines. Oh, they were really noisy machines, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:38.300" class="transcript_line"> Did they have any protective clothing or ear protection?</div><div id="00:29:41.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, nothing like that at all, because it hadn&#039;t come in then, all this protection,</div><div id="00:29:47.300" class="transcript_line"> for they should have, because it was really noisy on their ears, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:53.300" class="transcript_line"> No, it was before the time of all this health and safety.</div><div id="00:29:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Was the work dangerous at all, do you think?</div><div id="00:30:04.300" class="transcript_line"> No, not really, because it wasn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:30:11.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I wouldn&#039;t say it was a dangerous job.</div><div id="00:30:14.300" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t remember any accidents or anything like that?</div><div id="00:30:17.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, no. We had an accident book, but...</div><div id="00:30:26.300" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t... No, didn&#039;t have any accidents, no.</div><div id="00:30:31.300" class="transcript_line"> What about heat and lighting? Was it hot?</div><div id="00:30:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very, very hot. The strip lighting all down on the machines, you see,</div><div id="00:30:41.300" class="transcript_line"> for them to see the knitting as it was going, quite low on them, you know.</div><div id="00:30:47.300" class="transcript_line"> Each side of the machine, they had the strip lighting.</div><div id="00:30:50.300" class="transcript_line"> So was it hot in the winter as well? Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:30:54.300" class="transcript_line"> And the bottom part of all the windows was all frosted glass,</div><div id="00:30:58.300" class="transcript_line"> so they couldn&#039;t see out at all, because it was the original windows, I think,</div><div id="00:31:03.300" class="transcript_line"> from wartime, you know, the frosted glass, yeah.</div><div id="00:31:09.300" class="transcript_line"> So what about the office? Oh, we were the same.</div><div id="00:31:13.300" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I hate frosted glass.</div><div id="00:31:15.300" class="transcript_line"> I had to get up on the radiator pipe on the site and open the window to have a look out,</div><div id="00:31:23.300" class="transcript_line"> because I couldn&#039;t see out.</div><div id="00:31:26.300" class="transcript_line"> About the window was that much all the way around of frosted glass.</div><div id="00:31:30.300" class="transcript_line"> So were you ever cold in the office, or too hot or too cold?</div><div id="00:31:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very hot. Eileen, you see, she smoked as well.</div><div id="00:31:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it used to be blow.</div><div id="00:31:41.300" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d light her, put it on the ashtray, and let the smoke go on.</div><div id="00:31:48.300" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t breathe once. I thought I was bleeding out.</div><div id="00:31:51.300" class="transcript_line"> I was bleeding out. I couldn&#039;t breathe.</div><div id="00:31:53.300" class="transcript_line"> And she wouldn&#039;t have that much window open for it to go out.</div><div id="00:31:56.300" class="transcript_line"> And when the sun was in the front, it was like if she was in the cinema, you know, the rays,</div><div id="00:32:01.300" class="transcript_line"> it would be like that, coming in with the smoke.</div><div id="00:32:04.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so when she&#039;d come in, she&#039;d light one up, and then it would be going up and up.</div><div id="00:32:08.300" class="transcript_line"> I was a passive smoker, really, at the time, but I didn&#039;t think of it, you know.</div><div id="00:32:14.300" class="transcript_line"> And the boss was smoking. I got in the ashtray upstairs.</div><div id="00:32:18.300" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d light it up like that, up like that.</div><div id="00:32:20.300" class="transcript_line"> And all of a sudden, he gave it up overnight, because he found he had a little lest sit down in there.</div><div id="00:32:26.300" class="transcript_line"> And then he thought smoking was a very dirty habit.</div><div id="00:32:34.300" class="transcript_line"> So did he have a room of his own?</div><div id="00:32:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he had an office of his own, and then the end of it was called the boardroom.</div><div id="00:32:40.300" class="transcript_line"> Why it was called the boardroom, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:32:42.300" class="transcript_line"> It was just that there were a few chairs in there, and we never had any board meetings, really.</div><div id="00:32:47.300" class="transcript_line"> It was always called the boardroom.</div><div id="00:32:50.300" class="transcript_line"> What about the people on the factory floor? Could they smoke?</div><div id="00:32:55.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they did then, going round, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:58.300" class="transcript_line"> On the job?</div><div id="00:32:59.300" class="transcript_line"> On the job, they were, yeah, because years ago they did, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:33:03.300" class="transcript_line"> They just smoked anywhere, like, hmm, yeah.</div><div id="00:33:06.300" class="transcript_line"> I mean, now you think of it with that cotton, it was dangerous.</div><div id="00:33:09.300" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that cotton on that nylon? I mean, the nylon just melts, yeah.</div><div id="00:33:13.300" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t think of it.</div><div id="00:33:15.300" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:17.300" class="transcript_line"> Did your work change at all while you were there, or was it, you know, you were there for a long time?</div><div id="00:33:24.300" class="transcript_line"> No, not from the Monday morning, you see.</div><div id="00:33:27.300" class="transcript_line"> You had different days for everything to Friday then, so finish on Friday.</div><div id="00:33:32.300" class="transcript_line"> Everything had to be done every day to finish on Friday, to finish with a petty cash, so that it was balanced.</div><div id="00:33:38.300" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d have Monday morning again, you&#039;d have the sheets in then, from that week&#039;s work.</div><div id="00:33:44.300" class="transcript_line"> It was a week in hand. And then you&#039;d start all over again then.</div><div id="00:33:48.300" class="transcript_line"> So that was the same for the whole time you were there?</div><div id="00:33:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Did it matter whether you were married or not, you think?</div><div id="00:34:04.300" class="transcript_line"> You said there was a problem with Eileen.</div><div id="00:34:09.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because she went up to the arm of the work and live.</div><div id="00:34:13.300" class="transcript_line"> And no, no, it&#039;s just that she had a mother, you see, and a mother had a little boy.</div><div id="00:34:20.300" class="transcript_line"> And she didn&#039;t want to leave her mother in Trehaverd.</div><div id="00:34:25.300" class="transcript_line"> But in the end, he said, well, it&#039;s either also, it&#039;s either divorce and part and divorce, or, but in the end she went up.</div><div id="00:34:33.300" class="transcript_line"> Hmm. Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Were you encouraged to go to night school when you were there and further yourself?</div><div id="00:34:45.300" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing like that at all. No, no.</div><div id="00:34:49.300" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing at all. And another thing we didn&#039;t have were no pension schemes.</div><div id="00:34:54.300" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t believe in anything like that. He was all to make his own money, you know.</div><div id="00:34:59.300" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t believe in anything like that at all. No, no.</div><div id="00:35:05.300" class="transcript_line"> So you said you weren&#039;t in a trade union?</div><div id="00:35:09.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, Eileen and myself, no. Nothing at all.</div><div id="00:35:13.300" class="transcript_line"> But do you remember which trade union?</div><div id="00:35:16.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Nitta. Oh, dear, I should know it off by heart.</div><div id="00:35:21.300" class="transcript_line"> No, hmm. Can&#039;t remember that now.</div><div id="00:35:24.300" class="transcript_line"> It was the Nitta&#039;s union. It was up north because that&#039;s where a lot of the factories were up north, all the textile.</div><div id="00:35:31.300" class="transcript_line"> Textile, no, no, National Textile Union.</div><div id="00:35:35.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, dear, I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t say. I remember the name of the union.</div><div id="00:35:43.300" class="transcript_line"> I should know it. No, I can&#039;t remember the name of the union.</div><div id="00:35:46.300" class="transcript_line"> But it was in the textile union, it was.</div><div id="00:35:49.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were under the textile, yeah.</div><div id="00:35:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Were there any disputes or problems and stuff while you were there?</div><div id="00:35:57.300" class="transcript_line"> No, we were, no, we&#039;d just carry on, sail along all the time.</div><div id="00:36:05.300" class="transcript_line"> No, not really. No, they didn&#039;t sort of have any strikes or no.</div><div id="00:36:11.300" class="transcript_line"> I think they weren&#039;t, no, they were very, very good.</div><div id="00:36:16.300" class="transcript_line"> Did you feel that you and the other workers were fairly treated?</div><div id="00:36:23.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I suppose we were. We weren&#039;t, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:30.300" class="transcript_line"> Was he a good employer then?</div><div id="00:36:33.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, only that he never wanted to give us a rise. No.</div><div id="00:36:38.300" class="transcript_line"> Tell me a little bit about your employer then, who he was and his family.</div><div id="00:36:49.300" class="transcript_line"> Checils of Argyn, I can&#039;t bring it all out. Checils of Argyn, who he was.</div><div id="00:36:56.300" class="transcript_line"> And he came, I think before my time this was, he came over and he started with Stewart Singlem,</div><div id="00:37:05.300" class="transcript_line"> which was across the road up a bit on the estate, and then he had this then in 1940, 41 I expect,</div><div id="00:37:16.300" class="transcript_line"> and started upon his own, and then he had a sleeping partner up in London, which would come down every so often,</div><div id="00:37:24.300" class="transcript_line"> but he was a man in director, he did everything, you know, buying, everything, the machines.</div><div id="00:37:32.300" class="transcript_line"> What was his name?</div><div id="00:37:34.300" class="transcript_line"> Carole Bergman. Bergman. Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:39.300" class="transcript_line"> And didn&#039;t know anything about his personal life, he&#039;d never come out with any of his personal life.</div><div id="00:37:45.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve learnt more from the paper cut-ins now that I&#039;ve read, because he never said anything,</div><div id="00:37:53.300" class="transcript_line"> that Mrs Bergman was his wife, but didn&#039;t say like what happened with her,</div><div id="00:37:57.300" class="transcript_line"> she had a little boy in the concentration camp and that, and Eva, and then he took Eva on, you see,</div><div id="00:38:06.300" class="transcript_line"> and then they named her Eva Bergman. Other than that, I never, no, we never, and he never socialised himself,</div><div id="00:38:18.300" class="transcript_line"> he didn&#039;t go out with other men or anything, you know, for an evening, nothing at all like that,</div><div id="00:38:25.300" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t think they went very far either, so there was nothing really to say about,</div><div id="00:38:31.300" class="transcript_line"> we never sort of said we&#039;d go out with him for an evening with his wife, or no, we just went home, you know,</div><div id="00:38:38.300" class="transcript_line"> went to work and went home every night and it was the same.</div><div id="00:38:43.300" class="transcript_line"> Every, yeah, there was nothing, no, nothing sociable about him, so he didn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:38:55.300" class="transcript_line"> so I can&#039;t give you anything about, really about what, no, all I knew was that he went to Switzerland that morning,</div><div id="00:39:03.300" class="transcript_line"> stayed the night and then went the morning, five o&#039;clock, and died in the airport,</div><div id="00:39:08.300" class="transcript_line"> and then that day we were taken over by Burlington Fabrics then, over to Philly, so we had to go over there then.</div><div id="00:39:17.300" class="transcript_line"> So when, what year was that then?</div><div id="00:39:25.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, what year was that then? I was, I&#039;d have to have a pencil I think.</div><div id="00:39:32.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll ask you something.</div><div id="00:39:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Go on then.</div><div id="00:39:41.300" class="transcript_line"> So I wanted to ask you, what did you do with your wages? Did you keep all your wages or did you, you know, did you?</div><div id="00:39:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, we had, all of us had our cash, because I&#039;d go on a Thursday afternoon to the bank</div><div id="00:40:00.300" class="transcript_line"> and then made the wages up for the night shift to put them out with the foreman,</div><div id="00:40:06.300" class="transcript_line"> ready for the night shift foreman to come in, because they only worked four, four ten hour shifts when there were nights,</div><div id="00:40:13.300" class="transcript_line"> and then five hour, five days, eight hour shifts. So everybody had cash.</div><div id="00:40:20.300" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d not put it in the bank or anywhere for them then, it was all cash in the envelopes. Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:27.300" class="transcript_line"> When you started working there, were you still living at home then?</div><div id="00:40:35.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;d been home all the time.</div><div id="00:40:37.300" class="transcript_line"> So did you used to give your mother?</div><div id="00:40:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, my mother every Friday night, the two of us, yeah, hand out, we all would.</div><div id="00:40:44.300" class="transcript_line"> My mother kept our wages until we were both twenty-one and gave us pocket money,</div><div id="00:40:48.300" class="transcript_line"> but when we came twenty-one, because you wasn&#039;t out to do, I&#039;d look after.</div><div id="00:40:52.300" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to give, she believed in it, board and lodge.</div><div id="00:40:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Right. Was that about the age that everybody did that, you know, that twenty-one, did you go?</div><div id="00:41:05.300" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether it was everybody else, but my mother didn&#039;t believe in letting us have all our wages,</div><div id="00:41:10.300" class="transcript_line"> because we wouldn&#039;t know the value of any.</div><div id="00:41:12.300" class="transcript_line"> We were thinking every Friday we had that, oh we&#039;re going to spend it and then nothing left for the week.</div><div id="00:41:16.300" class="transcript_line"> We went like that. But that means there are some people who are like that,</div><div id="00:41:21.300" class="transcript_line"> and once they&#039;ve got their wages, they&#039;ve got to go on by Saturday morning like it&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:41:26.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, we had to bring ours home every Friday and she&#039;d sit down with two of us, with our hand out.</div><div id="00:41:33.300" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do with your pocket money?</div><div id="00:41:36.300" class="transcript_line"> When I was young, well I just had to make a drill for the week, whatever I wanted.</div><div id="00:41:43.300" class="transcript_line"> I just had to make a drill for the week. I had six and six, well how much is that in new money?</div><div id="00:41:48.300" class="transcript_line"> And just make a drill.</div><div id="00:41:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to pay for your transport out of that?</div><div id="00:41:55.300" class="transcript_line"> No, my mother paid for it out of my wages for the season ticket.</div><div id="00:42:01.300" class="transcript_line"> So that was all kind of for you to spend. Did you have to buy clothes out of that?</div><div id="00:42:07.300" class="transcript_line"> No, whatever we bought, my mother always came with us and paid for it.</div><div id="00:42:13.300" class="transcript_line"> Because of course we didn&#039;t have that amount of money. It wasn&#039;t enough.</div><div id="00:42:17.300" class="transcript_line"> It was only for sweets or chocolate or whatever.</div><div id="00:42:23.300" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t go to pictures, we weren&#039;t allowed to go to pictures.</div><div id="00:42:26.300" class="transcript_line"> We did go to youth club. Janet went to Young Farmers, but I went to the youth club in the village.</div><div id="00:42:33.300" class="transcript_line"> What else? Nothing else.</div><div id="00:42:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Did you buy records or anything?</div><div id="00:42:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I&#039;d buy up, but not very often because we didn&#039;t have the money to spend.</div><div id="00:42:44.300" class="transcript_line"> I always had to come home on a Tuesday when I worked in the shop.</div><div id="00:42:48.300" class="transcript_line"> We had a Thursday afternoon. That was my job, ironing, to do all the ironing.</div><div id="00:42:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Then in the summer, we&#039;d just go out in the garden, change then and have your tea and then work out in the garden.</div><div id="00:43:01.300" class="transcript_line"> In the winter nights, we&#039;d just sit by the fire. We all sat in one room.</div><div id="00:43:06.300" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have this business like they&#039;ve got today up to their bedroom. My father wouldn&#039;t allow that.</div><div id="00:43:11.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no. Never had a wireless or television up there. Nothing, George.</div><div id="00:43:17.300" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go up and go into bed and then get up in the morning and come down.</div><div id="00:43:22.300" class="transcript_line"> So when you had your own money and paid board and lodge, did you used to buy more clothes and things after that?</div><div id="00:43:31.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, not unless I wanted it. It was never, ever broke.</div><div id="00:43:36.300" class="transcript_line"> If you wanted something, you had to have the money on your hand before you went to buy it.</div><div id="00:43:42.300" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t go and then no credit at all. No credit, nothing.</div><div id="00:43:48.300" class="transcript_line"> So we didn&#039;t have clothes every week or every month.</div><div id="00:43:53.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d look after it, put all the summer clothes away for the winter and all the winter clothes away for the summer.</div><div id="00:43:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Amps sandals, bring them out then in the summer. That&#039;s what I still do now.</div><div id="00:44:04.300" class="transcript_line"> Clean them all up through the bottom, put them all away and then I&#039;d be glad to get the summer ones out.</div><div id="00:44:10.300" class="transcript_line"> I hate these long sleeves, especially when they&#039;re washing up.</div><div id="00:44:15.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be glad to get rid of them.</div><div id="00:44:19.300" class="transcript_line"> No, we&#039;ve had to look after everything and never abused anything.</div><div id="00:44:25.300" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had our own cars, we had to keep them clean and look after them.</div><div id="00:44:29.300" class="transcript_line"> When we had bikes then, we had to look after bikes.</div><div id="00:44:34.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve worked since I can remember, about seven years of age.</div><div id="00:44:38.300" class="transcript_line"> We never said to my father, what we get for it, we didn&#039;t get a penny, my sister or myself.</div><div id="00:44:44.300" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m having my time of life really, because I&#039;m having everything.</div><div id="00:44:49.300" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t spend it because I&#039;ve got to get rid of it.</div><div id="00:44:53.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just, oh, I like that, oh yeah, I think I&#039;ll have that.</div><div id="00:44:56.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I like that pair of shoes, yeah, I&#039;ll try them.</div><div id="00:44:58.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they&#039;re nice, I&#039;ll have them, or sandals or whatever.</div><div id="00:45:02.300" class="transcript_line"> I bought a pair of slippers yesterday, I don&#039;t really want them.</div><div id="00:45:06.300" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ll go up in the box for next winter now, because they&#039;re nice.</div><div id="00:45:10.300" class="transcript_line"> They come up over my ankles on the front, so it&#039;ll be cosy.</div><div id="00:45:14.300" class="transcript_line"> Not booties, but you can put them, but that&#039;s the type of thing.</div><div id="00:45:18.300" class="transcript_line"> So no, never had anything, unless we had the money to.</div><div id="00:45:24.300" class="transcript_line"> Never went to the hairdressers, never smoked.</div><div id="00:45:27.300" class="transcript_line"> My father said, come buy that drawer there with the cigarette in your bag, he said.</div><div id="00:45:32.300" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I&#039;ll ram it down your throat and open the choke you,</div><div id="00:45:35.300" class="transcript_line"> but we never had the money to buy them, you see.</div><div id="00:45:38.300" class="transcript_line"> And my mother told us, you buy a jumper, or you buy a cardigan or a pair of shoes,</div><div id="00:45:43.300" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got something to look at.</div><div id="00:45:45.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you have the cigarette, you might as well put the money there,</div><div id="00:45:47.300" class="transcript_line"> cos you&#039;ve got nothing after.</div><div id="00:45:49.300" class="transcript_line"> But we never had that.</div><div id="00:45:51.300" class="transcript_line"> As I said, six and six a week, I know they were cheaper then,</div><div id="00:45:55.300" class="transcript_line"> but it was dear then at that time, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:45:59.300" class="transcript_line"> They were, you know, and I think they were eight pounds for a pocket of cigarettes</div><div id="00:46:03.300" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got nothing after.</div><div id="00:46:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Beth?</div><div id="00:46:07.300" class="transcript_line"> Do you smoke?</div><div id="00:46:09.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:46:11.300" class="transcript_line"> Never.</div><div id="00:46:13.300" class="transcript_line"> What was I going to say?</div><div id="00:46:15.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, we go on to the holidays then.</div><div id="00:46:17.300" class="transcript_line"> That right, we&#039;re back on the holidays, aren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:46:19.300" class="transcript_line"> So, could you tell me about the holidays?</div><div id="00:46:24.300" class="transcript_line"> We started in April, we had Easter Monday and Tuesday off,</div><div id="00:46:31.300" class="transcript_line"> and then each Witson we&#039;d have the Monday off.</div><div id="00:46:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Then in July, then they&#039;d have the last week of July, first week of August,</div><div id="00:46:42.300" class="transcript_line"> but then I&#039;d have the last week of June and the first week of July,</div><div id="00:46:46.300" class="transcript_line"> cos I worked the fortnight that the factory was off,</div><div id="00:46:49.300" class="transcript_line"> manning the phones and seeing to the mail.</div><div id="00:46:52.300" class="transcript_line"> And then come Christmas, we&#039;d have the two weeks off,</div><div id="00:46:57.300" class="transcript_line"> one the Christmas week and then one before on the New Year&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:47:06.300" class="transcript_line"> But then they decided then, they preferred,</div><div id="00:47:09.300" class="transcript_line"> could they have the last two weeks of August off?</div><div id="00:47:12.300" class="transcript_line"> So for years then they did that.</div><div id="00:47:14.300" class="transcript_line"> I just remember they changed it.</div><div id="00:47:16.300" class="transcript_line"> But they weren&#039;t very fessy because the nights were beginning to draw in then,</div><div id="00:47:20.300" class="transcript_line"> in August, you see, they didn&#039;t have a long afternoon, did they?</div><div id="00:47:24.300" class="transcript_line"> But they kept to it and that&#039;s what they wanted.</div><div id="00:47:27.300" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t so crowded, they said, because it was miners, factory, schools,</div><div id="00:47:33.300" class="transcript_line"> and it all out then.</div><div id="00:47:35.300" class="transcript_line"> So that was the holidays.</div><div id="00:47:38.300" class="transcript_line"> Were they all paid holidays?</div><div id="00:47:40.300" class="transcript_line"> Only the bank holidays, the Monday, Tuesday, yeah,</div><div id="00:47:46.300" class="transcript_line"> and the Christmas and Boxing day.</div><div id="00:47:50.300" class="transcript_line"> What about the summer fortnight?</div><div id="00:47:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, just the basic it was.</div><div id="00:47:57.300" class="transcript_line"> They had no, no, the basic rate.</div><div id="00:47:59.300" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have the bonus of their work, you know, the knitting bonus.</div><div id="00:48:04.300" class="transcript_line"> No, just the basic, I just come to that.</div><div id="00:48:07.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:48:09.300" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do during the holidays?</div><div id="00:48:11.300" class="transcript_line"> When I was there, when I&#039;d be waiting for the phone to ring,</div><div id="00:48:15.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d see to the mail, I&#039;d take any checks that we had down to the bank</div><div id="00:48:18.300" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;d sit and I&#039;d be knitting.</div><div id="00:48:20.300" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;d have my cup of coffee or whatever</div><div id="00:48:23.300" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d leave about half past two then.</div><div id="00:48:27.300" class="transcript_line"> I thought there was nothing going on.</div><div id="00:48:29.300" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d come home then and that was my, I used to say,</div><div id="00:48:33.300" class="transcript_line"> it was like two weeks holiday or a month holiday</div><div id="00:48:37.300" class="transcript_line"> because it was only sitting there.</div><div id="00:48:39.300" class="transcript_line"> He wanted someone there because he went away as well.</div><div id="00:48:42.300" class="transcript_line"> And so it was, you know, a rest for me.</div><div id="00:48:47.300" class="transcript_line"> For me, it didn&#039;t sort of really work.</div><div id="00:48:50.300" class="transcript_line"> So I enjoyed it, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Was it only you in the factory?</div><div id="00:48:55.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was eerie.</div><div id="00:48:57.300" class="transcript_line"> After all that noise and to walk out into the factory,</div><div id="00:49:00.300" class="transcript_line"> it was really eerie. It was, yeah.</div><div id="00:49:05.300" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do when you actually had the time off?</div><div id="00:49:08.300" class="transcript_line"> You said you went away, did you?</div><div id="00:49:10.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, we used to go on holiday, yes.</div><div id="00:49:12.300" class="transcript_line"> My friend June and I, one year we went a week,</div><div id="00:49:15.300" class="transcript_line"> I think the first time we went on holidays was a week to Bournemouth.</div><div id="00:49:19.300" class="transcript_line"> And then Joyce and I went away with Cornwall.</div><div id="00:49:24.300" class="transcript_line"> And then before my sister started work then,</div><div id="00:49:27.300" class="transcript_line"> the three of us went to Switzerland on a coach tour.</div><div id="00:49:31.300" class="transcript_line"> And then afterwards then, well, it was down West Wales, Cornwall.</div><div id="00:49:41.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, then we went to Land&#039;s End to John O&#039; Groats.</div><div id="00:49:46.300" class="transcript_line"> Where else did we go?</div><div id="00:49:49.300" class="transcript_line"> You know, we didn&#039;t do it all.</div><div id="00:49:52.300" class="transcript_line"> We went due to Land&#039;s End and due to John O&#039; Groats, and to Scotland.</div><div id="00:49:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Where else did we go?</div><div id="00:50:01.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we went abroad again to Italy.</div><div id="00:50:05.300" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:50:07.300" class="transcript_line"> Italy, Austria, Switzerland.</div><div id="00:50:13.300" class="transcript_line"> When was this? What decade?</div><div id="00:50:15.300" class="transcript_line"> It was different times, I think.</div><div id="00:50:19.300" class="transcript_line"> When you went abroad, what decade was that?</div><div id="00:50:22.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, now you&#039;re asking me something.</div><div id="00:50:25.300" class="transcript_line"> What was your favourite country?</div><div id="00:50:30.300" class="transcript_line"> I went to Jersey, the Fortnight.</div><div id="00:50:35.300" class="transcript_line"> I went to Guernsey.</div><div id="00:50:41.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never fancied America.</div><div id="00:50:43.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s never appealed to me, or Ireland, or...</div><div id="00:50:46.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s either the Channel Islands, or...</div><div id="00:50:49.300" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s only Switzerland or Austria.</div><div id="00:50:52.300" class="transcript_line"> Of course, with the coach, too.</div><div id="00:50:54.300" class="transcript_line"> You come from Germany or France, but I didn&#039;t fancy France.</div><div id="00:50:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was all different when I was...</div><div id="00:51:01.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, I haven&#039;t had a holiday for 20 years.</div><div id="00:51:04.300" class="transcript_line"> 20 going on.</div><div id="00:51:06.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, over 20 years now I haven&#039;t had a holiday.</div><div id="00:51:08.300" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t have holidays, anything, because both my parents were beginning to get older</div><div id="00:51:12.300" class="transcript_line"> and beginning to go downhill, so there was no one.</div><div id="00:51:16.300" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have my sister to take over.</div><div id="00:51:19.300" class="transcript_line"> I was 21 years old, I&#039;ve got 22 coming out.</div><div id="00:51:22.300" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I didn&#039;t have a holiday for over 20 years.</div><div id="00:51:28.300" class="transcript_line"> Now I haven&#039;t got anybody to go with.</div><div id="00:51:31.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not going on my own.</div><div id="00:51:33.300" class="transcript_line"> They always say, go on your own, you&#039;ll soon go with Sargen.</div><div id="00:51:36.300" class="transcript_line"> No, I couldn&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:51:38.300" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:51:41.300" class="transcript_line"> Were you allowed days off for personal reasons?</div><div id="00:51:46.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;d ask for them.</div><div id="00:51:48.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d ask for a day off for my sister&#039;s wedding, and he more or less said,</div><div id="00:51:51.300" class="transcript_line"> well, have you got to have it off?</div><div id="00:51:54.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, I said, like, my sister&#039;s getting married on a Monday,</div><div id="00:51:57.300" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m going to be a witness, because she had a special licence,</div><div id="00:52:01.300" class="transcript_line"> and she went to the registry office.</div><div id="00:52:04.300" class="transcript_line"> And I more or less, well, you know, it&#039;s only for my sister&#039;s wedding.</div><div id="00:52:11.300" class="transcript_line"> But he wasn&#039;t very fussy.</div><div id="00:52:13.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="00:52:15.300" class="transcript_line"> Because we couldn&#039;t make it up, you see, or anything,</div><div id="00:52:18.300" class="transcript_line"> but he didn&#039;t eat up to me anyway.</div><div id="00:52:20.300" class="transcript_line"> But he wasn&#039;t very, no, he didn&#039;t believe in holidays,</div><div id="00:52:24.300" class="transcript_line"> because he used to say to his, it&#039;s not another holiday, bank holiday again.</div><div id="00:52:30.300" class="transcript_line"> He was a workaholic, you know, so he didn&#039;t believe in holidays, really.</div><div id="00:52:35.300" class="transcript_line"> But he paid you the day you went to his sister&#039;s wedding?</div><div id="00:52:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:52:41.300" class="transcript_line"> Other than that, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:52:43.300" class="transcript_line"> Did I ask for a time off other than that?</div><div id="00:52:45.300" class="transcript_line"> I think it was the only time that I asked.</div><div id="00:52:49.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think it was good.</div><div id="00:52:53.300" class="transcript_line"> So you worked on the Treforst Estate for a long time,</div><div id="00:53:00.300" class="transcript_line"> and can you describe to me what the Treforst Estate was like</div><div id="00:53:04.300" class="transcript_line"> when you started working there?</div><div id="00:53:06.300" class="transcript_line"> All the old factories from the war, the real, real old,</div><div id="00:53:12.300" class="transcript_line"> they were the old factories from the war,</div><div id="00:53:15.300" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;d go to Tantig on the Bess,</div><div id="00:53:18.300" class="transcript_line"> then we&#039;d go down through the one field, down through the other,</div><div id="00:53:21.300" class="transcript_line"> and then come down and we&#039;d walk through GCs,</div><div id="00:53:27.300" class="transcript_line"> and then, oh, and Linus was there, and the smell from the Linus, oh, the bone factory,</div><div id="00:53:34.300" class="transcript_line"> and then there was...</div><div id="00:53:36.300" class="transcript_line"> What was the smell, sorry?</div><div id="00:53:38.300" class="transcript_line"> Linus with gelatine with all the bones.</div><div id="00:53:41.300" class="transcript_line"> They used to go...</div><div id="00:53:43.300" class="transcript_line"> As we were leaving the fields, we&#039;d come down to it and go...</div><div id="00:53:49.300" class="transcript_line"> It was terrible.</div><div id="00:53:52.300" class="transcript_line"> And I can name a lot of the factories down there.</div><div id="00:53:55.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d go round, and very often when my mother was alive, I&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:53:59.300" class="transcript_line"> where are you going? She&#039;d say, I&#039;m going round to see how it went.</div><div id="00:54:02.300" class="transcript_line"> I said, a blinking, Greg&#039;s a...</div><div id="00:54:05.300" class="transcript_line"> All over our patch!</div><div id="00:54:07.300" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing of the factory left, no, it&#039;s all Greg&#039;s lorries.</div><div id="00:54:11.300" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d go round and say, oh, this is this one now, GC, DCL,</div><div id="00:54:16.300" class="transcript_line"> and then chrome leather, western board, aerozip,</div><div id="00:54:21.300" class="transcript_line"> Tiforacic printers, and I&#039;d go up around, and then Linus,</div><div id="00:54:27.300" class="transcript_line"> but where we used to walk down was GC there, oh,</div><div id="00:54:31.300" class="transcript_line"> and they used to have the canteen starting up in the mornings,</div><div id="00:54:34.300" class="transcript_line"> and the old smell where they made chips.</div><div id="00:54:37.300" class="transcript_line"> That was another smell.</div><div id="00:54:39.300" class="transcript_line"> And then there was...</div><div id="00:54:43.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they used to sell wood, Florida, Robinson, Florida, I think it was called.</div><div id="00:54:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Then there was Stuart Singlem, then there was plastic engineers,</div><div id="00:54:52.300" class="transcript_line"> then there was Hometons, and then there was Elliot&#039;s Glass,</div><div id="00:54:56.300" class="transcript_line"> and then by us then there was Rosedales.</div><div id="00:54:59.300" class="transcript_line"> We were in a big block, but a small block in a big block,</div><div id="00:55:03.300" class="transcript_line"> and I can&#039;t remember the name next door.</div><div id="00:55:06.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and there was Hulses, I was all the further over.</div><div id="00:55:10.300" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the name next door to us, in the same block,</div><div id="00:55:15.300" class="transcript_line"> but just all different, I can&#039;t remember that one.</div><div id="00:55:19.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been trying to think of that one for a long time,</div><div id="00:55:22.300" class="transcript_line"> and I can&#039;t remember it, is it funny?</div><div id="00:55:24.300" class="transcript_line"> I can remember all the others in the factory,</div><div id="00:55:26.300" class="transcript_line"> and down on the main avenue there was state printers, co-op shoes,</div><div id="00:55:30.300" class="transcript_line"> KLGs, BOHC, copygraph.</div><div id="00:55:41.300" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the ones now that they&#039;ve done away with now?</div><div id="00:55:43.300" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s disabled, oh, there was the blind down there,</div><div id="00:55:45.300" class="transcript_line"> then there&#039;s this Remploy.</div><div id="00:55:47.300" class="transcript_line"> There was a big Remploy down on the main avenue.</div><div id="00:55:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:51.300" class="transcript_line"> But describe to me what it was like, you know,</div><div id="00:55:54.300" class="transcript_line"> first thing in the morning and last thing at night.</div><div id="00:55:56.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, outside our office was the bus station</div><div id="00:56:01.300" class="transcript_line"> for all the buses from the valleys.</div><div id="00:56:04.300" class="transcript_line"> And it would take, if I went up to Tree Forest,</div><div id="00:56:08.300" class="transcript_line"> from Tree Forest to the state, up to Tree Forest,</div><div id="00:56:11.300" class="transcript_line"> it would take me a half an hour at least,</div><div id="00:56:13.300" class="transcript_line"> because it would stop, start, stop, start, all,</div><div id="00:56:16.300" class="transcript_line"> it would double-decker, single-decker,</div><div id="00:56:18.300" class="transcript_line"> it was chock-a-block with buses.</div><div id="00:56:22.300" class="transcript_line"> And now it&#039;s just gone, now it&#039;s all derelict there,</div><div id="00:56:25.300" class="transcript_line"> nothing at all.</div><div id="00:56:27.300" class="transcript_line"> And what a noise they&#039;d be coming about quarter to five.</div><div id="00:56:31.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, dear, dear, you know, all in the line,</div><div id="00:56:34.300" class="transcript_line"> waiting for the vault to come out of the rich factory.</div><div id="00:56:37.300" class="transcript_line"> Because now it&#039;s all cars, and they&#039;ll have to use them,</div><div id="00:56:40.300" class="transcript_line"> they went to cars.</div><div id="00:56:42.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:43.300" class="transcript_line"> But then I&#039;d walk up, and then I came,</div><div id="00:56:46.300" class="transcript_line"> I was walking up on my own, and I wouldn&#039;t go through the fields then on my own,</div><div id="00:56:50.300" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;d walk up the roadway, because it wasn&#039;t very nice,</div><div id="00:56:54.300" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t fancy coming on my own, and it wasn&#039;t, no.</div><div id="00:56:57.300" class="transcript_line"> Going down in the morning, we&#039;d be about 12 of us,</div><div id="00:57:00.300" class="transcript_line"> all going to different factories.</div><div id="00:57:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:05.300" class="transcript_line"> So when your boss died, you said it was taken over by?</div><div id="00:57:10.300" class="transcript_line"> By Burlington.</div><div id="00:57:12.300" class="transcript_line"> By Burlington.</div><div id="00:57:14.300" class="transcript_line"> And it moved to, because really, tell me about that.</div><div id="00:57:17.300" class="transcript_line"> We moved over to Cattifford.</div><div id="00:57:19.300" class="transcript_line"> They were at the back of us, it was called Burlington Gloves,</div><div id="00:57:23.300" class="transcript_line"> but then they went over to, when they were over there,</div><div id="00:57:26.300" class="transcript_line"> then they went into a bigger, much bigger factory,</div><div id="00:57:29.300" class="transcript_line"> and it was Burlington Fabrics, and a huge office,</div><div id="00:57:34.300" class="transcript_line"> and a much bigger factory altogether than ours.</div><div id="00:57:39.300" class="transcript_line"> And they did all types of material, not just like we did,</div><div id="00:57:45.300" class="transcript_line"> they did it for the furniture.</div><div id="00:57:48.300" class="transcript_line"> What else?</div><div id="00:57:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Well, I wasn&#039;t really told, we just went in there,</div><div id="00:57:54.300" class="transcript_line"> and just sort of mixing with the girls, I wasn&#039;t told what they did.</div><div id="00:57:59.300" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t, no, and they were, oh dear, dear, dear,</div><div id="00:58:04.300" class="transcript_line"> really fancy themselves, and they didn&#039;t have a penny to bless themselves with.</div><div id="00:58:11.300" class="transcript_line"> They just put it like that.</div><div id="00:58:13.300" class="transcript_line"> And they looked at the nose, it was as if it were riffraffs.</div><div id="00:58:17.300" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what, the office manager as well, he&#039;d be on his glasses, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:58:23.300" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s, I just went to work there, that&#039;s all, I wasn&#039;t sort of interested at all.</div><div id="00:58:28.300" class="transcript_line"> I did, and he did ask me then to cash up every night then,</div><div id="00:58:31.300" class="transcript_line"> because we had a factory shop, so he gave me that job.</div><div id="00:58:35.300" class="transcript_line"> But I went first on it.</div><div id="00:58:38.300" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t like it there, just one of those things, I didn&#039;t like it there.</div><div id="00:58:42.300" class="transcript_line"> So then he called us in and made us redundant, and I had a large sum of £3,050.</div><div id="00:58:48.300" class="transcript_line"> And he thought he was giving me the earth.</div><div id="00:58:52.300" class="transcript_line"> He said, oh dear, dear, you&#039;re having £3,000, oh Lord.</div><div id="00:58:58.300" class="transcript_line"> But that wasn&#039;t much, was it?</div><div id="00:59:00.300" class="transcript_line"> After that was 31 years of working.</div><div id="00:59:03.300" class="transcript_line"> So he put the two together, right?</div><div id="00:59:06.300" class="transcript_line"> So I came out of there and that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:59:09.300" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s all gone now.</div><div id="00:59:11.300" class="transcript_line"> They changed hands, I don&#039;t know how many times since I left there, now it&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:59:15.300" class="transcript_line"> All gone now.</div><div id="00:59:24.300" class="transcript_line"> And you left eventually in, is it 1988? Is that right?</div><div id="00:59:31.300" class="transcript_line"> I was made redundant and I was 54.</div><div id="00:59:36.300" class="transcript_line"> So 54 from 1978 is 34 years, is it?</div><div id="00:59:42.300" class="transcript_line"> 34 from 1990.</div><div id="00:59:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:55.300" class="transcript_line"> I was on the door then for 12 months.</div><div id="00:59:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Then I delivered my savings then for another 12 months.</div><div id="01:00:02.300" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t get a penny, I wasn&#039;t entitled to a penny.</div><div id="01:00:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Then I went then to the social services, well, Old Ray House in Potiprath on Broadway.</div><div id="01:00:12.300" class="transcript_line"> I did 13 weeks there from nine until one.</div><div id="01:00:15.300" class="transcript_line"> And I had £60 a week so that I could put stamps on then and I had another year then, door.</div><div id="01:00:21.300" class="transcript_line"> And until I was 60, I had not a penny until I was 60, until I had my pension.</div><div id="01:00:26.300" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s 24 years ago, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:00:30.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, 24, yes.</div><div id="01:00:32.300" class="transcript_line"> So about 1989.</div><div id="01:00:34.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:00:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy working in the factory office, the first year?</div><div id="01:00:42.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did, yes.</div><div id="01:00:44.300" class="transcript_line"> What about job satisfaction, were you bored at all?</div><div id="01:00:47.300" class="transcript_line"> No, never bored.</div><div id="01:00:51.300" class="transcript_line"> Were you given a gift or anything when you left?</div><div id="01:00:56.300" class="transcript_line"> No, whenever I had a thing.</div><div id="01:00:58.300" class="transcript_line"> I only had these different things because I was asking for it to show that I had, you know, what I&#039;d done.</div><div id="01:01:05.300" class="transcript_line"> And I only had that because I wanted something that could be, and I was looking and looking.</div><div id="01:01:11.300" class="transcript_line"> I went and then I had it inscribed, you see, and because what is it?</div><div id="01:01:16.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a, oh, I&#039;m worried about my glasses on.</div><div id="01:01:19.300" class="transcript_line"> Who gave you this?</div><div id="01:01:21.300" class="transcript_line"> The boss then.</div><div id="01:01:23.300" class="transcript_line"> And I got a bracelet with it on inside.</div><div id="01:01:27.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know where I put it on.</div><div id="01:01:29.300" class="transcript_line"> I know I haven&#039;t lost it.</div><div id="01:01:31.300" class="transcript_line"> But inside the bracelet is engraved another year and then I got a brandy with another so many years.</div><div id="01:01:40.300" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t have anything.</div><div id="01:01:42.300" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking of that before you were right.</div><div id="01:01:44.300" class="transcript_line"> None of us had a thing when we finished.</div><div id="01:01:47.300" class="transcript_line"> And I got it been a year.</div><div id="01:01:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Howard had been an aunt, Denzel is a brother.</div><div id="01:01:56.300" class="transcript_line"> Arthur and Howard, they were both foremen.</div><div id="01:02:03.300" class="transcript_line"> But of course they didn&#039;t when they died.</div><div id="01:02:06.300" class="transcript_line"> No, we never had a thing when he died.</div><div id="01:02:09.300" class="transcript_line"> Never sort of, nothing at all.</div><div id="01:02:11.300" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing.</div><div id="01:02:12.300" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t give us anything.</div><div id="01:02:14.300" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:02:16.300" class="transcript_line"> Looking back now then, how do you feel about the time you worked in the factory?</div><div id="01:02:24.300" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="01:02:25.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, alright.</div><div id="01:02:27.300" class="transcript_line"> Are you in touch?</div><div id="01:02:28.300" class="transcript_line"> We never sort of had a crossword, I mean of myself.</div><div id="01:02:33.300" class="transcript_line"> And there was only one chap that came in and he used to be, no two.</div><div id="01:02:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Two.</div><div id="01:02:40.300" class="transcript_line"> So he really wanted to take over.</div><div id="01:02:44.300" class="transcript_line"> And two I wasn&#039;t very fussy of.</div><div id="01:02:47.300" class="transcript_line"> But I had a lovely one then and he only came to finish, he was sixty, sixty-three.</div><div id="01:02:54.300" class="transcript_line"> And he came in until he was sixty-five and lo and behold he went home one night and he sat in the chair and died.</div><div id="01:03:01.300" class="transcript_line"> And he was a knight, he was.</div><div id="01:03:03.300" class="transcript_line"> He was from a director, he was in South Printers and he finished him off there.</div><div id="01:03:08.300" class="transcript_line"> And then he really enjoyed it.</div><div id="01:03:11.300" class="transcript_line"> But he went home and he died in the chair.</div><div id="01:03:14.300" class="transcript_line"> Big smoke that he was as well and he gave up smoking.</div><div id="01:03:17.300" class="transcript_line"> And then it just got to happen to him.</div><div id="01:03:20.300" class="transcript_line"> Are you in touch with anybody?</div><div id="01:03:24.300" class="transcript_line"> Well Eileen died two years just gone in December.</div><div id="01:03:29.300" class="transcript_line"> She was eighty-two I think.</div><div id="01:03:32.300" class="transcript_line"> And when I sent Ray the card to Gwyd Iamod, he&#039;s coming down because they&#039;ve got a house still in Treehaverd.</div><div id="01:03:41.300" class="transcript_line"> So I told him whenever he comes down, he did come down two years ago and I had a visitor.</div><div id="01:03:47.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always the same.</div><div id="01:03:49.300" class="transcript_line"> This young man was with him of course.</div><div id="01:03:51.300" class="transcript_line"> It was Gareth.</div><div id="01:03:53.300" class="transcript_line"> And he was fifty-two.</div><div id="01:03:56.300" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know who he was of course.</div><div id="01:03:58.300" class="transcript_line"> He said Gareth.</div><div id="01:04:00.300" class="transcript_line"> Last time I saw him it was a lovely little boy though.</div><div id="01:04:03.300" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s Eileen in Fondale but this Christmas is the first Christmas I am at a card.</div><div id="01:04:10.300" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s a cleaner.</div><div id="01:04:12.300" class="transcript_line"> She lived on Hawthorne and occasionally we phoned but she&#039;s ninety-four now.</div><div id="01:04:16.300" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a lady then, Nellera was in inspection.</div><div id="01:04:21.300" class="transcript_line"> I was looking after her from the end.</div><div id="01:04:23.300" class="transcript_line"> I was taking her to her to her plastic stockings.</div><div id="01:04:27.300" class="transcript_line"> I was taking her to the hospital because she had no one.</div><div id="01:04:30.300" class="transcript_line"> So I had to do journeys up there.</div><div id="01:04:33.300" class="transcript_line"> Then she had cancer in the eye and she had her eye out.</div><div id="01:04:36.300" class="transcript_line"> Then I stayed down in Morrison Hospital because she had to do her treatment every day.</div><div id="01:04:45.300" class="transcript_line"> But she died three years ago.</div><div id="01:04:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Three years after August I think.</div><div id="01:04:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Who else is alive?</div><div id="01:04:54.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know what you&#039;d wish on a ship.</div><div id="01:04:58.300" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he might still be alive.</div><div id="01:05:01.300" class="transcript_line"> Other than that I think they&#039;ve all gone.</div><div id="01:05:03.300" class="transcript_line"> You know, the ones that I haven&#039;t seen any other men like that&#039;s out in the factory</div><div id="01:05:09.300" class="transcript_line"> because they lived in all different places.</div><div id="01:05:12.300" class="transcript_line"> So yes, that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="01:05:16.300" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lot of it.</div><div id="01:05:18.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="01:05:24.300" class="transcript_line"> The cotton that you made in the factory, what was it used for?</div><div id="01:05:29.300" class="transcript_line"> The making of gloves.</div><div id="01:05:31.300" class="transcript_line"> The white was for police gloves.</div><div id="01:05:34.300" class="transcript_line"> Try that now.</div><div id="01:05:37.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s 100% cotton.</div><div id="01:05:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Then whatever colour, this happened to be the Charmar because they were used for lens cleaners.</div><div id="01:05:49.300" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;d be cut that much.</div><div id="01:05:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Like that and put in the glass cases right now.</div><div id="01:05:59.300" class="transcript_line"> And then these used to be made into swatches or sent to customers.</div><div id="01:06:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Like Eileen would cut them like that.</div><div id="01:06:08.300" class="transcript_line"> Then bend them over.</div><div id="01:06:18.300" class="transcript_line"> Bend them over.</div><div id="01:06:25.300" class="transcript_line"> And staple them to send to customers for the colours they wanted and then they&#039;d order.</div><div id="01:06:31.300" class="transcript_line"> See, that was called a swatch.</div><div id="01:06:37.300" class="transcript_line"> The nylon then was nylon gloves.</div><div id="01:06:41.300" class="transcript_line"> And then we started to go into dress fabrics with the nylon.</div><div id="01:06:46.300" class="transcript_line"> But I wouldn&#039;t fist on the nylon.</div><div id="01:06:48.300" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, that&#039;s all cotton.</div><div id="01:06:51.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s the...</div><div id="01:06:53.300" class="transcript_line"> They all want to see this when they say, what did you do?</div><div id="01:06:56.300" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m glad I brought these home.</div><div id="01:06:58.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was lovely, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:07:09.300" class="transcript_line"> The raw material would be sent up to Nottingham to be dyed.</div><div id="01:07:14.300" class="transcript_line"> And then brought back to us in rolls.</div><div id="01:07:16.300" class="transcript_line"> And then the orders that we&#039;d get for the rolls then would be sent to Hong Kong,</div><div id="01:07:21.300" class="transcript_line"> all in the colours, to be made into gloves.</div><div id="01:07:24.300" class="transcript_line"> And then the customers, the glove factories all around then,</div><div id="01:07:30.300" class="transcript_line"> would be having the fabric then to make into gloves and we wouldn&#039;t see it after.</div><div id="01:07:37.300" class="transcript_line"> So that was the... yeah, that&#039;s how much of it.</div></div></p>
