    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is Thursday June the 23rd. My name is Jill Willie and I&#039;m here today speaking with</div><div id="00:00:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Roy Evans at his home in Ryder, home with an absolutely beautiful view. Well Roy, thanks</div><div id="00:00:16.320" class="transcript_line"> very much for agreeing to talk to me. First of all, can we start by just asking your year</div><div id="00:00:22.280" class="transcript_line"> of birth please?</div><div id="00:00:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Right, that&#039;s fine. Okay, now you&#039;ve lived and worked in Ryder all your life. Can you</div><div id="00:00:32.360" class="transcript_line"> start off with your early life, where you were born?</div><div id="00:00:35.080" class="transcript_line"> I was the first child to be born in Cai Glass when they were elected them as they were finishing</div><div id="00:00:41.680" class="transcript_line"> them. So I was born there in 1948 with my brothers, you know, and we had a happy time there. And</div><div id="00:00:52.120" class="transcript_line"> the whole row, there&#039;s loads of us children up there and we had some great fun like, isn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:55.880" class="transcript_line"> it? Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:56.880" class="transcript_line"> Were you able to play in the streets then? Was it safe to play on the road?</div><div id="00:01:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, there&#039;s, outside our house in Cai Glass we lived in number three. There was</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> a lamppost there and there was another one up by my uncle in number 11 Cai Glass. And</div><div id="00:01:13.440" class="transcript_line"> we found out in the winter, if we hit the lamppost with a big stone, we&#039;d knock the</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> light off so we could play hide and seek. And then every Saturday morning, Mr Williams,</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> who worked for the electricity board, would be coming up with his ladder to go up to put</div><div id="00:01:30.720" class="transcript_line"> the timer back on the clock or the lights. And we&#039;d do the same thing again.</div><div id="00:01:36.240" class="transcript_line"> And did he ever catch on?</div><div id="00:01:39.440" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I don&#039;t think so, no. When we were very young, one of the highlights Saturday</div><div id="00:01:46.600" class="transcript_line"> morning, Mr Williams, they&#039;d come up, the bread men, two brothers in red at the time,</div><div id="00:01:55.440" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d come up with his horse and cart with the bread. And the bread, he had a canvas</div><div id="00:02:00.640" class="transcript_line"> sheet on the back of the trailer and the bread was piping hot and mum always had a round</div><div id="00:02:06.760" class="transcript_line"> loaf with rings on it. So we&#039;d take that in straight for mum and she&#039;d cut the crust</div><div id="00:02:12.240" class="transcript_line"> off both ends, put butter on it for my brother and myself. That was one of the treats on</div><div id="00:02:16.520" class="transcript_line"> the Saturday.</div><div id="00:02:18.600" class="transcript_line"> That was your reward for delivering the bread?</div><div id="00:02:21.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:22.920" class="transcript_line"> Wonderful.</div><div id="00:02:23.920" class="transcript_line"> And then do we add another man come up, Bimmy I think, the milkman, he used to come up a</div><div id="00:02:29.840" class="transcript_line"> glass with his milk flukes again, horse and cart. I can remember them, days well.</div><div id="00:02:37.080" class="transcript_line"> Things have certainly changed.</div><div id="00:02:38.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they have, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:39.880" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t expect to see that sort of delivery anymore.</div><div id="00:02:45.160" class="transcript_line"> What other families lived in Kiglass near you?</div><div id="00:02:50.360" class="transcript_line"> Number one was, her first husband died, so there were Joneses and Carraddocks then, and</div><div id="00:02:59.400" class="transcript_line"> there was a family of ten between the two, two families. And then number two there was</div><div id="00:03:08.280" class="transcript_line"> Missy Sharp when I was younger. We were number three. And number four was Mr. Watkins, Margaret</div><div id="00:03:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Watkins, she was in the Beauty Queen contest and her father worked for the council and</div><div id="00:03:23.640" class="transcript_line"> he was one of them. He used to go round with a bit of a truck with two bins on to sweep</div><div id="00:03:29.760" class="transcript_line"> the roads. And then next to him there was Jill Williams, his home, Quentin Davis, and</div><div id="00:03:37.720" class="transcript_line"> he was a character. And the next one then to him was Tom Jones, Dai Jones is Auntie&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:48.120" class="transcript_line"> father, we call him Dai Spanner, and they had a sister as well. And the next lot to</div><div id="00:03:53.560" class="transcript_line"> him was Eddie Futcher and he was a character. Because he didn&#039;t carry glass at the time.</div><div id="00:03:58.600" class="transcript_line"> We had massive gardens at the back because the road by the British Leeds, it was only</div><div id="00:04:03.800" class="transcript_line"> enough for one car, so you can imagine how big the gardens were. And Eddie was no gardener,</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> so the council wrote to him to tell him to tidy his garden up. And he replied back to</div><div id="00:04:16.960" class="transcript_line"> him in the letter and said, when I applied for a council house, I expected a council</div><div id="00:04:22.680" class="transcript_line"> house, not a homestead. Which was just like him. The next lot to him was the Bowenzes,</div><div id="00:04:30.840" class="transcript_line"> they were a very big family again. There was a big family of eight or nine there. And</div><div id="00:04:36.480" class="transcript_line"> then I don&#039;t know, there was another one, Bacchie Kinsley, he worked on the post but</div><div id="00:04:41.760" class="transcript_line"> he did cobbling as well. He had a little shop down there opposite the bay. And who was the</div><div id="00:04:48.400" class="transcript_line"> next one? Oh it was the next one was Jane Arborer&#039;s house, she lived there with her</div><div id="00:04:55.800" class="transcript_line"> And then there was my uncle Bill was number 11, he was a bit of a character. And then</div><div id="00:05:01.880" class="transcript_line"> number 12 was the Murphy&#039;s. And I always remember when we were a lot younger, we used to call</div><div id="00:05:08.320" class="transcript_line"> other boys here at Green Gardens, and some of that were boys, they used to call them</div><div id="00:05:13.360" class="transcript_line"> the Bay Boys because they always went drinking in the bay. And you&#039;ll be guaranteed Saturday</div><div id="00:05:18.840" class="transcript_line"> night they start at number 12 and jump the hedges. And my father had a big privet hedge</div><div id="00:05:26.880" class="transcript_line"> with a peak on it. And in the morning a big big dense in it and the Bay Boys called it</div><div id="00:05:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Beeches Brook because nobody made it. So you know we had a lot of, we made our own fun</div><div id="00:05:38.840" class="transcript_line"> up there then, like isn&#039;t it? Not damaged nothing but just good fun, you&#039;ll have your</div><div id="00:05:44.400" class="transcript_line"> gates taken off the hinges and things like that. So we had a happy childhood there.</div><div id="00:05:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Well he certainly did, we could almost write a book about Kiglass itself couldn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:05:55.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. Yes. Oh wonderful. And then school days Roy, which schools did you go to in this</div><div id="00:06:04.720" class="transcript_line"> town? Cuntida School, the other side there, but then Mrs Lloyd was headmistress and we</div><div id="00:06:11.360" class="transcript_line"> had to recite Cuntida, we used to say C W M D A U D D W R Cuntida. And my wife said</div><div id="00:06:22.680" class="transcript_line"> why couldn&#039;t you learn something like that even when you were in school all the time?</div><div id="00:06:27.480" class="transcript_line"> And after that Raider School. That was a good time there, like isn&#039;t there? A wonderful</div><div id="00:06:35.040" class="transcript_line"> headmaster, I can&#039;t think what his name was now. Mr Price. Mr Price, he was a good headmaster.</div><div id="00:06:40.640" class="transcript_line"> And then we went to the big school, Secondary Modern, which we thought was massive. We</div><div id="00:06:46.040" class="transcript_line"> had a lot of fun up there but I think the most that was in the school was ninety odd</div><div id="00:06:50.920" class="transcript_line"> then, you know we had a lot of fun and farm children came, most of them come to Brindale</div><div id="00:06:57.520" class="transcript_line"> School. We used to call the ones who went to Landrinders Grammar School county cabbage.</div><div id="00:07:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Alright. And what are your memories of Bryn Tyrion? Did you enjoy sport there Roy? Oh</div><div id="00:07:14.800" class="transcript_line"> yes I loved sport, yeah it was good, good all round really, like I enjoyed it up there.</div><div id="00:07:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Were you in the football team? Yes I played for Radisher Schools, Wynn Lloyd and myself</div><div id="00:07:28.520" class="transcript_line"> and Pinchy, yeah. We hardly won a game. Taking part that counts. And your school subjects</div><div id="00:07:38.600" class="transcript_line"> then, did you have any favourites? I quite like maths, I hope that&#039;s a spell in, I still</div><div id="00:07:43.520" class="transcript_line"> am a bit like isn&#039;t it, you know. My wife always says she thinks I was a little bit</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> dyslectic the way I used to pronounce things. She said of course today they pick it up,</div><div id="00:07:53.440" class="transcript_line"> you know. No we had happy times eh. I didn&#039;t like being in the choir. Friday was choir</div><div id="00:08:01.400" class="transcript_line"> day or gardening so we all went gardening instead of being in the choir. And where did</div><div id="00:08:06.680" class="transcript_line"> you do the gardening Roy? Well they did start up, they used to be up where Ainsley Richards</div><div id="00:08:12.600" class="transcript_line"> lives now, up behind there. They started to dig some of the ground up. Now that I know</div><div id="00:08:18.760" class="transcript_line"> a bit about gardening nothing grew there much because there was trees everywhere and it</div><div id="00:08:22.200" class="transcript_line"> took everything out of the soil. And when we were in the garden digging it we used to</div><div id="00:08:28.200" class="transcript_line"> find bullets because the army were billeted up there during the war and they used to go</div><div id="00:08:34.600" class="transcript_line"> practising in the field behind. They were all dads most of them like isn&#039;t they. So</div><div id="00:08:41.080" class="transcript_line"> did you have a lot of time trying to find all these bullet holes? No it&#039;s just that</div><div id="00:08:45.680" class="transcript_line"> when we were digging the garden and we were picking them up like isn&#039;t it. Of course</div><div id="00:08:52.480" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t know if they were alive or dead then like isn&#039;t it. And another time we started</div><div id="00:09:00.120" class="transcript_line"> to be, it seems dull today but on a Friday afternoon we used to go up to where the car</div><div id="00:09:07.440" class="transcript_line"> park is now, that was part of the big old house then before it was pulled down. And</div><div id="00:09:13.320" class="transcript_line"> we started to dig down and clear the old cellar out which was there with stones and</div><div id="00:09:18.880" class="transcript_line"> we were tipping them in the wood because we were going to make a swimming pool there.</div><div id="00:09:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So we were all up there every Friday for an hour for a long time doing it. And once we</div><div id="00:09:28.120" class="transcript_line"> dug it out after they built the one that was in the school then, the local people collected</div><div id="00:09:34.720" class="transcript_line"> the money for it. So they filled the cellar up after. And I think that was my training</div><div id="00:09:42.120" class="transcript_line"> for being in the building site lifting the stones up. Very good start. Good transition</div><div id="00:09:50.040" class="transcript_line"> from school into the building trade. So could we talk a little bit about that now, how it</div><div id="00:09:55.640" class="transcript_line"> all started and where you worked in building trade. It was in the Red area wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:00.880" class="transcript_line"> I started my time with Bernard Lloyd. In those days in school we didn&#039;t have what you call</div><div id="00:10:09.760" class="transcript_line"> a careers officer coming round much. My father said to me one day when I was ready to leave</div><div id="00:10:14.360" class="transcript_line"> school, I got you a job he said, he doesn&#039;t want any carpet but he could do with a mason</div><div id="00:10:22.440" class="transcript_line"> and that was my starting life. So he&#039;d asked Bernard Lloyd, so I started with Bernard then.</div><div id="00:10:29.520" class="transcript_line"> We never went to college then. Bernard said if you go to college you&#039;ll swallow the union</div><div id="00:10:34.160" class="transcript_line"> book. It can teach you more on site which you could like you know. And when I started</div><div id="00:10:40.640" class="transcript_line"> I was mixing cement because I was told how can you tell a labourer how to mix cement</div><div id="00:10:45.600" class="transcript_line"> if you can&#039;t do it yourself. That was the upbringing you know. And as I said King Morgan</div><div id="00:10:51.120" class="transcript_line"> was very good to me and Dick Mitten was very good. And the Carpenter&#039;s were very good,</div><div id="00:10:55.200" class="transcript_line"> they were very skilled carpenters. John Lloyd, Bill Johnson and of course Derek Cadwallagh,</div><div id="00:11:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Ralph Oakley they were all good tradesmen then. And Bernard Lloyd now, did he have his</div><div id="00:11:08.600" class="transcript_line"> own building firm? Because I think he took on a lot of apprentices. Yeah Bernard he was</div><div id="00:11:13.680" class="transcript_line"> the main builder in town here. The only other builder at the time was Tom Morgan and Tom</div><div id="00:11:19.960" class="transcript_line"> only had his brother Idris and two other boys but Bernard had the majority. I think there</div><div id="00:11:25.720" class="transcript_line"> was 20 working for Bernard when I started. And where did you work? I believe you mentioned</div><div id="00:11:34.720" class="transcript_line"> the Therrow estate. We used to go up there patching the barns up round town putting slates</div><div id="00:11:41.240" class="transcript_line"> and rows all manner of little jobs like wasn&#039;t it you know. You&#039;d be pushing it up a street</div><div id="00:11:49.440" class="transcript_line"> with a wheelbarrow or a truck with a ladder on. And my friend Dick was telling me one</div><div id="00:11:54.200" class="transcript_line"> day, Dick I learnt my apprenticeship with, the bloke laboring for him then was called</div><div id="00:12:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Evan, this was Jill Williams&#039; grandfather. And Dick would say we&#039;d be pushing the wheelbarrow</div><div id="00:12:07.480" class="transcript_line"> up by the police station pitch. And he used to say to Dick, take over, this was half past</div><div id="00:12:13.440" class="transcript_line"> seven quarter to eight in the morning, take over Yonge. And he said, so Dick could get</div><div id="00:12:17.400" class="transcript_line"> the wheelbarrow to go on, Evan would go in behind the back of the Coombe tither arms</div><div id="00:12:22.120" class="transcript_line"> coming out wiping his face and he said, that feels better. He&#039;d been in for a pint that</div><div id="00:12:27.200" class="transcript_line"> time of the morning. And when they were never without a good bucket because in those days</div><div id="00:12:38.200" class="transcript_line"> the ashes were put in buckets put outside the houses because they were hot. If we had</div><div id="00:12:42.400" class="transcript_line"> a hole in our bucket they&#039;d tip the ashes into the bucket with a hole and take the good</div><div id="00:12:47.680" class="transcript_line"> bucket. They had it all worked out by the sounds of things, my word. And you&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:12:56.240" class="transcript_line"> in the building trade all your working life then? Yes, yes. Of particular interest is</div><div id="00:13:03.440" class="transcript_line"> the bread oven I believe, Dick Mitten of whom you&#039;ve been speaking, told you a little bit</div><div id="00:13:10.160" class="transcript_line"> about this and how to construct one. Could you give me any info on that? I haven&#039;t built</div><div id="00:13:14.960" class="transcript_line"> the bread oven myself but I think Dick might have done one and he was telling me what they</div><div id="00:13:19.120" class="transcript_line"> used to do. He said, I think you had roughly a two foot diameter hole, ring I should say,</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you put a brick upright which is nine inches and then a brick on top which</div><div id="00:13:33.680" class="transcript_line"> made it 13 inches and you go round like that and build the bread oven door in. And when</div><div id="00:13:40.440" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s set you filled it all up with sand and you mounted the top like an oval shape</div><div id="00:13:48.080" class="transcript_line"> and then you bricked over the top of it and when that&#039;s set it was all done in line more</div><div id="00:13:52.720" class="transcript_line"> to them but the joints were very very tight because they didn&#039;t want the fire to break</div><div id="00:13:58.440" class="transcript_line"> it up. And once that&#039;s set you open the bread oven door and pull the sand out so it was</div><div id="00:14:03.840" class="transcript_line"> still formed all then as a little place like in there. They used to put all the all the</div><div id="00:14:09.840" class="transcript_line"> bracken and sticks in the fire, get it all warm and then pull it out so the fire bricks</div><div id="00:14:16.120" class="transcript_line"> were warm and then you can just push the bread in. And would these be used in commercial</div><div id="00:14:22.520" class="transcript_line"> bakeries or? No, mostly in old farm houses, things like that. Where my brother lives now,</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I did some work up there, repaired some work and there was a massive bread oven up there</div><div id="00:14:38.160" class="transcript_line"> that was a very big one and that did the baking for the estate for the whole area. And where is</div><div id="00:14:45.120" class="transcript_line"> that? That&#039;s up in Llandinan. And I think we did some work years and years ago for Elwyn at the</div><div id="00:14:52.080" class="transcript_line"> Lyon Hotel. Elwyn asked Dick was there a do you think there&#039;s a fire grate, an old-fashioned fire</div><div id="00:14:59.600" class="transcript_line"> grate? And Dick said well yes, he said if it&#039;s an eight foot opening and about that four foot</div><div id="00:15:04.960" class="transcript_line"> return it&#039;s surely a big grate. So Elwyn and William, they had I don&#039;t know how many tonnes</div><div id="00:15:12.080" class="transcript_line"> of stone out from there and we we did it up the oak beam and all but in the corner if I</div><div id="00:15:19.360" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t been in there for years now in the corner there&#039;s a baking oven and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s one is</div><div id="00:15:25.120" class="transcript_line"> dead out of stone and you don&#039;t often see a baked bread oven dead out of stone but see the lion is</div><div id="00:15:31.280" class="transcript_line"> that old I suppose he didn&#039;t have fire bricks in them days you know so I&#039;m gonna go one day into</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> the lion to see was I right was it a stone one I think back of my mind it was like you know.</div><div id="00:15:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me exactly where the lion is in in Raerder Roy?

Oh before we finish yes we&#039;d better talk about the peak hadn&#039;t we and um your</div><div id="00:17:23.840" class="transcript_line"> contribution to the new peak yes I&#039;d like to see the photograph but could you tell us a bit about</div><div id="00:17:29.280" class="transcript_line"> the well the peak it was all done just mounds of stone where people have been climbing up it and</div><div id="00:17:37.280" class="transcript_line"> it kept falling down and David Evans David Lloyd who was the mayor of course David&#039;s passed away</div><div id="00:17:43.440" class="transcript_line"> many years ago they did a mayor&#039;s project and he approached Dick about rebuilding it and Dick was</div><div id="00:17:51.280" class="transcript_line"> the main man behind it all and a gang of men went up a couple of days before and pulled it down</div><div id="00:17:59.920" class="transcript_line"> and Dick made a template to build the peak he had one of these uprights he used to have on the</div><div id="00:18:07.040" class="transcript_line"> old big H television aerials and he fixed a piece of hardwood on the top about two foot six</div><div id="00:18:13.920" class="transcript_line"> diameter or two foot diameter the top made loads of holes in it and he went up two days before fixed</div><div id="00:18:21.920" class="transcript_line"> it up cemented in this place then we put string then through these holes all the way down to shape</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> the radius of and tapered of the actual stonework so all we have to do then is follow the lines to</div><div id="00:18:36.480" class="transcript_line"> go on up and I think there&#039;s about 20 the three of us doing the building Dick Mitten Les Farme</div><div id="00:18:43.520" class="transcript_line"> and myself and there&#039;s about 20 people up this Sunday mixing the cement and we thought we&#039;d be</div><div id="00:18:51.520" class="transcript_line"> back in town before the pub shut on a Sunday at two o&#039;clock they used to and we ran out of cement</div><div id="00:18:57.760" class="transcript_line"> so we were late coming down and the pubs were shut and you were looking forward to a drink</div><div id="00:19:03.040" class="transcript_line"> and there was a time capsule built in there and and when was this what year roughly was this</div><div id="00:19:11.120" class="transcript_line"> oh what decade perhaps I think I was 27 now and I&#039;ll get if I get your photograph the date is on it</div><div id="00:19:21.520" class="transcript_line"> all right yes that that that would be lovely yes super super</div><div id="00:19:36.160" class="transcript_line"> well thank you for getting the photographs Roy we&#039;ve established now of course that</div><div id="00:19:41.440" class="transcript_line"> it was 1977 the um I suppose that&#039;ll be the Queen&#039;s silver jubilee am I right yeah</div><div id="00:19:47.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah there&#039;s a television pipe the pipe at the top of the peak and then we had this thing going</div><div id="00:19:58.240" class="transcript_line"> round and we put lines all the way down we just had to keep following it round and round and round</div><div id="00:20:03.600" class="transcript_line"> till we got to the top all right so that&#039;s how how you built it yes and the um the peak as we call it</div><div id="00:20:10.320" class="transcript_line"> of course that&#039;s a very prominent landmark yes um on the top of guastedin are I correct yes the</div><div id="00:20:16.160" class="transcript_line"> mountain overlooking and there&#039;s a lovely photograph here of all the local people</div><div id="00:20:20.480" class="transcript_line"> mainly farmers who were involved in that can in in that construction absolutely lovely um</div><div id="00:20:28.240" class="transcript_line"> now you you mentioned your father that he&#039;d worked on the corporation up in the the eland valley not</div><div id="00:20:35.200" class="transcript_line"> far from here uh can can you tell me what he did and one special garment that you kept from him</div><div id="00:20:42.960" class="transcript_line"> well he worked he ended up a general foreman up there but they worked on the filter beds and</div><div id="00:20:49.200" class="transcript_line"> and there was about 40 in their gang then like they used to filter the water from one bed to</div><div id="00:20:54.480" class="transcript_line"> the other and so on but today it&#039;s left goes all the way down the pipes to to Birmingham now to</div><div id="00:21:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Franklin like isn&#039;t it but in the end days the water was clean when it left here but because</div><div id="00:21:06.560" class="transcript_line"> there were so many seepages into the pipe track it had to be filtered the other end so they</div><div id="00:21:12.560" class="transcript_line"> they more or less did away with a lot of it up there then he was up there for many years</div><div id="00:21:18.400" class="transcript_line"> yeah I see and he was originally from where Roy Pantador he was born and then he came down</div><div id="00:21:26.640" class="transcript_line"> to live in raider then rest of your life Pantador being a little village about three or four months</div><div id="00:21:31.760" class="transcript_line"> away is that correct yes on the way to family advice oh I see now I believe you contributed</div><div id="00:21:38.400" class="transcript_line"> something rather important to Carrod the donkey jacket could you could you tell us a little bit</div><div id="00:21:43.360" class="transcript_line"> about that well they were issued with these white coats we called them donkey jackets why I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:48.880" class="transcript_line"> know they could uh it was part of the issue for work and um it was a very funny the backs of them</div><div id="00:21:58.640" class="transcript_line"> sort of came in oval shape and on a wet day the blokes used to pin it up so it acted instead of</div><div id="00:22:04.560" class="transcript_line"> the water and drip it off down your legs it acted like a little truffet they turn it up and put a</div><div id="00:22:10.480" class="transcript_line"> pin in it so so the water would drop off the back of their coats better like isn&#039;t there very good</div><div id="00:22:16.400" class="transcript_line"> design yeah and then there was a some of the olden says that there was a helicopter something going</div><div id="00:22:25.280" class="transcript_line"> on in Valley and a fella said what&#039;s all the other all them sheep down on the hill and they said oh</div><div id="00:22:30.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s in shape as Birmingham Corporation workers because they were real white they were these coats</div><div id="00:22:36.640" class="transcript_line"> so I I was in my garage for years it was sentimental value so I give to Carrod because</div><div id="00:22:42.240" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t want it like isn&#039;t it yeah well at least people can see it and have a glimpse into how</div><div id="00:22:49.440" class="transcript_line"> people were yes well right what changes have you seen in red particularly with regard to the way</div><div id="00:22:57.680" class="transcript_line"> industry has gone I know there&#039;s quite a few in industry that&#039;s come and gone in this in the estate</div><div id="00:23:04.720" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t there yes well when I was I can remember the factory at Brunavon factory my sister and my</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> brother worked there for a while they were making sun visors for the car industry then that closed</div><div id="00:23:17.760" class="transcript_line"> and then Ray Hicks very play to me started compact that autumn of years wasn&#039;t it and then</div><div id="00:23:23.760" class="transcript_line"> they were taken over they had two shifts down there people from Birmingham came to work here</div><div id="00:23:28.160" class="transcript_line"> then and there was about 50 odd people working there apparently and then we had priest jacksons</div><div id="00:23:36.080" class="transcript_line"> that was a big outfit again and then we had uh what did they make um right priest bolts and</div><div id="00:23:44.960" class="transcript_line"> things like that you know and was that down on the brim berth yes yeah industry it&#039;s uh far um</div><div id="00:23:51.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s next to radar rbs now but it it&#039;s like a um oh food place now I know we got two but</div><div id="00:24:00.800" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s rbs it philip pew added and it was like farm food and stuff to start with yeah</div><div id="00:24:08.160" class="transcript_line"> and then the other side the brook they weren&#039;t there then when we were small</div><div id="00:24:12.400" class="transcript_line"> what we called the glass factory but that&#039;s still there but it didn&#039;t operating like it used to you</div><div id="00:24:18.240" class="transcript_line"> know the thing that things have changed yes perhaps attitudes have had as well and you</div><div id="00:24:25.200" class="transcript_line"> were mentioning something about the motto that um was it dick mitten said or king all king morgan</div><div id="00:24:30.960" class="transcript_line"> he said to me his advice he gave to you yeah when i started the first week at work he said</div><div id="00:24:36.960" class="transcript_line"> roi three things to remember on the building site life limb and property and always think of the</div><div id="00:24:43.760" class="transcript_line"> man coming behind you what he meant by that is do your work tidy so it&#039;s right for the carpenter</div><div id="00:24:49.600" class="transcript_line"> and stuff after but today they&#039;ve come and gone those days are gone it&#039;s number one now look after</div><div id="00:24:56.560" class="transcript_line"> number one but he was he was very very good that&#039;s a very wise words i&#039;m sure which probably stuck</div><div id="00:25:03.520" class="transcript_line"> with you yeah oh it always stuck with you all your life yeah yes yes and he is a character he</div><div id="00:25:10.560" class="transcript_line"> always told me to um he i

great deal okay boy</div><div id="00:25:23.520" class="transcript_line"> well look here he said what you do when you go to the toilet he well you go do what you want and</div><div id="00:25:29.840" class="transcript_line"> he flushed flush the toilet and he said that&#039;s what i drink water for it&#039;s my way of flushing me out</div><div id="00:25:37.360" class="transcript_line"> and they should all do it he said again more wise words yes yes and i mean they&#039;re going back 50</div><div id="00:25:43.520" class="transcript_line"> years now and i used to think well what is he on about

dehydrated</div><div id="00:25:56.320" class="transcript_line"> fine so on the whole you&#039;ve had a very happy life really very interesting oh yes i would never go</div><div id="00:26:01.440" class="transcript_line"> from raider never no but we&#039;re saying like the likes of emras and them fellas like we were always</div><div id="00:26:11.440" class="transcript_line"> called if you&#039;re born and bred in raider he was a boogie boy because that&#039;s that&#039;s where you&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:26:16.880" class="transcript_line"> born but now there&#039;s not many of us left now brian poor old brian lauras always used to say there&#039;s</div><div id="00:26:23.920" class="transcript_line"> not many of us boogie boys left now who were born and bred here you know some people have been here</div><div id="00:26:29.200" class="transcript_line"> perhaps for five or six years but it&#039;s not the same as being born here that&#039;s right and the boogie</div><div id="00:26:34.480" class="transcript_line"> why why why do you call it the boogie well it starts up by brinterian school doesn&#039;t it the</div><div id="00:26:39.200" class="transcript_line"> boogie i think yeah and somebody brian used to say if you if you padlo went in the boogie you&#039;re here</div><div id="00:26:46.320" class="transcript_line"> for life or something he used to say because that used to go all the way through town didn&#039;t it you</div><div id="00:26:51.200" class="transcript_line"> know am i right in thinking they they put it underground but it&#039;s still there somewhere it&#039;s</div><div id="00:26:58.000" class="transcript_line"> at the opposite the lodge in brinterian school it&#039;s been piped up but there was a pond there</div><div id="00:27:02.880" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where it started it went across the road down the brook by dr evan says and then</div><div id="00:27:10.480" class="transcript_line"> where you go into my scene and there was another big pool on the side of the road there</div><div id="00:27:14.960" class="transcript_line"> then they went down north street west street and then down to the river and it&#039;s all piped after</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> so it goes into the river wide as it river wide eventually yes yeah so they tell us all like</div><div id="00:27:30.560" class="transcript_line"> but we can&#039;t see any of it now we take it no no no the the pond by the up by brinterian like</div><div id="00:27:39.760" class="transcript_line"> we used to go there you see frog spawns and stuff and all that that in there but</div><div id="00:27:43.600" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s all it&#039;s hardly anything there now because it&#039;s been piped</div><div id="00:27:47.440" class="transcript_line"> hmm well one of the changes are rarer but the the legacy lives on where we people</div><div id="00:27:54.720" class="transcript_line"> yeah that&#039;s right yeah well i think we&#039;ve covered most things now haven&#039;t we but i&#039;m so glad i&#039;ve</div><div id="00:28:01.760" class="transcript_line"> seen these lovely pictures and you were showing me some of school as well which brings back a lot</div><div id="00:28:06.160" class="transcript_line"> of memories for you yeah yes lovely right well thank you thank you very much for your time

class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re dealing with them and there&#039;s always a link isn&#039;t there somehow with the eland valley</div><div id="00:28:25.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s yeah another thing we used to do when we were young we used to go up to the station catch the</div><div id="00:28:31.680" class="transcript_line"> train and go as far as martick to go whimpering that was a big thing we&#039;d be all up in the hill</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> picking whimperies yeah then the railway of course is no more no it&#039;s a shame really</div><div id="00:28:45.600" class="transcript_line"> yeah so martick which direction would that be in that up the lingering road</div><div id="00:28:52.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah am i right in thinking that sometimes people used to sell the whimperies they&#039;d pick to</div><div id="00:28:58.320" class="transcript_line"> the people on the trains yeah used to go and pick whimperies come back to town there yeah</div><div id="00:29:03.120" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d be up there all afternoon picking whimperies yeah</div><div id="00:29:07.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah it&#039;s very sad to see the railway go and it&#039;d be a godsend to david or still there wouldn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:29:13.840" class="transcript_line"> i would think yes you never know see
