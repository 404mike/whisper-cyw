Nothing was ever too much trouble for him. He was the most generous</div><div id="00:00:14.220" class="transcript_line"> person you would ever wish to meet. He never charged any charity or anybody for anything.</div><div id="00:00:21.080" class="transcript_line"> Even to this day I&#039;ve had conversations with people who remember him from those days. Even</div><div id="00:00:27.340" class="transcript_line"> An old teacher of mine from Marlborough Road School where he used to give them the decorations</div><div id="00:00:34.240" class="transcript_line"> at Christmas to decorate the school via us, myself and my two sisters. My recollections</div><div id="00:00:40.900" class="transcript_line"> of him, he smoked until he was about 75. He never ever took a driving test. He drove on</div><div id="00:00:47.580" class="transcript_line"> the wrong side of the road. If anybody was in his way he would just beep and it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:52.460" class="transcript_line"> until the age of, I think he was about 90 that his license was taken away from him after</div><div id="00:00:58.100" class="transcript_line"> he had an accident with a Rolls Royce. In my youth, obviously I was very close to Monty,</div><div id="00:01:05.100" class="transcript_line"> he used to take me to the football and introduce me to Cardiff City, which I still support</div><div id="00:01:12.100" class="transcript_line"> today. When I was very, very young, sort of under the age of 10, he used to take me along</div><div id="00:01:22.220" class="transcript_line"> and he was very friendly with all the police officers. He knew everybody and he used to</div><div id="00:01:27.460" class="transcript_line"> hand me to a police officer and tell him to take me into the ground and he used to walk</div><div id="00:01:32.460" class="transcript_line"> me through the front door down the tunnel and lift me up and put me into the enclosure</div><div id="00:01:39.540" class="transcript_line"> and tell whoever I was standing next to to look after me till after the game. I&#039;d watch</div><div id="00:01:43.700" class="transcript_line"> the game and then the policeman would come and pick me up and I remember his name was</div><div id="00:01:47.740" class="transcript_line"> Sergeant Perks and he used to pick me up and take me back out and give me back to my grandfather</div><div id="00:01:53.060" class="transcript_line"> who would then take me home. And then in 1967, at the age of 12, I got my first season ticket</div><div id="00:02:02.140" class="transcript_line"> and I used to sit up in the grandstand near my grandfather and the fishers and I&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:02:09.700" class="transcript_line"> a supporter ever since.</div></div></p>
