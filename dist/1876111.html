It sounds ghastly if I say it like that,</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but he was very introspective and very analytical about everything, not just his work.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He had very delicate hands and delicate fingers and his work had the same delicacy and I thought it was quite unique.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We both felt that because of our background and everything that had happened that we were outsiders</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and that we couldn&#039;t somehow be accepted by the art establishment.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he bought an old farm in Wales and finally he left teaching and settled in Wales on that farm</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and turned it into his own little empire where he produced very interesting and intricate paintings that I liked very much.</div></div></p>
