    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But also in the 1860s they rebuilt the church.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There was really no church here after the dissolution until about 1680 when John Fowler, who was actively managing the estate for the Fowler family at the Brontrival,</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> built a church on the little bit of flat land. If you look at the present church there&#039;s a little ledge just below the flat land, just below the steps.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where the original church was. The Phillips rebuilt because they had connections with the church and Anna Phillips,</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> the lady of the manor at the time, was the daughter of the bickerstopport. And he&#039;d been bickerstopport for 47 years, as they did in those days.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was rebuilt because they wanted to create a church which had all the features of Anglican revival.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The original church was very simple. If you&#039;ve been to a little place called Reatham, which is down near Aberdeen, it&#039;s just a single room type of church.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Not very big, but very beautiful. And that&#039;s what Fowler built. They took that down and built this church, which is modelled on a church in Brittany.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But the inside is laid out, conforms with the thinking of a group of people called Tractarians, who were sometimes just Anglican revival.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What they were trying to do was get the churches back to what they might have looked like before the Reformation.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And everything within it has a significance. And you have the font near the door, which we see. As you get nearer and nearer the altar, the sanctuary, you go up a level.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you&#039;re getting towards the Holy of Holies. And then you have the sanctuary, which is the baptismal in our church, which was the name focal point of it.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And as you get nearer and nearer, the decoration becomes more elaborate. And it was the great glory, the church&#039;s stained glass windows.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The connoisseur of stained glass must be a wonderful find, because the windows at the east end are by a term of glass artists, they would call themselves artists rather than just glass makers, called Heaton, Butler and Bane.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were very prolific. And they made stained glass windows to order for Queen Victoria, and they were royal warrants, and they were really worth the tops.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And for the Philips, money was no object. They would make big money out of their mills in Stockport.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The west window, it&#039;s a lovely rose window, if we ever get back into it, is by another London glass artist, a company of Clayton Bell.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think by common consent it is the best west window in Ladinusher, because it&#039;s the lovely rose window with different panels.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And you need to go in on a lovely sunny day, and they are absolutely fantastic windows.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was all paid for at the expense of the Philips.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We often think of Victorians as being rather altruistic and great restorers of churches which were falling to bits.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no evidence that the church here was actually falling to bits, because Thomas Wilson had given it a good overhaul.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But the ulterior motive was pursuing the Anglo-Patholicism, and it was more for religious reasons than altruistic.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to do the church up because it&#039;s leaking in its drafty. They had a different reason.</div></div></p>
