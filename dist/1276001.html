    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 16 of our series in relation to the race riots in Wales in</div><div id="00:00:07.840" class="transcript_line"> 1919, June 1919. Chapter 16 is Cardiff riots. Black men in court that&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:17.400" class="transcript_line"> Afro-Caribbean, Arab mainly and African. This is part two of the Cardiff riots.</div><div id="00:00:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Black men found guilty in Swansea Court as a result of their role in the Cardiff</div><div id="00:00:30.400" class="transcript_line"> riots. Well despite 15 men being taken to court, some with very obvious injuries,</div><div id="00:00:37.280" class="transcript_line"> the court acted in a reasonable and fair way towards them. The press may have</div><div id="00:00:42.800" class="transcript_line"> placed all the blame on the black people of Butetown and Grangetown but the court</div><div id="00:00:47.520" class="transcript_line"> did not. The offences punished were largely unavoidable in terms of</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> punishment. They were mainly gun related in relation to violence towards the</div><div id="00:00:58.840" class="transcript_line"> police and shooting directly into the crowd. Black men found guilty were</div><div id="00:01:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Muhammad Ali, Ali Abdul, Ivor Gabriel Lansman and Muhammad Qayyid also known as</div><div id="00:01:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Ahmed Khalad. So only four men were found guilty. Others found not guilty or no</div><div id="00:01:20.440" class="transcript_line"> evidence presented were Ishmael Muhammad, Cham Ali, Sali Abdullah, Sayyid</div><div id="00:01:28.200" class="transcript_line"> bin Sayyid, Farah Muhammad, Muhammad Hassan, John Tucker, Muhammad Sharif, Issa</div><div id="00:01:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Muhammad, Muhammad Abederi and John Abdullah. So the four black men</div><div id="00:01:43.480" class="transcript_line"> who found guilty was sentenced to prison in Swansea Court. The four men were as I</div><div id="00:01:48.400" class="transcript_line"> say Ali Abdul who was age 26, a fireman on the merchant ships. He was given four</div><div id="00:01:54.160" class="transcript_line"> days imprisonment for assaulting Frederick Gregory, a police constable. I</div><div id="00:01:58.760" class="transcript_line"> should add he&#039;d already been in prison for nearly seven weeks. Sub-waiting trial.</div><div id="00:02:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Ivor Gabriel Lansman was age 21, a ship&#039;s cook and he was given a three-year</div><div id="00:02:11.080" class="transcript_line"> prison sentence for shooting at Sydney Jones, William Clarke and James Coombs.</div><div id="00:02:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Ahmed Khalad known also as Muhammad Qayyid, age 25, a ship&#039;s donkeyman was</div><div id="00:02:24.200" class="transcript_line"> given 15 months hard labour for shooting at John Porter, a police constable.</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Muhammad Ali, age 27, was given three months hard labour for shooting at Henry</div><div id="00:02:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Brotherton and Ernest May. Except for John Abdullah who is listed as a</div><div id="00:02:41.280" class="transcript_line"> shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner, all of the black men were in the</div><div id="00:02:46.620" class="transcript_line"> merchant navy at the time of the riots and therefore it&#039;s extremely likely that</div><div id="00:02:51.700" class="transcript_line"> they were also involved in World War One. Now thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum</div><div id="00:02:58.020" class="transcript_line"> we know that a number of people were compensated for loss of goods and damage</div><div id="00:03:03.540" class="transcript_line"> during the riots. The bulk of those being in Butetown. Some of these were among the</div><div id="00:03:09.320" class="transcript_line"> men that appeared in court. The figures I&#039;m going to quote show the actual amount</div><div id="00:03:13.660" class="transcript_line"> received and the modern equivalent in 2017 according to the National Archives</div><div id="00:03:19.540" class="transcript_line"> in London. Muhammad Ali, now he was found guilty in court and was sentenced three</div><div id="00:03:24.620" class="transcript_line"> months hard labour. Nonetheless he received 67 pounds 10 shillings</div><div id="00:03:31.660" class="transcript_line"> compensation, a modern equivalent of a thousand one thousand nine hundred and</div><div id="00:03:37.060" class="transcript_line"> sixty-one pounds and so we can understand that in a real context what</div><div id="00:03:41.820" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re also going to do is quote what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman</div><div id="00:03:46.900" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the high level of salary. So that would have been 204 days wages for a</div><div id="00:03:55.060" class="transcript_line"> skilled tradesman at that time. John Tucker received 30 pounds that&#039;s the</div><div id="00:04:01.380" class="transcript_line"> equivalent in 2017 of 886 pounds 26 pence 92 days wages.</div><div id="00:04:09.620" class="transcript_line"> Muhammad Sharif received 14 pounds 421 pounds 34 in 2017 money and 43 days</div><div id="00:04:19.580" class="transcript_line"> wages at the time. Now John Abdullah who owned a shop and boarding house which</div><div id="00:04:26.420" class="transcript_line"> was the center of a lot of the damage received a hundred and seventy five</div><div id="00:04:31.020" class="transcript_line"> pounds. Now that&#039;s the equivalent of just over five thousand pounds and it was</div><div id="00:04:37.500" class="transcript_line"> 531 days wages. Issa Muhammad received 12 pounds 348 pounds equivalent which is</div><div id="00:04:47.940" class="transcript_line"> the equivalent of 36 days wages. Ismail Muhammad received seven pounds 203</div><div id="00:04:55.620" class="transcript_line"> pounds 14 in 2017 and 21 days wages. Sayyid bin Sayyid received four pound</div><div id="00:05:04.020" class="transcript_line"> 116 pounds 23 equivalent and 12 days wages. Fahra Muhammad received five</div><div id="00:05:11.700" class="transcript_line"> pound 145 pounds 29 equivalent and 15 days wages. Sali Abdullah received six</div><div id="00:05:20.780" class="transcript_line"> pound the equivalent of 174 pounds 35 18 days wages and Muhammad Hassan received</div><div id="00:05:28.980" class="transcript_line"> the equivalent 145 pounds 29 and 15 days wages. So although the events were</div><div id="00:05:37.700" class="transcript_line"> savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant seaman the</div><div id="00:05:42.460" class="transcript_line"> treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not</div><div id="00:05:47.020" class="transcript_line"> start the riot. Also the compensation amounts were significant at that time so</div><div id="00:05:53.860" class="transcript_line"> despite the press consistently for most of June placing the blame for the Cardiff</div><div id="00:05:59.020" class="transcript_line"> riots on black people living in Cardiff that was not the conclusion reached by</div><div id="00:06:03.500" class="transcript_line"> the court and they received compensation for loss of belongings and damage to</div><div id="00:06:07.900" class="transcript_line"> property. It&#039;s interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years</div><div id="00:06:14.020" class="transcript_line"> before the start of World War one World War two and despite racist attacks</div><div id="00:06:20.260" class="transcript_line"> brutality by white mobs and overt threat to their families these black</div><div id="00:06:25.100" class="transcript_line"> people returned to the sea in World War two to assist Britain. In World War two</div><div id="00:06:31.860" class="transcript_line"> at least 645 Arab merchant seamen serving on the British Navy merchant</div><div id="00:06:39.420" class="transcript_line"> navy died. Of the 479 men who listed their last known address 242 sailed out</div><div id="00:06:49.540" class="transcript_line"> of Wales. 30 from Barry 12 from Swansea 10 from Newport 189 from Cardiff. Our</div><div id="00:06:59.580" class="transcript_line"> research shows that 330 men born in the Caribbean died serving on the UK merchant</div><div id="00:07:06.700" class="transcript_line"> navy in World War two. 56 of those listed their last known address as Wales. Three</div><div id="00:07:13.940" class="transcript_line"> from Newport 11 from Barry and 42 from Cardiff. These men left at least 35 wives</div><div id="00:07:22.660" class="transcript_line"> behind in Wales. Also there were sisters daughters brothers and mothers listed in</div><div id="00:07:29.140" class="transcript_line"> next of kin. Now this shows that the riots racism attacks failure of</div><div id="00:07:36.180" class="transcript_line"> government unions and others to support men none of this changed their</div><div id="00:07:40.540" class="transcript_line"> commitment to settling in Wales and becoming black citizens in an often</div><div id="00:07:45.460" class="transcript_line"> unfriendly environment. This is really important because for those of us who</div><div id="00:07:52.460" class="transcript_line"> are black but of mixed race third generation nowadays and fourth and fifth</div><div id="00:08:00.700" class="transcript_line"> generation the statement of intent made by those people during and after the</div><div id="00:08:11.260" class="transcript_line"> 1919 race riots after having been involved in World War one and after a</div><div id="00:08:18.700" class="transcript_line"> tremendous loss of life in World War one within their community that statement</div><div id="00:08:23.780" class="transcript_line"> is why we&#039;re citizens of Wales today. Now in chapters 17 to 20 will show the</div><div id="00:08:31.540" class="transcript_line"> brutality of the environment in the United States an environment that also</div><div id="00:08:36.940" class="transcript_line"> had race riots in 1919 an environment ruled by Britain&#039;s closest allies.</div></div></p>
