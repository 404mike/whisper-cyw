class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s very old.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They have four lots making on them, I suppose.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to see this, it used to grow a while.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it was in the garden.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> What used to happen on, um, jacking apple night then?</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Halloween.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we had a marvellous night.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The boys were dressing girls clothes.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, all kinds of things.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> All dressed up, like a carnival.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to come round, in stockings, they&#039;d come round to the mariloui.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the mariloui?</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> A horse&#039;s head.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve heard of it?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, things were happening.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They had them in Cornwall.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They had mariloui.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they used to carry lights around with them.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;d go to, some used to come in, and they&#039;d have parapetries and sandwiches.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Although people had the door open, they did it.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d go tap on the floor.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> This is South Wales.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> South Wales, North Wales, no.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> North Wales is Christmas time.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> New Year&#039;s Eve.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Halloween in North Wales, nothing very much.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Lottery New Year&#039;s Eve in North Wales.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what they used to do?</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Take people&#039;s gates off.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And hide them.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And perhaps you&#039;d live in 100, or next morning when you get up you were living in number 2, perhaps.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a search going round for the gates.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to go to powerhouses.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll tell you what they did in one powerhouse, and my father helped to do it.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They had, to go to the dairy, there were two steps to go down.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> From the yard.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Two steps to go down.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the yard was a big waterbath.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And what they did, they rolled the waterbath,</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d pass these steps to the door to go to the dairy.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d put the waterbath down to leave on the door.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And they rang, banged the door, and the farmer goes up to the garden, and as he went out,</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> the waterbath chipped into the dairy.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And he fired off the garden.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember it happening.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I was about 7 years of age and my mother was furious with him.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That means you were at this place.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be 1905.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No doubt you were a life-borrowers, I think, at that time.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d go to people&#039;s houses and they&#039;d have a big tub full of water and full of apples,</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and there was a little man hanging.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a marvelous time.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And every session we&#039;d go down the road with Mary-Louise singing.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Any kind of...</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a special song in South Wales.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know it.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a special song for it.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But in old Wales we always had it on New Year&#039;s Eve,</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> around the Christmas time that week.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of things were done.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t go with my grandfather as we were curious.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You know the red gate as you go in the drive?</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that gate we found in the panthorne,</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> across the way with the rabbit warren.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We found there lots of things belonging to other people in the little heap.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> For sale.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You would see the fun they had in the country.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> All customs rich.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, I thought, between Easter and Whitsun,</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> there used to be a competition, singing.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And you village come to my...</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There were three or four villages together.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would compete.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And from the school of...</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When I got from the university,</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> some of the musicians used to come along.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d do a shooting case.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then some band.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then a harpist.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> A real awesome violin, you know.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would be clogged dancing.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of things rich.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> When did this die out?</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Or how did that die out?</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It hasn&#039;t died out in the country.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It hasn&#039;t died out in the country.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And then that was...</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you were angry with them.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Your grandparents were on mainland.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we were on the mainland and my grandparents were in Andorra City.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But my father&#039;s family were up from...</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Go over a little bridge.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I told you my father told me there were some little boys playing on that bridge.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> There had been a king there years ago where the two just had a trowel.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They were throwing.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what it is?</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> A village up to you lean over and go over a little stone bridge.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well now my father&#039;s family were from there.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Farmers again.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can see in everything else,</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and you look over the water to the other side,</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> the bay can be seen.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Over the other side is where my father&#039;s family came from.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> By the Bay of Davies.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, not young.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Not young.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Not the bay with the rocks covered in them down.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That is the one that are also on the main dam.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Here is the one that are also on the main dam.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The other side around us.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t care.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the problem with the one that&#039;s covered in dam?</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather was here in the land.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Some time ago.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, probably 1860.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> 1850, 1850, 1860.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, was it not...</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was with the school children.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Often up to that sort of...</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Was that the school children who did that sort of thing?</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, in your town?</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They have changed.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And you like it.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I got you a tube.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmothers were there.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They were still the bankers.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The politicians, they just needed to appreciate.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I got a chair.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;re not carrying on.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I got a chair with W.J. on it.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> My father did that.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a little...</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s one of...</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And he could do with you.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got that in your house, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a little...</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You like to have it, Steve?</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> A little brown carver&#039;s chair.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> A little lounge chair.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s made by...</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been made.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s handmade.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s handmade.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And the whole goodie kitchen chair.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw that being made.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Who brought it?</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a little girl.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was six or seven years of age.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a little later in the family again.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And you still got that...</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They were all tradespeople.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And you got the cow horn.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> No, my wife got it.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a grandmothers&#039; look.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, I gave this one out.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a cow horn.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It was made out of the whole thing.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It was made out of the whole...</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a cow horn.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And afterwards I thought I should maybe give you...</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The name was on it was the Choo Choo.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was Nell&#039;s grandmothers.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmothers.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And Stephen, I can always remember...</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Going to my family&#039;s...</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad went to South Wales to work.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he used to do...</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the quarries closed...</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember it...</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to do sandals.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the horses here...</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my grandfather.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my grand...</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the quarries closed, he went to South Wales to work with quarry brothers.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t like the way they were doing it.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So he went to work on the quarry and not repairing.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was just...</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a sadler, to be very true.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And he always made old boots and shoes.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know when there&#039;s a sewing machine?</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> When Dad had a sewing machine of his own.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, a big one.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother changed it for that one.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it was.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They used hogs...</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Hogs and bristles for sewing.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh!</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Stephen, it was interesting.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to buy a bowl of something like cotton.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, can&#039;t tell you what a cotton was like.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t pull it like that.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It would break into pieces.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you tell me that you were sure?</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Linen.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it wasn&#039;t linen.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a kind of...</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> A plaques.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> A plaques.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You could pull it a bit.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d have a hook.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> On a door post.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> A door post.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And it put this stuff...</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got six or seven strands of it.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Throw it on the wrist.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And move.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d have a piece of</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> cobblest wax.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And especially brown.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> What is cobblest wax?</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I

career, when there was a funeral in the village, or</div><div id="00:33:55.000" class="transcript_line"> anywhere, out there would be a committee formed.</div><div id="00:33:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d take our socials down.</div><div id="00:34:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But how does it really take care of it?</div><div id="00:34:06.000" class="transcript_line"> At the day of the funeral, Stephen, a man would sit outside the door with a dead person.</div><div id="00:34:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the whole village got involved.</div><div id="00:34:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The whole village got involved.</div><div id="00:34:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d have a basin in front of it, a white cloth, had to be a white cloth on the table,</div><div id="00:34:25.000" class="transcript_line"> a basin on it, and a white cloth on the basin.</div><div id="00:34:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And as you went, you passed, you put a couple of coffers in, you were shilling in, got your</div><div id="00:34:35.000" class="transcript_line"> six-pence in, and when the basin was full, it gave you to the dead person&#039;s life, or</div><div id="00:34:41.000" class="transcript_line"> to the dead person at the table, you know, and that.</div><div id="00:34:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, you&#039;re saying that, like that, and literally they took you down to the family&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:52.000" class="transcript_line"> town.</div><div id="00:34:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The family really didn&#039;t get involved at all.</div><div id="00:34:56.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:34:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Not at all.</div><div id="00:34:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, Irene Dramal, my mother had a trench in Hughes.</div><div id="00:35:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Her husband died in Abercannon, with pneumonia.</div><div id="00:35:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he drove from the south way to Begherie, back to the north way, from the south way,</div><div id="00:35:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and it didn&#039;t cost her a penny.</div><div id="00:35:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is that?</div><div id="00:35:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we all corrected for it.</div><div id="00:35:18.000" class="transcript_line"> In the street?</div><div id="00:35:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Right from the village to a couple of villages.</div><div id="00:35:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, this is for you under South Wales.</div><div id="00:35:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll tell you something.</div><div id="00:35:26.000" class="transcript_line"> My granny, Nell&#039;s mother, had a sister, Auntie Grace, who was serving long was the Captain</div><div id="00:35:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Jones.</div><div id="00:35:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I showed her his grave.</div><div id="00:35:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in Flanbigh, Keechie, Cherokee.</div><div id="00:35:39.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:35:40.000" class="transcript_line"> One coat, not one coat in the lot.</div><div id="00:35:42.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but he was not down by a train.</div><div id="00:35:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He went on a lever crossing, and he noticed him through.</div><div id="00:35:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He was on a van, I forget the name, but it was called George.</div><div id="00:35:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Keechie, we used to be on the same boat.</div><div id="00:35:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We were on the same boat, yes.</div><div id="00:35:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We were on the same boat.</div><div id="00:36:02.000" class="transcript_line"> One of his sons, I know, is a fine count of Cherokee, in Brady.</div><div id="00:36:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Or what?</div><div id="00:36:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Or what?</div><div id="00:36:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Triad.</div><div id="00:36:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Just want to tell you something.</div><div id="00:36:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember Auntie Grace saying, and now we&#039;re telling you when this happened, I can</div><div id="00:36:20.000" class="transcript_line"> remember.</div><div id="00:36:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember when the Captain was still there on the island, and the man was there, they</div><div id="00:36:24.000" class="transcript_line"> paid the undertaker and all his senses to kill him.</div><div id="00:36:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they would go round to the city and see his family, all the money, and he figured</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> he made another collection in the clear of the lot.</div><div id="00:36:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So they started from scratch.</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And the woman didn&#039;t have, there was no intention, she went on the...</div><div id="00:36:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Parish.</div><div id="00:36:46.000" class="transcript_line"> On the parish.</div><div id="00:36:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What about now, before that death, what about births when a baby was born?</div><div id="00:36:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t anything like that happening, no.</div><div id="00:36:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There was just, there was a lot of births.</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a lot of children.</div><div id="00:36:58.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of children dying.</div><div id="00:36:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What about marriages?</div><div id="00:37:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Haven&#039;t you got a couple that married?</div><div id="00:37:04.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:37:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a do.</div><div id="00:37:07.000" class="transcript_line"> All the villages trimmed up and flags, you know, I think for a carnival, we were that.</div><div id="00:37:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody went, I can&#039;t remember my number, when you lay tables in a chapel, in</div><div id="00:37:22.000" class="transcript_line"> the Khamar Chapel history, there were a chapel people.</div><div id="00:37:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And a big two worlds contributed to all the wedding reception.</div><div id="00:37:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:37:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody went to their own house.</div><div id="00:37:34.000" class="transcript_line"> A house ready for them.</div><div id="00:37:37.000" class="transcript_line"> A house ready for them.</div><div id="00:37:39.000" class="transcript_line"> How was that ready?</div><div id="00:37:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It was ready to go quarry again.</div><div id="00:37:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It can be quarry committee.</div><div id="00:37:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If all the houses were quarried, what happened then?</div><div id="00:37:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They were always empty houses.</div><div id="00:37:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:37:52.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather, Richard Jones.</div><div id="00:37:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they actually buy their own houses?</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember Stephen, my grandfather, Richard Jones.</div><div id="00:37:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Who would be rented out of it?</div><div id="00:38:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were rented houses, because they were all quarry houses, you hear it.</div><div id="00:38:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you something.</div><div id="00:38:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather, as you know, father Richard Jones, came to that country during the living</div><div id="00:38:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and he saw a whole row of cottages.</div><div id="00:38:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone empty.</div><div id="00:38:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wanted to open building walls.</div><div id="00:38:22.000" class="transcript_line"> In having all those walls that were there now.</div><div id="00:38:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went to the state agent in Pantagai and he said, how much do you want for those</div><div id="00:38:34.000" class="transcript_line"> 20 houses?</div><div id="00:38:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was 20 houses.</div><div id="00:38:37.000" class="transcript_line"> 10 houses.</div><div id="00:38:39.000" class="transcript_line"> 10 houses.</div><div id="00:38:40.000" class="transcript_line"> 2 pounds each, right, he said.</div><div id="00:38:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I only want the stone.</div><div id="00:38:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The rest, he said, I want some size so you can have.</div><div id="00:38:47.000" class="transcript_line"> All great, so much.</div><div id="00:38:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re lovely, very interesting.</div><div id="00:38:50.000" class="transcript_line"> 2 pounds each?</div><div id="00:38:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He got 2 pounds each for the stone and he cried away.</div><div id="00:38:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it took weeks and weeks and weeks.</div><div id="00:38:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What work year was this, roughly?</div><div id="00:39:03.000" class="transcript_line"> What about, how much was the rent then?</div><div id="00:39:06.000" class="transcript_line"> How much was the rent then?</div><div id="00:39:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Half a grand each.</div><div id="00:39:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What is that?</div><div id="00:39:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can easily pay for a house in 2 pounds per house.</div><div id="00:39:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the house we lived in was our own house.</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandfather told me for 100 pounds, he gave me one to sell to Richard.</div><div id="00:39:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know the house.</div><div id="00:39:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a lot of money.</div><div id="00:39:23.000" class="transcript_line"> 100 pounds, really considerate of 1939, 3,400.</div><div id="00:39:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it was villa time.</div><div id="00:39:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t buy anything?</div><div id="00:39:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:39:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Perfect.</div><div id="00:39:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Come on.</div><div id="00:39:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You can hardly believe this has happened.</div></div></p>
