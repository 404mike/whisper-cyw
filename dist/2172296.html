    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll ask you a little question to keep the narrative going.</div><div id="00:00:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Somali, you said your father was a self-made man.</div><div id="00:00:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me, when he came to Uganda,</div><div id="00:00:14.480" class="transcript_line"> did he come to work on the railways,</div><div id="00:00:16.800" class="transcript_line"> or did he come for other purposes?</div><div id="00:00:19.400" class="transcript_line"> And then how did he create his wealth?</div><div id="00:00:21.640" class="transcript_line"> So he came to, it wasn&#039;t the railways.</div><div id="00:00:25.240" class="transcript_line"> My father came with setting up his own business idea.</div><div id="00:00:31.840" class="transcript_line"> So he had like a retail business,</div><div id="00:00:34.960" class="transcript_line"> and he would import products.</div><div id="00:00:38.240" class="transcript_line"> And every time, you know, my sister and I went to the shop,</div><div id="00:00:43.160" class="transcript_line"> he had a great big black chair, the boss&#039;s chair.</div><div id="00:00:46.640" class="transcript_line"> So I used to love twirling around in it.</div><div id="00:00:48.800" class="transcript_line"> It was very special to sit in his chair.</div><div id="00:00:51.600" class="transcript_line"> And he would either give my sister and I a pencil</div><div id="00:00:54.440" class="transcript_line"> and any of the female cousins who went, talcum powder.</div><div id="00:00:58.080" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve still got the talcum powder box he gave us.</div><div id="00:01:01.800" class="transcript_line"> So he would always give us a little bit of something.</div><div id="00:01:05.360" class="transcript_line"> And he had loads and loads of products.</div><div id="00:01:11.240" class="transcript_line"> And he would do like wholesale type work as well.</div><div id="00:01:14.600" class="transcript_line"> So he would supply other people.</div><div id="00:01:17.480" class="transcript_line"> And incredibly gifted man.</div><div id="00:01:19.640" class="transcript_line"> So he became very, very wealthy through that way.</div><div id="00:01:26.920" class="transcript_line"> But the good thing about my dad</div><div id="00:01:29.200" class="transcript_line"> was he helped other people as well.</div><div id="00:01:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Like he would say to my young uncle,</div><div id="00:01:34.520" class="transcript_line"> who I always used to call him cacu cacu,</div><div id="00:01:38.400" class="transcript_line"> the youngest cacu cacu I used to call him.</div><div id="00:01:41.240" class="transcript_line"> My youngest uncle used to say,</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> oh, when the girls are 20, you know,</div><div id="00:01:45.280" class="transcript_line"> think about finding a suitable match for them.</div><div id="00:01:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t leave it too late.</div><div id="00:01:50.200" class="transcript_line"> And he would always advise.</div><div id="00:01:51.840" class="transcript_line"> And he would always try and find matches for people.</div><div id="00:01:58.040" class="transcript_line"> Or he&#039;d say, my brother&#039;s son is, you know,</div><div id="00:02:01.120" class="transcript_line"> getting his this age and we&#039;re looking for a girl for him.</div><div id="00:02:06.160" class="transcript_line"> And you know, he would always help out</div><div id="00:02:08.200" class="transcript_line"> because you had to marry in the community.</div><div id="00:02:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t like how it is nowadays</div><div id="00:02:13.680" class="transcript_line"> with Facebook and social media.</div><div id="00:02:15.520" class="transcript_line"> So it was all connections and he was highly connected.</div><div id="00:02:19.320" class="transcript_line"> But very kind person.</div><div id="00:02:20.160" class="transcript_line"> And he also used to lend money to people.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And everything was done on trust.</div><div id="00:02:25.920" class="transcript_line"> So people would respect him</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> and he would help people set businesses up.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So he would lend money and then they would,</div><div id="00:02:35.440" class="transcript_line"> they would always give the money back.</div><div id="00:02:37.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was always respectfully done.</div><div id="00:02:40.360" class="transcript_line"> Right, so with regard, my community that I come from,</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the Luana community,</div><div id="00:02:49.040" class="transcript_line"> which is like the business people really.</div><div id="00:02:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Mainly they did business type of work.</div><div id="00:02:55.080" class="transcript_line"> So all my, everybody I knew were either in business</div><div id="00:02:59.160" class="transcript_line"> and a lot of my cousins were in medicine</div><div id="00:03:02.840" class="transcript_line"> because in Sanskrit, you know,</div><div id="00:03:04.360" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a great honor to work in medicine</div><div id="00:03:08.200" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re serving humanity.</div><div id="00:03:09.760" class="transcript_line"> But of course, nowadays it&#039;s not seen like that.</div><div id="00:03:12.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more about status.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the original Sanskrit thinking</div><div id="00:03:17.920" class="transcript_line"> about humanity and looking after,</div><div id="00:03:21.520" class="transcript_line"> looking after other people.</div><div id="00:03:23.880" class="transcript_line"> So with regard, the family, there is family in India.</div><div id="00:03:30.680" class="transcript_line"> So I did go back to India because mom couldn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:03:33.240" class="transcript_line"> She was a bad, poorly controlled diabetic.</div><div id="00:03:36.040" class="transcript_line"> But I did go and see my auntie, who&#039;s her older sister,</div><div id="00:03:41.280" class="transcript_line"> in Gujarat because mom couldn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:03:46.600" class="transcript_line"> And I went and I also went to see the house</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> where mom grew up and I was really shocked to see</div><div id="00:03:52.160" class="transcript_line"> that it was literally a grain store.</div><div id="00:03:54.920" class="transcript_line"> And the shopkeeper opened the house up for me</div><div id="00:03:57.440" class="transcript_line"> and it wasn&#039;t a house as such.</div><div id="00:03:59.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a downstairs and an upstairs open plan.</div><div id="00:04:01.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all that was there.</div><div id="00:04:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was literally a grain store now,</div><div id="00:04:05.640" class="transcript_line"> but they lived there.</div><div id="00:04:07.200" class="transcript_line"> So many brothers, sisters, her mom and dad,</div><div id="00:04:11.280" class="transcript_line"> and two brothers and four sisters.</div><div id="00:04:15.040" class="transcript_line"> So that sister, my mom&#039;s older sister,</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> always stayed in Gujarat.</div><div id="00:04:21.640" class="transcript_line"> So it was a great honor to meet her.</div><div id="00:04:23.680" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s passed away.</div><div id="00:04:24.760" class="transcript_line"> My youngest auntie from my mother&#039;s side lived in Kenya</div><div id="00:04:30.200" class="transcript_line"> and I went to visit her years later.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then subsequently she moved to London as well.</div><div id="00:04:38.560" class="transcript_line"> So, and there is some family still in India,</div><div id="00:04:42.520" class="transcript_line"> but because my mom&#039;s parents have died</div><div id="00:04:45.800" class="transcript_line"> and her sister has passed away,</div><div id="00:04:50.400" class="transcript_line"> the connection&#039;s a little bit loose.</div><div id="00:04:52.240" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m sure if I was to go and introduce myself,</div><div id="00:04:55.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, people would be thrilled.</div><div id="00:04:57.320" class="transcript_line"> And I also went to Singra where my dad&#039;s family came from.</div><div id="00:05:02.080" class="transcript_line"> And I went to the farmhouse and I explained who I was</div><div id="00:05:06.320" class="transcript_line"> and they remembered me, not me, they remembered my dad.</div><div id="00:05:11.400" class="transcript_line"> And they gave me a piece of wood</div><div id="00:05:13.880" class="transcript_line"> because the door that had been there for hundreds of years</div><div id="00:05:16.960" class="transcript_line"> was actually coming away.</div><div id="00:05:18.640" class="transcript_line"> And I said, can I have a piece of wood from this door?</div><div id="00:05:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So I had that piece of wood.</div><div id="00:05:23.960" class="transcript_line"> My mom&#039;s town, my mom&#039;s village, Ravel,</div><div id="00:05:27.080" class="transcript_line"> she remembered a clock tower and that&#039;s still there.</div><div id="00:05:30.680" class="transcript_line"> So I was able to take photographs and show mom,</div><div id="00:05:34.520" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I showed photos of her older sister.</div><div id="00:05:37.360" class="transcript_line"> So she was thrilled.</div><div id="00:05:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And mom always missed India as well,</div><div id="00:05:41.920" class="transcript_line"> but she said when my sister and I were born,</div><div id="00:05:44.480" class="transcript_line"> she said she missed her parents and the village is less.</div><div id="00:05:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And so she said, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d have done</div><div id="00:05:51.760" class="transcript_line"> without you two.</div><div id="00:05:52.640" class="transcript_line"> If I hadn&#039;t have had you two,</div><div id="00:05:54.080" class="transcript_line"> my life wouldn&#039;t have been worth anything really.</div><div id="00:05:57.320" class="transcript_line"> And no, my mother never went back to India</div><div id="00:06:00.360" class="transcript_line"> because, you know, it&#039;s very difficult really</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> to go back there.</div><div id="00:06:05.520" class="transcript_line"> So for example, my auntie, when she lives there,</div><div id="00:06:08.240" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s literally living in a,</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got a courtyard with lots of families living there.</div><div id="00:06:13.760" class="transcript_line"> And basically it&#039;s one room, you know,</div><div id="00:06:17.320" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a lot of poverty there.</div><div id="00:06:19.520" class="transcript_line"> And even her son couldn&#039;t come to meet me</div><div id="00:06:21.840" class="transcript_line"> even though I&#039;d gone thousands of miles</div><div id="00:06:23.680" class="transcript_line"> because he was running the shop.</div><div id="00:06:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, if you lose one deal in the shop,</div><div id="00:06:29.280" class="transcript_line"> it could be one less mouth you could feed almost, you know.</div><div id="00:06:34.080" class="transcript_line"> So it was just lovely to see my auntie.</div><div id="00:06:37.280" class="transcript_line"> And I was able to give her some money.</div><div id="00:06:41.240" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, she cried.</div><div id="00:06:44.280" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t want to accept it,</div><div id="00:06:45.680" class="transcript_line"> but it was what my mom would have wanted as well.</div><div id="00:06:50.600" class="transcript_line"> And it was good for her to know that, you know,</div><div id="00:06:53.840" class="transcript_line"> that I&#039;d gone, you know, it&#039;s my older auntie</div><div id="00:06:56.520" class="transcript_line"> that I&#039;d gone to visit.</div><div id="00:06:57.760" class="transcript_line"> So I was able to show mom the photos.</div><div id="00:07:02.280" class="transcript_line"> And people remembered my mom and my dad.</div><div id="00:07:04.720" class="transcript_line"> And one of my mom&#039;s friends actually came up to me</div><div id="00:07:08.600" class="transcript_line"> because everybody finds out when you go to India,</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> everybody wants to know who is this stranger,</div><div id="00:07:14.320" class="transcript_line"> who is this person from England, as they say,</div><div id="00:07:18.800" class="transcript_line"> because they don&#039;t know much about other parts</div><div id="00:07:21.280" class="transcript_line"> of the country, Wales, for example.</div><div id="00:07:24.520" class="transcript_line"> And people just gather around.</div><div id="00:07:27.160" class="transcript_line"> And I found my mom&#039;s school friend.</div><div id="00:07:29.720" class="transcript_line"> She said, I remember I went to school with your mom</div><div id="00:07:32.200" class="transcript_line"> and the tree where they used to study, that&#039;s still there.</div><div id="00:07:37.360" class="transcript_line"> So it was just lovely to be able to say to mom,</div><div id="00:07:39.480" class="transcript_line"> I saw these people and take photographs and show her.</div><div id="00:07:43.240" class="transcript_line"> So it was nice to do that.</div><div id="00:07:47.400" class="transcript_line"> So then going back to the military coming around,</div><div id="00:07:52.200" class="transcript_line"> my mom never did the suicide threatened again.</div><div id="00:07:55.800" class="transcript_line"> And she gave my sister and I food.</div><div id="00:07:57.640" class="transcript_line"> And we, my sister and I sat together and we held hands</div><div id="00:08:00.960" class="transcript_line"> and everything was fine.</div><div id="00:08:02.760" class="transcript_line"> But the white dress she was wearing was never seen again.</div><div id="00:08:06.320" class="transcript_line"> So we didn&#039;t want any of those memories.</div><div id="00:08:08.840" class="transcript_line"> And mom, I think, realized and had a shock.</div><div id="00:08:13.520" class="transcript_line"> And I look back as an adult now</div><div id="00:08:15.520" class="transcript_line"> and I realize how depressed she was.</div><div id="00:08:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And she was trying to keep a house over,</div><div id="00:08:20.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, my dad&#039;s house really.</div><div id="00:08:22.640" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s trying to keep a roof over our heads</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and how difficult it was to keep that.</div><div id="00:08:30.200" class="transcript_line"> And then the night the military came,</div><div id="00:08:32.040" class="transcript_line"> we were absolutely petrified, the three of us.</div><div id="00:08:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And the news was sent around because they come with guns</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and they can assault people.</div><div id="00:08:40.400" class="transcript_line"> They can&#039;t just fire.</div><div id="00:08:42.520" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lot of, you know, trucks going up and down,</div><div id="00:08:49.080" class="transcript_line"> all sort of tree branches, you know, through the trucks,</div><div id="00:08:52.560" class="transcript_line"> trees hacked down and to make things look more threatening,</div><div id="00:08:55.800" class="transcript_line"> frightening with guns and guns being fired.</div><div id="00:09:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Manick has said to mom, the headmistress next door,</div><div id="00:09:04.680" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t open the door, just stay quiet, you know,</div><div id="00:09:07.880" class="transcript_line"> because some families had left.</div><div id="00:09:09.720" class="transcript_line"> So obviously there wouldn&#039;t be an answer on the door.</div><div id="00:09:12.920" class="transcript_line"> So we were well advised really, but mom was so petrified.</div><div id="00:09:17.480" class="transcript_line"> And out of 50, 60 people, extended family,</div><div id="00:09:21.600" class="transcript_line"> male members, male cousins,</div><div id="00:09:25.080" class="transcript_line"> Suru, my brother, we rang around,</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> mom rang around and said,</div><div id="00:09:29.240" class="transcript_line"> can one of you come and stay with us the night?</div><div id="00:09:31.880" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously we weren&#039;t going to be able</div><div id="00:09:33.520" class="transcript_line"> to relax or sleep.</div><div id="00:09:36.040" class="transcript_line"> And not a single male person came to stay with us that night.</div><div id="00:09:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Nobody wanted to come.</div><div id="00:09:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And obviously you look back and you think,</div><div id="00:09:48.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah, every person would have been frightened,</div><div id="00:09:51.080" class="transcript_line"> but what about an uneducated widow</div><div id="00:09:53.320" class="transcript_line"> and her two small children and the man?</div><div id="00:09:57.240" class="transcript_line"> And the man being obviously always been credited</div><div id="00:10:01.040" class="transcript_line"> with a lot more strength.</div><div id="00:10:02.400" class="transcript_line"> And the man having always promised dad as well,</div><div id="00:10:06.400" class="transcript_line"> we look after them, we look after them.</div><div id="00:10:08.360" class="transcript_line"> They all said that to a dying man even,</div><div id="00:10:12.680" class="transcript_line"> we will be looking after the girls and mom.</div><div id="00:10:16.640" class="transcript_line"> So there was no problem, no worries.</div></div></p>
