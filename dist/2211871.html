id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We were like, whoever goes the other side fast, he&#039;s, he&#039;s, he&#039;s win.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, okay, let&#039;s do it then.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we like to take challenge.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> This is me as a family.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I like to take challenge.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was massive swimming pool, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s just funny.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> No one can win because we are very tired to just keep swimming and swimming.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re very tired.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So same time we were swimming back from the other side.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Same time.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Same time we came back.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I said, no one wins.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So we, and then we came back and we were like relaxing for a bit.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re taking break from, from swimming.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I saw, I am, we saw there&#039;s a two snake, two snake.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They were, I don&#039;t know what

class="transcript_line"> They were doing that like, I don&#039;t know, embracing or hugging each other.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I can&#039;t, still since then, till now I can&#039;t tell whether they&#039;re fighting,</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> whether they&#039;re loving each other.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I saw, I was the first person.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I

id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more like I would say Australia.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I think, you know, Australia has a couple of, it&#039;s many snakes.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like that.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> My country is like that.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> In my country there&#039;s many snakes.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So, and I, we saw and there, it was two big black snakes.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were, I don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I scream and

not very near.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t near.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can see, it was, you know, I can see it.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I can see it.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I will show, see I was shopping and she, and then she was screaming as well.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then luckily she, they had security.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They had security and she called him.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Like she was screaming and he came.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you know what the, what&#039;s the magic thing?</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was like, where is snake?</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Where is snake?</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he went there and he saw there&#039;s no snake, nothing.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> In the center, where are all the snakes gone?</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Where are they gone?</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two snakes, where are they gone?</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Honestly, that&#039;s why I&#039;m, I&#039;m, I still, I still think since then, like, why did they, the snakes gone?</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, he said, I didn&#039;t see any snake.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And you guys saw, Mia, it&#039;s not just me.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s me, okay, maybe I saw wrong.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It was my bad, right?</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I can make myself, oh, okay.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just maybe I was very tired.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe, that&#039;s why I saw.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it was my cousin as well.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So, and then, yeah, snakes gone then.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that still I keep remember, I keep thinking, what the snakes gone?</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Either, and then I think like, are they, why are they actually snakes or something else?</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe there&#039;s something else and they became snake and then they just vanish.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that this exists, that exists.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> What else would it be?</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me what else it would be in that?</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Gene?</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you, did you watch Aladdin movie?</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Aladdin,

right?</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another, how to say, another planet that we call Gene.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the Genie comes from Gene.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why it is a Genie.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Genie, the Aladdin Genie, the Genie comes from Gene.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In our holy book, it says about Gene.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So in Day of Judgment, in the, do you know Day of Judgment?</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Like in the, we have, we believe we have two lives, here and hereafter.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is here, this world is temporary and hereafter is permanent.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not temporary, it&#039;s permanent.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the Day of Judgment where everyone will be in front of our God, in front of Allah</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and He will ask every single one of us, why did you hurt people?</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did you do backbiting?</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did you hurt people?</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Just because of, He will ask.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why as a Muslim, we have to be nice.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We have to have, there&#039;s no excuse.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We have to be nice with other people.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We have to make other people comfortable.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask us, why did you do that?</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Answer me, otherwise I will give you, I will send you to Hellfire.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And in that day, only people, He will ask only people and jinn.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> People and jinn.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Jinn, they are invisible.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They are not visible, they are invisible.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So they have, they made, we made from no sand.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s something else.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And the jinn made, I think from fire, He made.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> This is what we believe.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> If you read it, this is very very interesting.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> If you read about Quran, our holy book, Muslims holy book, you can know everything about jinn.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So these jinn, that&#039;s what I think now.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, maybe it&#039;s not a snake because He didn&#039;t see.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We saw them, He didn&#039;t see them.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So if it&#039;s not a snake, then it must be jinn.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The jinn can vanish like anytime.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s like, if we see snakes, if it&#039;s actually jinn, he can vanish like,</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> he can be like this table.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is what I think.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be jinn.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is, jinn comes from jinn.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what He called jinn.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it so interesting?</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Fascinating.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Really fascinating.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the other day I saw interview from, in our back home interview I saw,</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> because now it&#039;s weather, it&#039;s very rain, it&#039;s flooded everywhere.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t get, my house didn&#039;t get flooded, luckily.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I saw interview like people, journalists, they interviewed people,</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> random people and they&#039;re saying how they&#039;re feeling, how they&#039;re surviving now.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So one lady was saying, when I, she&#039;s a farmer, right?</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was like, when I go to farming, when I go to field, I see many, many big snakes.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And at the end of the time she was saying, this country is full of snakes.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> She was saying, because I know the isora, I used to see when it&#039;s heavily raining,</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to see snakes in front of our house, even, well, because it&#039;s raining,</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s everywhere&#039;s watery, so they&#039;re just swimming.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So they have to live, right?</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> How we live, they have life as well.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re like, okay, you are our friends, new friends, okay, live your life.</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Just don&#039;t bite us because our country,</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re better, some of our better scary, they can eat you,</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> they can, you know, yeah, bite you and then you can, you will die.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re very scary snakes.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why sometimes horribly we have to kill them sometimes,</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> which is not nice, it&#039;s just because of us.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, they will kill our family, especially the babies,</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> because they don&#039;t know the snakes, you know, they don&#039;t know the difference.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They will be like, oh, this is toy, this is my toy.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But some of we keep them as a pet, like here.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think now here in the UK, people keep as a pet snakes, right?</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so that lady was saying this country was full of snakes country.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I find it a bit funny.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, I feel so sad for them because she said,</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> whenever I go field to farming, I see this massive snakes.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very scared.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, if you go ever in my country, you will see that.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like Australia.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great. It&#039;s a great story. Really interesting.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I still don&#039;t know whether they&#039;re loving each other or were they fighting?</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;re fighting, but that way, honestly, I wish you can see.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re like, do, doing that.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were fighting, not loving.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Love&#039;s not like that, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They were arguing.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Fighting over some food or something.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were honestly like snake were there and we just came.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We just came swimming.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very near.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re very near them.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Luckily, they didn&#039;t bite us.</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Luckily.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God. Otherwise, I would have been dead.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. I would have come to UK.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, brilliant. That&#039;s a great story.</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Really. Thank you.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish you enjoyed.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me, was it very hot?</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hot. It was very hot.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like summertime, summer hot time.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why we were doing swimming in swimming pool.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why it was very hot.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there anything else you wanted to tell about anything you saw on the day or anything else?</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So when I was little, like baby, baby, baby, yeah, my mom went to my cousin&#039;s wedding.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt, like auntie, that side.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Her sons, it was her sons wedding.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she holds me like this and she was walking all around the hall.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And everyone&#039;s like, oh, is this your granddaughter?
