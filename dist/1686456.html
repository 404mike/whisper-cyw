    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Firstly, let us say thank you to Heritage Lottery in Wales for enabling us to bring</div><div id="00:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> you these podcasts.</div><div id="00:00:09.480" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jamie Baker and I&#039;m part of Horn Development Association, HDA in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:17.360" class="transcript_line"> And this site, Black Diverse and Welsh, is intended to bring together lots of initiatives</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;ve been involved in in terms of Black and Diverse people in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:31.040" class="transcript_line"> But most immediately, a series of episodes, a series of contributions, which are about</div><div id="00:00:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And if you sit outside the Norwegian church on the bay in Cardiff and in better times</div><div id="00:00:46.280" class="transcript_line"> have a cup of coffee, hopefully this series of podcasts over the next few months will</div><div id="00:00:52.080" class="transcript_line"> give you an idea what that place you&#039;re looking at used to be, what&#039;s happened there and</div><div id="00:00:58.280" class="transcript_line"> what it represents to the people who live or lived in the streets you, to a large extent,</div><div id="00:01:06.040" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t see anymore.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> This is episode six of the series of podcasts and it&#039;s with Richard Ford.</div><div id="00:01:16.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re recording, so wherever you want to start mate.</div><div id="00:01:19.800" class="transcript_line"> OK, right.</div><div id="00:01:20.800" class="transcript_line"> My name is Richard Ford.</div><div id="00:01:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 61 years of age at this moment in time.</div><div id="00:01:26.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m one of nine children, mixed heritage, Caribbean, from Barbados, my grandfather.</div><div id="00:01:37.240" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather on my mother&#039;s side was from Yemen and the rest of us are mainly Welsh.</div><div id="00:01:47.320" class="transcript_line"> I lived in West Coast, which was kind of in between the docks and Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I grew up, as I say, one of nine children.</div><div id="00:01:59.920" class="transcript_line"> My first memory I come up with pop bottles.</div><div id="00:02:03.760" class="transcript_line"> We used to have glass pop bottles and people would ask you to go to the shop or you&#039;d ask</div><div id="00:02:10.120" class="transcript_line"> them if they want anything in the shop because you would go in.</div><div id="00:02:14.400" class="transcript_line"> And for going in return instead of giving you money, they&#039;d give you bottles to take</div><div id="00:02:18.200" class="transcript_line"> back because you got money off them.</div><div id="00:02:20.200" class="transcript_line"> So that was helpful to yourself and obviously to the state of the world right now because</div><div id="00:02:27.120" class="transcript_line"> now we&#039;re using too much plastic.</div><div id="00:02:30.280" class="transcript_line"> Timber floats, right?</div><div id="00:02:31.280" class="transcript_line"> There was a place called the timber floats.</div><div id="00:02:33.680" class="transcript_line"> They used to have logs in that and in water basically and we used to go fishing over there</div><div id="00:02:39.400" class="transcript_line"> with my brothers.</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Basically, my brother used to take me out of the house because I was like four or five</div><div id="00:02:45.360" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d sit on the riverbank.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And on two occasions I went fishing with him.</div><div id="00:02:49.800" class="transcript_line"> I fell in.</div><div id="00:02:50.800" class="transcript_line"> So that was another memory that stuck in my mind.</div><div id="00:02:54.800" class="transcript_line"> In West Coast we had this place called the Patch outside everyone&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:02:58.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s kind of built in a circle.</div><div id="00:03:01.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still there now, right at this moment, but they have built gardens on it, which is</div><div id="00:03:07.360" class="transcript_line"> not the same as it was obviously back in the day.</div><div id="00:03:10.680" class="transcript_line"> We used to be able to, in winter, throw ice, throw water on the Patch to make ice so we&#039;d</div><div id="00:03:18.120" class="transcript_line"> have slides.</div><div id="00:03:19.120" class="transcript_line"> That was a great fun and didn&#039;t cost anything and didn&#039;t hurt anybody, hurt yourselves.</div><div id="00:03:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Teenagers, teenage life, we used to go to Top Rank, which was in town, and we used to</div><div id="00:03:34.440" class="transcript_line"> go to Under 18&#039;s Discos.</div><div id="00:03:37.640" class="transcript_line"> So that was on a Tuesday evening and Saturday morning.</div><div id="00:03:41.640" class="transcript_line"> And we would always, as an area, meet up outside after it finished, the dances had finished,</div><div id="00:03:49.720" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d all walk home or we&#039;d meet outside and in a place called Caroline Street so everyone</div><div id="00:03:57.480" class="transcript_line"> could kind of get back home, down to the bay, safely.</div><div id="00:04:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of times...</div><div id="00:04:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Chippies and kebabs.</div><div id="00:04:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:04:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Chippies and kebabs.</div><div id="00:04:06.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Caroline Street.</div><div id="00:04:08.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:09.920" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it&#039;s kind of a way of getting home safely and making sure everybody got</div><div id="00:04:16.280" class="transcript_line"> home safely because a lot of times you get stopped by the police in harassed.</div><div id="00:04:20.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting, one thing about, I&#039;ll just interrupt Rich and say, the difference between</div><div id="00:04:27.800" class="transcript_line"> being in the docks and the bay, Tiger Bay, and going under that bridge into town.</div><div id="00:04:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Unbelievable.</div><div id="00:04:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Foreign territory.</div><div id="00:04:38.120" class="transcript_line"> And I worked there for 20 years afterwards.</div><div id="00:04:42.920" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s still kind of strange because as you say, foreign territory, even though I worked</div><div id="00:04:51.160" class="transcript_line"> there.</div><div id="00:04:52.160" class="transcript_line"> The funeral, this is something that we did, the Leibar was known as to do, carried our</div><div id="00:04:59.880" class="transcript_line"> owned from the houses up to the church or the mosque.</div><div id="00:05:06.120" class="transcript_line"> And after the service, we would always bury the person as a mark of respect.</div><div id="00:05:13.440" class="transcript_line"> When they&#039;ve done...</div><div id="00:05:15.960" class="transcript_line"> For people who don&#039;t understand, Richard, when you say bury them, give them an idea</div><div id="00:05:21.760" class="transcript_line"> of what was involved for all the men.</div><div id="00:05:26.480" class="transcript_line"> We would all get a shovel.</div><div id="00:05:29.240" class="transcript_line"> As many shovels as you could get.</div><div id="00:05:31.640" class="transcript_line"> And the grave would be open and we would fill the grave in.</div><div id="00:05:37.680" class="transcript_line"> And I think that stems back, way, way back.</div><div id="00:05:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean it&#039;s a Muslim tradition, but the bay...</div><div id="00:05:45.160" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:05:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, in other countries, it&#039;s a Muslim tradition, but in the bay, there was no difference on</div><div id="00:05:52.480" class="transcript_line"> faiths, was there?</div><div id="00:05:53.480" class="transcript_line"> You took the best of each.</div><div id="00:05:54.480" class="transcript_line"> No, not at all.</div><div id="00:05:55.480" class="transcript_line"> Not at all.</div><div id="00:05:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it stemmed from poverty.</div><div id="00:06:00.600" class="transcript_line"> So save money, everyone helped.</div><div id="00:06:05.640" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a tradition that&#039;s passed on from one generation to another.</div><div id="00:06:11.680" class="transcript_line"> So it keeps the community strong as well, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:06:18.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an act that we all have to go through.</div><div id="00:06:22.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice to think that someone&#039;s going to give your family the same respect that you</div><div id="00:06:26.200" class="transcript_line"> gave to them.</div><div id="00:06:28.680" class="transcript_line"> We went to Sunday school, which was called Band of Hope.</div><div id="00:06:34.680" class="transcript_line"> That was in Hannah Street.</div><div id="00:06:37.040" class="transcript_line"> And that was a Tuesday evening and Sunday morning.</div><div id="00:06:43.160" class="transcript_line"> And then obviously later on, we go to St. Mary&#039;s Church.</div><div id="00:06:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my wife&#039;s telling me where they gave you sweets to go to Hannah Street.</div><div id="00:06:53.360" class="transcript_line"> At St. Mary&#039;s Church, they had a local football team, which we used to go around playing.</div><div id="00:07:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Kings from the parishes.</div><div id="00:07:04.360" class="transcript_line"> And also going up the valleys now, which was another experience.</div><div id="00:07:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Just to play football and getting chased off the pitch because of the colour of your skin,</div><div id="00:07:15.360" class="transcript_line"> basically.</div><div id="00:07:16.360" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re talking like late 60s, early 70s.</div><div id="00:07:20.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was still a problem, racism.</div><div id="00:07:23.360" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t a problem in the Bay, in Tiger Bay or the Docks?</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:07:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was welcome.</div><div id="00:07:32.360" class="transcript_line"> I always said the only way you could find trouble in the Bay and the Docks was if you</div><div id="00:07:37.360" class="transcript_line"> came looking for it.</div><div id="00:07:39.360" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, you were welcome with open arms.</div><div id="00:07:43.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always taught my kids as well.</div><div id="00:07:48.360" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t buy respect.</div><div id="00:07:49.360" class="transcript_line"> You have to earn it.</div><div id="00:07:51.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know I was taught.</div><div id="00:07:53.360" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t look for trouble.</div><div id="00:07:55.360" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:56.360" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re ready if trouble comes.</div><div id="00:07:58.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:59.360" class="transcript_line"> And those who know you are expected to have your back.</div><div id="00:08:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:05.360" class="transcript_line"> And we both know that from older times.</div><div id="00:08:08.360" class="transcript_line"> From growing up.</div><div id="00:08:09.360" class="transcript_line"> In top rank and other places.</div><div id="00:08:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:14.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all right.</div><div id="00:08:15.360" class="transcript_line"> You have someone always at your back because you&#039;re proud of growing up and finding yourself.</div><div id="00:08:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And as a child, I say a child, like eight or nine, ten, that kind of age, taught by</div><div id="00:08:29.360" class="transcript_line"> my parents to don&#039;t come in crying.</div><div id="00:08:33.360" class="transcript_line"> If you got yourself in a fight and it&#039;s someone of your own age and size and things, you go</div><div id="00:08:39.360" class="transcript_line"> back out there.</div><div id="00:08:40.360" class="transcript_line"> If it was somebody bigger and older than me, I have brothers.</div><div id="00:08:44.360" class="transcript_line"> Then, you know, my mother turned my brothers in because I&#039;m being bullied.</div><div id="00:08:48.360" class="transcript_line"> But otherwise, I have to stick up for myself, which made me a stronger character.</div><div id="00:08:54.360" class="transcript_line"> And it also taught me not to be a bully as well.</div><div id="00:08:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I respect people.</div><div id="00:08:59.360" class="transcript_line"> And I was speaking to Karen Alley earlier on.</div><div id="00:09:05.360" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:09:06.360" class="transcript_line"> And she was saying about how people showed respect to older people by calling them auntie</div><div id="00:09:12.360" class="transcript_line"> and uncle and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:09:14.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very true.</div><div id="00:09:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:16.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:17.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s something I also pass on to my children.</div><div id="00:09:22.360" class="transcript_line"> And the youngest one turned around to me and he said to me, after I introduced him to my</div><div id="00:09:28.360" class="transcript_line"> closest friend, Rosie Parrish.</div><div id="00:09:32.360" class="transcript_line"> And I said to him, this is Auntie Rosie.</div><div id="00:09:35.360" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, right dad.</div><div id="00:09:38.360" class="transcript_line"> He said, no, is this respect or blood?</div><div id="00:09:42.360" class="transcript_line"> That was his way of differentiating because he&#039;s got a lot of aunties and uncles.</div><div id="00:09:50.360" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it enabled him to find out who&#039;s who.</div><div id="00:09:54.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we go for big families.</div><div id="00:09:57.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:59.360" class="transcript_line"> So one of nine.</div><div id="00:10:01.360" class="transcript_line"> My father was one of 13.</div><div id="00:10:04.360" class="transcript_line"> I worked as a youth worker for a thing called Community Roots.</div><div id="00:10:10.360" class="transcript_line"> And I was to assist people who were unemployed to try and help them get back into work.</div><div id="00:10:17.360" class="transcript_line"> And it was run at Chalky White&#039;s Youth Center.</div><div id="00:10:21.360" class="transcript_line"> So I created our own football team.</div><div id="00:10:25.360" class="transcript_line"> It was the first one we had down there.</div><div id="00:10:28.360" class="transcript_line"> And we got to be successful and won the Wednesday League.</div><div id="00:10:33.360" class="transcript_line"> There was about 15 sides.</div><div id="00:10:37.360" class="transcript_line"> And we won the cup.</div><div id="00:10:39.360" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve done that for about four or five years.</div><div id="00:10:43.360" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned Rosie Parrish.</div><div id="00:10:46.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And it made me think of Frankie Parrish.</div><div id="00:10:50.360" class="transcript_line"> Frankie, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:52.360" class="transcript_line"> And the Kayaks.</div><div id="00:10:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I was in only a couple of months ago.</div><div id="00:11:01.360" class="transcript_line"> I was in Bridge End.</div><div id="00:11:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And somebody said to me, came up to me and said, do you know the Kayaks?</div><div id="00:11:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Mr. J said, hardest team we ever played rugby against.</div><div id="00:11:11.360" class="transcript_line"> He said, hardest team we ever played.</div><div id="00:11:14.360" class="transcript_line"> He said, I can&#039;t understand.</div><div id="00:11:15.360" class="transcript_line"> All those boys weren&#039;t playing for Cardiff.</div><div id="00:11:18.360" class="transcript_line"> I said, nor could we.</div><div id="00:11:20.360" class="transcript_line"> Because we were discriminated against.</div><div id="00:11:23.360" class="transcript_line"> And my cousin had the worst one of all.</div><div id="00:11:26.360" class="transcript_line"> He represented his country.</div><div id="00:11:30.360" class="transcript_line"> Stephen, Stephen Ford.</div><div id="00:11:32.360" class="transcript_line"> But because he went for a trial at Bradford.</div><div id="00:11:37.360" class="transcript_line"> Rugby League.</div><div id="00:11:38.360" class="transcript_line"> And came back.</div><div id="00:11:39.360" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, the other code, rugby league.</div><div id="00:11:41.360" class="transcript_line"> He came back from that and he got suspended.</div><div id="00:11:45.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it was like six months he couldn&#039;t play.</div><div id="00:11:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And he also got a fine.</div><div id="00:11:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Which was a lot when you were an amateur because he was at those times.</div><div id="00:11:55.360" class="transcript_line"> And they couldn&#039;t work out why so many black or mixed race kids ended up at rugby league.</div><div id="00:12:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because that&#039;s what they used to do.</div><div id="00:12:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it was the only way they made a wage.</div><div id="00:12:08.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:12:10.360" class="transcript_line"> And they were noted for their skills.</div><div id="00:12:13.360" class="transcript_line"> And many of them had lots of skill.</div><div id="00:12:16.360" class="transcript_line"> So naturally, I mean if someone&#039;s going to say to you, play for nothing or play for whatever, X amount a week.</div><div id="00:12:24.360" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you&#039;re going to take the money because that&#039;s what you&#039;re there for.</div><div id="00:12:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Especially when they show you respect.</div><div id="00:12:32.360" class="transcript_line"> And the fans cheer you.</div><div id="00:12:35.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:37.360" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:12:38.360" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve all been in those games where you take so much abuse from the sidelines.</div><div id="00:12:42.360" class="transcript_line"> That you just start to ignore it.</div><div id="00:12:45.360" class="transcript_line"> And show your own skills and rise above it.</div><div id="00:12:49.360" class="transcript_line"> We had the second biggest carnival in Britain before it got cut.</div><div

id="00:13:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Because we had so many people going down to the park.</div><div id="00:13:06.360" class="transcript_line"> By the community center.</div><div id="00:13:10.360" class="transcript_line"> It was like five, six thousand.</div><div id="00:13:13.360" class="transcript_line"> In that time there was a lot of people.</div><div id="00:13:16.360" class="transcript_line"> They decided in their wisdom that they would cut our budgets.</div><div id="00:13:19.360" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t run it anymore.</div><div id="00:13:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And they put the thing up by the county hall on the August.</div><div id="00:13:26.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a fair with live stages.</div><div id="00:13:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Not stages.</div><div id="00:13:31.360" class="transcript_line"> A live band, sorry.</div><div id="00:13:32.360" class="transcript_line"> Went to the dance from the community

class="transcript_line"> But they would have dances as well on Saturday night.</div><div id="00:13:55.360" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d have coaches coming down from London, Birmingham,

class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:14:39.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:14:40.360" class="transcript_line"> So I played, bought us some music.</div><div id="00:14:41.360" class="transcript_line"> So they said to me, right.</div><div id="00:14:42.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:14:43.360" class="transcript_line"> Now your job is DJing.</div><div id="00:14:44.360" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve now got to book the bands.</div><div id="00:14:46.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:14:47.360" class="transcript_line"> So I did that.</div><div id="00:14:48.360" class="transcript_line"> And I mixed the mixing desk.</div><div id="00:14:50.360" class="transcript_line"> All untrained.</div><div id="00:14:51.360" class="transcript_line"> Never been trained in any of it.</div><div id="00:14:53.360" class="transcript_line"> I just put my ear to it and thought, well, I could do it.</div><div id="00:14:55.360" class="transcript_line"> So I will go.</div><div id="00:14:56.360" class="transcript_line"> And this is my creme de creme cockup.</div><div id="00:15:01.360" class="transcript_line"> I booked this band on the Friday gig.</div><div id="00:15:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Laverne Brown Band.</div><div id="00:15:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:09.360" class="transcript_line"> But when I phoned up the echo.</div><div id="00:15:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Because they used to do a publication for the weekend.</div><div id="00:15:14.360" class="transcript_line"> I booked it as Laverne Brown Band and Spasm Band.</div><div id="00:15:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:19.360" class="transcript_line"> But they were rival bands.</div><div id="00:15:21.360" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t kind of get on and play together.</div><div id="00:15:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Avoid each other.</div><div id="00:15:25.360" class="transcript_line"> But Spasm Band were playing somewhere else.</div><div id="00:15:28.360" class="transcript_line"> And their gig finished early.</div><div id="00:15:30.360" class="transcript_line"> So they just turned up.</div><div id="00:15:33.360" class="transcript_line"> And both crowds were there.</div><div id="00:15:36.360" class="transcript_line"> And then the crowd turned up.</div><div id="00:15:38.360" class="transcript_line"> And we had a wicked night.</div><div id="00:15:40.360" class="transcript_line"> It was jammed.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> So good things come out of it.</div><div id="00:15:56.360" class="transcript_line"> The thing about the castle that I remember more than anything else is.</div><div id="00:16:00.360" class="transcript_line"> It was neutral territory.</div><div id="00:16:02.360" class="transcript_line"> You know as someone on the door.</div><div id="00:16:04.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:05.360" class="transcript_line"> But the curses stopped when people walked in the door.</div><div id="00:16:09.360" class="transcript_line"> And it

class="transcript_line"> But they were also looking out for you.</div><div id="00:20:17.360" class="transcript_line"> Because you were being somewhere you shouldn&#039;t have been.</div><div id="00:20:19.360" class="transcript_line"> And then.</div><div id="00:20:21.360" class="transcript_line"> Parents will tell you off.</div><div id="00:20:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Or keep you in or ground you.</div><div id="00:20:25.360" class="transcript_line"> And if there was something serious.</div><div id="00:20:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Then you would have been licked.</div><div id="00:20:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:31.360" class="transcript_line"> These things happen.</div><div id="00:20:33.360" class="transcript_line"> We won&#039;t say

is.</div><div id="00:20:55.360" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll say this.</div><div id="00:20:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be saying this on every single one.</div><div id="00:20:59.360" class="transcript_line"> If somebody is sat at the Norwegian church.</div><div id="00:21:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Having a coffee.</div><div id="00:21:03.360" class="transcript_line"> In better times.</div><div id="00:21:05.360" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re looking across at those nice restaurants.</div><div id="00:21:07.360" class="transcript_line"> And all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:21:09.360" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re going to understand.</div><div id="00:21:11.360" class="transcript_line"> These were real people.</div><div id="00:21:13.360" class="transcript_line"> And what you read about them.</div><div id="00:21:15.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s not a script.</div><div id="00:21:17.360" class="transcript_line"> Where you&#039;ve got people like Neil Sinclair.</div><div id="00:21:19.360" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:21:21.360" class="transcript_line"> But it isn&#039;t written by them.</div><div id="00:21:23.360" class="transcript_line"> And one of the things that struck me the other day.</div><div id="00:21:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Was the smells.</div><div id="00:21:27.360" class="transcript_line"> You know if you were walking.</div><div id="00:21:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Through.</div><div id="00:21:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Through the bay.</div><div id="00:21:33.360" class="transcript_line"> And cafes.</div><div id="00:21:35.360" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:21:37.360" class="transcript_line"> You could eat around the world.</div><div id="00:21:39.360" class="transcript_line"> In one little place.</div><div id="00:21:41.360" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:21:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And you could cook for like seven different people.</div><div id="00:21:45.360" class="transcript_line"> At meal times.</div><div id="00:21:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And then outside families would come in.</div><div id="00:21:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Because you know.</div><div
