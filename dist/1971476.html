    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Another group of songs which are quite often called sea shanties but in fact</div><div id="00:00:04.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re ballads, they&#039;re story songs. Sea shanties were meant to do work.</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> They got a very close beat for pulling ropes or working a capstan. It&#039;s all</div><div id="00:00:16.120" class="transcript_line"> from the days when people used to have sailing ships and they didn&#039;t have any</div><div id="00:00:19.840" class="transcript_line"> engines at all. So you had to either have manpower or wind power.</div><div id="00:00:26.480" class="transcript_line"> If you can get a good sea shanty going then it would increase the pulling power</div><div id="00:00:32.160" class="transcript_line"> of a crew by about 10 to 15 percent which was not to be sniffed at. It was</div><div id="00:00:37.320" class="transcript_line"> worth doing. And also because they would be on board together as a</div><div id="00:00:42.720" class="transcript_line"> group for maybe a month, two months, three months or a year sometimes. But that guy</div><div id="00:00:48.120" class="transcript_line"> used to go around to South America, Lotte Park, the guy who bought Lotte Park in</div><div id="00:00:53.240" class="transcript_line"> town here. It took six months to go there. So if you&#039;re together for</div><div id="00:00:58.280" class="transcript_line"> six months then it&#039;s nice to have a couple of songs you can sing together</div><div id="00:01:01.920" class="transcript_line"> and be more sociable. So it was a way of being sociable as well. Usually</div><div id="00:01:07.800" class="transcript_line"> they were pretty risque sort of songs. They were sort of making fun of</div><div id="00:01:12.560" class="transcript_line"> people or talking about the girls they got and so on. So it makes it makes a</div><div id="00:01:18.280" class="transcript_line"> bit an interesting bit of oral history. It&#039;s good oral history.</div><div id="00:01:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Some are in Welsh like the collection I&#039;ve got here and some are in English</div><div id="00:01:26.200" class="transcript_line"> and some relate to fish goud, some relate to the trade and so on. If you look at</div><div id="00:01:32.200" class="transcript_line"> history lots of communities used to have work songs but they&#039;ve all disappeared.</div><div id="00:01:37.600" class="transcript_line"> The sea shanties are probably the last of these work songs.</div></div></p>
