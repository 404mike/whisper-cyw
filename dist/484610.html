    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Location Swickert Office Market House in Canton Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:12.600" class="transcript_line"> And the date today is Monday the 21st of September.</div><div id="00:00:17.040" class="transcript_line"> John, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?</div><div id="00:00:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay.</div><div id="00:00:25.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m well known as John from young school age, but my Indian name is Rajinder Singh,</div><div id="00:00:31.840" class="transcript_line"> which is spelled R-A-J-I-N-D-E-R and surname Singh S-I-N-G-H.</div><div id="00:00:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Raj, would you be kind enough to do the same?</div><div id="00:00:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Yep, most definitely. Mine is spelled R-A-J-A, surname Singh S-I-N-G-H.</div><div id="00:00:55.680" class="transcript_line"> For listeners in the future, I&#039;ll point out from the onset that of course John and Raj are father and son.</div><div id="00:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So the dynamic duo, as I like to think of you both.</div><div id="00:01:09.080" class="transcript_line"> When do you first remember getting involved in Carnival, Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:01:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, many years it&#039;s been from what I can remember.</div><div id="00:01:22.280" class="transcript_line"> From I think at least about say, I remember overall, it&#039;s been about say 20 odd years.</div><div id="00:01:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, 20 years.</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Or 20 odd years from what I can remember. I can&#039;t remember exact dates.</div><div id="00:01:36.280" class="transcript_line"> But I remember it was over 20 years ago.</div><div id="00:01:39.880" class="transcript_line"> So from seeing many other Carnivals and then saw a Carnival here and then working with Bhangra</div><div id="00:01:54.880" class="transcript_line"> and then just seeing a great development in Carnival. So I&#039;ll put a light to it.</div><div id="00:02:01.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember myself, I actually have a picture going back about 20 years ago when I was about 6, 7 years old.</div><div id="00:02:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Taking part in the mass Carnival. So yeah, most definitely it&#039;s been a good 20 years.</div><div id="00:02:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Is this a picture where perhaps as part of your fantastic Bhangra performance on Parade,</div><div id="00:02:21.880" class="transcript_line"> you actually ended up on the shoulders of your father?</div><div id="00:02:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Because I have a picture which again we&#039;ll be putting online in the archive</div><div id="00:02:28.880" class="transcript_line"> where having performed a number of acrobatic moves, you then got on top of John&#039;s shoulders</div><div id="00:02:35.880" class="transcript_line"> and you appear to be going down the haze at the time, which I thought was rather wonderful, like an acrobat.</div><div id="00:02:41.880" class="transcript_line"> That wasn&#039;t that, the picture I have is not that specific one.</div><div id="00:02:44.880" class="transcript_line"> However, yeah, I&#039;m sure it is some of that kind as well. We&#039;ve got loads. I&#039;ve got some doing sword fighting as well.</div><div id="00:02:51.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember when I was a youngster doing the Carnival, drumming, dancing, as we&#039;ve done so many different things in the Carnival.</div><div id="00:02:58.880" class="transcript_line"> For those who don&#039;t know, Bhangra, what is it? Where does it come from? How did it arrive here in Cardiff in Wales?</div><div id="00:03:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Originally stems from India. It&#039;s celebrated during the harvest periods.</div><div id="00:03:12.880" class="transcript_line"> This is where it originates from a long, long time ago.</div><div id="00:03:17.880" class="transcript_line"> However, bringing it to Cardiff, I suppose my dad can answer that more better than myself.</div><div id="00:03:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Over to you, John.</div><div id="00:03:24.880" class="transcript_line"> As my son speaks, he&#039;s quite right.</div><div id="00:03:28.880" class="transcript_line"> The start of it really started from the Saki time, which is very known around the world, especially in India at the harvest time.</div><div id="00:03:42.880" class="transcript_line"> And as my father, when he came over from India in 1963, 64, he came over and as they used to do it there, they done it here as well with a few of their cousins and colleagues.</div><div id="00:04:02.880" class="transcript_line"> And from there, there was a very, very few artists in the Asian community.</div><div id="00:04:10.880" class="transcript_line"> And from what I recall, what my father said, there was only one in Scotland as a Bhangra dancer and one of them.</div><div id="00:04:20.880" class="transcript_line"> And everywhere where they went, they did a really nice show.</div><div id="00:04:27.880" class="transcript_line"> And one of the famous places they did, which was in London, is it the...</div><div id="00:04:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Not the Palladium, it&#039;s another one, which is a very famous one, which I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:04:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, they&#039;ve done it there and they really, really liked it.</div><div id="00:04:44.880" class="transcript_line"> And from there, we, as he got older and then we took over and from we taking over, now the third generation is taking over, which is my son.</div><div id="00:04:56.880" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s been very colourful and very sort of nice to do carnivals as well in a very diplomatic way, different, different workshops, different things.</div><div id="00:05:13.880" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been very enjoyable.</div><div id="00:05:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Carnival, particularly when it&#039;s on the road and we&#039;re there with our big audiences, we need music to dance to, to power us on.</div><div id="00:05:23.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like the fuel in our engine.</div><div id="00:05:25.880" class="transcript_line"> And you guys and your family and friends and your colleagues have provided that with a very special instrument called the dhol.</div><div id="00:05:33.880" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us a bit more about the dhol and what it is and what makes it so wonderful for...</div><div id="00:05:38.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, I don&#039;t want to give it away.</div><div id="00:05:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Over to you guys. You&#039;re the experts.</div><div id="00:05:42.880" class="transcript_line"> So the dhol is part of Indian percussion as well.</div><div id="00:05:46.880" class="transcript_line"> A family of approximately four or five other drums.</div><div id="00:05:49.880" class="transcript_line"> But the dhol is used during all celebrations periods.</div><div id="00:05:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Most importantly, Vasaki, Harvest Time, as we originally stated.</div><div id="00:05:58.880" class="transcript_line"> This is a very loud instrument played with two sticks.</div><div id="00:06:02.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s approximately a metre and a half big, long, shall I say, carried on the shoulders with a strap.</div><div id="00:06:11.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very, very loud.</div><div id="00:06:13.880" class="transcript_line"> So you can imagine five to ten of them being played at one time.</div><div id="00:06:17.880" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s for people to dance to, Bhangra dancers or what have you, which is which matches that.</div><div id="00:06:23.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always enjoyed the spirit, the rhythm, the enthusiasm of Bhangra, particularly in the carnival context, but in any context.</div><div id="00:06:32.880" class="transcript_line"> There are also a number of, what shall I say, exclamations and chants that to my mind go with the Bhangra experience.</div><div id="00:06:39.880" class="transcript_line"> And now is my chance to finally learn. What exactly does the phrase Haripa mean?</div><div id="00:06:45.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Haripa, I suppose. It&#039;s a difficult one.</div><div id="00:06:50.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s because there&#039;s numerous different translations.</div><div id="00:06:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Please give us a few.</div><div id="00:06:54.880" class="transcript_line"> Mine would be, I would assume, I would say it means joy, if you wish, joy.</div><div id="00:07:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Any other examples you can give?</div><div id="00:07:03.880" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:07:04.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my speech is when you are very jolly and you want to shout out loud that you&#039;re having some fun.</div><div id="00:07:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:07:14.880" class="transcript_line"> So the Bhangra, when the music actually hits to the rhythm on your feet and the brain, you just want to yell out, I&#039;m having some fun.</div><div id="00:07:24.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s similar as when people are dancing, say, in the Western world and they say, hey, ho.</div><div id="00:07:30.880" class="transcript_line"> Got it. It&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:07:32.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, again, when you guys are performing, you shout that.</div><div id="00:07:35.880" class="transcript_line"> I have a tendency to shout it as well, you know, because it raises the atmosphere, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Adding on to what my dad said earlier about you bringing Bhangra into Cardiff and what have you.</div><div id="00:07:46.880" class="transcript_line"> One thing my dad didn&#039;t mention is he actually used to teach as well in schools.</div><div id="00:07:50.880" class="transcript_line"> So from obviously after my grandfather and what have you, once they passed it on to my dad&#039;s generation, my dad then took it into schools.</div><div id="00:07:59.880" class="transcript_line"> And it started to get recognised quite a lot more as an instrument.</div><div id="00:08:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, going back over 20, 25, 30 years ago, even, you can imagine how many people didn&#039;t know what the dhol was.</div><div id="00:08:10.880" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the difference between a dhol and a dholki?</div><div id="00:08:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Dholki is played by hands and that&#039;s a very, it&#039;s a smaller instrument.</div><div id="00:08:17.880" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was a smaller version.</div><div id="00:08:18.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s about half a metre in size.</div><div id="00:08:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:08:21.880" class="transcript_line"> And then the schools, it was in the Key Stage 3, which was very important that a lot of people do some sort of, especially in the Asian, there was not a lot of instruments in the Asian.</div><div id="00:08:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Creative skill.</div><div id="00:08:36.880" class="transcript_line"> And for the other people to give the opportunity for them to play that instrument as well as all the other instruments.</div><div id="00:08:46.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to see one performance that you taught the children at Nenian Park Junior School.</div><div id="00:08:53.880" class="transcript_line"> And it was wonderful.</div><div id="00:08:55.880" class="transcript_line"> And as you say, there were children of Asian origin, or background there, but there were children, you know, from every shape and size, every creed and colour, and they were all into it so much, which is fantastic.</div><div id="00:09:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Of course Bhangra, as well as being a music form, is a dance form as well.</div><div id="00:09:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us a little bit about some of the different shapes you pull and some of the, you know, okay, let me say, I&#039;ve never seen such a wonderful, dramatic, collective dance moves.</div><div id="00:09:30.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the chariot moves.</div><div id="00:09:32.880" class="transcript_line"> Give us some insight into the physical fitness required for this and some of the shapes.</div><div id="00:09:38.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you most definitely have to be fit and you&#039;ve described it very, very well.</div><div id="00:09:43.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something of a lot of physical demanding moves.</div><div id="00:09:47.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very colourful, very bright.</div><div id="00:09:49.880" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the moves that are displayed in a form of Bhangra dance actually signify the harvest time.</div><div id="00:09:56.880" class="transcript_line"> So for example, have you probably seen the sort of snappy sort of stick thing?</div><div id="00:10:00.880" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:01.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s cutting the crops.</div><div id="00:10:02.880" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s actually what they used to do to cut the crops, but we&#039;ve turned them into moves.</div><div id="00:10:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Again, it&#039;s signifying, remembering what we&#039;ve done during this harvest time.</div><div id="00:10:11.880" class="transcript_line"> I say we, my ancestors, during the harvest period.</div><div id="00:10:15.880" class="transcript_line"> So those sort of moves.</div><div id="00:10:17.880" class="transcript_line"> And then obviously they&#039;ve added to more acrobatic style stuff like making pyramids out of 10, 15 people or what have you.</div><div id="00:10:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic.</div><div id="00:10:25.880" class="transcript_line"> So that is very colourful, very bright as well.</div><div id="00:10:28.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been the intention for Cardiff Cardiff of all to reflect the multicultural nature of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:10:36.880" class="transcript_line"> And certainly when the Duaul&#039;s been beating out its fabulous rhythm, the Bhangra dancers have been there.</div><div id="00:10:43.880" class="transcript_line"> What kind of reaction can you remember getting from the wider population as you come through the streets or in the city centre?</div><div id="00:10:52.880" class="transcript_line"> Or indeed when we used to stage Cardiff mass carnival as it was down the bay.</div><div id="00:10:56.880" class="transcript_line"> What can you remember about what?</div><div id="00:10:58.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes. What was people&#039;s reactions like?</div><div id="00:11:00.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a really energetic instrument.</div><div id="00:11:02.880" class="transcript_line"> So it definitely brings out the energy in people.</div><div id="00:11:06.880" class="transcript_line"> You hear loads of chants, loads of screaming, loads of clapping.</div><div id="00:11:10.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the sort of thing, because it&#039;s definitely something.</div><div id="00:11:12.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not something you walk by.</div><div id="00:11:14.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a percussion. It&#039;s similar to the steel pans.</div><div id="00:11:16.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got so much rhythm in the actual instrument.</div><div id="00:11:20.880" class="transcript_line"> It just brings out the energy in you.</div><div id="00:11:24.880" class="transcript_line"> When the actual instrument is played, as soon as it&#039;s played, the Duaul.</div><div id="00:11:29.880" class="transcript_line"> And they will stop and listen to it that split second because it&#039;s so loud and it&#039;s so enjoyable listening to a different instrument.</div><div id="00:11:44.880" class="transcript_line"> And they want to learn more to see how it&#039;s played.</div><div id="00:11:47.880" class="transcript_line"> As you mentioned, it was your father who helped bring this wonderful art form to Wales.</div><div id="00:11:52.880" class="transcript_line"> You then picked up the baton and now we turn to the younger generation, Thiraj.</div><div id="00:11:58.880" class="transcript_line"> Am I right in thinking that, I mean, let&#039;s be honest, just before we start the interview, you have in fact been teaching Duaul today.</div><div id="00:12:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Now, as you mentioned, with the acknowledgement of the instrument and you can even say the genre of music has become very famous.</div><div id="00:12:22.880" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people are learning of numerous ethnicities.</div><div id="00:12:26.880" class="transcript_line"> So I have approximately 12 to 15 students at the moment, ranging from kids that are four and five, that are white, British, Welsh, Muslim, Hindu.</div><div id="00:12:37.880" class="transcript_line"> I even have a doctor from Italia that comes from Bristol.</div><div id="00:12:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Where are they sourcing the instruments?</div><div id="00:12:43.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember at one point, certainly, is it Bina Arts in Southall was a place that people used to go?</div><div id="00:12:50.880" class="transcript_line"> Bina used to be very, very big.</div><div id="00:12:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Back in the day, back in the day.</div><div id="00:12:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Bina is still there. Jazz is probably the most famous now, jazz musicals.</div><div id="00:12:59.880" class="transcript_line"> However, as we move into the 21st century and with internet, people are now sourcing direct from the horse&#039;s mouth, shall we say.</div><div id="00:13:09.880" class="transcript_line"> So from India themselves. So we&#039;re jazz musicals. We&#039;re charging you X amount.</div><div id="00:13:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Say, for example, just to use as an example, a hundred pound for a drum.</div><div id="00:13:17.880" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re now going there and picking them up for 10 percent off the price.</div><div id="00:13:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic. The skins. What are the skins made of?</div><div id="00:13:25.880" class="transcript_line"> The base side, because you&#039;ve got one heavy duty skin and one thin skin.</div><div id="00:13:29.880" class="transcript_line"> The heavy duty one is actually sheepskin.</div><div id="00:13:31.880" class="transcript_line"> So obviously you can hit that as hard as you want.</div><div id="00:13:34.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not really ripping unless your intention is to.</div><div id="00:13:38.880" class="transcript_line"> And then the other side is a thin plastic.</div><div id="00:13:41.880" class="transcript_line"> And the sense of tuning the drum. Is that difficult?</div><div id="00:13:45.880" class="transcript_line"> Is it obviously, you know, bound with ropes?</div><div id="00:13:50.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s exactly it. So originally it was only done with rope.</div><div id="00:13:53.880" class="transcript_line"> So both sides was done with rope.</div><div id="00:13:55.880" class="transcript_line"> But as we move forward into the 21st century, if you wish, they started to change them to nut and bolt.</div><div id="00:14:00.880" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a lot more easier to control.</div><div id="00:14:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Some people do both with nut and bolt, but it&#039;s not very common because the base side, you don&#039;t get the same sound as doing it with rope.</div><div id="00:14:10.880" class="transcript_line"> So people have rope on the base side still that you can tighten and loosen after every performance.</div><div id="00:14:16.880" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got the nut and bolt to do the treble side.</div><div id="00:14:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Got it.
