    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What are your earliest memories of television?</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> My earliest memories of television I think must have been possibly the coronation of the Queen</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> because that was about the time that my parents had a television</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and prior to that of course we didn&#039;t have one at home</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> but when the coronation came that was about the first time we had one in our own home</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> so my grandparents didn&#039;t have one obviously</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> so that really was my first recollection of having it in my own home</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was aware of television and of other people having it</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;d never had the opportunity to sort of sit and watch it myself</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> but having said that I am not a big television addict</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m quite happy with a little television screen</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> my husband had a much larger television</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> but after he passed away I decided it was too big and heavy so that went</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and people always comment</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh how do you manage to see what you know on television</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s totally adequate for what I need</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and I listen to the radio quite a lot in the day</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> because I feel like in work and do jobs</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and still keep myself informed</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> but with television it&#039;s not quite as easy</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s a moving picture you tend to want to sit and watch it</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> which is nice to be able to relax I quite agree</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;m not a big television fan</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> How have your viewing patterns changed over the years?</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I would say I watch more now in retirement</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and because I live on my own possibly</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> because when my husband was alive as with most families</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the remote control was always that side wherever he was</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and so it was a matter of popping in</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and then if there was something that I was interested in</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> that he was watching maybe I would sit and watch with him</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> but generally I&#039;d just let him have his choice</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and he sort of chose what he was interested in</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> if there was anything I was particularly interested in</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> yes I would sit and watch it</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but now because I&#039;m on my own and I have more time</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I have my own choice and I can watch whatever programmes I&#039;m interested in</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> but as I say I&#039;m not a very big fan of it</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you any experience of watching television with a lot of other people or in a public place?</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> In my early days when television was very new</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> yes I know when my parents first had the television</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and the coronation was on and I can&#039;t remember which royal wedding was on</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember my mother inviting people in</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> because other people that were her friends and neighbours that didn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> were obviously very keen and interested to see</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and they would be quite a houseful</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you know it&#039;s a social occasion</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> because people would sit down and they&#039;d have their cups of tea or coffee</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and their sandwich or biscuit</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was really quite pleasant</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s gone now hasn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> because everybody&#039;s got one, two or even three or four televisions in their home</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not just the family one</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> the youngsters have got their own televisions in their rooms now haven&#039;t they</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s become well part of life today</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s just an accepted part of life that everybody has a television</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> similarly I suppose to when I was a child</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> the radio was the thing that we liked to have</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> but those are my early recollections of social occasions with television</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> everything that you&#039;ve seen on television</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> what would you say has had the greatest effect on your impact on you?</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I must say that I enjoy watching operas on television</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and when you get somebody like Bryn Terfel</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Geraint Evans going way back</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Dame Gwyneth Jones</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and when you see people like that performing</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> who are Welsh people</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> it gives a big thrill</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and this is one of the things I feel that television has helped to bring to the working class person</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> it gives you that opportunity to see wonderful performances</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> which we were denied before unless we had the means to go to the theatre</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> or travel to London, maybe Liverpool or Manchester</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but we were very very limited in our musical standards I feel before the advent of television</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I know we could hear it on radio but it&#039;s not quite as good as seeing an actual performance is it?</div></div></p>
