    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The opera, well now another thing I do about this, because between my grandfather, my grandmother,</div><div id="00:00:09.880" class="transcript_line"> my mother and my father, my mother&#039;s sister, Auntie Elena, sisters were thinking, oh there&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:18.040" class="transcript_line"> a great one because of the dressing up and so on, smart clothes and non-smart clothes,</div><div id="00:00:23.400" class="transcript_line"> and they were really into thinking of it all the time, and they were singing all the time.</div><div id="00:00:27.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember then as the sergeant policeman in the Pirates of Penzance, oh and it was great,</div><div id="00:00:35.480" class="transcript_line"> we were singing those choruses and the songs for months afterwards, having learnt them from my uncle.</div><div id="00:00:41.880" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever perform in the operas? Oh yes. Well tell me about performing,</div><div id="00:00:47.040" class="transcript_line"> did you perform at the Coliseum? Oh tremendous excitement, yeah, we put in a tremendous amount</div><div id="00:00:53.160" class="transcript_line"> of time. And tell me what it felt like just to walk onto the Coliseum stage and perform?</div><div id="00:00:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Excitement, excitement galore. I can remember when acting in Patience, you were Patience,</div><div id="00:01:07.560" class="transcript_line"> the upper Patience? I told you then, Brass Elmint and everything, they were real swords,</div><div id="00:01:16.120" class="transcript_line"> they were real swords, full length sword, lashing away at one another, sword fighting,</div><div id="00:01:23.440" class="transcript_line"> and then of course the orchestra would strike up and we&#039;d watch the conductor&#039;s face, whether he</div><div id="00:01:28.720" class="transcript_line"> was pleased or not, whether he could play from the orchestra, because he was already looked at</div><div id="00:01:35.440" class="transcript_line"> more than anything else, but the song was very good, very good, and we had some fine singers,</div><div id="00:01:41.920" class="transcript_line"> and tremendous ovations, tremendous ovations, and if you were a soloist and you warmed the heart of</div><div id="00:01:50.480" class="transcript_line"> the audience with a love song from someone in the operas, it would sound and it could go on and</div><div id="00:01:56.960" class="transcript_line"> go on and go on, and that&#039;s how, you couldn&#039;t have enough of it, it was marvelous. Then the Coliseum</div><div id="00:02:03.280" class="transcript_line"> was ringing to the rafters with the sound of the people cheering and clapping and stamping their</div><div id="00:02:08.800" class="transcript_line"> feet and doing everything to let the singers know that they&#039;d gone down well.</div></div></p>
