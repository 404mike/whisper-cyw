    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I went to live with the relatives in Ammanford who kept the big, but I didn&#039;t like it there.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I missed my brothers and sisters wanting to go home, and it was only in Ammanford, which is not very far.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I came home and eventually, you know, I was allowed to do wall work.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And was that in the local factory?</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually no, we had to travel to Bridgend, you know, with the bus and the train and hundreds to go to the Royal Ordnance Factory, making different things.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But eventually I became a fitter.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And during the war I went to a training centre in Newport and came back and I was allowed to join the Union, Engineering Union, which was another dog really, you know, with men in the engineering.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s another tale.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you said you were from a very large family. Can you tell me again how many there was?</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the eldest sister died and I had three other sisters and two brothers.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And you said your uncle and auntie had quite a few children as well.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There were big families around us all in the street, you know.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> There was the Morganses and the Jameses, you know.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the biggest family I think in that street then.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But there we are. We all mucked in and did things.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember my sister getting married on a boxing day.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father and mother were glad that she was getting married because she was working in Cardiff, you see, and Cardiff was being bombed.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And there we are.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The only time that we were in a street, you know, was when a plane dropped some bombs on the drink and we mucked it then, you know.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But between this village and the next village there was an army post.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And before you crossed over the bridge, you know, you had to be a few walking then, you know, buses would go.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I used to go to Brecon because it felt safer somehow, I would say.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband and I then, no, my boyfriend, he was then, he would cast the bus.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I spent a lot of time looking around the cathedral and did things because my mother then didn&#039;t like me going to Swansea at all in case of the bombing.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe your street and the river behind your house?</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The canal.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The canal.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, that canal had been there for years, it&#039;s no longer there.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They did the bypass on it eventually.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But, well, the canal was a way of life there, you know, kids used to play there.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And then behind that there was another little stream and that was more or less coming from the muddyn which was cleaner than the canal.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But people used to do a lot of things in the canal, they used to throw their water, you know, and a lot of things.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to say that you weren&#039;t a member of the street until you had fallen into the canal.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You were christened in the canal sort of thing, you know.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the canal, canal bank, where a lot of people used to walk on a Sunday evening after chapel.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a venue like, you know, you saw these couples and families and things.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the house coming down the steps and into the house and then the street and across the street the gardens.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody in the street did their gardens, you know, just to grow things.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And an uncle of mine had built big greenhouses and used to grow tomatoes and things like that.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, they say chicken is very popular now.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, chicken was popular in our house then because that was a way of eating out the rations and things.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> During the war anyway.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I even ate goat&#039;s meat.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when the goats used to have tins, I don&#039;t know, I remember giving it to my husband when he didn&#039;t know what meat to eat.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, oh, when he had that, it was goat meat, it was modified.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But rabbits we used to, you know, have.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Because men used to go shooting and trapping and things.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But every Christmas there was a goose, of course.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And no turkeys then.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I say, my father used to grow onions.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was snuggler shawls, you know, photographed there somewhere, my uncle and with these big huge onions.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And Sunnybrook Shawl was a big venue then.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how we lived back then.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when I started work in the RF factory in Bridgend, I hated going out in the morning in the dark.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother was the only one who used to get up and take me to the bus sometimes.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I hated the dark.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my other brother used to come and meet me sometimes.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But we survived.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You told me the story earlier on of your family keeping animals.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me again about that?</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> About keeping?</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Your family kept animals?</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was, we kept animals.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We kept them, it was like a plank, you know, a big long thing to cross.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the other side of the canal there was all sheds then.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where they kept the chickens, the geese were there.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt even had a donkey.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to be dressed up for the carnival, you know.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And an old man, another gentleman living on the other side of the canal, used to dress a cart up and he&#039;d go to the carnival with the donkey.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But that all finished with the war, you see.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that it was never the same, was it?</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was coating with my husband and he was in the mines, but he also had to do fire watching and things, you know.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> When I used to work shift or whatever, perhaps he was, the only time we used to meet, he&#039;d come down by the last bus when I was after noon.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come home by the 11th or 12th.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d meet me and walk up and go to the house then.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have his lowers there and then he&#039;d walk up the canal bank then all the way back to other cranes.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, as I say, it was the miners who were working six days a week then.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was working seven days a week sometimes.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Different shifts and things.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember my youngest, my brother then, he was only 14.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wanted to join up, I think, or 15, something like that.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> When I got home one afternoon, Tom was in the house and my mother said he&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He wanted to join up.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Infusia related with Dite.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He went down to try and join a ship in the Saunday Docks.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were bobbing, of course.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They were bobbing and he was under this table in this seaman&#039;s place somewhere.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Mother Solie remembers, he&#039;s having a big mug of tea under the table of this place.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he could hardly lift the mug. He was saying it was so heavy.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But he came home anyway and he never joined up.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> The experience put him up.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother didn&#039;t want him to go anywhere.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother had died and I remember him then.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> He wanted to join the Palestinian police.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And he sent away.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother knew the envelope she was to burn.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She just didn&#039;t want him to go.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> If we go back to Joseph Herman, can you describe to me how you first met him?</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was in this pentagon.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had been asked to go and help out with Ben and Katie.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They were kept in the pub.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And Katie had broken her ankle, I think it was.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were looking.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to help.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I knew of him there before.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because as I say, my cousin was doing the washing and things.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother, my cousin, were very, very friendly.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to help out with them.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I got really to know him there in the pentagon.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I hadn&#039;t, I had seen her but I had never spoken to her.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I became more used to her when she moved from the pentagon to the street where I lived.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they had done the studio.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I worked with him, I knew him.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Used to come and stand outside the bar in Pentagon.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was funny, you know, saying different things.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the time after a while he asked, could you paint my portrait?</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was very impressed.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother told my mother, my mother said, yes.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then of course when we went to, she said, you know, how old I was.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And was I a virgin?</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother told my mother, my mother said, no way, leave it there.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think he was, his way of asking, you know, what I was and who I was then.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, I didn&#039;t find him, as I say, he was a bit flamboyant, you know.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was walking about in his cape and you would see him coming in the distance, you know.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you used to see him and he used to like crossing the canal, you know, and going up.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But other than him, he used to go towards where the mines were that way then.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen him sat on the bridge where the bridge is in Estragon Lice now and sat there waiting for the miners to come home, you know, that way.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think she would like to go up to what we call the patches, you know, and to do a little bit of sketching that way.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I did see one or two things that she had done, you know, different to him and all his friends.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had a cape and a camaschanto and things and she looked different to the people of the village.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She talked to anyone, and children especially.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She had a good rapport with her son.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to, I&#039;m thinking of the festival of St. Joshua, which was, there was like a festival with us,</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and like carnival type thing, and people were dressing up and she dressed my son.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She had this whiskwood from somewhere and a fez on his head and coloured him a bit with something and striped pyjama bottoms and a thick,</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> she put a few beads on his slippers or something like that and he went and rolled a carpet into his hand.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a photo of the attic somewhere of him.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He wasn&#039;t very old, you know, but there is a photo of him by the wall by wherever we lived then.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was more inclined to, I think, get involved with the, than he was, but he talked to anybody or anything, you know.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of the miners thought a lot of him, you know, because he was so ordinary like that with them.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And by then a lot of the elders used to think that because he built that, they had that big wall built around the studio, as they called it,</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s going to go on there, you know, and then, oh, is he a communist, you know, and things like that.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In a way it was sharp when they went, you know, because the studio was empty then for a while, you know, until Peggy and I came.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were big friends of his and through that Peggy Ray got involved with them and Diana, Thomas John and a lot of others.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They were big settler friends in the village, I think.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I say, I knew the lady, Mrs. Galley, and I was told that there was a portrait of her in the nude, you know, partly in the nude.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would talk that she was pregnant at the time, I think, you know.</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I never saw the portrait, but there was, I remember this woman living in the street and she had had a new baby.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have seen that photo.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry if I just...</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, just to recap.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know what else to say.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, you know, quite ordinary people.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I knew, when we had heard, that she was a wealthy woman.</div><div id="00:18:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And she never gave us that impression at all, you know.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But my mother used to say, you know, and my cousin with them, once they moved to the studio, I don&#039;t think my cousin, somebody else then, as a maid with them, I remember who she was.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And, my mother used to say, you know, they can&#039;t have got much money, look, you know, because of the bedding and things like that.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s the way they lived, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I believe we have a lifestyle like that.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe the bedding?</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was red, just ordinary, but it was red and a red tablecloth and, you know, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s so, but I remember the bedding more than anything.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I say, it was wartime and everything was white with everybody else then, you know.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But this was red, red pillow pieces.</div><div id="00:19:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I remember mainly, then, you know, my mother saying, no, Bob, you want red pillow pieces, but, you know, that&#039;s their way, I suppose.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she did have a pet hen in this place in Pennebont, and my cousin&#039;s husband, the hen wasn&#039;t well, you know, and he had to go away with it down the little cage that they had.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember him saying, but if she had fed it up a bit, then she would have had a nice meal out of it, but I don&#039;t think they would have wanted to eat this hen because it was more of a, like a pet with them.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it was a special breed or what, I don&#039;t know, but I remember my cousin&#039;s husband saying about the hen that he was called because the hen.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought that was really funny that somebody had a pet hen because we had plenty of hens where we lived and nobody would have time to because it was a show to feed them and clean the sheds out and things.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We talk about the red sheets. What did, what were people&#039;s first reactions to it?</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I say, my mother was, my cousin, my cousin, took it in a straight, I think, and then my mother told me and I went to see, you know, these red pillow pieces and things.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They think it on, but I had never seen red sheets before or red pillow pieces. But whether she had died them, she had had them died, I don&#039;t know, but they were bright red.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I say, she dressed differently to anybody else in the village. She had beautiful boots, you know, and things. And his cape and tamarshankam and him and his cape and his little Popeye hat. It was quite dapper.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You said that your mother thought the red sheets most symbolized them, I think.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. Well, as I say, my mother thought he was a communist. And then when they built the big walls around it, you know, a lot of the elderly people in the street were saying, but you want that big wall for, you know, they want it, they got to Hyde and things like that.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But they accepted it in the end, you know. And my mother, always, you know, she&#039;d pass and she&#039;d say good morning or he&#039;d say, you know, or raise his hand and, you know, a way he went with his easel under his arm and things.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he tried to fit in then, you know. In the end, people never used to think, you know, but he was a bit of a mystery when he came first.</div><div id="00:23:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And how he came, I think it was to do with Peggy and I, they are friends in Lendensie and they were local and they must have brought them down this way. I never had the proper story with Peggy, how they, but it became, in the end, of course, Peggy lived in the studio for years after that.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how Betty has got it now because they were related. If Peggy was alive, she could tell you more, much more, I expect. Now Dinah, she would know more because they were so friendly.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t say I was ever that friendly with them, but I remember him well and I remember the time in Pennabont. Once they went to the studio and, you know, eventually I got married and then I came back to the street to live and then she, now there&#039;s Mrs. Gallagher,</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> she fought after the war to have a children&#039;s clinic and they got, and I think, well, she did more than he did, got involved that way with the locality then.</div><div id="00:24:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember, you know, Mrs. Gallagher, and I remember going with a poster on the pram, you know, to try and get the first baby clinic in the Stringerland after the war.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were very friendly. The house around the corner, there was a big house and they used to go there quite a lot. But there again, Mrs. Gallagher and her husband, they talked. Well, Mrs. Gallagher was more or less local, but he was.</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was Scottish, Mr. Gallagher, so maybe they got friendly that way, you see, because she was Scottish.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I have, you know, Dinah has told us one or two things when we&#039;re in company, how they met and how they, you know, and his life and no doubt she helped him because she had money and, you know, he had nothing and that started him off right, more or less.</div><div id="00:25:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I should think so anyway, because until he became more well known then, you know, then they left and went back to London. We used to, yeah, setting things about them, you know, found out that they had parted, you know, and divorced and things.</div><div id="00:26:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think she still carried a torch for him, you know, from what I can gather. But I have seen his wife then, you know, but I&#039;ve never spoken of my husband.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that Joseph captured the essence of this together, the people and the industry?</div><div id="00:27:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think he concentrated more on the mining aspect of the Strygonite. As I say, I remember him taking a picture and I seen that. She&#039;s nursing a child Welsh-fusher, like, you know, on the doorstep and things.</div><div id="00:27:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was very interested in it, to the point that he went and he went to go underground and, you know, back to the, in the Skiing and Collering, watched them coming.</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> As I say, my brother was, you know, and he was coming home from night shift. You&#039;d see him going and he had been up early watching the men going to work and watching them coming back because I think he was more fascinated with the mining of the area and the miners themselves.</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to go into the pub and have a chat with them and capture them, you know, smoking and things like that. But as I say at first, I didn&#039;t like the way he was portraying the miners because they didn&#039;t resemble the miners to me as I knew them, you know.</div><div id="00:28:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But then that&#039;s the way he saw them, you know. And you could see there, sometimes I used to think, oh, he does look bad and does look ill in that one, you know, because they were suffering, some of them then, with the chest problems and things.</div><div id="00:28:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe what, if you started from one end of Astigan Lice and walked through the town to the other side, can you describe what you would see and the people you would meet?</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were very friendly at that time, you know. Everybody knew everybody else. And Welfare Hall, they had dances and dramas and operas.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The big Male Voice Choir was a huge success, a band, a silver band. And very often when Male Voice had a concert, you had to go weeks ahead to have a ticket, I think.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the Historia Cinema, it was a wonderful cinema, beautiful films and things like that. But I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s vastly different now. There wasn&#039;t so many houses, you know.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they, after the war, they built the local factory, the Tik Tok, as they called it. Well, that became a way of life for them, yeah. There were so many people working there.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was something new to the village because the young men didn&#039;t have to go to the mines, they could have an apprenticeship in the local factories and things.</div><div id="00:30:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one, and then there was Perry Chain, as they called it, in Calan, in Tabont, just up the road. And that brought prosperity that way to them.</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But I would say that all villages, they say, you know, there&#039;s a lot of people come in to live to this area. Whereas before, as I say, you knew everybody.</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I could walk into any house in the street, you know, and you knew, you know, nobody would ask you what you want or anything like that. And where I lived in the street, there was a lot of relatives, aunts and uncles and cousins, living all along the street.</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> If anybody was barred, well, you know, you knew you&#039;d have support and sympathy. It&#039;s not like that now.</div><div id="00:31:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like that when Joseph came at first, because, as I say, everybody knew everybody in the street and the surrounding. Because it&#039;s odd where we lived. There was two public houses in the street, the miners and the star.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And then down the bottom of the street, there was the unischeduling house, which is still around. And then around the corner, where they made their first home, the Pennebots.</div><div id="00:31:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was three chapels around us at the time, the Tabernacles, Sardis, Anina, the Baptists, Methodists, and an independent chapel. And that was the way of life then.</div><div id="00:32:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The river. Kids used to swim and play in the river. There were no swimming pools or anything then. And it was a treat to go to the beach in Swansea or Pothkul or somewhere, you know.</div><div id="00:32:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember one time, I don&#039;t know whether it was some relative of Joseph&#039;s wife then, and there was a big car came into the village and they were saying that somebody, a relative of hers or something.</div><div id="00:32:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And that caused a stir. And a lot of people were saying, why didn&#039;t he, after the war and things, more cars were on the road. Funny that old Joseph hasn&#039;t got the car, they used to say.</div><div id="00:33:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t think of it that way. As I say, there were plenty of buses. Buses, well, the road is closed now, around the Skedwin Arms that way. There was an open road all the way down to the Guernas.</div><div id="00:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They closed the canal then and did a bike pass then, behind where I lived, in the street there. So he must have seen a lot of changes while he was here, because he was here during the war then.</div><div id="00:33:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s about all.</div><div id="00:33:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And you said the bus used to go through your street?</div><div id="00:33:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:33:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You said the bus used to go through your street?</div><div id="00:34:00.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not at the bottom of the street.</div><div id="00:34:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Bottom of the street.</div><div id="00:34:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Bottom of the street. But he used to work around the corner and up to Cungier, you know, every hour practically. But the bus is going now.</div><div id="00:34:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And he would jump on the bus and go anywhere. And never used to go to Swansea during the war much. Only to Brecken and the like. We considered it safer to go up that way than down to Swansea.</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> When I used to like, well, we went married then to go to the Empire in Swansea where they had live shows. Remember, see, Vera Linda. Then we used to catch the train in St. Thomas and come back up to Rosalvera and walk then, you know, perhaps if there was no bus or something.</div><div id="00:35:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And this night, I forget, we had been to see. And when we got into the train, the air raid, the train was blacked out in the station, it was moving. When I got home, it was very late. I remember that my brother was at the bottom of the street waiting for us.</div><div id="00:35:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Then my husband was told in all certain terms that he wanted to take me again down to Swansea. That&#039;s the life we had, you see. We were better off than millions.</div><div id="00:35:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think the time they spent amongst the Western people, I think, Joseph and I enjoyed themselves. It became like, you know, anyone else then. At first, of course, they were a talking point.</div><div id="00:35:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Why have they chosen us to come like that? You know, and things like that. And as I say, when they off the studio, the old pop factory brought.</div><div id="00:36:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it became, after the pop, it became during the war, a food distribution, you know, like a warehouse. I remember them, some local men worked at them. And then when it was finished, they did, you know, it was all right.</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I did go to a studio once, and I thought it was wonderful, you know, the way they handled it. But I sat in the garden with them, with her then especially, and she used to open it up and have children there to play.</div><div id="00:36:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to give them poppies. And I remember one time she put a magic show on for the children. And then, that&#039;s the way they lived.</div><div id="00:37:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know why they decided to move back to London?</div><div id="00:37:17.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I didn&#039;t know. I can&#039;t really say. They were all wondering what would happen. And then, of course, Peggy and I came to live in the studio. And they were very, very friendly with us.</div><div id="00:37:39.000" class="transcript_line"> How they became friends, I don&#039;t know. But they were in London at one time as well, you see, you know. And they never had any children, so.</div><div id="00:37:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the first time my mother ever said how she felt after being married. And I always remember her telling me that when you lose a husband, yes, you lose a partner.</div><div id="00:38:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When you lose a child, you lose part of the interest. And then, apparently, my sister was a very, how can I say, she liked going to church and chapel.</div><div id="00:38:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And an aunt of mine was an apostolic. And she used to take ladies with her. And she&#039;d get up and sing at that age, you know. And my mother used to say, oh, she was too good for this world. That&#039;s why she went like that.</div><div id="00:38:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember my mother saying that they had been talking outside somewhere. And she, I think, she told that she had buried a little girl, you know.</div><div id="00:39:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not long ago we put a headstone different to what was there because the church, and it&#039;s so old. And, you know, I was saying how.</div><div id="00:39:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I say, with Mrs. Herman, I think she knew more about the people in the street than maybe he did because she used to, you know.</div><div id="00:39:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Although, as I say, he&#039;d talk to anybody. Or wherever you were, you know, he&#039;d find something to it. And I know he used to love going to the public houses and seeing the men how they were and things.</div><div id="00:39:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was quite a few characters in the area as well.</div><div id="00:40:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Your mother must have felt very comfortable with Katie to tell her about your daughter.</div><div id="00:40:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I think by asking me what he did ask then, you know, maybe he wanted to know more about me then, you know.</div><div id="00:40:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that, as you say, he could make his own thoughts about how to portray.</div><div id="00:40:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I do remember that time in the Cardiff, Stedford.</div><div id="00:40:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went in and to the, where all the pictures were shown around there.</div><div id="00:40:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember someone asking, when was this, when, you know, about Joseph&#039;s and saying, a woman saying, they don&#039;t look like miners to me, you know.</div><div id="00:41:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did say, well, I happen to know him, you know, I said. That&#039;s how he saw the miners.</div><div id="00:41:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And from a distance, I think, you know, close up was to think, but then seeing them in frames and things like that, you had a different perspective on it.</div><div id="00:41:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But at first, I never thought much of this.</div><div id="00:41:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve seen books and things since, you know, and you could see how he saw the miners.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When I think of a miner, I think of him in a, you know, hard hat with the lamp and things like that.</div><div id="00:41:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There we are. That&#039;s it. Another era gone.</div><div id="00:42:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I was sorry to see them go, you know, because, as I say, they became part of life.</div><div id="00:42:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They fitted in then.</div><div id="00:42:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe it&#039;s of some help to you.</div></div></p>
