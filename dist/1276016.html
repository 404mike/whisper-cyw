    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> During the Red Summer in America, the race riots were all over America, not just the South.</div><div id="00:00:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Chicago is the one that seems to have gotten the most coverage nowadays, but it happened in other</div><div id="00:00:11.200" class="transcript_line"> places. And one of the most telling photographs of those race riots was taken in Omaha. And this</div><div id="00:00:18.720" class="transcript_line"> next video, next narration is from Weymark Productions and it&#039;s Race Riots in Omaha,</div><div id="00:00:26.560" class="transcript_line"> The Lynching of Will Brown and it is chapter 19 of our race riots project.</div><div id="00:00:34.560" class="transcript_line"> In the late 1800s, Omaha, Nebraska was a booming western city that was soon to become number one</div><div id="00:00:40.240" class="transcript_line"> in the world in livestock meat production. In the early 1900s, nearly 80 percent of Omaha&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:47.040" class="transcript_line"> population of an estimated 125,000 people had livestock related jobs. These workers were</div><div id="00:00:54.480" class="transcript_line"> primarily of European descent. And from 1910 to 1919, their participation in labor strikes</div><div id="00:01:01.680" class="transcript_line"> and the First World War left many vacancies at the meat packaging plants. To fill the void,</div><div id="00:01:07.680" class="transcript_line"> company owners vigorously recruited blacks in the southern states. There were ads and papers in</div><div id="00:01:12.720" class="transcript_line"> Omaha and throughout the South that beckoned blacks to come north to better wages and living</div><div id="00:01:16.880" class="transcript_line"> conditions. The wages that blacks were paid at the Omaha plants were lower than white workers,</div><div id="00:01:23.600" class="transcript_line"> but it was significantly more money than they could earn in the South.</div><div id="00:01:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Hundreds of blacks began to replace white plant workers and by 1915, a burgeoning black community</div><div id="00:01:33.120" class="transcript_line"> was established near the meat packaging plants in South Omaha and the near north side of the city.</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> A new African-American newspaper called The Monitor began circulation in the summer of 1915.</div><div id="00:01:46.400" class="transcript_line"> The Monitor was published weekly with news stories, columns and advertising that was vital to</div><div id="00:01:51.280" class="transcript_line"> establishing a strong sense of community among blacks in Omaha.</div><div id="00:01:56.640" class="transcript_line"> By 1920, over 10,000 African-Americans were living in Omaha.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Because of the rapid growth in the African-American population and employment</div><div id="00:02:11.920" class="transcript_line"> situations at the meat packaging plants, racial tension began to build in Omaha.</div><div id="00:02:17.120" class="transcript_line"> This tension culminated in the summer of 1919 when one plant worker in particular</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> met a horrible fate. This was the period of red hot summer. This was the period where about that</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> what it is you&#039;d already had to ride to St. Louis, other places. And now you happen to be in Omaha.</div><div id="00:02:33.840" class="transcript_line"> What happened was they they had a woman say that she had been molested or had been sexually abused</div><div id="00:02:41.680" class="transcript_line"> by a black man. And that&#039;s all that needed to be said. On September 25, 1919, Agnes Loebke</div><div id="00:02:51.280" class="transcript_line"> identified 40-year-old Will Brown as the man who attacked her. Brown was then arrested and taken</div><div id="00:02:57.280" class="transcript_line"> to the Douglas County Courthouse. Before Brown was even identified, a civic storm was already</div><div id="00:03:04.080" class="transcript_line"> brewing in Omaha due to a series of inflammatory stories published in the Omaha Bee and struggles</div><div id="00:03:09.760" class="transcript_line"> for political power between racketeer Thomas Dennison and Omaha&#039;s mayor Edward Smith.</div><div id="00:03:16.960" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s interesting is is that the mayor attempted to keep them from taking Will Brown out of jail</div><div id="00:03:26.320" class="transcript_line"> and he suffered from an inch of his life of his life being taken from him. And that was really</div><div id="00:03:32.640" class="transcript_line"> intent from the very beginning to really kill him as well as to bring about the racial tension</div><div id="00:03:42.320" class="transcript_line"> even more so. On the evening of September 28, 1919, a crowd of an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people</div><div id="00:03:51.040" class="transcript_line"> gathered outside the Douglas County Courthouse and demanded that Brown be handed over to them.</div><div id="00:03:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Inside the courthouse, a frightened judge and other prisoners sent a note down to the crowd</div><div id="00:04:02.080" class="transcript_line"> saying that they would surrender Brown. The bloodthirsty crowd could not wait</div><div id="00:04:06.880" class="transcript_line"> and rushed into the courthouse to seize Brown. Once in the hands of the crowd, Brown was beaten,</div><div id="00:04:13.280" class="transcript_line"> hung from a lamppost, and shot more than 100 times. Actor Henry Fonda, at the time just 14 years old,</div><div id="00:04:22.080" class="transcript_line"> witnessed the horrendous event from a second story window at his father&#039;s printing company across the</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> street from the courthouse. The ghastly melee ended with the burning of Will Brown&#039;s body.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> An Omaha World Herald photographer captured one of the most infamous photographs in American history.</div><div id="00:04:42.800" class="transcript_line"> After the riot, federal troops were called in and for two days Omaha was under martial law.</div><div id="00:04:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Even though over 100 people were arrested in connection with the riot</div><div id="00:04:54.880" class="transcript_line"> and the murder of Will Brown, no one was charged. For Omaha&#039;s black community,</div><div id="00:05:00.640" class="transcript_line"> an editorial picture published in the Monitor spoke volumes.</div><div id="00:05:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Will Brown was buried in 1919 in an unmarked grave in Powders Field at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Omaha.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Ninety years later, in July of 2009, a man from Riverside, California, Chris A. Bear,</div><div id="00:05:22.320" class="transcript_line"> who has no ties to the city of Omaha and has never visited before,</div><div id="00:05:26.480" class="transcript_line"> was moved to pay $450 of his own money for a marker for Will Brown&#039;s grave.</div><div id="00:05:33.200" class="transcript_line"> A Bear said that he watched a special on actor Henry Fonda,</div><div id="00:05:36.240" class="transcript_line"> which mentioned the riot and how it affected his life and his acting career.</div><div id="00:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> A Bear also said that he hopes people will stop by the headstone</div><div id="00:05:44.720" class="transcript_line"> and reflect on what happened to Will Brown in 1919.</div><div id="00:05:47.680" class="transcript_line"> So that we may never let ourselves sink again to this level of inhumanity.</div><div id="00:05:53.200" class="transcript_line"> Once again, we would like to credit Weymark Productions for the excellent work of the</div><div id="00:06:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Once again we would like to credit Weymark Productions for the excellent work.</div></div></p>
