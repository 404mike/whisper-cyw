    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is August 15th 2019 and I&#039;m here in the beautiful Nantgull Church having a chat</div><div id="00:00:10.520" class="transcript_line"> with Mr Michael Morgan originally from these parts but now living in Surrey. Mike welcome</div><div id="00:00:18.400" class="transcript_line"> to the church and thanks for agreeing to have a little bit of a chat. Mike tell me where</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> are you from originally? I know it&#039;s these parts somewhere. A farm called Lower Ochekeven,</div><div id="00:00:30.080" class="transcript_line"> from Typhoon. Right and what sort of farm was that? Part arable, part hill I suppose you might</div><div id="00:00:41.560" class="transcript_line"> call it. So you had the best of both worlds really? Yes. Can you remember anything in particular</div><div id="00:00:48.040" class="transcript_line"> about the people who lived in that area about any of the characters who you know passed by?</div><div id="00:00:54.480" class="transcript_line"> I remember some old gentleman that lived at the Upper Ochekeven, I made because it was lower,</div><div id="00:01:05.280" class="transcript_line"> middle and upper so he may have been at Middle Ochekeven. We were certainly at Lower Ochekeven</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and he used to be, you could set your club by him, he&#039;d be walking coming into town on a Wednesday</div><div id="00:01:16.320" class="transcript_line"> on his pony at one o&#039;clock he&#039;d pass by the house. So you could virtually set your watch by him.</div><div id="00:01:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. A gentleman of regular habits. Yes, very elderly gentleman, often wondered who he was and</div><div id="00:01:33.520" class="transcript_line"> what his family was. Yes it would be interesting to find out. And what was life on the farm like?</div><div id="00:01:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Were you busy? Were you kept busy all the time? It was very basic, there was no electricity,</div><div id="00:01:45.400" class="transcript_line"> coal fired, heating, part of the chimney. Sort of things we take for granted today then weren&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:54.400" class="transcript_line"> really around. Yes. And what about schooling then Mike, primary school, secondary school,</div><div id="00:02:01.760" class="transcript_line"> do you have any memories fond or otherwise? I come to school and then on up to</div><div id="00:02:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Raleigh School and then up to Binturion School, secondary modern. And can you remember your teachers in the primary school?</div><div id="00:02:17.200" class="transcript_line"> No I can&#039;t, I&#039;ve lost track of them in my mind. Well obviously one... In fact until I get to Binturion,</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> secondary modern, I can&#039;t remember much of it. I&#039;m afraid it was a bit of a dance. Oh go on, I&#039;m sure you made up for it in other ways.</div><div id="00:02:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And well it turns out that when you went to Binturion, my father was one of your teachers</div><div id="00:02:41.360" class="transcript_line"> and I believe he taught you woodwork Mike, so have you still got any memories of anything you made or anything you did?</div><div id="00:02:49.360" class="transcript_line"> I can remember him chasing me around the woodwork room with a chair leg. Oh dear, had you fashioned the chair leg?</div><div id="00:02:58.160" class="transcript_line"> And oh several things I&#039;ve got at home still, there&#039;s a little news today that I learnt under your father&#039;s tutelage.</div><div id="00:03:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s wonderful, so something good came out of all that. Yes, I enjoyed my time there.</div><div id="00:03:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, what about social life, friends, things to do in the evening? There was the YMCA in town</div><div id="00:03:22.480" class="transcript_line"> and of course once one got old enough you crept round the back of the pub for a pint.</div><div id="00:03:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think we all did a little bit of that. Now you found... It was then known as the butcher&#039;s arms.</div><div id="00:03:36.480" class="transcript_line"> The Kondyther arms, no, no, it&#039;s called the horseshoe now isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Round the back road there. Yes, yes I think I know the one you mean.</div><div id="00:03:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Your ancestors came from Dolvolle which of course is one of the farms under the water now.</div><div id="00:03:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember anything about those people and where they came from, their names etc.?</div><div id="00:04:01.040" class="transcript_line"> I believe they came to live there originally from Camastwith area.</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> I know that there&#039;s a churchyard near Camastwith that&#039;s got a heck of a lot of Morgans&#039; names on the stones.</div><div id="00:04:15.600" class="transcript_line"> What I&#039;d tip it I learnt from when I was a lad confirms itself that they did all come from Camastwith originally</div><div id="00:04:25.600" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t know any of their history or anything.</div><div id="00:04:30.160" class="transcript_line"> So and there was a connection with the Lewis Lloyds with the land that they were on over there I believe.</div><div id="00:04:40.160" class="transcript_line"> So they came when they... one of the family of the Lewis Lloyds ended up living in Red at the Nile Hall</div><div id="00:04:50.720" class="transcript_line"> and from that some of the family came down to live here at Dolvolle.</div><div id="00:04:58.720" class="transcript_line"> To live and farm at Dolvolle, yes.</div><div id="00:05:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Your cousin of course is Mary, Mary Morgan as she was now, Mary Connolly.</div><div id="00:05:08.720" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;re telling me about her, was it her grandmother who came from somewhere in England to be working in service?</div><div id="00:05:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, as I understand it when the family lived at Dolvolle</div><div id="00:05:25.280" class="transcript_line"> would have been my great uncle, I could even be further back than that perhaps.</div><div id="00:05:31.280" class="transcript_line"> One of them started to go out and was courting a girl who lived at the big house down the road at Nankwip.</div><div id="00:05:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And eventually they got married and that&#039;s how I came to be.</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sort of one of your very important ancestors.</div><div id="00:05:53.840" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m part English through that as well.</div><div id="00:05:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Part English as well.</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Well you&#039;ve certainly got connections with English people and with the Welsh aristocracy I suppose.</div><div id="00:06:03.840" class="transcript_line"> We could refer to the Lewis Lloyds couldn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:06:10.400" class="transcript_line"> I think they were just tenant farmers, you know, as they were over there when they came here too.</div><div id="00:06:16.400" class="transcript_line"> I see, they seemed to own vast tracts of land.</div><div id="00:06:20.400" class="transcript_line"> They did, yes.</div><div id="00:06:22.400" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fine and then you presumably moved away to work, did you?</div><div id="00:06:26.400" class="transcript_line"> I joined the army.</div><div id="00:06:28.960" class="transcript_line"> I joined the army and what can I add, I went to Aldershot, page 90.</div><div id="00:06:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I spent seven months training to be a paratrooper.</div><div id="00:06:40.960" class="transcript_line"> And was immediately posted overseas to the campaign that was going on at the time in Borneo</div><div id="00:06:48.960" class="transcript_line"> where there was a confrontation between Indonesia and British territory.</div><div id="00:06:57.520" class="transcript_line"> I spent nine months there, came back and was involved in perhaps three or four more</div><div id="00:07:07.520" class="transcript_line"> in places around the world, the Middle East.</div><div id="00:07:13.520" class="transcript_line"> Right, so you&#039;ve really had quite a chequered career haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:07:17.520" class="transcript_line"> And you say you try and come back about every couple of years.</div><div id="00:07:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Is that right?</div><div id="00:07:23.520" class="transcript_line"> No, you come back about twice a year?</div><div id="00:07:26.080" class="transcript_line"> I like to come home two or three times a year.</div><div id="00:07:28.080" class="transcript_line"> Two or three times a year, oh right, even better, yes.</div><div id="00:07:30.080" class="transcript_line"> Where you&#039;ve tried to follow up some of your family I believe.</div><div id="00:07:34.080" class="transcript_line"> Well in recent years I&#039;ve become more interested, I suppose as one does when you get older.</div><div id="00:07:42.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well that&#039;s, you know, it&#039;s something I think people are doing now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:46.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;re really trying to follow up our family trees.</div><div id="00:07:50.640" class="transcript_line"> And have you had any success in finding them and following them up?</div><div id="00:07:56.640" class="transcript_line"> I know you said something about looking in graves.</div><div id="00:07:58.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ve been trying to look for any of the family that might have died up the valley.</div><div id="00:08:08.640" class="transcript_line"> That might have been buried up the chapel that is now under water.</div><div id="00:08:13.200" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t seem to find any trace of the graves or anything like that,</div><div id="00:08:19.200" class="transcript_line"> whether they&#039;ve been reinterred or not.</div><div id="00:08:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that would be interesting to find out.</div><div id="00:08:27.200" class="transcript_line"> Right, well look, thank you very, very much for your time, Mike.</div><div id="00:08:31.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been great talking to you and it&#039;s been great talking to somebody who can trace their ancestry back to,</div><div id="00:08:39.280" class="transcript_line"> well, a spot just up from where we&#039;re sitting at the moment in this lovely Nantleville church.</div><div id="00:08:43.760" class="transcript_line"> So thank you very much for your contribution.</div></div></p>
