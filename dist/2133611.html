all to do with my family tree.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything interesting about your houses?</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Marty told me that we&#039;re, well, which is actually pretty amazing myself.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re actually related to Sir Francis Drake.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So what do you know about him?</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell us a little bit about what you found out about him?</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I went on the internet to find out about it, it turns out my grandma is a citizen.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;d be on my grandma&#039;s side.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d be a distant relative.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you just mentioned your grandmother&#039;s side, but there&#039;s something I find interesting about your grandfather.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Your mum&#039;s...</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, dad, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, grandpa was Andre.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really cool.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Take this...</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t say Andre.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got this weird...</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s spelled A-N-D-R.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you put a I-J on the end.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you want to explain why?</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> What was his nationality?</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was from outside Kiev in Ukraine.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I only found out about that about 10 years ago when I saw your mother&#039;s surname because she uses that maiden name.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she&#039;s an extremely, extremely good artist.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, turns out my mother is a...</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Like what she said, she&#039;s an amazing artist.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> She does great, great drawings.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> She once did a picture mouse.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> An owl cat.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Then a gypsy, a daisy, cabbie.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve got a picture of a pet that you want my mum to do for you, she will draw it and paint it.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But only watercolours.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I was about to say she&#039;s one of the most talented artists I&#039;ve ever known.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They are pet portraits.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve just named all your pets.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because of course, Mike and I know mouse because he was always in our garden.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So mouse is your cat, which is...</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> He was.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He was, yes.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The paintings that she does of pets in watercolours, I have never seen such a fine example.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Very talented.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It turns out when mum and dad first met one another, she went to art college in Newport.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s why she&#039;s so talented.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she did a course.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m going to tell you an interesting fact.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You may know it, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But one of the art lecturers at that college in Newport was Annie&#039;s dad.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What? Annie?</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Annie who...</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He was, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a very famous artist, actually.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s actually got a painting in the Tate in London.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was one of the art lecturers at Newport College of Art, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No way.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where your mother has studied art.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, thinking about the age scales of things, quite possibly she would have known him.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s an interesting fact of connections that we&#039;re seeing today.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my Lord.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you share your mum&#039;s talent?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Is art something that you like to do?</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m not as good as my mother, but I am really good at art.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So some of you enjoy doing art.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We do quite a lot of art here at Mencap, actually, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We do different projects.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We do, yes.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve just been given permission to do a huge piece of art in the meeting room.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Basically fill the whole wall, which is going to be about two metres by three metres.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re going to be starting that soon.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What is that all about?</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They just want a big piece of art on the, what was the computer room?</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, the meeting room.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re just going to put a huge piece of abstract kind of painting on the wall.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The guy&#039;s got free reign to do whatever we want, really.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So that should be fun.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I really hope that that will get him hurt.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to ask mum about the leptra that he had.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> His name was Keith, and it was Keith Richardson.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you remember Annie&#039;s surname, which is Richardson,</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and if you think of Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones member,</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a combination, so it&#039;s Keith Richardson.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And see if your mother knew him.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be quite interesting, wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It would.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So moving on with the interview, Bex, is there anything else you want to discuss?</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I find that incredible, by the way.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s blown me away by the funny tree.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you want to talk about?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Your love of animals.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a nephew.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a loving family.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What have you jumped on then?</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;re missing Alice.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I never thought I would be an auntie now, to be honest.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, I knew I would be one one day, but not yet.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m pleased that I just did get pregnant</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> because Alice is such an amazing, cheeky, cute little thing ever.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can see you&#039;re absolutely exuding love as you&#039;re talking about Alice.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he&#039;s four now, and he&#039;ll be starting a mono in September.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:11:30.000"

Jess is your sister.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You have another sister who&#039;s embarked on something special as well.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, another thing that events in the family.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It does.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Rose&#039;s job.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my sister.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a flower farmer.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But it but it burns in the family because mum&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> grandmother and grandfather used to run a nursery in Somerset.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to go there a lot.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d go to the nursery and their house, massive house, called Asham House,</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> had horses.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> My favorite was Caramere.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I even got a picture of her.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Me, mum&#039;s nan and Caramere in the field.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the best horse ever.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> She was a creepy colour.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I love horses.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was when I was like a chocolate.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go to Asham a awful lot.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Bethany found a Christmas.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But my first year of Christmas didn&#039;t go very well because I was ill.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to stay in shelter for my first year for Christmas.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So a year later we went down to Somerset.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Spent time at a grandma&#039;s and grandpa&#039;s old house.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d go to Asham as well.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I even had a picture taken with Father Christmas.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So the relatives who run the nursery, was that your mother&#039;s grandparents?</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So the things I&#039;m picking up in this interview is how things go through the generations.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s there, isn&#039;t it, Becky?</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> All our skills are quite often passed down.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to run this nursery with like flowers.</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m guessing that a great...</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m guessing that it was more of a florist, which Rose is as well.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a florist.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Her bedroom is like a ceiling, shelves, all that, all covered with flowers.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Which actually is the whole of your family.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> For a start, your sister is called Rose.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So you like wearing flowers on your clothes.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Your mother does.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I know you love the colour pink.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, couture.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.

class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about Covid?</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, OK.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, tell you the truth.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never been like this at all.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But since Covid has started, I&#039;ve been more aware that it&#039;s around her.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been paying more attention to wash my hands, like awful lot, make sure I don&#039;t use like too hot.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I would make sure that I wash myself in a comfortable, heating in the bath or shower because it kills germs and bacteria.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And anything that kills it is better.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially with.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying not to get it.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you for sharing that, actually.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> That is an important thing that&#039;s come out of it.</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a positive thing about and the more awareness of hygiene.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And to be honest, I think that&#039;s the case with everyone.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m certainly more aware of it.</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to talk about how you felt during that time?</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Or is it something that you don&#039;t want to talk about?</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt like I never liked sharing hand towels.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And because they&#039;re my own one.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And you wouldn&#039;t believe this.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I would believe that it&#039;s.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were aware of what was happening when that pandemic hit because we all had to learn fairly quickly.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you remember the rules that the Welsh government laid down about not going to supermarkets?</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Not having friends?</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, your relatives are from Somerset.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Did that affect you?</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Or how did you cope?</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s only two of them.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Grandma and Auntie.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Her.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But all the other ones.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think exactly everything at Somerset.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not entirely sure.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> That my mum&#039;s cousin, just I.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Awesome.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That we don&#039;t know who are living in Somerset.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But most of the people who live there are not a not a person anymore.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> My my my sister.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Kathleen.</div><div id="00:20:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was a a a.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> If you make addresses.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Her.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Seems to.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Her.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, I picked up that you studied textiles at college.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, actually. So I did test on college.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Her.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing there.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> To covid and.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a point where I.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> A day away down here.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> At one point.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because.</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Jim, her. That was because it was a Christmas and having Auntie and Grandma</div><div id="00:22:01.200" class="transcript_line"> coming up, so I couldn&#039;t make present people for her.</div><div id="00:22:06.100" class="transcript_line"> So you took the very sensible approach about not, about avoiding places here</div><div id="00:22:12.040" class="transcript_line"> where we&#039;ve got groups of people in and the gym. So all in all then you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:22:20.900" class="transcript_line"> through Covid. Yes. It&#039;s now made you very aware, like I said, of hygiene.</div><div id="00:22:28.840" class="transcript_line"> And you got through it basically, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:22:31.840" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have a tiny bit of a setback bit.</div><div id="00:22:40.840" class="transcript_line"> The day that I had my birthday, Dora decided to use a bit of my mouthwash.</div><div id="00:22:58.840" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t mean to. It was just, she totally understood after a while.</div><div id="00:23:10.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just like a sharing stuff. But it comes to mouth.</div><div id="00:23:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes. No, that&#039;s fair enough. I agree. I&#039;m sure people will understand that.</div><div id="00:23:29.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be the same. But Dora got a tiny bit upset over it. She didn&#039;t mean to.</div><div id="00:23:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, accidents happen, but I&#039;m sure she understood when you explained.</div><div id="00:23:41.840" class="transcript_line"> So would you like to ask Michael or me any questions? Because you&#039;ve known us</div><div id="00:23:48.840" class="transcript_line"> quite a few years, which is probably going to come across in this interview.</div><div id="00:23:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll say on Rose&#039;s, how old are you now? I&#039;m 32. Yeah, so I&#039;m guessing a 30-year-old.</div><div id="00:24:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve probably got quite a few memories of your mother.</div><div id="00:24:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Rose, your sister and Michael have gone through school right up until to come.</div><div id="00:24:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s Rose, me and Rose as toddlers together.</div><div id="00:24:18.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. She&#039;s October, Michael&#039;s December. That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:24:23.840" class="transcript_line"> So Rose would have celebrated a Covid 30th, same as I celebrated a 60th during Covid.</div><div id="00:24:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Not the best times. Yeah, because I remember you had white hair, white blonde hair.</div><div id="00:24:39.840" class="transcript_line"> He did, he was white. Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Albino when I was a child.</div><div id="00:24:45.840" class="transcript_line"> You came over for Rose&#039;s birthday. I played in all sorts.</div><div id="00:24:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember playing in your garden and coming round for tea and stuff like that when I was younger.</div><div id="00:25:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I do remember a nirvato of all three of you. It was you, Kim and Rose.</div><div id="00:25:09.840" class="transcript_line"> I think two of you had your tops off.</div><div id="00:25:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Do we? Probably me, I was only naked as a kid.</div><div id="00:25:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Not much has changed.</div><div id="00:25:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Just to give you a memory, you live on the back of us.</div><div id="00:25:31.840" class="transcript_line"> And I, and your dad&#039;s quite tall, a bit like Michael and my husband.</div><div id="00:25:38.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got memories of seeing you as a toddler. You were always on your dad&#039;s shoulders.</div><div id="00:25:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So I used to see toddler Becky just going past our fence every day.</div><div id="00:25:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Your dad Mark always had you on his shoulders.</div><div id="00:25:57.840" class="transcript_line"> He had another link through Mencap. I know he&#039;s not part of, well he may be part of Mencap, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:26:08.840" class="transcript_line"> But you know, Alison. Alison Bray, yes.</div><div id="00:26:13.840" class="transcript_line"> When my dad first put me home after being born, you won&#039;t believe who was our neighbour sector.</div><div id="00:26:34.840" class="transcript_line"> It would have been Alison and...Andy. And Ben.</div><div id="00:26:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow. Small world.</div><div id="00:26:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I just want to, I think we&#039;re coming to the end of this now with the interview.</div><div id="00:26:49.840" class="transcript_line"> I would like to say to you that I&#039;ve enjoyed it very much. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:26:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Michael, I&#039;m sure you have.</div><div id="00:26:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve done a really good job. You answered wonderfully. You&#039;ve got some great stories in there.</div><div id="00:27:02.840" class="transcript_line"> I really appreciate you doing it. Thank you.</div><div id="00:27:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And I hope it&#039;s been enjoyable for you, Becky.</div><div id="00:27:08.840" class="transcript_line"> It has. It has. Good.</div><div id="00:27:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well so what we&#039;ll do is we&#039;ll go away, have a listen to it ourselves and then you can listen to the recording yourself.</div><div id="00:27:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Cool. Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then we&#039;ll decide maybe what bits we&#039;d like to use for the exhibition and we&#039;ll let you know.</div><div id="00:27:23.840" class="transcript_line"> And can I ask, do other people hear what I&#039;m saying?</div><div id="00:27:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, if you&#039;re comfortable with that.</div><div id="00:27:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Cool.</div><div id="00:27:36.840" class="transcript_line"> The forms we signed before, Laska and what not, just close in.</div><div id="00:27:41.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll find out about that.</div><div id="00:27:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well we won&#039;t, obviously we won&#039;t play or let anything public that you&#039;re not comfortable being public,</div><div id="00:27:51.840" class="transcript_line"> but I think most of what we&#039;ve spoken about is good content and I think people would like to hear it.</div><div id="00:27:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And to be honest, I do want Kenny to hear it because I said earlier that I&#039;m pleased that I&#039;ve been a night with her.</div><div id="00:28:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, okay, cool.</div><div id="00:28:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Alright, well we&#039;ll end it there then guys. Okay, if anyone wants to say goodbye.</div><div id="00:28:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, bye. Thank you.</div><div id="00:28:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Ta-ra.</div></div></p>
