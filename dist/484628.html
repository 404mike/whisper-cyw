    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:03.080" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Siobhán Grice, location of the interview</div><div id="00:00:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Swicker office and today&#039;s date is the 19th of October 2015. Before we start</div><div id="00:00:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Siobhán, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Certainly. My name is Siobhán Grice, S-I-O-B-H-A-M-G-R-I-C-E.</div><div id="00:00:27.080" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed. How did you first make contact with Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:32.080" class="transcript_line"> I was involved with a dance group that Sally ran. I just went along to the classes</div><div id="00:00:40.080" class="transcript_line"> and as it happened they were rehearsing for the 98th Carnival so I started off as a dance group.</div><div id="00:00:48.080" class="transcript_line"> So Sally McLennan was your gateway and she still is for many people to this very day.</div><div id="00:00:53.120" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s the musical director, which involves dance as well obviously, for the Carnival crew.</div><div id="00:00:59.120" class="transcript_line"> So Sally dates right back in time. And in 1998 you were a dancer in the Carnival.</div><div id="00:01:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So can you remember what you were wearing perhaps? What kind of costume did you have?</div><div id="00:01:10.120" class="transcript_line"> I know we had big headdresses.</div><div id="00:01:12.120" class="transcript_line"> What a surprise.</div><div id="00:01:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and it was quite Egyptian type costumes and lots of blues and silvers.</div><div id="00:01:24.160" class="transcript_line"> I can see the costume in my mind. We have a picture of that which will be going into the archive.</div><div id="00:01:28.160" class="transcript_line"> So we can tell you that&#039;s what you were wearing.</div><div id="00:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got pictures of you going over Cotet&#039;s Bridge I think.</div><div id="00:01:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, yes.</div><div id="00:01:36.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where we have some really nice shots of you in costume and the rest of it, which is smashing.</div><div id="00:01:41.200" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d have been dancing to samba drumming?</div><div id="00:01:45.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, samba drumming.</div><div id="00:01:46.200" class="transcript_line"> So it was the first time that I&#039;d ever done street dance and also the first time really that I&#039;ve been involved in something that was dancing to that type of music.</div><div id="00:01:57.200" class="transcript_line"> So it was really quite exciting.</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> And it was a sunny day I think as I remember.</div><div id="00:02:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a sunny day.</div><div id="00:02:03.200" class="transcript_line"> So it was great fun.</div><div id="00:02:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Did you get involved in the making of the costumes as well or were you primarily about movement?</div><div id="00:02:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did.</div><div id="00:02:09.240" class="transcript_line"> We were down in Cotet&#039;s.</div><div id="00:02:12.240" class="transcript_line"> In the community centre?</div><div id="00:02:13.240" class="transcript_line"> In the community centre and I vividly remember it.</div><div id="00:02:15.240" class="transcript_line"> We were making the costumes and I looked up and there was a rainbow over the camp.</div><div id="00:02:22.240" class="transcript_line"> So that was a really nice.</div><div id="00:02:23.240" class="transcript_line"> A good sign.</div><div id="00:02:24.240" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t going to be flooded that year.</div><div id="00:02:27.240" class="transcript_line"> For those of you with biblical aspirations or connotations.</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> So after having danced with Sally in a dance group in 98, what happened next?</div><div id="00:02:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, 99 I came to the opening of the carnival of the launch party, which was the first time I&#039;d been to the launch party.</div><div id="00:02:49.280" class="transcript_line"> And I went in and I spoke to you about possible work.</div><div id="00:02:58.320" class="transcript_line"> So I came and you had the welcoming committee.</div><div id="00:03:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure of the job title.</div><div id="00:03:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s when I was involved on a work basis with the carnival.</div><div id="00:03:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Were you being a trainee at that point?</div><div id="00:03:15.320" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I was.</div><div id="00:03:16.320" class="transcript_line"> You were full time?</div><div id="00:03:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, as the sort of front of house welcoming.</div><div id="00:03:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:03:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So as people came in, I&#039;d be.</div><div id="00:03:25.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a really important position because we&#039;re always trying to attract new people and having a welcoming face and a positive attitude, which you&#039;d be glad to know you still possess, is really important.</div><div id="00:03:37.360" class="transcript_line"> So I can see you.</div><div id="00:03:38.360" class="transcript_line"> And in 99, were we at chapter?</div><div id="00:03:41.360" class="transcript_line"> I thought so.</div><div id="00:03:42.360" class="transcript_line"> Right here.</div><div id="00:03:43.360" class="transcript_line"> So we were in what used to be the gym and it&#039;s now called the studio.</div><div id="00:03:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re there.</div><div id="00:03:48.360" class="transcript_line"> I can see it now.</div><div id="00:03:49.360" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re there as our.</div><div id="00:03:52.400" class="transcript_line"> I say receptionist, super receptionist.</div><div id="00:03:55.400" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s put it that way.</div><div id="00:03:56.400" class="transcript_line"> And it was it was a really nice job because it meant I got to meet everybody that was involved.</div><div id="00:04:03.400" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people had not, you know, had not done that.</div><div id="00:04:07.400" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to stop anybody escaping or whatever?</div><div id="00:04:09.400" class="transcript_line"> Let me out of there.</div><div id="00:04:10.400" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was really happy to be there and it was it was a lovely sort of creative environment.</div><div id="00:04:17.440" class="transcript_line"> And what I especially loved about it was that it was sort of a real fusion of the arts.</div><div id="00:04:24.440" class="transcript_line"> Like I come from an art background, visual art background, but with the camp, it was a mixture of the music, dance, art and performance.</div><div id="00:04:35.440" class="transcript_line"> And what really whatever people wanted to do, it was very open and very open for people to bring their own creativity there,</div><div id="00:04:44.480" class="transcript_line"> as well as following the sort of more structured.</div><div id="00:04:48.480" class="transcript_line"> I think we only had one secret rule, which was no Simpsons.</div><div id="00:04:52.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s like, you know, when there is an overarching theme, it&#039;s, you know, there&#039;s a black piece of paper.</div><div id="00:05:00.480" class="transcript_line"> But secretly, it&#039;d be like, I can remember one year going like, OK, whatever we do, we mustn&#039;t produce Power Rangers.</div><div id="00:05:05.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like, no, it&#039;s just not it&#039;s just not us, you know.</div><div id="00:05:09.520" class="transcript_line"> And given that you are our hostess with the mostest, can you remember?</div><div id="00:05:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you get to play costume on the day itself this year?</div><div id="00:05:17.520" class="transcript_line"> I did, yes. Excellent. What were you in that design?</div><div id="00:05:19.520" class="transcript_line"> I was I had a blue costume.</div><div id="00:05:23.520" class="transcript_line"> I was I was part of the there was the blue people.</div><div id="00:05:26.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure what the name of it was, but I did my own thing because I wasn&#039;t specifically with that group,</div><div id="00:05:31.520" class="transcript_line"> but I had blue paint all over my face and my body.</div><div id="00:05:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And I made a kind of blue leather sort of belt with lots of feathers on and a headdress.</div><div id="00:05:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And and really out of a lot of the scraps of material.</div><div id="00:05:47.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite, it&#039;s not the case that the artists and the workers involved are well, they put themselves last.</div><div id="00:05:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s only until the last few days and suddenly goes like, whoops, you know, I may have helped facilitate hundreds of costumes.</div><div id="00:06:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And so it&#039;s like, what am I going to look like on the day?</div><div id="00:06:02.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, because because you&#039;re not specifically with the section, you know, you&#039;ve got to go around all all the different groups.</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Running up and down the line.</div><div id="00:06:12.600" class="transcript_line"> So just yeah, but those were my colors.</div><div id="00:06:14.600" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I wanted to be in that group.</div><div id="00:06:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And also it was the the drumming group were with them.</div><div id="00:06:23.600" class="transcript_line"> So it was people were dancing and I can&#039;t quite remember the name of them.</div><div id="00:06:28.600" class="transcript_line"> But it was I think it was an offshoot of run down mental.</div><div id="00:06:31.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:32.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So who&#039;s done it for a number of years and yes.</div><div id="00:06:35.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> So would you have been holding?</div><div id="00:06:38.640" class="transcript_line"> I was holding something to me.</div><div id="00:06:40.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, I wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:06:41.640" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I have my ones, my pink fairy ones because because I started off before I joined the carnival.</div><div id="00:06:51.640" class="transcript_line"> I just sort of got a performance piece up and running, which was pink fairy.</div><div id="00:06:55.640" class="transcript_line"> Does the pink fairy still exist?</div><div id="00:06:57.680" class="transcript_line"> She hasn&#039;t surfaced recently, but yes, she still exists.</div><div id="00:07:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Excellent. I can see the ones in my mind&#039;s eye.</div><div id="00:07:08.680" class="transcript_line"> And then the you had sort of like a mini feather boa wrapped around the right.</div><div id="00:07:13.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was kind of a cross between a sort of a blue warrior type costume with my pink meets the pink fairy.</div><div id="00:07:21.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:22.720" class="transcript_line"> But I did go in as a pink fairy during one of the carnivals.</div><div id="00:07:27.720" class="transcript_line"> But I think that was for the Rugby World Cup when we were parades in the streets.</div><div id="00:07:34.720" class="transcript_line"> I think before before the game.</div><div id="00:07:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:07:37.720" class="transcript_line"> And so that&#039;s when I you actually pink fairy did big time.</div><div id="00:07:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:43.720" class="transcript_line"> So after after 1999, what happens next?</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> Tell us more about your carnival adventures.</div><div id="00:07:48.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, after 99, the carnival, my my I had a life changing experience because I met in the carnival,</div><div id="00:07:57.760" class="transcript_line"> which is a mix of, you know, Caribbean cultures.</div><div id="00:08:00.760" class="transcript_line"> It mixes. It is truly a intercultural experience.</div><div id="00:08:05.760" class="transcript_line"> I met the father of my children who&#039;s from St. Vincent.</div><div id="00:08:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Some of the the people running the carnival, some of the people making the costumes and working</div><div id="00:08:17.800" class="transcript_line"> alongside Swicker were there.</div><div id="00:08:19.800" class="transcript_line"> So I actually had my became a mother as a consequence of the carnival.</div><div id="00:08:26.800" class="transcript_line"> What does carnival mean to you?</div><div id="00:08:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Motherhood.</div><div id="00:08:29.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good answer.</div><div id="00:08:30.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good answer.</div><div id="00:08:31.800" class="transcript_line"> The way I see it is that really I was kind of a mother figure when I was meeting people in the carnival.</div><div id="00:08:37.800" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s sort of almost led into my role as a mother.</div><div id="00:08:42.840" class="transcript_line"> However, I did continue with the carnival and I brought my children along there.</div><div id="00:08:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Even there was one carnival when Rose, my daughter, was a couple of months old and I had her in my,</div><div id="00:08:57.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, my little papoose in during the carnival.</div><div id="00:09:01.840" class="transcript_line"> So I just integrated life.</div><div id="00:09:03.840" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the great thing about the carnival.</div><div id="00:09:05.840" class="transcript_line"> It is very much an all inclusive family event.</div><div id="00:09:10.880" class="transcript_line"> So it didn&#039;t disclude me because I was, which often happens when you&#039;re in the creative industries,</div><div id="00:09:17.880" class="transcript_line"> is that it&#039;s very much not family or child friendly.</div><div id="00:09:22.880" class="transcript_line"> So that was the great thing about it for me anyway.</div><div id="00:09:25.880" class="transcript_line"> So I could continue.</div><div id="00:09:26.880" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t I didn&#039;t work in the carnival, but I always brought my children and they got involved in the culture of.</div><div id="00:09:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Literally carnival babies.</div><div id="00:09:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they were carnival babies.</div><div id="00:09:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Which is lovely, yes.</div><div id="00:09:40.920" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:09:45.920" class="transcript_line"> Could you say a little bit about, so obviously, yeah, carnival is something we share.</div><div id="00:09:49.920" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps a bit about your arts practice, because I associate you with lots of interesting, exciting and spiritual things.</div><div id="00:09:56.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:09:57.920" class="transcript_line"> For future generations.</div><div id="00:09:59.920" class="transcript_line"> In fact, as I was thinking of what the carnival meant to me,</div><div id="00:10:03.920" class="transcript_line"> I did think that there is a certain amount of spiritual elements of the carnival as well.</div><div id="00:10:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Because I felt that the whole drumming aspect of it is is is can draw parallels with with quite shamanic work</div><div id="00:10:18.960" class="transcript_line"> and especially the tradition of going through the streets and the night before the carnival.</div><div id="00:10:24.960" class="transcript_line"> The juve, the poor man&#039;s carnival.</div><div id="00:10:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, I think that.</div><div id="00:10:28.960" class="transcript_line"> So if I say, you know me well, jab jab.</div><div id="00:10:31.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, sorry, let&#039;s get it right.</div><div id="00:10:33.960" class="transcript_line"> I come from hell.</div><div id="00:10:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Jab jab.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You know me well.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Jab jab.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I come from hell.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Jab jab.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, simple but effective.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And that tradition is to clear out any of the bad spirits the night before the carnival.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, like for me, I&#039;m the work I do is quite I&#039;m an artist.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I done my masters just before in 98.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I finished that.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So 99 being the first the year I joined or 98 this year, I joined the carnival.</div><div id="00:11:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a painter is the practice I&#039;m doing at the moment.</div><div id="00:11:10.040" class="transcript_line"> I use a studio at home.</div><div id="00:11:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did last year.</div><div id="00:11:16.040" class="transcript_line"> And the light at Portcaul, the light.</div><div id="00:11:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s the same night as the South Wales.</div><div id="00:11:21.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m making this up.</div><div id="00:11:22.040" class="transcript_line"> The light is very good.</div><div id="00:11:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:11:24.040" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:11:25.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s I was living in Cardiff at the time of the carnival, but I moved to Portcaul, which is my hometown.</div><div id="00:11:31.040" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:11:32.080" class="transcript_line"> I sort of use that sort of, you know, the nature around as part of it to influence my work.</div><div id="00:11:39.080" class="transcript_line"> But I also do beach art and I go into the environment to create artworks, land art, beach art, land art,</div><div id="00:11:50.080" class="transcript_line"> go into schools, doing sort of willow projects.</div><div id="00:11:55.080" class="transcript_line"> And also.</div><div id="00:11:57.120" class="transcript_line"> And also.</div><div id="00:11:58.120" class="transcript_line"> That means you&#039;re aware of one of the regular company jokes, which is another word for willows is, of course, with these.</div><div id="00:12:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Why are they called with these?</div><div id="00:12:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Because with these we&#039;re going to make something.</div><div id="00:12:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Have I never used that?</div><div id="00:12:13.120" class="transcript_line"> No, you never heard.</div><div id="00:12:14.120" class="transcript_line"> I hear I gift you that rather sad joke.</div><div id="00:12:16.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll remember that.</div><div id="00:12:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t think you ever have to use it.</div><div id="00:12:19.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know.</div><div id="00:12:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:12:21.160" class="transcript_line"> No, so I so it also combines my artwork when I&#039;m doing, say, beach art.</div><div id="00:12:28.160" class="transcript_line"> I started that in 2010 with the residents I had on Coney Beach, which is sort of a it&#039;s probably not the most spiritual place you&#039;d think of.</div><div id="00:12:42.200" class="transcript_line"> But I decided to take up the challenge of making Coney Beach, which is right by the fairground, right by Treco Bay, very, very public beach.</div><div id="00:12:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a lot of litter that tends to be like a bit of donkey droppings and donkey droppings and everything in the summer.</div><div id="00:12:58.200" class="transcript_line"> And I decided to have a month to a month&#039;s residency there and visit the beach every single day, do a kind of beach clean and take personal responsibility for the environment,</div><div id="00:13:10.240" class="transcript_line"> taking care of the environment and creating a kind of spiritual connection, sacred connection with that space to see if I could change the energy of what was already there.</div><div id="00:13:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Not that there was anything wrong with the energy there, but I mean just that whole sort of environmental and just just being in nature.</div><div id="00:13:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Because usually I would go somewhere quite remote, such as Scare and make where I&#039;ve got my own sort of stone circle and I go and it&#039;s very much conducive to some way you would more like liken to a sacred space.</div><div id="00:13:45.280" class="transcript_line"> Whereas Coney Beach is not in public view, so it&#039;s kind of for me it was a bit of a coming out of not.</div><div id="00:13:51.280" class="transcript_line"> What was the public reaction to finding you doing this?</div><div id="00:13:54.280" class="transcript_line"> Because there you were accessible, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:13:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, well, that&#039;s the whole point is because is to be to be visible, picking up rubbish, inviting people to come along to pick up rubbish, but also to invite people to make artwork on the beach.</div><div id="00:14:10.360" class="transcript_line"> And you know, and then it wasn&#039;t obviously a spiritual act.</div><div id="00:14:15.360" class="transcript_line"> It was more because sort of the intention was there that that&#039;s what I was doing.</div><div id="00:14:20.360" class="transcript_line"> I was I was connecting with that environment to improve the environment and to connect with people that were there.</div><div id="00:14:26.360" class="transcript_line"> But in actual fact, the last day that I was there, it was on 31st of August.</div><div id="00:14:32.360" class="transcript_line"> There is a crowds come to see the firework display because it&#039;s seaside town.</div><div id="00:14:38.400" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, I started to make lanterns and that was the first time it would probably be maybe a little bit more spiritual in looking.</div><div id="00:14:46.400" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s big crowds of people came up that teenagers not not really anybody asked for 15, 16 year olds that were hanging around with nothing to do other than wait for the fireworks to happen.</div><div id="00:15:01.440" class="transcript_line"> And so they came around and they were kind of getting involved and and one person said, oh, my gosh, I can&#039;t believe we&#039;re on Coney Beach.</div><div id="00:15:08.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s totally different. It&#039;s like being in another place.</div><div id="00:15:11.440" class="transcript_line"> So for me, it worked. It&#039;s transformative arts, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:15:16.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s the power of it, which brings us full circle, because that&#039;s certainly one of the ways in which I like to think of of carnival arts is it&#039;s that whole the world turned upside down.</div><div id="00:15:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Even if you know, yes, nine tenths of it is, as you pointed out, at the carnival camp.</div><div id="00:15:32.480" class="transcript_line"> But for one day in the year, you know, you&#039;ve got you have the Lord of Mist rule gives his or her powers to us all to to transgress and to what can I say?</div><div id="00:15:44.480" class="transcript_line"> You know, well, just turn the normal everyday order upside down.</div><div id="00:15:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. I think it does.</div><div id="00:15:50.520" class="transcript_line"> I think, you know, it&#039;s it&#039;s not about people being trained or people being professionals or people being having to be a certain type of person to be involved.</div><div id="00:16:04.520" class="transcript_line"> It does give everybody a chance.</div><div id="00:16:06.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one of the few art forms which I feel is genuinely accessible.</div><div id="00:16:09.520" class="transcript_line"> It is very inclusive.</div><div id="00:16:11.520" class="transcript_line"> And it even includes people who don&#039;t want to make the art.</div><div id="00:16:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s like this year we were at Fitz Allen and then there were some boys who were brought there as part of family groups by their mums and they played football outside and then they perhaps come in and have a drink or whatever.</div><div id="00:16:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s fine, too.</div><div id="00:16:28.560" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no right or wrong with carnival.</div><div id="00:16:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I find it&#039;s not prescriptive, is it?</div><div id="00:16:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Nobody&#039;s going, you have to do the following.</div><div id="00:16:34.560" class="transcript_line"> No, there&#039;s only one road to follow.</div><div id="00:16:36.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think that transformative thing is very evident because you can have people that&#039;s coming in that are very shy, very introvert or very they don&#039;t want to be sent to attention, but they get caught up in the whole energy.</div><div id="00:16:52.640" class="transcript_line"> And as they see their friends or their groups transformed, then it sort of it brings them out of themselves and it puts them into a place where they can experiment and they can try something out that they wouldn&#039;t normally do.</div><div id="00:17:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:17:11.680" class="transcript_line"> And I think the duration of the camp, because it lasts three weeks, people could come in and be quite sort of objective about it and stand back.</div><div id="00:17:22.680" class="transcript_line"> But I think by the time it finishes, you can&#039;t help but get involved and even if they thought they wouldn&#039;t, I think it just it really brings people out, which is a great sort of self empowering tool that happens quite naturally without forcing people to be creative or to be to be to be part of something.</div><div id="00:17:52.720" class="transcript_line"> So pleased that this interview took place.</div><div id="00:17:55.720" class="transcript_line"> I thank you for your eloquence.</div><div id="00:17:57.720" class="transcript_line"> And whilst it&#039;s invisible and it&#039;s yes, it&#039;s still eternal.</div><div id="00:18:01.720" class="transcript_line"> I hereby award you, Siobhan Grace, the title of Cardiff Carnival Queen.</div><div id="00:18:06.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much.</div><div id="00:18:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Steve.</div></div></p>
