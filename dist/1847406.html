I think it was called Hanover.</div><div id="00:02:40.440" class="transcript_line"> I think it was Hanover.</div><div id="00:02:41.440" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, the people were just...</div><div id="00:02:43.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, it was just so nice.</div><div id="00:02:46.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, everyone was really nice.</div><div id="00:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> I remember I went in the market.</div><div id="00:02:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And I like haggling.</div><div id="00:02:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I like doing a little bit of hustling.</div><div id="00:02:53.840" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m a good hustler.</div><div id="00:02:55.840" class="transcript_line"> So I went in the shop in the market.</div><div id="00:02:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And there was this man.</div><div id="00:02:59.840" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted this...</div><div id="00:03:00.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it was only a map of Jamaica in a frame.</div><div id="00:03:04.840" class="transcript_line"> And I said, how much is that?</div><div id="00:03:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And he said, like, $30.</div><div id="00:03:09.840" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, how much is it to a Jamaican?</div><div id="00:03:13.840" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re a Jamaican.</div><div id="00:03:14.840" class="transcript_line"> He said, listen, if you&#039;re white, you&#039;re black, you&#039;re Jamaican, you&#039;re Chinese,</div><div id="00:03:17.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s still $30.</div><div id="00:03:20.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, and I thought...</div><div id="00:03:22.840" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s just saying, like, in that place, it&#039;s like it doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:03:25.840" class="transcript_line"> We just do things equal.</div><div id="00:03:26.840" class="transcript_line"> And I like that.</div><div id="00:03:29.840" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t buy it because I...</div><div id="00:03:31.840" class="transcript_line"> But I did like that.</div><div id="00:03:33.840" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, that&#039;s all I really know about Jamaica.</div><div id="00:03:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, obviously Jamaica.</div><div id="00:03:39.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the food is beautiful.</div><div id="00:03:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And things like that.</div><div id="00:03:42.840" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, the sea is clean.</div><div id="00:03:45.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s just...</div><div id="00:03:46.840" class="transcript_line"> When I went to...</div><div id="00:03:47.840" class="transcript_line"> When you go to Jamaica,</div><div id="00:03:50.240" class="transcript_line"> obviously the West Indies,</div><div id="00:03:51.240" class="transcript_line"> and you come back to this country,</div><div id="00:03:53.240" class="transcript_line"> and you eat the food,</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> the food tastes like cardboard.</div><div id="00:03:56.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s one thing I noticed.</div><div id="00:03:58.240" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, obviously, like I remember when I was a child,</div><div id="00:04:04.240" class="transcript_line"> there used to be a man, his name was Green.</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Green, used to call him.</div><div id="00:04:11.240" class="transcript_line"> Because he called everyone like their titles,</div><div id="00:04:13.240" class="transcript_line"> like Mr., Mrs.</div><div id="00:04:14.240" class="transcript_line"> You never used first names when I was a child.</div><div id="00:04:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And you had to...</div><div id="00:04:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, you had to respect people.</div><div id="00:04:19.640" class="transcript_line"> Good morning.</div><div id="00:04:20.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, Mr. This or Mr. That.</div><div id="00:04:23.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like slack like it is today.</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, he used to come and visit,</div><div id="00:04:28.640" class="transcript_line"> not just us, but the West Indian people.</div><div id="00:04:31.640" class="transcript_line"> And he used to sell the proper West Indian food.</div><div id="00:04:34.640" class="transcript_line"> The yam, you know, green bananas,</div><div id="00:04:37.640" class="transcript_line"> the ackee, the saltfish.</div><div id="00:04:39.640" class="transcript_line"> People didn&#039;t know what that was in them days.</div><div id="00:04:40.640" class="transcript_line"> People do now.</div><div id="00:04:41.640" class="transcript_line"> So, I used to like...</div><div id="00:04:44.640" class="transcript_line"> We had the hard dough bread.</div><div id="00:04:45.640" class="transcript_line"> I used to like the bullet cake.</div><div id="00:04:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I used to love the bullet cake.</div><div id="00:04:49.040" class="transcript_line"> My dad used to like sugar cane.</div><div id="00:04:51.040" class="transcript_line"> You could buy these sugar cane drinks.</div><div id="00:04:53.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, things like that.</div><div id="00:04:54.040" class="transcript_line"> And remember that, this cocoa, chocolate.</div><div id="00:04:56.040" class="transcript_line"> And it was like solid, it was together.</div><div id="00:04:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And then you grate it and you make the chocolate drink.</div><div id="00:05:02.040" class="transcript_line"> But my dad died when I was 13.</div><div id="00:05:04.040" class="transcript_line"> So, I, you know, go back a long, long, long, long...</div><div id="00:05:07.040" class="transcript_line"> Not that I&#039;m that old, old.</div><div id="00:05:08.040" class="transcript_line"> But I go back a long way to try and have the memories.</div><div id="00:05:11.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, and...</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so...</div><div id="00:05:14.040" class="transcript_line"> How old was your dad when he came over?</div><div id="00:05:16.040" class="transcript_line"> My dad was 33.</div><div id="00:05:18.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like the same age as Jesus.</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> Started the first church in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:05:22.440" class="transcript_line"> And then...</div><div id="00:05:24.440" class="transcript_line"> And then, that was 1951.</div><div id="00:05:27.440" class="transcript_line"> I think my mother come 1952.</div><div id="00:05:32.440" class="transcript_line"> But what it was, like we were talking earlier on,</div><div id="00:05:34.440" class="transcript_line"> in them days, you know, they didn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:05:36.440" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t sort of welcome at churches.</div><div id="00:05:39.440" class="transcript_line"> The white churches.</div><div id="00:05:40.440" class="transcript_line"> They were all...</div><div id="00:05:41.440" class="transcript_line"> Churches owned by white people,</div><div id="00:05:43.440" class="transcript_line"> mostly in them days.</div><div id="00:05:45.440" class="transcript_line"> And they, you know, kept to themselves.</div><div id="00:05:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Very closed shop.</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, so when a black person come,</div><div id="00:05:51.840" class="transcript_line"> they taught the field like an outcast.</div><div id="00:05:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Even though people are supposed to be Christians.</div><div id="00:05:55.840" class="transcript_line"> So, it was easy then,</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> for black people to start churches.</div><div id="00:05:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Because in Jamaica, there&#039;s more churches</div><div id="00:06:01.840" class="transcript_line"> per square mile again</div><div id="00:06:03.840" class="transcript_line"> than any other country in the world in Jamaica.</div><div id="00:06:05.840" class="transcript_line"> More churches per square mile.</div><div id="00:06:07.840" class="transcript_line"> So, obviously they come here</div><div id="00:06:09.840" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s practically a Christian country,</div><div id="00:06:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Jamaica.</div><div id="00:06:12.840" class="transcript_line"> So, they come here and they still want the</div><div id="00:06:14.840" class="transcript_line"> fellowship and worship and do like they&#039;ve done in Jamaica.</div><div id="00:06:17.240" class="transcript_line"> But West Indians,</div><div id="00:06:19.240" class="transcript_line"> when my dad had his church</div><div id="00:06:21.240" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff, Antwerp, other one in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:06:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I noticed like they&#039;re very vibrant.</div><div id="00:06:25.240" class="transcript_line"> They had a lot of life.</div><div id="00:06:27.240" class="transcript_line"> And when a lot of people,</div><div id="00:06:29.240" class="transcript_line"> English people</div><div id="00:06:31.240" class="transcript_line"> or Welsh people, British people,</div><div id="00:06:33.240" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re very stiff.</div><div id="00:06:35.240" class="transcript_line"> The British stiff up a lip, I suppose.</div><div id="00:06:37.240" class="transcript_line"> But the thing is, what&#039;s funny, I&#039;m like that, see?</div><div id="00:06:39.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like, I&#039;m more English</div><div id="00:06:41.240" class="transcript_line"> than Jamaican.</div><div id="00:06:43.240" class="transcript_line"> I might act more like a Jamaican in my</div><div id="00:06:45.640" class="transcript_line"> characteristics.</div><div id="00:06:47.640" class="transcript_line"> But I like being quiet and calm in church</div><div id="00:06:49.640" class="transcript_line"> whereas West Indian people</div><div id="00:06:51.640" class="transcript_line"> when it comes to church time,</div><div id="00:06:53.640" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like Sister Act, they jump, they dance, they sing.</div><div id="00:06:55.640" class="transcript_line"> All different languages.</div><div id="00:06:57.640" class="transcript_line"> Because to them, they speak in tongues.</div><div id="00:06:59.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like speaking in English.</div><div id="00:07:01.640" class="transcript_line"> Whereas English people or British</div><div id="00:07:03.640" class="transcript_line"> people in them days,</div><div id="00:07:05.640" class="transcript_line"> a lot of them didn&#039;t even</div><div id="00:07:07.640" class="transcript_line"> accept it properly.</div><div id="00:07:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Even though a lot of English churches</div><div id="00:07:11.640" class="transcript_line"> were Pentecostal.</div><div id="00:07:14.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to the city temple</div><div id="00:07:16.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was really young.</div><div id="00:07:18.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m talking the 70s.</div><div id="00:07:20.040" class="transcript_line"> To me, it was like</div><div id="00:07:22.040" class="transcript_line"> not much different to Methodist, Baptist.</div><div id="00:07:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t find much difference.</div><div id="00:07:26.040" class="transcript_line"> They talk about it was lively and this was happening.</div><div id="00:07:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a lot of people might have been going</div><div id="00:07:30.040" class="transcript_line"> and the Spirit of God was moving.</div><div id="00:07:32.040" class="transcript_line"> But it never had the life</div><div id="00:07:34.040" class="transcript_line"> that our church had.</div><div id="00:07:36.040" class="transcript_line"> And I remember</div><div id="00:07:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I spoke to this lady.</div><div id="00:07:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to be a youth manager</div><div id="00:07:42.440" class="transcript_line"> at the Beacon Centre.</div><div id="00:07:44.440" class="transcript_line"> There was a lady there and her son was</div><div id="00:07:46.440" class="transcript_line"> in a bit of trouble so I used to go over and talk</div><div id="00:07:48.440" class="transcript_line"> to the people sometimes.</div><div id="00:07:50.440" class="transcript_line"> I was talking to this lady and then</div><div id="00:07:52.440" class="transcript_line"> she actually said,</div><div id="00:07:54.440" class="transcript_line"> she used to go to my dad&#039;s church.</div><div id="00:07:56.440" class="transcript_line"> My dad&#039;s church was in Welles Street.</div><div id="00:07:58.440" class="transcript_line"> So I thought to myself,</div><div id="00:08:00.440" class="transcript_line"> let me ask this white lady what it was like.</div><div id="00:08:02.440" class="transcript_line"> Because there wasn&#039;t loads of white people in our church.</div><div id="00:08:04.440" class="transcript_line"> So I thought</div><div id="00:08:06.440" class="transcript_line"> to myself, let me ask her what she thought about it.</div><div id="00:08:08.440" class="transcript_line"> So I said, what did you think of it?</div><div id="00:08:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was good on holiday.</div><div id="00:08:12.840" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously</div><div id="00:08:14.840" class="transcript_line"> women especially</div><div id="00:08:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I think they like dancing and moving</div><div id="00:08:18.840" class="transcript_line"> and our church was sort of like that.</div><div id="00:08:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So yeah,</div><div id="00:08:22.840" class="transcript_line"> nowadays people try and make church</div><div id="00:08:24.840" class="transcript_line"> entertaining.</div><div id="00:08:26.840" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think church should be entertaining.</div><div id="00:08:28.840" class="transcript_line"> I think church should be so warm.</div><div id="00:08:30.840" class="transcript_line"> It should be so welcoming.</div><div id="00:08:32.840" class="transcript_line"> It should be the place that people want to go</div><div id="00:08:34.840" class="transcript_line"> because they know that</div><div id="00:08:36.840" class="transcript_line"> God is there.</div><div id="00:08:39.240"

class="transcript_line"> and now we&#039;re in a time for everybody.</div><div id="00:12:04.040" class="transcript_line"> So, like my parents</div><div id="00:12:06.040" class="transcript_line"> when

me cope</div><div id="00:17:02.040" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;ve got to cope with things</div><div id="00:17:04.040" class="transcript_line"> either you&#039;re going to kill people or they&#039;re going to kill you</div><div id="00:17:06.040" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m</div><div id="00:17:08.040" class="transcript_line"> was never the sort of person</div><div id="00:17:10.040" class="transcript_line"> to sit down</div><div id="00:17:12.040" class="transcript_line"> and take rubbish, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:14.040" class="transcript_line"> never

id="00:17:36.040" class="transcript_line"> so I used to be mad</div><div id="00:17:38.040" class="transcript_line"> and it made me angry</div><div id="00:17:40.040" class="transcript_line"> and I just wouldn&#039;t take rubbish</div><div id="00:17:42.040" class="transcript_line"> so I used to think to myself, if you want</div><div id="00:17:44.040" class="transcript_line"> to think you can be cheeky to me</div><div id="00:17:46.040" class="transcript_line"> you better be able to fight me</div><div id="00:17:48.040" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m going to beat you</div><div id="00:17:50.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to think like that, so when I was younger</div><div id="00:17:52.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to have a lot of problems in school</div><div id="00:17:54.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to have a lot of trouble</div><div id="00:17:56.040" class="transcript_line"> and thank God</div><div id="00:17:58.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had problems, like my dad</div><div id="00:18:00.040" class="transcript_line"> come and speak to the headmaster</div><div id="00:18:02.040" class="transcript_line"> because I used to</div><div id="00:18:04.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s terrible, I used to get caned every day</div><div id="00:18:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think a day</div><div id="00:18:08.040" class="transcript_line"> ever went by</div><div id="00:18:10.040" class="transcript_line"> from when I couldn&#039;t remember going to school</div><div id="00:18:12.040" class="transcript_line"> until I was about 14</div><div id="00:18:14.040" class="transcript_line"> without getting the cane</div><div id="00:18:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I got caned every single day</div><div id="00:18:18.040" class="transcript_line"> because I was always the fault</div><div id="00:18:20.040" class="transcript_line"> if I would get jumped by 3 people, 4 people</div><div id="00:18:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I would always end up getting caned</div><div id="00:18:24.040" class="transcript_line"> but when I got older, when I was about 14</div><div id="00:18:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to be able to beat people so bad</div><div id="00:18:28.040" class="transcript_line"> that they couldn&#039;t cane me no more</div><div id="00:18:30.040" class="transcript_line"> so I never got caned from when I was about 14</div><div id="00:18:32.040" class="transcript_line"> because I used to beat the people so bad</div><div id="00:18:34.040" class="transcript_line"> that I&#039;d say, I remembered</div><div id="00:18:36.040" class="transcript_line"> if there&#039;s trouble</div><div id="00:18:38.040" class="transcript_line"> the other person has got to get in trouble too</div><div id="00:18:40.040" class="transcript_line"> so they used to be so bad</div><div id="00:18:42.040" class="transcript_line"> they couldn&#039;t do nothing</div><div id="00:18:44.040" class="transcript_line"> because I used to say, what about them</div><div id="00:18:46.040" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re going to cane me, you&#039;ve got to cane them</div><div id="00:18:48.040" class="transcript_line"> so I should laugh anyway</div><div id="00:18:50.040" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s why I stopped getting caned</div><div id="00:18:52.040" class="transcript_line"> so when I was 14 I got caned again</div><div id="00:18:54.040" class="transcript_line"> so basically, that just sounds really</div><div id="00:18:56.040" class="transcript_line"> unjust, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:18:58.040" class="transcript_line"> you were picked on</div><div id="00:19:00.040" class="transcript_line"> and attacked</div><div id="00:19:02.040" class="transcript_line"> and beaten</div><div id="00:19:04.040" class="transcript_line"> by the headmaster or whatever</div><div id="00:19:06.040" class="transcript_line"> that doesn&#039;t make any sense, does it?</div><div id="00:19:08.040" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s the system</div><div id="00:19:10.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s strange</div><div id="00:19:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I see it like this, as I&#039;m talking to you now</div><div id="00:19:14.040" class="transcript_line"> you have a mother, not all mothers</div><div id="00:19:16.040" class="transcript_line"> but most mothers</div><div id="00:19:18.040" class="transcript_line"> them children can do no wrong</div><div id="00:19:20.040" class="transcript_line"> so because the white people</div><div id="00:19:22.040" class="transcript_line"> were their children, their children</div><div id="00:19:24.040" class="transcript_line"> can do no wrong</div><div id="00:19:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to feel like they used to try and beat me</div><div id="00:19:28.040" class="transcript_line"> or cause me problems</div><div id="00:19:30.040" class="transcript_line"> because I was a net child</div><div id="00:19:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I was different</div><div id="00:19:34.040" class="transcript_line"> apparently a friend of mine told me</div><div id="00:19:36.040" class="transcript_line"> he said to me, I found out this</div><div id="00:19:38.040" class="transcript_line"> this year I think I found this out</div><div id="00:19:40.040" class="transcript_line"> he said that the teachers were so worried about me</div><div id="00:19:42.040" class="transcript_line"> so frightened of me</div><div id="00:19:44.040" class="transcript_line"> they used to ask the other children, can any of them fight me</div><div id="00:19:46.040" class="transcript_line"> so they can come in the classroom with me</div><div id="00:19:48.040" class="transcript_line"> and if I cause trouble they can keep me camp</div><div id="00:19:50.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what the teachers used to ask the pupils</div><div id="00:19:52.040" class="transcript_line"> I found out this year</div><div id="00:19:54.040" class="transcript_line"> how does that make you feel?</div><div id="00:19:56.040" class="transcript_line"> well it&#039;s funny, because I look back</div><div id="00:19:58.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger and I was wild</div><div id="00:20:00.040" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t care, that was just how it was</div><div id="00:20:02.040" class="transcript_line"> but when I look back I just think</div><div id="00:20:04.040" class="transcript_line"> it was real child abuse</div><div id="00:20:06.040" class="transcript_line"> because if you hurt a child now</div><div id="00:20:08.040" class="transcript_line"> the parent will go to prison</div><div id="00:20:10.040" class="transcript_line"> but yet I was a child</div><div id="00:20:12.040" class="transcript_line"> just like everybody else</div><div id="00:20:14.040" class="transcript_line"> but I was black</div><div id="00:20:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and I used to get all beaten and all trouble</div><div id="00:20:18.040" class="transcript_line"> all things just happened to me</div><div id="00:20:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I was black</div><div id="00:20:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember once I was walking</div><div id="00:20:24.040" class="transcript_line"> through Sapphire Gardens</div><div id="00:20:26.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s in Riverside where I lived</div><div id="00:20:28.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was walking home and I was with one of my friends</div><div id="00:20:30.040" class="transcript_line"> and he was back in and out of prison</div><div id="00:20:32.040" class="transcript_line"> he was a rough guy</div><div id="00:20:34.040" class="transcript_line"> and we were walking and there was</div><div id="00:20:36.040" class="transcript_line"> two police, police come up in a car</div><div id="00:20:38.040" class="transcript_line"> they come out the car</div><div id="00:20:40.040" class="transcript_line"> and I said to my friend, I said I&#039;m not stopping</div><div id="00:20:42.040" class="transcript_line"> because you know I&#039;m going to get in trouble</div><div id="00:20:44.040" class="transcript_line"> so he stopped and I just walked off</div><div id="00:20:46.040" class="transcript_line"> and anyway they just called me back</div><div id="00:20:48.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was walking and my friend was a criminal</div><div id="00:20:50.040" class="transcript_line"> and then they picked on me</div><div id="00:20:52.040" class="transcript_line"> and he put his hands in my pocket</div><div id="00:20:54.040" class="transcript_line"> and squeezed me</div><div id="00:20:56.040" class="transcript_line"> so I punched him I did, the policeman</div><div id="00:20:58.040" class="transcript_line"> and then he, you know I automatically</div><div id="00:21:00.040" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t, well anyway</div><div id="00:21:02.040" class="transcript_line"> because I don&#039;t take burbish anyway</div><div id="00:21:04.040" class="transcript_line"> so he took me home to my mother</div><div id="00:21:06.040" class="transcript_line"> and then you know and then I</div><div id="00:21:08.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s I didn&#039;t get any trouble for it</div><div id="00:21:10.040" class="transcript_line"> because he probably knew what he&#039;d done</div><div id="00:21:12.040" class="transcript_line"> and as I say I just got in trouble</div><div id="00:21:14.040" class="transcript_line"> with my mum then but</div><div id="00:21:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I was good, you know, because I never done nothing</div><div id="00:21:18.040" class="transcript_line"> you know and things like that</div><div id="00:21:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean that&#039;s just one, I mean I&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:21:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember I got</div><div id="00:21:24.040" class="transcript_line"> pulled over, obviously my car</div><div id="00:21:26.040" class="transcript_line"> plenty of times, I used to drive</div><div id="00:21:28.040" class="transcript_line"> stopped, harassed</div><div id="00:21:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember once</div><div id="00:21:32.040" class="transcript_line"> and this was in the last say eight years</div><div id="00:21:34.040" class="transcript_line"> I was</div><div id="00:21:36.040" class="transcript_line"> I dropped off my cousin in Lamarmy</div><div id="00:21:38.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was driving to</div><div id="00:21:40.040" class="transcript_line"> back to St Melan&#039;s</div><div id="00:21:42.040" class="transcript_line"> and then the police, I see them follow me</div><div id="00:21:44.040" class="transcript_line"> they follow me to Lamarmy</div><div id="00:21:46.040" class="transcript_line"> and then they see me</div><div id="00:21:48.040" class="transcript_line"> drop off my cousin and then they follow me</div><div id="00:21:50.040" class="transcript_line"> I was with my ex</div><div id="00:21:52.040" class="transcript_line"> they follow me back</div><div id="00:21:54.040" class="transcript_line"> to the house and then</div><div id="00:21:56.040" class="transcript_line"> they pulled up behind me, obviously they knew where I was</div><div id="00:21:58.040" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t that long ago, they checked the number plate and everything</div><div id="00:22:00.040" class="transcript_line"> but I was in a bad mood because they followed me</div><div id="00:22:02.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was just really angry</div><div id="00:22:04.040" class="transcript_line"> so</div><div id="00:22:06.040" class="transcript_line"> they come out the car because I always</div><div id="00:22:08.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to keep my documents with me</div><div id="00:22:10.040" class="transcript_line"> but anyway</div><div id="00:22:12.040" class="transcript_line"> so they said to me</div><div id="00:22:14.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got your documents</div><div id="00:22:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was in such a bad mood I said</div><div id="00:22:18.040" class="transcript_line"> no I haven&#039;t got my documents, just give me a producer</div><div id="00:22:20.040" class="transcript_line"> so he looked at me</div><div id="00:22:22.040" class="transcript_line"> this police man, he must have seen me in real world</div><div id="00:22:24.040" class="transcript_line"> went round the producer and just went</div><div id="00:22:26.040" class="transcript_line"> you know that was good</div><div id="00:22:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I was in a bad mood</div><div id="00:22:30.040" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;re human at the end of the day</div><div id="00:22:32.040" class="transcript_line"> when we get</div><div id="00:22:34.040" class="transcript_line"> because when we&#039;re young</div><div id="00:22:36.040" class="transcript_line"> we don&#039;t really understand racism</div><div id="00:22:38.040" class="transcript_line"> a lot, I don&#039;t think, you know, how deep it is</div><div id="00:22:40.040" class="transcript_line"> and how bad it is because</div><div id="00:22:42.040" class="transcript_line"> we might just think</div><div id="00:22:44.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s just like we don&#039;t</div><div id="00:22:46.040" class="transcript_line"> think deep, I didn&#039;t think, I want to think</div><div id="00:22:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I never thought, but when I got older</div><div id="00:22:50.040" class="transcript_line"> and I started, like I said, I thought</div><div id="00:22:52.040" class="transcript_line"> when they picked on me and gave me</div><div id="00:22:54.040" class="transcript_line"> trouble when I was a child</div><div id="00:22:56.040" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the same as picking on a little white child</div><div id="00:22:58.040" class="transcript_line"> but because I was black they didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:23:00.040" class="transcript_line"> care, they treated me like I was an animal</div><div id="00:23:02.040" class="transcript_line"> so when I look back and I think how can an adult</div><div id="00:23:04.040" class="transcript_line"> how can I be an adult and want to</div><div id="00:23:06.040" class="transcript_line"> be through or cause trouble until like 8</div><div id="00:23:08.040" class="transcript_line"> 6 year old, 6 year old, so because my mind</div><div id="00:23:10.040" class="transcript_line"> thinks different now</div><div id="00:23:12.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s different now when I get stopped or when someone</div><div id="00:23:14.040" class="transcript_line"> says something to me, you know, I&#039;ll think to myself</div><div id="00:23:16.040" class="transcript_line"> why is he saying that?</div><div id="00:23:18.040" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s the reason behind that?</div><div id="00:23:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I got married, I had a family</div><div id="00:23:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I was in London and in London</div><div id="00:23:24.040" class="transcript_line"> they understand the program</div><div id="00:23:26.040" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s areas where there&#039;s black love, black</div><div id="00:23:28.040" class="transcript_line"> people, black white, they mix</div><div id="00:23:30.040" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s not too bad, in certain areas they understand</div><div id="00:23:32.040" class="transcript_line"> so I come</div><div id="00:23:34.040" class="transcript_line"> back to Cardiff and when I come back to Cardiff</div><div id="00:23:36.040" class="transcript_line"> got saved, come to Cardiff</div><div id="00:23:38.040" class="transcript_line"> and then my wife wasn&#039;t well</div><div id="00:23:40.040" class="transcript_line"> and I went to social services</div><div id="00:23:42.040" class="transcript_line"> the next thing I know they take my children off me</div><div id="00:23:44.040" class="transcript_line"> I went to them for help and they take</div><div id="00:23:46.040" class="transcript_line"> my children off me and until this</div><div id="00:23:48.040" class="transcript_line"> day I still haven&#039;t gotten back</div><div id="00:23:50.040" class="transcript_line"> so I made</div><div id="00:23:52.040" class="transcript_line"> complaints, they found

id="00:32:04.040" class="transcript_line"> was sort of prejudice</div><div id="00:32:06.040" class="transcript_line"> or racist I suppose</div><div id="00:32:08.040" class="transcript_line"> towards my own people</div><div id="00:32:10.040" class="transcript_line"> I guess it would have been hard as well because if you&#039;re one in a class</div><div id="00:32:12.040" class="transcript_line"> of 30 you&#039;re the only black person</div><div id="00:32:14.040" class="transcript_line"> and you don&#039;t really have much options do you</div><div id="00:32:16.040" class="transcript_line"> in terms of liking a black girl</div><div id="00:32:18.040" class="transcript_line"> or whatever, you didn&#039;t have that option in school</div><div id="00:32:20.040" class="transcript_line"> besides the fact that it was compounded</div><div id="00:32:22.040" class="transcript_line"> with the racism of we&#039;re ugly</div><div id="00:32:24.040" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re this and

class="transcript_line"> because there wasn&#039;t many of us</div><div id="00:34:54.040" class="transcript_line"> like we were saying earlier on</div><div id="00:34:56.040" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:58.040" class="transcript_line"> sort of how it was</div><div id="00:35:00.040" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:35:02.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s funny because like I said it seemed like</div><div id="00:35:04.040" class="transcript_line"> my parents</div><div id="00:35:06.040" class="transcript_line"> generation, them ones, and my dad</div><div id="00:35:08.040" class="transcript_line"> was a minister and they seemed to be able</div><div id="00:35:10.040" class="transcript_line"> to go anywhere and

id="00:35:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I found it</div><div id="00:35:18.040" class="transcript_line"> strange</div><div id="00:35:20.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger</div><div id="00:35:22.040" class="transcript_line"> it was funny because</div><div id="00:35:24.040" class="transcript_line"> we had light skin</div><div id="00:35:26.040" class="transcript_line"> so when I was younger</div><div id="00:35:28.040" class="transcript_line"> the white people wouldn&#039;t really accept you</div><div id="00:35:30.040" class="transcript_line"> just because you&#039;re black, any colour black</div><div id="00:35:32.040" class="transcript_line"> and then the black, dark, dark people</div><div id="00:35:34.040" class="transcript_line"> they weren&#039;t too cool with you neither</div><div id="00:35:36.040" class="transcript_line"> because you were in between in them days</div><div id="00:35:38.040" class="transcript_line"> in Jamaica they called us red skin</div><div id="00:35:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean</div><div id="00:35:42.040" class="transcript_line"> it was just strange</div><div id="00:35:44.040" class="transcript_line"> but then you&#039;re told like</div><div id="00:35:46.040" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;ve got any colour</div><div id="00:35:48.040" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re black</div><div id="00:35:50.040" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;ve got to be a black person</div><div id="00:35:52.040" class="transcript_line"> but some of the blacks are not cool</div><div id="00:35:54.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s just really weird, it&#039;s just strange</div><div id="00:35:56.040" class="transcript_line"> but anyway, I don&#039;t think a black person</div><div id="00:35:58.040" class="transcript_line"> would beat you up</div><div id="00:36:00.040" class="transcript_line"> just because you were light the colour of skin</div><div id="00:36:02.040" class="transcript_line"> a white man would want to string you up</div><div id="00:36:04.040" class="transcript_line"> just because you&#039;ve got any tiny bit of colour</div><div id="00:36:06.040" class="transcript_line"> and some white people</div><div id="00:36:08.040" class="transcript_line"> they can see black, even when</div><div id="00:36:10.040" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t see black</div><div id="00:36:12.040" class="transcript_line"> but I know</div><div id="00:36:14.040" class="transcript_line"> it always happens</div><div id="00:36:16.040" class="transcript_line"> so the history with Butown</div><div id="00:36:18.040" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t really have a relationship with Butown then?</div><div id="00:36:20.040" class="transcript_line"> not until I was</div><div id="00:36:22.040" class="transcript_line"> like a teenager</div><div id="00:36:24.040" class="transcript_line"> because there was some</div><div id="00:36:26.040" class="transcript_line"> in my school</div><div id="00:36:28.040" class="transcript_line"> but when I was in school I think there might have been</div><div id="00:36:30.040" class="transcript_line"> two black people in the A band</div><div id="00:36:36.040" class="transcript_line"> except for Fitz Allen</div><div id="00:36:38.040" class="transcript_line"> when I went to Fitz Allen</div><div id="00:36:40.040" class="transcript_line"> there was 2000 people</div><div id="00:36:42.040" class="transcript_line"> and just say</div><div id="00:36:44.040" class="transcript_line"> maybe 75</div><div id="00:36:46.040" class="transcript_line"> if that</div><div id="00:36:48.040" class="transcript_line"> were black</div><div id="00:36:50.040" class="transcript_line"> if that</div><div id="00:36:52.040" class="transcript_line"> like Indians or whatever</div><div id="00:36:54.040" class="transcript_line"> and now if you go to Fitz Allen</div><div id="00:36:56.040" class="transcript_line"> the roles reversed</div><div id="00:36:58.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s strange</div><div id="00:37:00.040" class="transcript_line"> because obviously I&#039;ve got children</div><div id="00:37:02.040" class="transcript_line"> even my children</div><div id="00:37:04.040" class="transcript_line"> they tell me they</div><div id="00:37:06.040"

id="00:37:12.040" class="transcript_line"> so I mean it&#039;s just</div><div id="00:37:14.040" class="transcript_line"> a system</div><div id="00:37:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t really think it&#039;ll ever</div><div id="00:37:18.040" class="transcript_line"> change</div><div id="00:37:20.040" class="transcript_line"> because</div><div id="00:37:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll change</div><div id="00:37:24.040" class="transcript_line"> because</div><div id="00:37:26.040" class="transcript_line"> there are people who</div><div id="00:37:28.040" class="transcript_line"> like the white race</div><div id="00:37:30.040" class="transcript_line"> they sort of feel like they&#039;re superior than they</div><div id="00:37:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean they just do</div><div id="00:37:34.040" class="transcript_line"> even now</div><div id="00:37:36.040" class="transcript_line"> you know they</div><div id="00:37:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean</div><div id="00:37:40.040" class="transcript_line"> they still don&#039;t</div><div id="00:37:42.040" class="transcript_line"> see black people as on like an even</div><div id="00:37:44.040" class="transcript_line"> path today they just don&#039;t</div><div id="00:37:46.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s just the system even though we&#039;ll get better</div><div id="00:37:48.040" class="transcript_line"> and better</div><div id="00:37:50.040" class="transcript_line"> I won&#039;t be surprised if there&#039;s Muslim one

support</div><div id="00:38:02.040" class="transcript_line"> each other as equals</div><div id="00:38:06.040" class="transcript_line"> that is</div><div id="00:38:08.040" class="transcript_line"> I hear what you&#039;re saying there</div><div id="00:38:10.040" class="transcript_line"> what are the coping mechanisms then</div><div id="00:38:12.040" class="transcript_line"> in a system that seems to</div><div id="00:38:14.040" class="transcript_line"> inherently be against you?</div><div id="00:38:16.040" class="transcript_line"> What are the coping mechanisms for us and for our

class="transcript_line"> from authorities</div><div id="00:38:24.040" class="transcript_line"> you know because I just</div><div id="00:38:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean what&#039;s the point I mean</div><div id="00:38:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like going places because as soon as I</div><div id="00:38:30.040" class="transcript_line"> think to myself they see a black face and that&#039;s it</div><div id="00:38:32.040" class="transcript_line"> and I suppose this is all ingrained</div><div id="00:38:34.040" class="transcript_line"> from years ago you know because</div><div id="00:38:36.040" class="transcript_line"> obviously it&#039;s not all bad</div><div id="00:38:38.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not there&#039;s such a change</div><div id="00:38:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean you&#039;ve got the</div><div id="00:38:42.040" class="transcript_line"> the black</div><div id="00:38:44.040" class="transcript_line"> is it Emmy

class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what that means I didn&#039;t know that but that&#039;s what it means</div><div id="00:43:08.040" class="transcript_line"> so I know God I know Jesus for

class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s actually not so bad now and I tell</div><div id="00:44:04.040" class="transcript_line"> you why because anything goes people</div><div id="00:44:06.040" class="transcript_line"> anything goes except Christianity</div><div id="00:44:08.040" class="transcript_line"> which is really strange you know because</div><div id="00:44:10.040" class="transcript_line"> in the old days when you thought about Jesus</div><div id="00:44:12.040" class="transcript_line"> they appeared in a madhouse</div><div id="00:44:14.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah but they are</div><div id="00:44:16.040" class="transcript_line"> called religious mania I think</div><div id="00:44:18.040" class="transcript_line"> they used to call it</div><div id="00:44:20.040" class="transcript_line"> if you go back in the old days the proper</div><div id="00:44:22.040" class="transcript_line"> born again Christians used to love Jesus</div><div id="00:44:24.040" class="transcript_line"> they used to burn them as witches and things like that</div><div id="00:44:26.040" class="transcript_line"> so people have always done strange</div><div id="00:44:28.040" class="transcript_line"> things but nowadays it&#039;s cool</div><div id="00:44:30.040" class="transcript_line"> to an extent to be a Muslim</div><div id="00:44:32.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s cool to be a Buddhist I think Buddhists are quite</div><div id="00:44:34.040" class="transcript_line"> cool anyway because they just go round in</div><div id="00:44:36.040" class="transcript_line"> circles and they do good usually</div><div id="00:44:38.040" class="transcript_line"> if I was going to be any religion I&#039;d be a Buddhist</div><div id="00:44:40.040" class="transcript_line"> because Buddhists I don&#039;t think hurt people</div><div id="00:44:42.040" class="transcript_line"> even some Hindus</div><div id="00:44:44.040" class="transcript_line"> they just come back and they do good you know</div><div id="00:44:46.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean I&#039;m into that</div><div id="00:44:48.040" class="transcript_line"> but Jesus is real</div><div id="00:44:50.040" class="transcript_line"> which is the difference</div><div id="00:44:52.040" class="transcript_line"> so it doesn&#039;t matter

id="00:44:58.040" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s real you know only</div><div id="00:45:00.040" class="transcript_line"> so if I was brought up a Muslim</div><div id="00:45:02.040"

id="00:47:44.040" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s the advice I would give somebody I suppose</div><div id="00:47:46.040" class="transcript_line"> your colour doesn&#039;t have to be a hindrance anymore</div><div id="00:47:48.040" class="transcript_line"> in a lot of ways</div><div id="00:47:50.040" class="transcript_line"> it can be an advantage</div><div id="00:47:52.040" class="transcript_line"> especially if you&#039;re a black person speaking Welsh</div><div id="00:47:54.040" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s a lot of opportunities</div><div id="00:47:56.040" class="transcript_line"> so yeah just study</div><div id="00:47:58.040" class="transcript_line"> study hard, like my children, I hope they study hard</div><div id="00:48:00.040" class="transcript_line"> and just be faithful to God</div><div id="00:48:02.040" class="transcript_line"> and try not to</div><div id="00:48:04.040" class="transcript_line"> have too many different partners</div><div id="00:48:06.040" class="transcript_line"> just try and wait for the right person</div><div id="00:48:08.040" class="transcript_line"> save yourself, that&#039;s what I would say</div><div id="00:48:12.040" class="transcript_line"> In terms of these stories and these histories</div><div id="00:48:14.040" class="transcript_line"> so you know that we&#039;re connecting the stories</div><div id="00:48:16.040" class="transcript_line"> of the Wendrush generation</div><div id="00:48:18.040" class="transcript_line"> and all these people telling us about</div><div id="00:48:20.040" class="transcript_line"> what it was like back home and what it&#039;s been like here</div><div id="00:48:22.040" class="transcript_line"> and how they kind of like</div><div id="00:48:24.040" class="transcript_line"> navigate that sense of belonging</div><div id="00:48:26.040" class="transcript_line"> feeling Jamaican</div><div id="00:48:28.040" class="transcript_line"> feeling British</div><div id="00:48:30.040" class="transcript_line"> how do you make sense of the two and all of that</div><div id="00:48:32.040" class="transcript_line"> how important do you think these stories are</div><div id="00:48:34.040" class="transcript_line"> for the next generation</div><div id="00:48:36.040" class="transcript_line"> and the generation after that, do you think it&#039;s relevant?</div><div id="00:48:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s really really relevant</div><div id="00:48:40.040" class="transcript_line"> because the thing is</div><div id="00:48:42.040" class="transcript_line"> I wish now</div><div id="00:48:44.040" class="transcript_line"> that I would have sat down with my dad</div><div id="00:48:46.040" class="transcript_line"> or my dad would have sat down and talked to me</div><div id="00:48:48.040" class="transcript_line"> and talked to me about what it was like</div><div id="00:48:50.040" class="transcript_line"> because my dad&#039;s generations</div><div id="00:48:52.040" class="transcript_line"> most of them</div><div id="00:48:54.040" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t pass on a lot of information</div><div id="00:48:56.040" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a lot of</div><div id="00:48:58.040" class="transcript_line"> illegitimacy</div><div id="00:49:00.040" class="transcript_line"> is that it&#039;s by when you have like a lot of people</div><div id="00:49:02.040" class="transcript_line"> I think in</div><div id="00:49:04.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say the West Indian culture</div><div id="00:49:06.040" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d say a lot of people</div><div id="00:49:08.040" class="transcript_line"> got family that they don&#039;t know about</div><div id="00:49:10.040" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s all been kept secret</div><div id="00:49:12.040" class="transcript_line"> and I think because of things like that we don&#039;t know a lot</div><div id="00:49:14.040" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of things</div><div id="00:49:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I believe that we should know that we don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:49:18.040" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s</div><div id="00:49:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got probably loads of</div><div id="00:49:22.040" class="transcript_line"> cousins and stuff</div><div id="00:49:24.040" class="transcript_line"> and family that I don&#039;t even know about</div><div id="00:49:26.040" class="transcript_line"> and I wish I did know about because family</div><div id="00:49:28.040" class="transcript_line"> is everything really in this world</div><div id="00:49:30.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s about family</div><div id="00:49:32.040" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes we need support from family</div><div id="00:49:34.040" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s</div><div id="00:49:36.040" class="transcript_line"> they say blood is thicker than water</div><div id="00:49:38.040" class="transcript_line"> some people say yes, some people say no</div><div id="00:49:40.040" class="transcript_line"> but you know it&#039;s</div><div id="00:49:42.040" class="transcript_line"> good if you can confide in a family member</div><div id="00:49:44.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s easier isn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:49:48.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah, so I guess in a way</div><div id="00:49:50.040" class="transcript_line"> knowing these stories</div><div id="00:49:52.040" class="transcript_line"> and knowing this kind of legacy kind of helps to root you</div><div id="00:49:54.040" class="transcript_line"> in a way?</div><div id="00:49:56.040" class="transcript_line"> of course, it&#039;s like my mother</div><div id="00:49:58.040" class="transcript_line"> like I said she&#039;s Jewish and I said to my mother</div><div id="00:50:00.040" class="transcript_line"> one day I wanted to go to the synagogue</div><div id="00:50:02.040" class="transcript_line"> because when I became a Christian</div><div id="00:50:04.040" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to</div><div id="00:50:06.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger I always wanted to hook up with my Jamaican roots</div><div id="00:50:08.040" class="transcript_line"> I wish I was born in Jamaica, I hated being born</div><div id="00:50:10.040" class="transcript_line"> in this country, I hated this country</div><div id="00:50:12.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, I was angry with my parents</div><div id="00:50:14.040" class="transcript_line"> why was I born here, why was I born here</div><div id="00:50:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and when I became a Christian I realised</div><div id="00:50:18.040" class="transcript_line"> oh ok, because God wants me here</div><div id="00:50:20.040" class="transcript_line"> to help people and I like that</div><div id="00:50:22.040" class="transcript_line"> but um</div><div id="00:50:26.040" class="transcript_line"> talk about rooting</div><div id="00:50:28.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah, yeah, rooting</div><div id="00:50:30.040" class="transcript_line"> so I was saying</div><div id="00:50:32.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah, so I always wanted to be Jamaican</div><div id="00:50:34.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger</div><div id="00:50:36.040" class="transcript_line"> because I didn&#039;t know my mother was</div><div id="00:50:38.040" class="transcript_line"> Jewish anyway and even if I did know</div><div id="00:50:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t have acknowledged it</div><div id="00:50:42.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger because I liked the Jamaican</div><div id="00:50:44.040" class="transcript_line"> I liked the way they talk, I just like how they are</div><div id="00:50:46.040" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re cool, you know</div><div id="00:50:48.040" class="transcript_line"> their music, the reggae, I love all that sort of stuff</div><div id="00:50:50.040" class="transcript_line"> but</div><div id="00:50:52.040" class="transcript_line"> then</div><div id="00:50:56.040" class="transcript_line"> anyway, that&#039;s it</div><div id="00:50:58.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very important, like my kids</div><div id="00:51:00.040" class="transcript_line"> I say look I&#039;m Jewish by birth but I&#039;m a Jamaican</div><div id="00:51:02.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, it&#039;s easier</div><div id="00:51:04.040" class="transcript_line"> it was easier for me to see myself as a Jamaican</div><div id="00:51:06.040" class="transcript_line"> because like I said in this country</div><div id="00:51:08.040" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re so ostracised, you feel like</div><div id="00:51:10.040" class="transcript_line"> other place and you</div><div id="00:51:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to hold on to something, I used to hold on to my</div><div id="00:51:14.040" class="transcript_line"> my Jamaican-ness</div><div id="00:51:16.040" class="transcript_line"> even though I never went to Jamaica until I was older</div><div id="00:51:18.040" class="transcript_line"> but you know</div><div id="00:51:20.040" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s funny, right?</div><div id="00:51:22.040" class="transcript_line"> you should say that, because the first time</div><div id="00:51:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I ever heard reggae music</div><div id="00:51:26.040" class="transcript_line"> not Bob Marley, I mean</div><div id="00:51:28.040" class="transcript_line"> reggae music, right?</div><div id="00:51:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I felt like I had a hole</div><div id="00:51:32.040" class="transcript_line"> and it was filled, it was really weird</div><div id="00:51:34.040" class="transcript_line"> people say they have that when they</div><div id="00:51:36.040" class="transcript_line"> get saved, when they become Christians</div><div id="00:51:38.040" class="transcript_line"> but it happened to me, I just felt</div><div id="00:51:40.040" class="transcript_line"> that there was a hole, I didn&#039;t even know</div><div id="00:51:42.040" class="transcript_line"> I just felt like this was filled</div><div id="00:51:44.040" class="transcript_line"> when I heard reggae music</div><div id="00:51:46.040" class="transcript_line"> and it was really strange for me</div><div id="00:51:48.040" class="transcript_line"> you know</div><div id="00:51:50.040" class="transcript_line"> and I just fell in love with reggae music then</div><div id="00:51:52.040" class="transcript_line"> in like the 80s</div><div id="00:51:54.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, when you have like</div><div id="00:51:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Eka Mouse, or Yellow Man</div><div id="00:51:58.040" class="transcript_line"> or</div><div id="00:52:00.040" class="transcript_line"> people stitching</div><div id="00:52:02.040" class="transcript_line"> all them</div><div id="00:52:04.040" class="transcript_line"> it was really strange</div><div id="00:52:06.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah, that&#039;s really touching</div><div id="00:52:08.040" class="transcript_line"> okay, I think we&#039;re pretty much done</div><div id="00:52:10.040" class="transcript_line"> is there anything else you want to say, or add?</div><div id="00:52:12.040" class="transcript_line"> no, I just thank you, you know</div><div id="00:52:14.040" class="transcript_line"> for taking your time out, you know</div><div id="00:52:16.040" class="transcript_line"> your organisation and</div><div id="00:52:18.040" class="transcript_line"> speaking to people, because it is important</div><div id="00:52:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I wish, like I was saying, I wish that I would have</div><div id="00:52:22.040" class="transcript_line"> my parents would have, my dad really would have</div><div id="00:52:24.040" class="transcript_line"> took me to Jamaica</div><div id="00:52:26.040" class="transcript_line"> when I was a child and explained things to me</div><div id="00:52:28.040" class="transcript_line"> and showed me around, I would have loved all that</div><div id="00:52:30.040" class="transcript_line"> just to have that, so I just</div><div id="00:52:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this is for my children</div><div id="00:52:34.040" class="transcript_line"> and maybe people who are interested, and at least</div><div id="00:52:36.040" class="transcript_line"> I think they know, I thank God for that</div><div id="00:52:38.040" class="transcript_line"> okay</div></div></p>
