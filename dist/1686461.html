changed, doesn&#039;t it, kid?</div><div id="00:04:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in terms of what kids now have compared to what we might remember.</div><div id="00:04:14.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, our rule.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The things we could do, the things we were able to do.</div><div id="00:04:20.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, go out on the beginning of the day if it wasn&#039;t a school day.</div><div id="00:04:26.880" class="transcript_line"> And off you went all day.</div><div

saying, when we went to school, you have to go.</div><div id="00:04:39.840" class="transcript_line"> You have to go in the snow.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> None of them closed.</div><div id="00:04:43.240" class="transcript_line"> The schools didn&#039;t close like they do now.</div><div id="00:04:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Anything happened, the schools closed.</div><div id="00:04:50.960" class="transcript_line"> That one like that.</div><div id="00:04:51.920" class="transcript_line"> We used to come home, oh my god.</div><div id="00:04:54.120" class="transcript_line"> In all kinds of winds and weathers.</div><div id="00:04:56.960" class="transcript_line"> But now today, they closed it.</div><div id="00:05:00.600" class="transcript_line"> I could have snowed.</div><div id="00:05:03.880" class="transcript_line"> We used to go in the sky.</div><div id="00:05:07.400" class="transcript_line"> They never closed.</div><div id="00:05:08.320" class="transcript_line"> They closed.</div><div id="00:05:10.400" class="transcript_line"> That just meant playtime was more fun.</div><div id="00:05:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d come in crying.</div><div id="00:05:18.920" class="transcript_line"> Soaking wet.</div><div id="00:05:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Snowballs.</div><div id="00:05:22.680" class="transcript_line"> I know you&#039;re going to come in crying.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And even if you were the one who threw the first one.</div><div id="00:05:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:31.720" class="transcript_line"> Did Laura tell us you worked in the colonial center?</div><div id="00:05:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, she did.</div><div id="00:05:36.480" class="transcript_line"> She did.</div><div id="00:05:37.960" class="transcript_line"> We were good kids.</div><div id="00:05:39.280" class="transcript_line"> I said, we never had a lot, but we were happy.</div><div id="00:05:41.640" class="transcript_line"> My mother always said that.</div><div id="00:05:43.720" class="transcript_line"> And then they used to say, oh, ma&#039;am.</div><div id="00:05:46.680" class="transcript_line"> So and so and so and so.</div><div id="00:05:48.520" class="transcript_line"> They had bikes for Christmas.</div><div id="00:05:50.880" class="transcript_line"> And they sat near there.</div><div id="00:05:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Mama&#039;s slapping hands on the table.</div><div id="00:05:54.360" class="transcript_line"> She said, it&#039;s your bike.</div><div id="00:05:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Those people are going to eat.</div><div id="00:06:00.720" class="transcript_line"> She always threw that.</div><div id="00:06:02.920" class="transcript_line"> Mind you, oh, god.</div><div id="00:06:05.240" class="transcript_line"> We had a good upbringing.</div><div id="00:06:07.120" class="transcript_line"> There was five of us.</div><div id="00:06:09.280" class="transcript_line"> And then my father went to see it.</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> And then my mother used to take us all to the shelters.</div><div id="00:06:14.160" class="transcript_line"> In the night, you know, the head-in shelters.</div><div id="00:06:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Because you remember the Second World War.</div><div id="00:06:20.960" class="transcript_line"> You were younger.</div><div id="00:06:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:22.880" class="transcript_line"> I was only 17.</div><div id="00:06:26.080" class="transcript_line"> I was seven.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> When the war started, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:30.040" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember of it, Cain?</div><div id="00:06:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Everything.</div><div id="00:06:33.640" class="transcript_line"> The bombing and all things.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;d be in the shelter.</div><div id="00:06:39.280" class="transcript_line"> We knew we were going to eat, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:06:42.040" class="transcript_line"> In the night.</div><div id="00:06:43.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was on Butte Road, all the shelters.</div><div id="00:06:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And then this, because Mama had five of us.</div><div id="00:06:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And I was just little.</div><div id="00:06:54.120" class="transcript_line"> And my mother had it on the lap.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The tears was running from my mother&#039;s eyes.</div><div id="00:07:00.200" class="transcript_line"> Aunt Juarez.</div><div id="00:07:01.720" class="transcript_line"> She was a bigot, that one.</div><div id="00:07:03.800" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, Mama, I&#039;ll throw this water running on me.</div><div id="00:07:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Mama said she was thinking about, oh, what am I</div><div id="00:07:10.480" class="transcript_line"> going to do with all these bombs?</div><div id="00:07:12.160" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:07:12.880" class="transcript_line"> What am I going to do to my kids?</div><div id="00:07:16.920" class="transcript_line"> She said that.</div><div id="00:07:18.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I remember then.</div><div id="00:07:19.720" class="transcript_line"> And the woman next to my mother said,</div><div id="00:07:21.920" class="transcript_line"> oh, that&#039;s a ticket I&#039;d love.</div><div id="00:07:24.400" class="transcript_line"> My mother said, oh, I don&#039;t smoke.</div><div id="00:07:26.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, let&#039;s smoke.</div><div id="00:07:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ll throw it to you.</div><div id="00:07:29.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll calm your nerves.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So the next night, my mother said,</div><div id="00:07:36.320" class="transcript_line"> oh, I&#039;ll buy a packet of cigarettes.</div><div id="00:07:38.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll take the woman, you know, and I&#039;m back.</div><div id="00:07:40.160" class="transcript_line"> You boy didn&#039;t want me back.</div><div id="00:07:42.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m also sorry my mother&#039;s smoking.</div><div id="00:07:46.360" class="transcript_line"> I think he hates him.</div><div id="00:07:47.840" class="transcript_line"> I think he hates him.</div><div id="00:07:49.320" class="transcript_line"> People used to think it was good for them.</div><div id="00:07:52.560" class="transcript_line"> But then when he was 80, the doctor said,</div><div id="00:07:59.200" class="transcript_line"> keep going through it.</div><div id="00:08:00.320" class="transcript_line"> I forgot what that doctor was there.</div><div id="00:08:02.520" class="transcript_line"> You know, because I&#039;ve had chest and I&#039;ve lunged</div><div id="00:08:05.080" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve had.</div><div id="00:08:05.960" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, Mrs. Freeman, you&#039;ve got to.</div><div id="00:08:10.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to stop smoking.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So she said, oh, yes, I will.</div><div id="00:08:15.800" class="transcript_line"> He said, you said that last time.</div><div id="00:08:18.200" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, she stopped.</div><div id="00:08:19.440" class="transcript_line"> She was 80.</div><div id="00:08:22.160" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, your chest and this and that.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my mother didn&#039;t do bad.</div><div id="00:08:28.880" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t pass as a 94.</div><div id="00:08:31.600" class="transcript_line"> But that was good going, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:33.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:34.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:35.400" class="transcript_line"> And she finished smoking when she was 80.</div><div id="00:08:38.040" class="transcript_line"> And then my father and me, dad used to go upstairs and smoke.</div><div id="00:08:42.440" class="transcript_line"> And I used to go in the kitchen.</div><div id="00:08:44.120" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d say, look, I&#039;m not spoiling your enjoyment</div><div id="00:08:46.920" class="transcript_line"> because I finished.</div><div id="00:08:48.800" class="transcript_line"> You know what?</div><div id="00:08:49.400" class="transcript_line"> After she finished smoking for a while, she said,</div><div id="00:08:53.560" class="transcript_line"> after the meal, she said, put it in the ashtray.</div><div id="00:08:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s a laugh.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You see?</div><div id="00:09:01.400" class="transcript_line"> But once the ashtray is happy, it&#039;s a habit, she said.</div><div id="00:09:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, it kept going on and on and on for my mother.</div><div id="00:09:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Because you could smoke on the buses then.</div><div id="00:09:13.200" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d have the skinheads go to Langdonk on the bus.</div><div id="00:09:17.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, at the back.</div><div id="00:09:19.880" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d have the skinheads going to Langdonk.</div><div id="00:09:23.280" class="transcript_line"> And she was 80 then.</div><div id="00:09:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And we got there and we said, oh.</div><div id="00:09:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And that was the last skinhead she had.</div><div id="00:09:30.480" class="transcript_line"> That was good going.</div><div id="00:09:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Just stopped just like that.</div><div id="00:09:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but strong women.</div><div id="00:09:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Strong women.</div><div id="00:09:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:41.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, my nan always used to say, the men can think,</div><div id="00:09:47.040" class="transcript_line"> but the women run the community.</div><div id="00:09:49.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:09:50.680" class="transcript_line"> We just let the men pretend, she used to say.</div><div id="00:09:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:57.080" class="transcript_line"> Still true.</div><div id="00:09:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Still true.</div><div id="00:09:59.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:10:01.520" class="transcript_line"> What about the way, one of the things a lot of people</div><div id="00:10:04.920" class="transcript_line"> have talked about is manners and the way people have always</div><div id="00:10:09.960" class="transcript_line"> respected older people, auntie and uncle.</div><div id="00:10:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Because a girl says we run, in my convenience again,</div><div id="00:10:19.840" class="transcript_line"> I wanted a job there.</div><div id="00:10:21.640" class="transcript_line"> She says, we call you, you got some auntie, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:10:26.360" class="transcript_line"> I said, no.</div><div id="00:10:27.720" class="transcript_line"> I said, we knew her good.</div><div id="00:10:30.200" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t need to call her by her name.</div><div id="00:10:33.400" class="transcript_line"> And so we used to call her auntie.</div><div id="00:10:35.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:35.840" class="transcript_line"> So I said, oh, and she next to myself, gosh,</div><div id="00:10:38.280" class="transcript_line"> you got some auntie.</div><div id="00:10:41.040" class="transcript_line"> But I did that so we was, you know.</div><div id="00:10:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s respect, you know.</div><div id="00:10:46.080" class="transcript_line"> As a child, you couldn&#039;t call them by their first name.</div><div id="00:10:49.840" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:10:52.240" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:10:54.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but as I said, nobody had loads of money or nothing</div><div id="00:11:02.240" class="transcript_line"> like that.</div><div id="00:11:03.480" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:11:04.360" class="transcript_line"> But you still have the good life.</div><div id="00:11:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:07.200" class="transcript_line"> When we were kids, yeah, my father went to sea.</div><div id="00:11:11.200" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember, Bill and Keith,</div><div id="00:11:16.720" class="transcript_line"> a fellow that was in charge, one of them, with the ships</div><div id="00:11:20.360" class="transcript_line"> and all, because he used to come up,</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d say, oh, John, this fellow can&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:11:24.880" class="transcript_line"> He said, would you take his place?</div><div id="00:11:29.480" class="transcript_line"> So dad said, well, I&#039;m going to love it time.</div><div id="00:11:32.320" class="transcript_line"> And he said, we&#039;ll catch the train and so on.</div><div id="00:11:34.040" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, dad, I missed the train.</div><div id="00:11:37.600" class="transcript_line"> And he came back, and he got in touch with Bill.</div><div id="00:11:39.960" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I missed the train.</div><div id="00:11:42.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, I won&#039;t make it.</div><div id="00:11:43.760" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a good job.</div><div id="00:11:45.160" class="transcript_line"> He never think of throwing that ship he would have been on.</div><div id="00:11:50.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:52.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just the way your luck runs sometimes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:57.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he missed the train.</div><div id="00:11:59.640" class="transcript_line"> And then I said, oh, I&#039;m telling him,</div><div id="00:12:02.880" class="transcript_line"> my I&#039;m not catching the next one.</div><div id="00:12:06.040" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t have done it anyway.</div><div id="00:12:07.360" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t have gone.</div><div id="00:12:08.640" class="transcript_line"> He missed the boat.</div><div id="00:12:12.320" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it blew up.</div><div id="00:12:15.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, we should be coming down</div><div id="00:12:20.160" class="transcript_line"> wherever the river was, the Pacific or the Atlantic or what.</div><div id="00:12:24.640" class="transcript_line"> And bombs would be, he said, they&#039;d be shipped on fire</div><div id="00:12:29.240" class="transcript_line"> each side of him, you know, and they&#039;d be going through.</div><div id="00:12:32.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, he said it was terrible.</div><div id="00:12:34.920" class="transcript_line"> Because I know a lot of my friends off their father&#039;s.</div><div id="00:12:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, Laura was saying about her brother and.</div><div id="00:12:42.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Because my my granddad, he was from Barbados and he went.</div><div id="00:12:48.280" class="transcript_line"> He was on the ships all the way through the First World War.</div><div id="00:12:51.400" class="transcript_line"> He then he then became a miner</div><div id="00:12:54.320" class="transcript_line"> at just the beginning of the Second World War,</div><div id="00:12:57.520" class="transcript_line"> because my nan said, you are not going again.</div><div id="00:13:01.240" class="transcript_line"> Because you went, you live through one.</div><div id="00:13:04.360" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll never live through another.</div><div id="00:13:06.200" class="transcript_line"> She wouldn&#039;t let him go.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s typical, it&#039;s typical luck.</div><div id="00:13:11.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, you can&#039;t be a merchant seamen, which is hard enough life.</div><div id="00:13:14.960" class="transcript_line"> So what do you do? You become a miner.</div><div id="00:13:18.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it gets you good enough, because in the world we.</div><div id="00:13:24.080" class="transcript_line"> Went to Aberadwe, number day.</div><div id="00:13:25.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:27.040" class="transcript_line"> And. Oh, God, I went to my mother and I came back.</div><div id="00:13:33.120" class="transcript_line"> A lot of us went.</div><div id="00:13:35.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was you got more prejudice going into Cardiff</div><div id="00:13:39.960" class="transcript_line"> and once you were at the bay.</div><div id="00:13:43.040" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t know what to do, Laura, what I was when we were kids.</div><div id="00:13:47.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, because everybody&#039;s grandmother was white.</div><div id="00:13:52.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s what I mean.</div><div id="00:13:54.280" class="transcript_line"> And everything mixed.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, you didn&#039;t know until you went out to the,</div><div id="00:14:02.880" class="transcript_line"> you know, to the bay.</div><div id="00:14:04.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:06.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, without the bay, without the bay, Cardiff.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I always say without the bay, Cardiff would have had no money.</div><div id="00:14:17.160" class="transcript_line"> Because it was the work of all of those seamen and their families</div><div id="00:14:22.760" class="transcript_line"> that made Cardiff rich.</div><div id="00:14:25.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:28.640" class="transcript_line"> And yet they still look down on people.</div><div id="00:14:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:33.400" class="transcript_line"> But of course, you didn&#039;t know until you went out to the bay.</div><div id="00:14:36.640" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:14:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think I think that&#039;s why they knocked down all the houses.</div><div id="00:14:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Because it was like, oh, no, we don&#039;t want to.</div><div id="00:14:45.920" class="transcript_line"> We, you know, we&#039;re now we&#039;re now no longer need them kind of thing.</div><div id="00:14:50.160" class="transcript_line"> You know. Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:51.440" class="transcript_line"> But as the lazy said, yeah, the council, they could have done that.</div><div id="00:14:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And that&#039;d be worth money.</div><div id="00:14:58.440" class="transcript_line"> They were better.</div><div id="00:14:59.240" class="transcript_line"> They were better looking at some of the flats.</div><div id="00:15:02.080" class="transcript_line"> He said they were sorry.</div><div id="00:15:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Desperately.</div><div id="00:15:05.360" class="transcript_line"> But they didn&#039;t do a map because they did them in other places.</div><div id="00:15:09.160" class="transcript_line"> Because I know I worked with this woman and</div><div id="00:15:13.840" class="transcript_line"> I say, oh, pretend I&#039;m one of those places.</div><div id="00:15:20.600" class="transcript_line"> And she said they put a caravan in the yard.</div><div id="00:15:26.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they got it there. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:28.080" class="transcript_line"> And they lived in there until they got their house.</div><div id="00:15:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:32.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they could have done that.</div><div id="00:15:33.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;re on the street.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Instead, you know, they knocked down they knocked down half of Butown and the bay.</div><div id="00:15:40.880" class="transcript_line"> And then they and at the same time, they knocked down Thompson Street and all of the docks around Barry.</div><div id="00:15:46.240" class="transcript_line"> In Barry. Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Just.</div><div id="00:15:52.720" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, but yeah, but but that&#039;s that&#039;s the thing, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:15:57.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like you and me having a conversation and immediately there&#039;s someone who crossovers our lives.</div><div id="00:16:04.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:16:05.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, and that&#039;s that&#039;s something that&#039;s missing nowadays.</div><div id="00:16:09.880" class="transcript_line"> That, you know, if you you talk to anybody from the bay, you talk to anybody who&#039;s from from Barry,</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> particularly the merchant Siemens families and their lives will overlap.</div><div id="00:16:22.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, you know somebody or when I was a kid,</div><div id="00:16:26.520" class="transcript_line"> I used to go out with the boys from the bay all the time and and they&#039;d come over the island and and.</div><div id="00:16:32.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:37.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:38.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:39.080" class="transcript_line"> They were good people.</div><div id="00:16:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:41.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were good.</div><div id="00:16:42.080" class="transcript_line"> They were good people and they were good days.</div><div id="00:16:45.160" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s all you could wish for, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:16:49.280" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:16:50.280" class="transcript_line"> And when you&#039;re a kid, you don&#039;t understand how some kids got this or that, you know.</div><div id="00:16:56.840" class="transcript_line"> But oh, we had a good life.</div><div id="00:16:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, they were fine of us.</div><div id="00:17:01.160" class="transcript_line"> And we had a good, good upbringing.</div><div id="00:17:04.760" class="transcript_line"> You said you couldn&#039;t talk, but you did.</div><div id="00:17:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha.</div><div id="00:17:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha ha.</div><div id="00:17:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, crazy.</div><div id="00:17:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:17.840" class="transcript_line"> I bet you just caught me because I came in.</div><div id="00:17:20.560" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t call this morning, did you?</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:17:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Somebody called when it was.</div><div id="00:17:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Someone has just passed away.</div><div id="00:17:27.680" class="transcript_line"> So maybe that was it.</div><div id="00:17:28.960" class="transcript_line"> Michael Michael dos Santos.</div><div id="00:17:32.480" class="transcript_line"> It is right then, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:17:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I hear that this morning.</div><div id="00:17:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think he passed away.</div><div id="00:17:37.760" class="transcript_line"> It is right.</div><div id="00:17:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he passed away.</div><div id="00:17:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because somebody called me this morning.</div><div id="00:17:42.560" class="transcript_line"> So they said, go meet people there.</div><div id="00:17:44.480" class="transcript_line"> Just in case, you know.</div><div id="00:17:45.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and that&#039;s what it that&#039;s what it was.</div><div id="00:17:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God.</div><div id="00:17:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:50.360" class="transcript_line"> The trouble at the moment as well is, although we can clap from the side of the road, we</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t have proper funerals.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And one thing the Bay does and Bute Town does is proper funerals.</div><div id="00:18:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, yes.</div><div id="00:18:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Because when my brother died and the kids were living in Holmen, he came back and people</div><div id="00:18:18.320" class="transcript_line"> come down from Yorkshire, you know, to the funeral.</div><div id="00:18:22.880" class="transcript_line"> And they said, we&#039;ve never seen anything like it.</div><div id="00:18:26.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, because we went to the club.</div><div id="00:18:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, we put on the, you know, the food and everything.</div><div id="00:18:34.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:18:37.280" class="transcript_line"> People walking behind, you know, it&#039;s.</div><div id="00:18:41.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:42.280" class="transcript_line"> But of course, that&#039;s the last time I&#039;ve seen them.</div><div id="00:18:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Michael.</div><div id="00:18:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:50.680" class="transcript_line"> And I thought I laughed with him because he used to shave his head, you know, bald.</div><div id="00:18:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And his sister lived in Oddsworth Square and you had to go all the way up those steps,</div><div id="00:19:07.680" class="transcript_line"> you know.</div><div id="00:19:08.680" class="transcript_line"> So he came in and was in the shop and we were having a laugh and talking and he said, Oh</div><div id="00:19:14.680" class="transcript_line"> God, when he said those stairs, he said, when I came, he said, when I went to my sister&#039;s</div><div id="00:19:19.080" class="transcript_line"> because he said I come out of the shop, he said I had hair when I went in.</div><div id="00:19:24.080" class="transcript_line"> He was just bald.</div><div id="00:19:27.080" class="transcript_line"> He said it was a right moment, he said, I had hair when I came in.</div><div id="00:19:32.080" class="transcript_line"> And one of you that this morning, you have.</div><div id="00:19:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:37.080" class="transcript_line"> And my friends, they don&#039;t see nothing because they don&#039;t know if it&#039;s right or not.</div><div id="00:19:42.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, because you use these rumors, you know.</div><div id="00:19:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:46.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:47.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, somebody else called me when I was filming the doc, doing the shopping.</div><div id="00:19:52.480" class="transcript_line"> But the thing is, the thing is, I always say the only memory you should have of people,</div><div id="00:19:58.480" class="transcript_line"> you know, it&#039;s those good moments.</div><div id="00:20:01.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:02.480" class="transcript_line"> You know, and I think that&#039;s why we celebrate a funeral.</div><div id="00:20:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you should actually, you don&#039;t mourn their passing because we&#039;re all going to pass.</div><div id="00:20:12.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, of course.</div><div id="00:20:13.880" class="transcript_line"> And all you want is people to celebrate and remember the good times.</div><div id="00:20:17.880" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;ve taken up loads and loads of your time and I&#039;m grateful for it.</div><div id="00:20:22.880" class="transcript_line"> I know, I&#039;ve just been saying thanks for the cup of tea.</div><div id="00:20:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s a bad time, you had one.</div><div id="00:20:26.880" class="transcript_line"> And if you were a decent person, you&#039;d have made me one by now.</div><div id="00:20:30.880" class="transcript_line"> But anyway.</div><div id="00:20:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;m going to go.</div><div id="00:20:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Bill.</div><div id="00:20:38.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m really, really grateful, kid.</div><div id="00:20:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Get yourself a cup of tea.</div><div id="00:20:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Or better still, have a cup of coffee with some honey in.</div><div id="00:20:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, that&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:20:50.280" class="transcript_line"> I love my honey.</div><div id="00:20:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:52.280" class="transcript_line"> I eat honey when it&#039;s coming out of my mouth.</div><div id="00:20:55.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you what, every morning, every morning, I have Weetabix or shredded wheat, right?</div><div id="00:21:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I got a lighter.</div><div id="00:21:03.280" class="transcript_line"> And I put honey on it.</div><div id="00:21:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I love honey.</div><div id="00:21:07.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s just.</div><div id="00:21:08.280" class="transcript_line"> Are you having a coffee?</div><div id="00:21:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I have.</div><div id="00:21:11.680" class="transcript_line"> You have honey in your coffee?</div><div id="00:21:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:13.680" class="transcript_line"> The doctor said to me, you&#039;re having too much sugar.</div><div id="00:21:19.680" class="transcript_line"> You shouldn&#039;t have sugar.</div><div id="00:21:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, OK.</div><div id="00:21:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So I put honey on things.</div><div id="00:21:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s why I never had, it&#039;s funny, from a kid, never had sugar in my tea.</div><div id="00:21:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Never had sugar in my tea, ever.</div><div id="00:21:32.680" class="transcript_line"> From a kiddie.</div><div id="00:21:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:21:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they always had no sugar.</div><div id="00:21:40.080" class="transcript_line"> But loving people now don&#039;t like sugar in their tea, do they?</div><div id="00:21:43.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they have those sweetener things.</div><div id="00:21:45.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d rather have a spoonful of honey, honestly.</div><div id="00:21:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="00:21:48.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d rather have a spoonful of honey.</div><div id="00:21:50.080" class="transcript_line"> I could taste sweetener.</div><div id="00:21:52.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:21:53.080" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:21:54.080" class="transcript_line"> In my coffee, I have honey.</div><div id="00:21:57.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:58.080" class="transcript_line"> And before I go bed, I always make a hot chocolate.</div><div id="00:22:01.080" class="transcript_line"> And I have honey in a drop of brandy.</div><div id="00:22:04.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;ve done for you today.</div><div id="00:22:09.480" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re in lockdown and I&#039;ve taken your mind back.</div><div id="00:22:13.480" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be thinking about that for the rest of tonight.</div><div id="00:22:16.480" class="transcript_line"> And other stuff will appear in your head.</div><div id="00:22:19.480" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll tell you, you think of your mum and you&#039;ll start to smile.</div><div id="00:22:23.480" class="transcript_line"> And here you are again, you&#039;re doing it.</div><div id="00:22:26.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m never going to get a cup of tea here, Beryl.</div><div id="00:22:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Let me tell you, when we were kids,</div><div id="00:22:37.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean there was no televisions and all that then.</div><div id="00:22:40.880" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d all be on the fire in the kitchen</div><div id="00:22:43.880" class="transcript_line"> and listening to the radio,</div><div id="00:22:46.880" class="transcript_line"> the stories on the radio.</div><div id="00:22:49.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it would be wonderful.</div><div id="00:22:51.880" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know nothing about televisions and all that.</div><div id="00:22:54.880" class="transcript_line"> When I was a kiddie.</div><div id="00:22:56.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:57.880" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when the first kid in our street in London,</div><div id="00:23:00.880" class="transcript_line"> we were the second family.</div><div id="00:23:02.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve no idea where the telly was.</div><div id="00:23:04.880" class="transcript_line"> We were the second family.</div><div id="00:23:06.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve no idea where the telly came from, so we won&#039;t go into that.</div><div id="00:23:09.880" class="transcript_line"> But we were the second family that had a telly in our street.</div><div id="00:23:12.880" class="transcript_line"> And when someone got a telly,</div><div id="00:23:15.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you what, they regretted it because their house was never empty.</div><div id="00:23:19.880" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:23:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, we were like that.</div><div id="00:23:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Because there was only two families that had a telly.</div><div id="00:23:26.880" class="transcript_line"> There was our family, another family up the street.</div><div id="00:23:29.880" class="transcript_line"> And then my sister and her husband bought it for my mother.</div><div id="00:23:33.880" class="transcript_line"> There was only a little screen, black and white.</div><div id="00:23:36.880" class="transcript_line"> And this lady up the street used to come in.</div><div id="00:23:41.880" class="transcript_line"> And another one on the other side of the road.</div><div id="00:23:44.880" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t sit in your friend&#039;s room.</div><div id="00:23:47.880" class="transcript_line"> There was people in there.</div><div id="00:23:49.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, my mum used to make a huge pot of spaghetti bolognese</div><div id="00:23:56.880" class="transcript_line"> on FA Cup final day.</div><div id="00:24:00.880" class="transcript_line"> Literally a huge pot because we had the telly.</div><div id="00:24:05.880" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d be there with a group of my friends.</div><div id="00:24:10.880" class="transcript_line"> My brother Paul, who&#039;s three years older than me,</div><div id="00:24:12.880" class="transcript_line"> would be there with a group of his friends.</div><div id="00:24:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Doors open, I&#039;m cooking, come in.</div><div id="00:24:18.880" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the way it is.</div><div id="00:24:20.880" class="transcript_line"> And people don&#039;t get, that&#039;s the way it was in Barry.</div><div id="00:24:22.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the way it was in the bay in Bute Town.</div><div id="00:24:25.880" class="transcript_line"> Of course it was.</div><div id="00:24:27.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to dinner with somebody.</div><div id="00:24:30.880" class="transcript_line"> Because you never know.</div><div id="00:24:32.880" class="transcript_line"> What goes around comes around.</div><div id="00:24:35.880" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s times when we didn&#039;t have anything on the table.</div><div id="00:24:40.880" class="transcript_line"> And someone else did.</div><div id="00:24:42.880" class="transcript_line"> And so you help someone, they help you.</div><div id="00:24:46.880" class="transcript_line"> And no one was embarrassed because someone had to ask.</div><div id="00:24:50.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the other thing I thought was good.</div><div id="00:24:53.880" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have to go any chance.</div><div id="00:24:56.880" class="transcript_line"> You best come and have some of the week, kid.</div><div id="00:24:59.880" class="transcript_line"> Because everybody knew I had no money.</div><div id="00:25:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:04.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s special.</div><div id="00:25:06.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a Christ card.</div><div id="00:25:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I&#039;m ready now for my teeth.</div><div id="00:25:13.880" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to blame me now.</div><div id="00:25:17.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not going to work.</div><div id="00:25:19.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go.</div><div id="00:25:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Listen.</div><div id="00:25:23.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going because you&#039;re never going to let me get off the phone.</div><div id="00:25:26.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m ready for it all.</div><div id="00:25:28.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going before you.</div><div id="00:25:30.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got my tooth stuck in this cat.</div><div id="00:25:34.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll see you after lockdown, Beryl.</div><div id="00:25:38.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay, love.</div><div id="00:25:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Bye, love.</div><div id="00:25:42.880" class="transcript_line"> Take care.</div></div></p>
