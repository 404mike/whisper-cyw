    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think these tragedies that are shown now on television, what we see is always much more vivid than what we hear and what we read.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve only got to show a child a picture and it stays. You can tell them to read a book or do something like that, but it doesn&#039;t stay quite the same way, unless they&#039;ve got a very good imagination.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But anybody looking at a picture and it stays with you. And the impact of television on Abba Van was terrific.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> In the same way that you&#039;ve got it now in Japan and the tsunami and things like that, that is staying in people&#039;s minds.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think it&#039;s possible in those kinds of circumstances for television to convey how people are feeling?</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you have to be very careful. Television commentators tend to interview people, you know, and ask.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And when people suddenly have questions thrust at them, they say what they think they ought to say.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t always think, you know, instinctively, oh, I&#039;m on television, I better say something.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I can&#039;t say what I want to say. I can&#039;t swear, you know.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I can&#039;t say all the language I want to burst out at the NCB because of Abba Van, because I&#039;m on television.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t come over very well. But I find it can be an artificial.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Very rarely do you get a sort of immediate impact reaction. It&#039;s a more studied one.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> If you approach somebody with a camera or a microphone, they sort of dither. They don&#039;t quite know what to do.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it needs a very good producer or director, whatever it is, to pick the right moment and the right person.</div></div></p>
