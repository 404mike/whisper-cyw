    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so today is the 3rd of July 2019, this is after I do the Dows. Can you say your full</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> name? My name is Derek Patrick Gale. And what are your parents&#039; names? Well, my mother&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:18.320" class="transcript_line"> name is Gwendolyn and my stepfather, Ruben Murray, because he&#039;s not my real dad, because</div><div id="00:00:26.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never met my real dad, you know. Which is something none of my existing family has</div><div id="00:00:35.240" class="transcript_line"> ever spoken about, you know. So I&#039;ve never been able to find out who he is or what he</div><div id="00:00:42.320" class="transcript_line"> did or, you know, some secrets. Big secrets, you know, black people like, you know, you</div><div id="00:00:50.240" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t get in conversation with them until you&#039;ve been spoken to, you get me? So you</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t really know what&#039;s happening, you know. But, and I thought it was, but I didn&#039;t know</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Ruben&#039;s family before I came to England. And I knew he wasn&#039;t my father, because that much</div><div id="00:01:07.720" class="transcript_line"> I knew, you know. So when I came here, I knew I was going to a house with my mother and</div><div id="00:01:14.760" class="transcript_line"> my stepfather, you know, but I didn&#039;t know how the reaction would be. But it was good</div><div id="00:01:22.320" class="transcript_line"> in terms of living, you know. There wasn&#039;t any animosity between either of us, you know.</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> My mother was more like, more dominant of the two, you know. So she, she was like, I</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> came here, but, you know, I look at it and I thought to myself, over the years and see</div><div id="00:01:44.280" class="transcript_line"> the years gone by, I was here to look after the younger ones more, you know, more than</div><div id="00:01:50.840" class="transcript_line"> actually looking after myself, you know what I mean. I was fed and I was clothed, stuff</div><div id="00:01:57.440" class="transcript_line"> like that. But other than that is do around the house, which, you know, when they&#039;re not</div><div id="00:02:05.920" class="transcript_line"> there, you know, make sure the kids are safe. So I&#039;ve been doing safety work for quite a</div><div id="00:02:10.920" class="transcript_line"> long time, you know what I&#039;m saying. So, you know, five kids, you know. But back home,</div><div id="00:02:16.720" class="transcript_line"> as a kid, we grew up with a large amount of young people, you know, because if I remember</div><div id="00:02:22.160" class="transcript_line"> rightly, I was counting the other day, my auntie in London, she had five children. My</div><div id="00:02:29.280" class="transcript_line"> one auntie, she had two. My other auntie, you know, it was like ten of us in the one</div><div id="00:02:36.280" class="transcript_line"> yard, you know what I mean. There used to be a gale yard. That&#039;s why the word yardie</div><div id="00:02:40.160" class="transcript_line"> comes about, you know, because everybody live in a yard. Because my grandfather, he owns</div><div id="00:02:45.480" class="transcript_line"> this property. So that was a gale yard. And further down the road, there was a property</div><div id="00:02:51.480" class="transcript_line"> which is called Clark&#039;s. And the fact that it was called a Clark yard is because they</div><div id="00:02:59.560" class="transcript_line"> were all relatives, but there was only one owner. He owns it and everybody built a house</div><div id="00:03:04.880" class="transcript_line"> on it, you know, family, a little house there, a little house there. And it&#039;s called Clark</div><div id="00:03:10.160" class="transcript_line"> yard. It actually was called James yard, because they were all James, the whole caboodle</div><div id="00:03:15.160" class="transcript_line"> of them, you know. So, you know, so kids were like close proximity when you&#039;re growing up,</div><div id="00:03:21.320" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean. Uncles around you, you know what I mean. You have, like I was showing</div><div id="00:03:27.440" class="transcript_line"> you, I&#039;ve got three uncles, you know. We were at similar age, you know, older than me, but</div><div id="00:03:33.280" class="transcript_line"> they were doing things which I was able to do as well, you know. So it was a happy medium</div><div id="00:03:38.360" class="transcript_line"> back home, you know. I had a fantastic time as a kid, you know, because we lived out in</div><div id="00:03:42.200" class="transcript_line"> the bush, you know what I mean. We had, my grandfather, he had goats, you know, he was</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> a farmer, he planted rice. I mean, he did everything, you know what I&#039;m saying. He was</div><div id="00:03:53.520" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, and the most important thing, right, Premento, right. I don&#039;t know if you</div><div id="00:03:59.680" class="transcript_line"> know what Premento is, right. Premento, that part where we came from, Premento was the</div><div id="00:04:06.480" class="transcript_line"> main growth of stuff, right. And when the Premento season comes around, everybody has</div><div id="00:04:12.920" class="transcript_line"> to chip in, you know. We are the youngest boys, we are the one that climbs the trees</div><div id="00:04:17.400" class="transcript_line"> and breaks the limb down, and you&#039;ve got some of them down there with a bag, because the</div><div id="00:04:22.520" class="transcript_line"> seeds, right, the seeds is the most important thing, right. And Premento season is like</div><div id="00:04:28.720" class="transcript_line"> a hard working time, right, because it&#039;s got to be dried, it&#039;s got to be picked, you know.</div><div id="00:04:35.120" class="transcript_line"> We used to have a little room at the back of the house, we used to have all the, we used to call them</div><div id="00:04:41.240" class="transcript_line"> crock-ass bags, and we used to fill it up with Premento, take it out, and in the night,</div><div id="00:04:47.200" class="transcript_line"> all the women and the neighbours come and we sit there and they&#039;re picking Premento</div><div id="00:04:51.160" class="transcript_line"> in the night, and we&#039;re talking dopey stories, you know. It&#039;ll be like, cool story going</div><div id="00:04:57.520" class="transcript_line"> on, you know. And if you have to get up and walk back to your house, it&#039;s pitch black,</div><div id="00:05:02.160" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean. The living day life, you know what I&#039;m saying, it&#039;s ridiculous,</div><div id="00:05:07.600" class="transcript_line"> but it was fun, you know. I didn&#039;t have to just go, and my granny used to say, you wash</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> your foot, you know, we had a top running into the yard just off the road, and the foot</div><div id="00:05:19.640" class="transcript_line"> pad leaves up there, and she used to come with the torch and say, go wash your foot,</div><div id="00:05:23.520" class="transcript_line"> and you know what I mean. So we had to run up in the dark to the top and you wet your</div><div id="00:05:28.840" class="transcript_line"> foot and run back, you know what I mean. I used to go, dopey! And those are the things</div><div id="00:05:35.200" class="transcript_line"> I remember back home, you know what I mean. We used to have goats, and like I said, we</div><div id="00:05:42.440" class="transcript_line"> get up early in the morning and goats gotta go out, right. And we had a property, we used</div><div id="00:05:48.440" class="transcript_line"> to call it hilltop, it&#039;s like that. But when you get to the top, it&#039;s a pure level, you</div><div id="00:05:55.600" class="transcript_line"> know. But the goats, they know the way up and down. We used to have one called Billy,</div><div id="00:06:00.600" class="transcript_line"> because he&#039;s a ram goat, you know. We used to call him Billy, tie a thing around his</div><div id="00:06:05.600" class="transcript_line"> neck, and he takes a plaque up to the hill. And this is before we got to school, you know</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> what I mean. And we used to go to a school called Petersfield, which is like from here</div><div id="00:06:15.840" class="transcript_line"> to Grangetown, probably further. But we used to walk, but we never used to walk by the</div><div id="00:06:21.360" class="transcript_line"> roads. We used to walk in between properties. We know there&#039;s footpath leading, you know,</div><div id="00:06:27.280" class="transcript_line"> so you come across mango trees, there&#039;s nisberry trees, there&#039;s squabber trees. So you leave</div><div id="00:06:33.240" class="transcript_line"> home and you don&#039;t get to school until ten o&#039;clock, you know. And the teacher, Mr. what&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:40.240" class="transcript_line"> his name, I never forget, Mr. Dunn, he used to meet us halfway down the road with a big</div><div id="00:06:47.240" class="transcript_line"> bloody belt, you know what I mean. But we got him tricked anyway, because they used</div><div id="00:06:50.520" class="transcript_line"> to have a thing called a corage. It&#039;s a herb. You rub it in the middle of your hand, it</div><div id="00:06:57.520" class="transcript_line"> makes your hand go numb. So you can&#039;t feel anything, you know. The only time, don&#039;t let</div><div id="00:07:02.680" class="transcript_line"> him hit you over the palm. That&#039;s where it hurts. So if you rub it in, if it touch anywhere</div><div id="00:07:08.160" class="transcript_line"> on your skin, you come out in a rash, you know. But if you rub it in your arms, palms</div><div id="00:07:14.760" class="transcript_line"> like that, it makes the middle of your hand go numb, you know. And he used to come, you</div><div id="00:07:20.320" class="transcript_line"> know. And he used to say, hold out your hand. This is at the school gate before. Hold your</div><div id="00:07:25.320" class="transcript_line"> hands. Used to hit you in your arms, you know. But if you tried to run, you used to try and</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> get your legs. This was a running battle between the school and the kids, you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So, but the worst thing is, if they send a report home to your grandparents, they&#039;ll</div><div id="00:07:45.520" class="transcript_line"> be late to school, you know. Then you get another beating, you know. And that&#039;s how</div><div id="00:07:51.520" class="transcript_line"> it was. It was joyful to go to school. Because when we lived, we had a path running right</div><div id="00:07:57.960" class="transcript_line"> along our house, right. We used to play cricket out there and stuff, right. And there&#039;s a</div><div id="00:08:03.680" class="transcript_line"> place behind us called Goldsmith, a different little community. So if you walk down a path,</div><div id="00:08:10.680" class="transcript_line"> it takes you ten minutes. But if you have to walk around, go around, it takes you another</div><div id="00:08:16.200" class="transcript_line"> half an hour. So being, you know, so we used to control that lane, you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:08:21.480" class="transcript_line"> So anyone we falling out with, they ain&#039;t gonna pass, you know. We&#039;d be stoning them</div><div id="00:08:26.320" class="transcript_line"> or whatever, you know what I mean. Used to wait for them at the bottom of the property</div><div id="00:08:31.240" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;d swap from the house down there and this would be a footpath. And there&#039;s</div><div id="00:08:34.960" class="transcript_line"> houses behind us, you know. Because there was no barter or such, you know, by the trees</div><div id="00:08:42.680" class="transcript_line"> and whose land is that, whose property is that. You know, there&#039;s no fencing, you know.</div><div id="00:08:47.400" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s certain people that&#039;ll protect their property like the plant, certain mango</div><div id="00:08:51.960" class="transcript_line"> tree, you know when the mango is gonna drop and, you know, they&#039;ll be waiting for you,</div><div id="00:08:56.400" class="transcript_line"> you know. You know, you could see people running through the cane field, you know.</div><div id="00:09:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Mr. Harp is coming, you know what I mean. Try to get away, you know what I mean. And</div><div id="00:09:06.160" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s how our life was, you know what I mean, back home. But when you came to England, everything</div><div id="00:09:12.440" class="transcript_line"> stopped. You&#039;re thinking, what the heck. I mean, you have to pay for everything, man.</div><div id="00:09:18.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when you start paying, you know. There&#039;s no cricket field unless you pay to play, there</div><div id="00:09:23.760" class="transcript_line"> is nothing, you know. And where my parents lived, it was a coal industry, not steel industry,</div><div id="00:09:33.320" class="transcript_line"> you know. It was like, West Midlands, you know, heart of the West Midlands, basically</div><div id="00:09:37.960" class="transcript_line"> steel. You know, my father, stepfather used to work in the London Steel Works, you know,</div><div id="00:09:45.800" class="transcript_line"> which is like five minutes away. You could smell it, you know. My first thing in the</div><div id="00:09:50.800" class="transcript_line"> morning, I&#039;d steal, they&#039;d steal, truck, steal, you know. And I hated it, to be honest,</div><div id="00:09:56.800" class="transcript_line"> you know. I did not like living there, you know. I used to go out, used to get locked</div><div id="00:10:02.080" class="transcript_line"> out of the house because, you know, 10 o&#039;clock come, you&#039;re not home, you know, you don&#039;t</div><div id="00:10:06.440" class="transcript_line"> come in. You know, that&#039;s how my mother was, you know, because I fought E-Works, shift</div><div id="00:10:11.920" class="transcript_line"> works, you know, on and off, you know, stuff like that. So, yeah. So I think I spend about</div><div id="00:10:21.640" class="transcript_line"> after I left school, about 18 months at home, you know, and went to live in Wolverhampton,</div><div id="00:10:29.720" class="transcript_line"> you know, because I had a problem, you know. You know, I was the problem, I was like, house</div><div id="00:10:37.800" class="transcript_line"> problem because I go out and don&#039;t come back here and I go try and get, go to a, because</div><div id="00:10:42.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m beginning to know a few people from Dudley because Dudley was two minutes away, you know,</div><div id="00:10:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Dudley Zoo and places like that. So when I leave Wolverhampton, when I went to live</div><div id="00:10:53.360" class="transcript_line"> in Wolverhampton, I know the area, so I&#039;m able to come back, like, to a place like Dudley,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, where I used to go with my mother, pull in the trolley every Saturday morning,</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> you know. I mean, that was, those days were done because I&#039;m independent now, I live</div><div id="00:11:06.640" class="transcript_line"> by myself, you know. I have different friends in Wolverhampton, start coming back to Dudley,</div><div id="00:11:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Queen Mary Ballroom, which is where Lenny Henry used to perform before he became big,</div><div id="00:11:21.640" class="transcript_line"> you know. And used to be running battles with Hell Angels because Hell Angels used to be</div><div id="00:11:28.200" class="transcript_line"> part of that gang then, because they used to control the Dudley, the Queen Mary Ballroom,</div><div id="00:11:33.480" class="transcript_line"> as it were, you know, and they used to be, they did not like black people, you know what</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean. They did not like black people. So we all used to catch the bus from, from Wolverhampton</div><div id="00:11:43.640" class="transcript_line"> to Dudley, and if you&#039;re from Wolverhampton, it makes you a Wolverhampton supporter, you</div><div id="00:11:50.160" class="transcript_line"> know, in football, right. Outside of Wolverhampton, a place called Garnall, from Garnall to Dudley</div><div id="00:11:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and the rest of the areas, or West Bramwich Albion, you know, the baggies on the walls.</div><div id="00:12:04.940" class="transcript_line"> So you get to a certain part of, they stone the bus, especially if you see a black man</div><div id="00:12:09.160" class="transcript_line"> on that bus, you&#039;ve got to put the seats up against the door, against the windows,</div><div id="00:12:14.760" class="transcript_line"> you know. That used to be a regular occurrence on a Sunday night, because the police would</div><div id="00:12:21.760" class="transcript_line"> be out there waiting, because this is one of those stops where the bus has to stop,</div><div id="00:12:25.960" class="transcript_line"> you know. I&#039;ve been on the bus, rather than go down that way, they drive round and go</div><div id="00:12:31.120" class="transcript_line"> to the police station, because they&#039;d be chasing the bus, you know, and stuff like that, you</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> know what I mean. Yeah, so I live in Wolves. I got to know people, because I didn&#039;t know</div><div id="00:12:42.320" class="transcript_line"> anyone around there, got to know people, made friends with, you know, with all the, because</div><div id="00:12:47.400" class="transcript_line"> Wolverhampton is very black-oriented, you know, there&#039;s a lot of black people living</div><div id="00:12:52.720" class="transcript_line"> there, West Indians. So that&#039;s where my story is different from Glaston, in a way, because</div><div id="00:12:57.720" class="transcript_line"> I, Wolverhampton is a bigger town, more people, music, you know, and the police, you know,</div><div id="00:13:05.280" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where I get involved with the music thing, because we set up a sound system, you</div><div id="00:13:10.280" class="transcript_line"> know, a group of us, you know. Little sound we had used to play, you know, Spiderman sound,</div><div id="00:13:16.280" class="transcript_line"> we used to call ourselves and play, you know, people used to turn up, all of a sudden people</div><div id="00:13:22.160" class="transcript_line"> start coming, you know, get bigger and bigger, and you know, so, and that&#039;s how it was.</div><div id="00:13:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Then we start travelling outside of Wolverhampton, it&#039;s a good place, like Manchester, you know,</div><div id="00:13:33.400" class="transcript_line"> so I knew the culture of the music then, and once I got into a bit of trouble in Wolverhampton,</div><div id="00:13:39.400" class="transcript_line"> well, until this day I think we were innocent, but I think because we were young black kids,</div><div id="00:13:47.080" class="transcript_line"> and the racist vibes then were rivers of blood by Enoch Powell, and I was watching a program</div><div id="00:13:56.760" class="transcript_line"> the other day, and you know, I didn&#039;t know this, but he was the man, he was the home</div><div id="00:14:02.680" class="transcript_line"> secretary firing secretary, I don&#039;t remember what it was, but when they started to recruit</div><div id="00:14:09.960" class="transcript_line"> West Indian people to come to England, he was the man that actually went to the Caribbean</div><div id="00:14:14.600" class="transcript_line"> and started recruiting nurses and telling people come to Britain, get a life, you know,</div><div id="00:14:19.400" class="transcript_line"> education, etc. And he&#039;s the one that turned around and told them, stop, because we&#039;re</div><div id="00:14:23.160" class="transcript_line"> going to have rivers of blood and stuff like that, you know, and I mean, the racist thing</div><div id="00:14:28.920" class="transcript_line"> was, you know, this is like back in the 70s, you know, 75, you know, I&#039;ve only been in</div><div id="00:14:36.480" class="transcript_line"> the country about, what, possibly about less than five years, you know, so five of us end</div><div id="00:14:44.760" class="transcript_line"> up in Crown Court, because we got attacked, we got attacked, we didn&#039;t attack anyone,</div><div id="00:14:52.240" class="transcript_line"> the one guy fell through the glass window, the one white guy, he was from Newcastle,</div><div id="00:14:55.840" class="transcript_line"> he was Newcastle supporters, and he fell through the glass, and they say that they were stabbed,</div><div id="00:15:02.840" class="transcript_line"> but you see the trouble is we didn&#039;t have anyone to defend us, to say, well, you know,</div><div id="00:15:07.920" class="transcript_line"> we were just in court, they gave us a lawyer, I end up in bloody Staffordshire Crown Court,</div><div id="00:15:12.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, it used to be called Staffordshire Assizes then, before Crown Court, I mean,</div><div id="00:15:19.840" class="transcript_line"> I was sitting there, I was stood there, and the judge was bloody over there, half a mile</div><div id="00:15:23.920" class="transcript_line"> away, you need a bar necklace to see this guy, you know, so anyway, they say we started,</div><div id="00:15:32.160" class="transcript_line"> they had me, what was the charge they put on me, causing an offrate, didn&#039;t know what</div><div id="00:15:39.160" class="transcript_line"> that was at the time, and two of my friends, they got

the only reason we were in that</div><div id="00:15:56.520" class="transcript_line"> part of the town is because they wouldn&#039;t let us black people in any club unless you</div><div id="00:16:02.680" class="transcript_line"> knew someone who works there, or you&#039;re friendly with the doorman, but I had a friend who works</div><div id="00:16:08.240" class="transcript_line"> in the bar downstairs, and he used to let us in off the street, go to the bar, and upstairs,</div><div id="00:16:14.400" class="transcript_line"> I used to hide in the dark, just to, you know, because the bouncers, they used to come around,</div><div id="00:16:21.400" class="transcript_line"> and you know, so we used to just smell her out in the, because it was quite a dark dance</div><div id="00:16:26.960" class="transcript_line"> room, you know, just split up, and just to be in there, you know, and we, but we had</div><div id="00:16:32.720" class="transcript_line"> to get there before 11 o&#039;clock, because they closed the downstairs bar, and that&#039;s where</div><div id="00:16:37.160" class="transcript_line"> we were going, we were on our way to this club, when we got attacked, and we end up,</div><div id="00:16:42.160" class="transcript_line"> my friend end up in hospital, and also all hell broke loose, so I had a friend living</div><div id="00:16:49.480" class="transcript_line"> in Birmingham at the time, so I thought, oh, you know, I couldn&#039;t even tell my mother then,</div><div id="00:16:54.240" class="transcript_line"> because my mum just lived up the road, you know, and they said, oh, you&#039;ve got to have,</div><div id="00:17:02.400" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s your next of kin, you know, and I&#039;m like, oh, my mother, so, because I went to</div><div id="00:17:09.160" class="transcript_line"> live in Birmingham then, at the time of the friend, not live, but stayed with him, because,</div><div id="00:17:13.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, hopefully this thing would blow over, but never quite did, because I went</div><div id="00:17:19.360" class="transcript_line"> back to Wolverhampton, because I was signing the dole, and you know, when you go there,</div><div id="00:17:22.720" class="transcript_line"> give you dole check and stuff, so, went there one morning, and they were waiting for me,</div><div id="00:17:28.720" class="transcript_line"> the police, they, it was even on the radio, it was the most frightening thing, you know,</div><div id="00:17:32.840" class="transcript_line">

know, which was like, actually</div><div id="00:21:20.840" class="transcript_line"> I moved to a friend of mine called Robert, because I knew him from Wolverhampton, so</div><div id="00:21:27.840" class="transcript_line"> we got a flat together, both of us, and went to live in Edgbaston, City Road, you know,</div><div id="00:21:34.840" class="transcript_line"> and, but he was still working in the, further on in the Midlands, because he&#039;d been working</div><div id="00:21:40.840" class="transcript_line"> there all his school life, a place called Darleston, and he says, yeah, I&#039;ll move to</div><div id="00:21:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham, let&#039;s get a flat together, man, so we went there, we got a flat together,</div><div id="00:21:50.840" class="transcript_line"> share a house, you know, in Edgbaston, yeah, and from there, you know, the front line was</div><div id="00:21:59.840" class="transcript_line"> just down the road, you know, I&#039;m quite acquainted with black people now, I can move around,</div><div id="00:22:06.840" class="transcript_line"> music business, and I got a job at Quick Save, there&#039;s a company, a Welsh company, yeah,</div><div id="00:22:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Quick Save, and they opened a big warehouse in a place called Tipton, so we all went there</div><div id="00:22:20.840" class="transcript_line"> for a job, and we all got a job there, you know, it was about eight of us black guys,</div><div id="00:22:23.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and we all started working there, you know, and the money was quite good, but</div><div id="00:22:29.840" class="transcript_line"> what it was, you could do a lot of overtime, right, so we used to go work at ten o&#039;clock,</div><div id="00:22:35.840" class="transcript_line"> and come home at ten o&#039;clock, you know, piling up the cash, we were earning good cash, you</div><div id="00:22:40.840" class="transcript_line"> know, and we had a flat, you know, we didn&#039;t worry about cooking, there was Mavis, Miss</div><div id="00:22:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Mavis down the road who cooks, we&#039;d order dinners, Mavis, we&#039;re coming for dinner,</div><div id="00:22:49.840" class="transcript_line"> make sure you put the dinner up, you know, and the gambling is going on, we&#039;re playing</div><div id="00:22:53.840" class="transcript_line"> cards, so sometimes I come from work, I don&#039;t even bother to go home until bedtime, you</div><div id="00:22:58.840" class="transcript_line"> know, because it&#039;s so busy, there&#039;s the herbs man there, the pubs there, you know, it was</div><div id="00:23:04.840" class="transcript_line"> front line, this is the, you know, we never used to go to the city centre or anything,</div><div id="00:23:09.840" class="transcript_line"> everything you do in a community, you go play gambling, you lost your wages this week,</div><div id="00:23:14.840" class="transcript_line"> next week you&#039;ll win it back, you&#039;ll win back the same money you lost, you know, you&#039;re</div><div id="00:23:19.840" class="transcript_line"> not, you used to go around in circles, so you never used to have to leave the area,</div><div id="00:23:24.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, because the blues, this man called Dyke, he had a hairdresser shop, weekend,</div><div id="00:23:30.840" class="transcript_line"> he popped all the hairdresser stuff up and put the sound system in, you know, the pubs</div><div id="00:23:35.840" class="transcript_line"> across the road, you know, like it is on city road now, you know, you don&#039;t have to walk</div><div id="00:23:41.840" class="transcript_line"> far to get fresh product, because, you know, in the middle of Zoroastrian land, you know,</div><div id="00:23:46.840" class="transcript_line"> with the black community, you always get the food, you know, like I went to buy a piece</div><div id="00:23:52.840" class="transcript_line"> of yam the other day, I&#039;d have to touch about 10 pieces before I feel what I want, you know,</div><div id="00:23:56.840" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;ve got it so long, but back then you could go and get the fresh stuff, you</div><div id="00:24:00.840" class="transcript_line"> know what I mean, and yeah, and that&#039;s how it was, everything was good, then a new influx</div><div id="00:24:08.840" class="transcript_line"> of West Indians start coming in now, this is like the early 80s, coming, you know, and</div><div id="00:24:19.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a new influx, and they&#039;ve just, they change the whole, they change everything at</div><div id="00:24:26.840" class="transcript_line"> that point, you know, because when we came here, we came here, we went to school, we</div><div id="00:24:30.840" class="transcript_line"> did this, we did that, but the influx which was coming in, they came in after they were</div><div id="00:24:37.840" class="transcript_line"> in the school, I don&#039;t, you know, most of them came in on visas and coming as musician,</div><div id="00:24:45.840" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;re not, but you could get a visa that way, you got to have a, you know, so</div><div id="00:24:51.840" class="transcript_line"> most, and there used to be a lot of artists from the Caribbean coming to England, you</div><div id="00:24:56.840" class="transcript_line"> just latch onto one of them, you know, and say, oh, I&#039;m a drummer, I&#039;m a diss, I&#039;m a</div><div id="00:25:01.840" class="transcript_line"> that, I&#039;m a that, bing, bing, bing, visa, but most of them are gangsters, to be honest,</div><div id="00:25:08.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean, I&#039;m not talking, you know, they were, you know, and they had one</div><div id="00:25:13.840" class="transcript_line"> intention, earn money, money was their objective, money, money, and they&#039;ll do anything, you</div><div id="00:25:21.840" class="transcript_line"> know, anything, so therefore it becomes a war between themselves and people which are</div><div id="00:25:28.840" class="transcript_line"> already there, you know what I&#039;m saying, like for instance, I used to go into the cafe where</div><div id="00:25:32.840" class="transcript_line"> we used to go for years and sit down, have a laugh and joke, play music in the back room,</div><div id="00:25:37.840" class="transcript_line"> all that stuff, because certain people start turning up, you know, I mean, so I left, you</div><div id="00:25:44.840" class="transcript_line"> know, you could see, well, I could, I could see what direction it was going, and once</div><div id="00:25:49.840" class="transcript_line"> I came to live in Cardiff and that, there&#039;s a few people I&#039;d known back then who died,</div><div id="00:25:55.840" class="transcript_line"> who got killed, who was doing life and doing a lot of jail time because of certain things</div><div id="00:26:03.840" class="transcript_line"> that happened in their lives, you know, and you know, and that&#039;s how it was that time</div><div id="00:26:08.840" class="transcript_line"> when I left to come to Cardiff, because I&#039;m thinking, you know, I didn&#039;t have a profession,</div><div id="00:26:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m living just on the main and where am I going to go, you know what I&#039;m saying,</div><div id="00:26:21.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like, and I don&#039;t want to go to jail, I hate that place, you get me, so I thought,</div><div id="00:26:26.840" class="transcript_line"> my friend, you know, I had a friend who was a builder doing plaster and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:26:34.840" class="transcript_line"> and I used to work with him from time to time, you know, and the reason I, in Newport, they</div><div id="00:26:40.840" class="transcript_line"> were building a new estate, what&#039;s it called, anyway, they&#039;re building this new estate</div><div id="00:26:49.840" class="transcript_line"> and he had a job there working in some of the houses and, you know, did plastering,</div><div id="00:26:54.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I used to come up with them and that&#039;s how it goes, you make a few young</div><div id="00:27:00.840" class="transcript_line"> ladies at the time, oh, come and stay with us, you don&#039;t have to go back to Brom, you</div><div id="00:27:04.840" class="transcript_line"> know, and stuff like that, and you know, and you start linking people, I used to come to</div><div id="00:27:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff and, of course, Newport, see, you would not believe, I reckon there&#039;s more</div><div id="00:27:12.840" class="transcript_line"> black people at that time living in Newport than there were in Cardiff, you know, the</div><div id="00:27:17.840" class="transcript_line"> real genuine West Indian, because if you go to Newport now, there are, well, I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:27:21.840" class="transcript_line"> about now, but then there was quite a few West Indian, really, proper West Indian you</div><div id="00:27:29.840" class="transcript_line"> could deal with, there used to be a food shop there, there used to be a lady there, there</div><div id="00:27:34.840" class="transcript_line"> used to be a cafe called Silver Sands, which was like very popular, you know, food shop</div><div id="00:27:40.840" class="transcript_line"> upstairs, dance underneath, you know, and it was people from Bristol, they all used</div><div id="00:27:47.840" class="transcript_line"> to go there, you know, you cannot believe, right in the middle of Newport in Pyle, you</div><div id="00:27:51.840" class="transcript_line"> know, and that&#039;s, you know, and it was a regular thing to do, so we&#039;re going this weekend,</div><div id="00:27:56.840" class="transcript_line"> oh, we&#039;re going down to Newport, man, the Pyle thing is kicking, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:27:59.840" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s a lot of girls from Cardiff used to go down there, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:28:03.840" class="transcript_line"> because, you know, to be honest with you, the girls that were living in Cardiff at</div><div id="00:28:08.840" class="transcript_line"> that time, they weren&#039;t interested in the Cardiff men, because they were kind of slow,</div><div id="00:28:12.840" class="transcript_line"> they weren&#039;t up to date, you know, Glaston, he&#039;s saying everything is good, you know,</div><div id="00:28:19.840" class="transcript_line"> we kind of opened their eyes, really, when it comes to entertainment and music-wise,</div><div id="00:28:23.840" class="transcript_line"> because they had the Casablanca, but the Casablanca was entertained by outsiders, you know,</div><div id="00:28:29.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s our sound system from Birmingham, from London, Bristol, so you get a lot of influx,</div><div id="00:28:35.840" class="transcript_line"> especially this time of the year, you know, coming from all over, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:28:40.840" class="transcript_line"> and having loads of babies and gone, you know what I mean, and so when I come, and I, you</div><div id="00:28:47.840" class="transcript_line"> know, I stayed on and stayed on, even myself, I got caught up, because I had a girl, my</div><div id="00:28:52.840" class="transcript_line"> son, mother, and that&#039;s how we linked up, because we used to go out, because we were</div><div id="00:28:56.840" class="transcript_line"> like modern day roads, but in a good way, you know, trouble a lot of girls, don&#039;t be</div><div id="00:29:03.840" class="transcript_line"> so honest, you know, so I came and I thought, when my son was born, I think, sheesh, I&#039;m</div><div id="00:29:09.840" class="transcript_line"> going to do it myself now, you know what I mean, 90% of the men I know who had kids,</div><div id="00:29:14.840" class="transcript_line"> they took us back to their own community and do what they do, you know, but I didn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:29:18.840" class="transcript_line"> any ties of anything, I had no other kid, and he would have been, he was my first, you</div><div id="00:29:24.840" class="transcript_line"> know, so I stick around, and I thought, I&#039;m getting older, I have to be doing something,</div><div id="00:29:31.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and that&#039;s when I told you I went to see this guy in NACRO, right, NACRO, I</div><div id="00:29:37.840" class="transcript_line"> think, what the hell, he sounds black, you know, NACRO, but it was an agency for people</div><div id="00:29:44.840" class="transcript_line"> who had been inside and they&#039;re trying to, you know, reestablish themselves back in the</div><div id="00:29:52.840" class="transcript_line"> community, but I didn&#039;t know that, and I went to see them, and he told me about, he</div><div id="00:30:00.840" class="transcript_line"> said, he only asked me what I can do, I didn&#039;t have a profession, I said, I can do anything,</div><div id="00:30:04.840" class="transcript_line"> man, I&#039;m a sporting man, he said, yeah, you do sports here, took me up to Pentium, and</div><div id="00:30:10.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s, didn&#039;t go long ago, that was back from 1982 or something, and he just dropped me</div><div id="00:30:18.840" class="transcript_line"> off, I met this lady, she was the, what you would call them now at the time, she wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:30:26.840" class="transcript_line"> the education officer, she was the youth officer at the time, because they had two back then,</div><div id="00:30:31.840" class="transcript_line"> they had their education and they had the youth, and she was the youth, so her boss</div><div id="00:30:37.840" class="transcript_line"> was the education officer, so she said, oh yeah, come and have a job, part, you know,</div><div id="00:30:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and paid at the time, so I started doing it voluntarily, and I told you about, she got</div><div id="00:30:50.840" class="transcript_line"> me my first bank account, you know, which I still got now, worked up in Pentium for</div><div id="00:30:57.840" class="transcript_line"> about 10 years, working with young people, doing travel, and that&#039;s where I began to</div><div id="00:31:02.840" class="transcript_line"> think, oh man, I love this, you know, because I&#039;m doing things now which I&#039;ve never done</div><div id="00:31:06.840" class="transcript_line"> before, you know, I mean, which I would not have done if I had still been living in Birmingham,</div><div id="00:31:11.840" class="transcript_line"> even though I didn&#039;t go to college, but they helped me with the youth and coming to courses,</div><div id="00:31:15.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, just got to County Hall every Wednesday, and I got through that, and I&#039;ve done the</div><div id="00:31:22.840" class="transcript_line"> outreach up in the Breckhens and stuff like that, you know, and that&#039;s how it&#039;s been,</div><div id="00:31:27.840" class="transcript_line"> that, you know, working from one centre to the next, just doing the things which I enjoy</div><div id="00:31:34.840" class="transcript_line"> doing, which was the sports side of it all, you know, I mean, I wasn&#039;t very good with</div><div id="00:31:38.840" class="transcript_line"> the paperwork, you know, I never bothered with that, so that&#039;s what I&#039;m saying, the</div><div id="00:31:43.840" class="transcript_line"> thing I regret is not to pursue some kind of education, you know, because I can read,</div><div id="00:31:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I read, I read, I read anything, you know, reading is not a problem, it&#039;s my writing</div><div id="00:31:57.840" class="transcript_line"> is a problem, and tell you why, I used to work, and I think, I know everything, I look</div><div id="00:32:04.840" class="transcript_line"> at everything, I can read it, and I understand it, but I cannot put it down on paper, in</div><div id="00:32:10.840" class="transcript_line"> sentences, so I&#039;m working, I&#039;m doing an after school club over in, when I worked in Cardiff</div><div id="00:32:16.840" class="transcript_line"> High, I used to do Cardiff High lunch club, and I used to do after school club, I used</div><div id="00:32:23.840" class="transcript_line"> to pick the kids up from Redepenn High School, I mean, these are just babies, you know what</div><div id="00:32:30.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m saying, look at me, black man from nowhere, walking with doctors and whoever children</div><div id="00:32:35.840" class="transcript_line"> they are, you know, grabbing their bags, but I was loving it, you know, and so I went back</div><div id="00:32:43.840" class="transcript_line"> up one day, because I used to go there for three o&#039;clock, right, because I used to</div><div id="00:32:49.840" class="transcript_line"> work, I used to do some cleaning job down in Cardiff Bay, because it was just been</div><div id="00:32:56.840" class="transcript_line"> building a new cinema complex down there, and I&#039;m thinking, shit, I have a choice,</div><div id="00:33:02.840" class="transcript_line"> go back to Berlin, just try and do something, so when my son was born, and I decided to</div><div id="00:33:09.840" class="transcript_line"> get a job, you know, so I&#039;m going down there, actually, there used to be an agent&#039;s and</div><div id="00:33:15.840" class="transcript_line"> city road agency, right, and I used to go to the local shop there, it was a coloured</div><div id="00:33:21.840" class="transcript_line"> guy, I can&#039;t remember his name, but I used to be friendly with him, you know, so I used</div><div id="00:33:27.840" class="transcript_line"> to go in, I said, hey, what&#039;s going on, I see loads of people coming in there, right,</div><div id="00:33:31.840" class="transcript_line"> he says, do you want a job? I said, yeah, I said, I don&#039;t want it too far, because I</div><div id="00:33:36.840" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t got a car, right, so he set me up, he got me a job down in the bay, just doing</div><div id="00:33:41.840" class="transcript_line"> basic cleaning in the cinema, you know, so you got to be there at six o&#039;clock, you know,</div><div id="00:33:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I said, no problem, I cycle down there, used to do that, and when my second daughter, Sophie,</div><div id="00:33:50.840" class="transcript_line"> was born, she used to live around the corner, I used to zoom, zoom, zoom, cycle down there,</div><div id="00:33:57.840" class="transcript_line"> get back up, come on for a couple of hours, then I had to go to Riddipennine, got to</div><div id="00:34:05.840" class="transcript_line"> be there for three o&#039;clock, pick the kids up and that, and then from there, six thirty,</div><div id="00:34:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to cycle to Pentwin, up to the Dome to do euphoric then, you know, so it&#039;s like</div><div id="00:34:18.840" class="transcript_line"> three days a week, it&#039;s like that&#039;s Riddipennine, you know, back and forth, you know, and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:25.840" class="transcript_line"> how life, that&#039;s how it&#039;s been, and so I went to pick a kid up one day, he had to do, stay</div><div id="00:34:33.840" class="transcript_line"> over and do some extra work, so I got to the school now and I&#039;m speaking to the teacher,</div><div id="00:34:39.840" class="transcript_line"> she says, oh, the reason why Rachel, she&#039;s got dyslexia, I said, what the hell is that?</div><div id="00:34:47.840" class="transcript_line"> And then she started to tell me what it is, I&#039;m thinking, maybe that&#039;s what I&#039;ve got,</div><div id="00:34:53.840" class="transcript_line"> because I go to, because when I started first with the euphoric, right, this was the friary,</div><div id="00:34:58.840" class="transcript_line"> the old friary, right, I put myself on a course there to improve my writing skills or whatever,</div><div id="00:35:07.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, I did that and I&#039;m like, I did it for about four months, man, and I just could not</div><div id="00:35:13.840" class="transcript_line"> get my writing together, you know, even though I know what I want to write, but I just could not</div><div id="00:35:18.840" class="transcript_line"> put it down on paper, so I thought, oh, look at this, I&#039;ll give up, I basically give up,</div><div id="00:35:24.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean, I basically, but I&#039;m saying, there is that thing out there, no one knew what</div><div id="00:35:30.840" class="transcript_line"> it is, even now, you know, you put that in the black community, they don&#039;t know what it is,</div><div id="00:35:35.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and those are the things which probably holding back a lot of black people, you know,</div><div id="00:35:39.840" class="transcript_line"> because, you know, even now, I&#039;m in Kiteiz and I can write and stuff like that, but I&#039;m scared,</div><div id="00:35:48.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, people might think you&#039;re a dobat and that, but it&#039;s not a case of being, it&#039;s all up there,</div><div id="00:35:53.840" class="transcript_line"> like I&#039;m telling you, I&#039;m going to write a book one day, because I&#039;ve got it up here, you know,</div><div id="00:35:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t forgotten nothing at all, you know, things I&#039;ve been through and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:36:01.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, but I want my kids to be, because, you know, they&#039;re hard work too, you know, when you go</div><div id="00:36:10.840" class="transcript_line"> and work with other people&#039;s children and you get the most respect and, you know, they&#039;re not</div><div id="00:36:15.840" class="transcript_line"> disrespectful at all, they&#039;re, you know, but my two daughters, I&#039;ve got two daughters and they don&#039;t</div><div id="00:36:21.840" class="transcript_line"> seem to get on, like Lassandra said, they&#039;re from different mothers, but I&#039;ve always been there,</div><div id="00:36:27.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, even though I don&#039;t really get on with the mothers anymore, because I&#039;ve been with Suna</div><div id="00:36:33.840" class="transcript_line"> for about over 15 years, you know, and it&#039;s her, we&#039;ve done a lot of things together, you know,</div><div id="00:36:40.840" class="transcript_line"> we do a lot of travelling, you know, I mean, the first time I went back to Jamaica, it was because of her,</div><div id="00:36:46.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, because she&#039;s been there prior and that, and, you know, she speaks, she knows how to deal with</div><div id="00:36:51.840" class="transcript_line"> all these holiday people and etc., you know, probably I wouldn&#039;t have learned to do that,</div><div id="00:36:55.840" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, and through that I learned to deal with all that, you know what I&#039;m saying, so,</div><div id="00:37:00.840" class="transcript_line"> for my children, they always, they come, she remembers their birthdays, she remembers,</div><div id="00:37:06.840" class="transcript_line"> so, it&#039;s Sophie&#039;s birthday or it&#039;s Alexia&#039;s birthday, she&#039;s got it all covered in that angle, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:37:13.840" class="transcript_line"> so, you know, it&#039;s just that they, you know, I want more from them, but then again, who knows,</div><div id="00:37:21.840" class="transcript_line"> my parents probably wanted more from me, but they&#039;re healthy, they&#039;re good health, you know,</div><div id="00:37:25.840" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m happy with that, you know, they&#039;re all out there doing their thing, they&#039;re working, they don&#039;t do drugs,</div><div id="00:37:33.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, so, altogether, I think Cardiff&#039;s been, you know, Wales has been good for me, from what I was,</div><div id="00:37:42.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, even though I didn&#039;t get into any trouble, you know, and stuff, but I&#039;m more involved with my family</div><div id="00:37:52.840" class="transcript_line"> now than I was when I was living there, even though they were closer, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:37:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, because I&#039;ve got three sisters, I can pick the phone up to any one of them at any time,</div><div id="00:38:03.840" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, they will be there, when I was living in Birmingham, I would never go near the house,</div><div id="00:38:08.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, the fact is, what my mother&#039;s going to say, you know, because to be honest, I was kind of scared of my mother,</div><div id="00:38:17.840" class="transcript_line"> and I think what it was, because I didn&#039;t bond with her when I was a kid, my grandparents was my mum,</div><div id="00:38:24.840" class="transcript_line"> my grandmother was my mother, you know, her mum around my life, you know, and grandfather came to England,</div><div id="00:38:31.840" class="transcript_line"> my mother, she had her own children, you know, there was nothing there to say,</div><div id="00:38:36.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember you and I was like two or three years old, because I don&#039;t, you know, I can&#039;t say I remember at all before I came to England,</div><div id="00:38:46.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what I&#039;m saying, I came here when like 14, 15, it&#039;s like this is the first time we&#039;ve met, you know,</div><div id="00:38:54.840" class="transcript_line"> so you can imagine it was hard to settle in the house, knowing I got two other brothers, which are half brothers,</div><div id="00:39:01.840" class="transcript_line"> and their father live in the house, you know, they don&#039;t think that, see, but they don&#039;t know what goes through your head,</div><div id="00:39:08.840" class="transcript_line"> because I can see, you can see, as a man, you come from the Caribbean as a youth, you&#039;re older than them, you know more than them,</div><div id="00:39:18.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and their father is there, they&#039;re like, they&#039;re these are my boys, you know, and you know, and that&#039;s how it is, you know,</div><div id="00:39:26.840" class="transcript_line"> so I think I got out at the right time for them to strive, and they did, you know, even on harsh circumstances,</div><div id="00:39:36.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, they all, one, two, three sisters, they all went to uni, got good jobs, paid work, married, settled down,</div><div id="00:39:46.840" class="transcript_line"> and they all live happily ever after down there now, and I can go visit whichever, you know, I mean, and the relationship is good,</div><div id="00:39:55.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, compared to what it was when I first came to England, and living in the West Midlands, I hated it, you know, at the time,</div><div id="00:40:05.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, at the time, you know, I hated it, you know, and I come to ways, you know, and like Glasson&#039;s saying,</div><div id="00:40:13.840" class="transcript_line"> I know there&#039;s a lot of prejudice, prejudice going on, but I find I get more prejudice from the black people than I do from the white people,</div><div id="00:40:19.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what I&#039;m saying, because I go into, going down there in Butown now, which I didn&#039;t grow up down there,</div><div id="00:40:27.840" class="transcript_line"> I go down there as an outsider, which they do, if you&#039;re not part of that community from, you don&#039;t get a bloody, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:40:36.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re very cautious, you know, you interfere with any other, you know, the girls, they&#039;re all someone trying to knock you back,</div><div id="00:40:43.840" class="transcript_line"> because of all that, you know, but keeping the blues, you know, they all used to come to the blues, you know, oh, oh, Brammy, they&#039;re, you know,</div><div id="00:40:50.840" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t like it, you know, so it&#039;s been a, you know, but I tend to keep out of that type of thing, you know, rather than get involved,</div><div id="00:41:01.840" class="transcript_line"> because I know you come down here, because we all do, we come down here and you see things looking quiet and everybody&#039;s happy,</div><div id="00:41:10.840" class="transcript_line"> you think, oh, we could do this, we could do this down here, but I do, I know a lot of people who&#039;ve done that and end up in jail,</div><div id="00:41:18.840" class="transcript_line"> come down here, get involved with certain things, I&#039;ll be like, hey, don&#039;t you be doing that, you know, it&#039;s easier, next thing you know,</div><div id="00:41:26.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re doing sentences and I&#039;ve got my friends, you know, who came down here, got involved with whatever they do and they end up in prison, you know,</div><div id="00:41:37.840" class="transcript_line"> I came down here, I&#039;ve been down here, what, God knows, about 40 years, near enough, I&#039;ve never been to jail, I&#039;ve been to court, you know,</div><div id="00:41:46.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah, I mean, you know it is, you know, women report you to police or, you know, just because you&#039;re telling them the right thing,</div><div id="00:41:55.840" class="transcript_line"> not because you&#039;re doing anything wrong, you know, you&#039;re telling them the right thing, you know, and they&#039;re like, I&#039;m not having that,</div><div id="00:42:01.840" class="transcript_line"> but down here, the policemen, they didn&#039;t know, they don&#039;t know much about black people, see, and that&#039;s the trouble with this, with Cardiff,</div><div id="00:42:11.840" class="transcript_line"> they do not know anything about Caribbean people, you know, they don&#039;t know how they tick, you know, it&#039;s like in the youth service,</div><div id="00:42:20.840" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t see many black youth leaders or shop workers, you know, like you&#039;d see in the West Midlands or anywhere else,</div><div id="00:42:30.840" class="transcript_line"> you go into any one of those like boots chemists or any one of those boutiques or footwear shops, you know,</div><div id="00:42:36.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s black guys working all over the place down here, you very rarely see them, I&#039;m thinking, is it because they&#039;re black,</div><div id="00:42:42.840" class="transcript_line"> is it because, you know, are they that stupid? But no, I think it&#039;s improving, you know, than from 10 years, 15 years ago,</div><div id="00:42:53.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, the racism thing is coming more to the fore and says, hey, there is racism out there, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:43:01.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of it out there, but no one take any note, it just comes natural to most people, you know, they say things to you and you&#039;re like,</div><div id="00:43:09.840" class="transcript_line"> oh, you&#039;re my friend, I&#039;m not racist towards you, you know what I mean, I said, mate, you racist to that lady there,</div><div id="00:43:16.840" class="transcript_line"> you racist to me, because you might not say the same thing to me, but you&#039;ll say to someone else about me, you get me,</div><div id="00:43:22.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s racism anyway, you know what I mean, you don&#039;t be, oh, you can be racist to that man there and not be racist to me,</div><div id="00:43:28.840" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re my friend, you know, so, you know, so it is, isn&#039;t it, you know, because I&#039;ve got three children anyway,</div><div id="00:43:38.840" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got any kids, any one son, he&#039;s a big man now, I don&#039;t even know, he was in Jamaica the last time,</div><div id="00:43:45.840" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;ve got three children, I&#039;ve got one son and two girls, and I&#039;ve got three grandchildren, four, three girls and one boy,</div><div id="00:43:58.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I see them all the time, you know, they&#039;re back and forth, you know, I go and visit them, you know,</div><div id="00:44:08.840" class="transcript_line"> so, and that&#039;s it, you know, racism don&#039;t, I don&#039;t ever think about it, it&#039;s only sometimes there&#039;s some people who say they&#039;re a little shocked with it,</div><div id="00:44:16.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, it&#039;s like, well, you still think that way, do you, you know what I mean, and stuff like that, but other than that,</div><div id="00:44:22.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, I wish, I just wish education was a thing I could handle, you know what I mean, you see, you know, because that&#039;s what&#039;s stopping black people,</div><div id="00:44:34.840" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where most of the racism comes in, because there&#039;s not enough space for everyone in Wales to climb the ladder, you know,</div><div id="00:44:41.840" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re very true, they&#039;re picking true so they want to, you know, I mean, I know, because I work in, since I work with Welsh speaking people,</div><div id="00:44:51.840" class="transcript_line"> and I work with like, kids in Cardiff High, you know, the rich kids in Cardiff High, they get priority, if you can donate, you know,</div><div id="00:45:04.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s all they operate, you donate and you&#039;re part of this, you know, you&#039;ll do anything for your kids to get them to graduate for uni, you know what I&#039;m saying,</div><div id="00:45:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I work in Glantaff, they don&#039;t care where you come from, you know, they&#039;ll help you, that&#039;s what from my perspective, because my daughter,</div><div id="00:45:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Sophie, she went to a Welsh school, you know, and she comes, she&#039;s brighter than the other two, you know what I&#039;m saying,</div><div id="00:45:35.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, she is, to be honest with you, she&#039;s brighter than the other two, you know, I work in Glantaff over there in the youth, in the youth club there,</div><div id="00:45:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I speak to so many different kids, mixed-race kids, kids from in the valleys, you know, and the only thing they don&#039;t like is that the fact they have to speak the language in school,</div><div id="00:45:56.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, when they&#039;re in school, they have to speak Welsh, but once they&#039;re outside, you don&#039;t have to, so when they come into the centre, we speak English,</div><div id="00:46:06.840" class="transcript_line"> most of, well they all do, but you know, and I think a lot of colour people, they&#039;ll send their kid to go there, they say, oh the Welsh is not good, they don&#039;t want to speak Welsh,</div><div id="00:46:15.840" class="transcript_line"> well I tell you what, you go to a Welsh school, you ten times get a better job than any other kids out there, you know, because they want these kids to be bilingual,</div><div id="00:46:25.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, they want them to speak the Welsh language, you know, do you speak Welsh?</div><div id="00:46:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you go, you know, they want them to speak the Welsh language, you know, it&#039;s like me, if I get rid of my patwa, who would I be?</div><div id="00:46:40.840" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean, you know, who would I be, you know what I&#039;m saying, you&#039;ve got to keep part of your culture, you know, you go to anywhere in the world,</div><div id="00:46:50.840" class="transcript_line"> you say, believe in Wales, do you speak the language? No, you know what I mean, but you have to, and that&#039;s why I respect the Welsh speaking people,</div><div id="00:47:04.840" class="transcript_line"> people might say they are this and that, but I know a few of them, and they&#039;re tough people, they&#039;ve got different way of thinking,</div><div id="00:47:14.840" class="transcript_line"> just to the other, you know what I mean, so, my friend, he lives in Splough, and you know, his father was the headmaster of Cotay&#039;s High School for years and years,</div><div id="00:47:28.840" class="transcript_line"> but they went to Welsh speaking school, you know, and most of those people, kids go to Welsh speaking school, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:47:36.840" class="transcript_line"> because I think they reckon their education is a little better standard than it is in the normal school, even though they say Cardiff High,</div><div id="00:47:44.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, but there&#039;s a lot of Asian in Cardiff High, because when I was there, and they are the brightest, you know what I&#039;m saying,</div><div id="00:47:52.840" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s a lot of resentment over there, because I worked there, and I, in the youth club, and I see the racism that, you know, the kids,</div><div id="00:48:02.840" class="transcript_line"> not from the school, because I don&#039;t deal with, I&#039;m dealing with the kids in the playground, you know, I could see their attitude to Asian,</div><div id="00:48:10.840" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;re not troublemakers, they&#039;re just cleverer than the rest of them, and that&#039;s all it is, you know, because Sue, her son, her grandson,</div><div id="00:48:18.840" class="transcript_line"> because she&#039;s got a daughter, Michelle, and her son is in Cardiff High, you know, and doing brilliantly, you know, he&#039;s doing robotics and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:48:29.840" class="transcript_line"> and just cause she&#039;s pushing, pushing, pushing, you know, and he&#039;s doing well there, you know, and a lot of the Asians do well there,</div><div id="00:48:37.840" class="transcript_line"> a lot of the African black kids that goes there do well, you know, so I wish I had done well in my time, who knows, I could have been a professor or something.</div><div id="00:48:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow, it&#039;s not too late to get into the university.</div><div id="00:48:50.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, you&#039;re a professor, right?</div><div id="00:48:52.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re a professor.</div><div id="00:48:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s good to know.</div><div id="00:48:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Can I take you back for a second? I really wanted to know, what, what did your mother do? Did she do the same thing in Jamaica that she did,</div><div id="00:49:03.840" class="transcript_line"> I know you didn&#039;t know her in Jamaica, you knew her only when she was in England.</div><div id="00:49:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, apparently, apparently, she was going to a, is it a teacher&#039;s nursing college? Because I think one of my aunties went to that college,</div><div id="00:49:13.840" class="transcript_line"> she was going to a nursing thing, you know, and I think that&#039;s the reason she came here so early in her life,</div><div id="00:49:18.840" class="transcript_line"> because the idea is come to England and finish her studies, you can be a proper midwife or something like that.</div><div id="00:49:24.840" class="transcript_line"> What year did she come with you?</div><div id="00:49:26.840" class="transcript_line"> She came in the 50s, just after, 59, I think.</div><div id="00:49:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And how long after?</div><div id="00:49:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Because I was born in 54, you know what I mean? So you can imagine, she left me when I was like a toddler, you know?</div><div id="00:49:42.840" class="transcript_line"> So I came here in, I think about 1968, 68, 69, because I remember when I came here, the first year Manchester United won the European Championship,</div><div id="00:49:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it was about 1968, because I remember watching that on the black and white TV, you know, because that&#039;s what we had, you know, I remember then.</div><div id="00:50:07.840" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was about 1968 I came here, yes, or late, 60, 67, you know?</div><div id="00:50:18.840" class="transcript_line"> But I do remember, I was in Jamaica when England won the World Cup, which was not, that&#039;s when Glaston came here, but I was still in Jamaica then,</div><div id="00:50:28.840" class="transcript_line"> because Glaston came when I was 10, I came when I, because I think I had one year left in school before when I came,</div><div id="00:50:37.840" class="transcript_line"> because when they say you could come to England and bring your kids with you, I think the cutting-edge point was 15, because I leave school at 15,</div><div id="00:50:51.840" class="transcript_line"> so I had to come to England before I was 15 years of age, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t have been able to until I was 18 or something like that,</div><div id="00:51:01.840" class="transcript_line"> so that&#039;s where I think they got mixed up, because I could remember my auntie used to take me on the truck to go to Kingston, you know?</div><div id="00:51:14.840" class="transcript_line"> So she could sort the paperwork out, because hell of a lot of trouble in there just to get the papers you require to come to England as a kid,</div><div id="00:51:23.840" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what killed you, you&#039;re thinking, shit man, they don&#039;t know how the trouble we&#039;ve gone through to get here, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:51:29.840" class="transcript_line"> And they turn around, they think, oh yeah, you jump on one of those boats coming from France,</div><div id="00:51:35.840" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t walk from the Caribbean to England, you can&#039;t, there&#039;s no way, you&#039;re talking thousands of miles, you know?</div><div id="00:51:44.840" class="transcript_line"> So, it&#039;s been awesome man, Jesus.</div><div id="00:51:48.840" class="transcript_line"> You remember the journey?</div><div id="00:51:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember when my auntie put me on the plane, like I said, I remember we staying off in New York,</div><div id="00:51:57.840" class="transcript_line"> I was stuck off in New York, but the fact is, when I got to London, I thought there was someone going to come and get me from there,</div><div id="00:52:04.840" class="transcript_line"> so they just stuck me in a room all day, I think I must have been there for about 6, 7 hours in this one room, all by myself,</div><div id="00:52:13.840" class="transcript_line"> I cry like a baby, because I&#039;m thinking, where&#039;s everyone, who&#039;s picking me up, you know?</div><div id="00:52:19.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only like about 6 o&#039;clock in the evening, they says, oh come, we&#039;re going now, I&#039;m like, where are we going, it&#039;s all going to burn in here,</div><div id="00:52:26.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, my senior, I think I am in Birmingham, you know, so they flew us from London to Birmingham,</div><div id="00:52:31.840" class="transcript_line"> so I actually got two planes to get here, you know, so, and that&#039;s where my mum and my stepdad picked us up from,</div><div id="00:52:39.840" class="transcript_line"> I can remember they picked us up in the Zephyr 6, you know, those Zephyrs, I don&#039;t know, big, you know, because he liked the caruban,</div><div id="00:52:48.840" class="transcript_line"> he was quite a poser, you know, he was, yeah, he picked us up in the Zephyr, he was pitch black then, you know, I mean, the day is gone,</div><div id="00:52:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I could see his white stuff, because there was snow on the ground, you know, got me back to Dudley Road, man,</div><div id="00:53:06.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a fireplace there, I&#039;m just cold, cold, cold, cold, I was cold for 6 months, really, I end up, I get in,</div><div id="00:53:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I end up with all these football scars rather than anything else, you know, these are not, you know, but I had chill blame,</div><div id="00:53:26.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what chill blame is, I had that when I was a kid, because I used to be sat in front of the fire like that every time my mum turned her back,</div><div id="00:53:33.840" class="transcript_line"> you know what I mean, because otherwise, let the heat spread, but it was only two frigging bars, you know what I mean, let the heat spread,</div><div id="00:53:41.840" class="transcript_line"> but, and they only would light the fire on the weekend, because we had a fire thing, coke, coke fire, it wasn&#039;t even coal, it was coke,</div><div id="00:53:50.840" class="transcript_line"> the cheapest stuff, but it used to burn hot, but quicker than the normal coal, it doesn&#039;t give off as much smoke,</div><div id="00:53:58.840" class="transcript_line"> so when she used to order coke, big bloody lorry used to turn up, emptied a lot of it in the front yard,</div><div id="00:54:07.840" class="transcript_line"> so well, I have to shovel it down the cellar, because the cellar is the coldest cellar in history, believe you, me, you go down the cellar,</div><div id="00:54:16.840" class="transcript_line"> then you freeze, I swear to God, you open the door, you go, it&#039;s frozen, it was a cold cellar, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:54:25.840" class="transcript_line"> but no other one go down there, because I was the eldest, I had to go and get the coal, I was like, Jesus Christ, you knocked down that cellar there,</div><div id="00:54:33.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah man, because on top of the cellar, you have the front room, you know, black people, the front room, you don&#039;t use it,</div><div id="00:54:42.840" class="transcript_line"> you only use that for when relatives or friends come, you know, you&#039;ve got to heat it up for about a week before it gets hot,</div><div id="00:54:50.840" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re so cold, because it&#039;s rotting in the cellar, yeah, so it&#039;s a turn it, and that&#039;s the only place they had electric heater,</div><div id="00:54:58.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the only room, there was electric heater in the front room, you know what I mean, I said turn the heater on in the front room,</div><div id="00:55:05.840" class="transcript_line"> leave it on for about a week, because the aunties come from London, or somebody&#039;s coming to spend a day or two,</div><div id="00:55:13.840" class="transcript_line"> so you get to get in the front room, you get to get the cockerels out, yeah, madness man,</div><div id="00:55:22.840" class="transcript_line"> so you know, within that period of time, I learned to cook, so therefore I was quite independent, from back home up until then,</div><div id="00:55:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I was independent, you know what I mean, so I didn&#039;t have, no one could have, well most of the girlfriend, I had a teacher,</div><div id="00:55:41.840" class="transcript_line"> most of the girls, in terms of domesticating themselves and cooking, and you know, I mean so that&#039;s how it was,</div><div id="00:55:50.840" class="transcript_line"> because all my girls I&#039;ve been at within Wales, half of them didn&#039;t know nothing, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:55:57.840" class="transcript_line"> so you know, that&#039;s how it was, I&#039;m teaching them from when I was a kid, you know, so yeah, my mother, she was a,</div><div id="00:56:07.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, she used to show me how to season the meat and the chicken, how to brown the chicken and you know, stuff like that,</div><div id="00:56:15.840" class="transcript_line"> how to cook the peas before you put the rice in and you know, all them type of stuff, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:56:20.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been doing this since I was a kid, you know what I mean, because I used to have to cook, yeah, I used to have to cook for my younger siblings,</div><div id="00:56:27.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, because they&#039;re at work, you know what I mean, she used to peel the potato before she goes to work, right,</div><div id="00:56:33.840" class="transcript_line"> and the school I went to, which is like, it&#039;s called Tivydale Comprehensive, right, it was about five minutes away, right,</div><div id="00:56:42.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to leave the potatoes, she says, you got to come home and peel the potatoes,</div><div id="00:56:48.840" class="transcript_line"> so when everyone is running around at lunchtime, I had to run home and peel the potatoes,</div><div id="00:56:55.840" class="transcript_line"> so when she comes home, she can cook, she can start the cooking, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:57:00.840" class="transcript_line"> so when the kids come home, they can, you know, stuff like that, you know, Sunday, I have to season the meat and you know what I mean, yeah,</div><div id="00:57:09.840" class="transcript_line"> because she used to have me walking behind her with her trolley, man, used to go to West Bromwich,</div><div id="00:57:15.840" class="transcript_line"> go to West Bromwich, I used to support the Albion, right, every Saturday morning, used to go to Dudley, right,</div><div id="00:57:21.840" class="transcript_line"> and she used to stop and talk to everyone, and Lenny Henry&#039;s mother, which she knew,</div><div id="00:57:28.840" class="transcript_line"> they used to stop in the Dudley town, they used to have a market, right, right in the middle of the town,</div><div id="00:57:36.840" class="transcript_line"> they sell West Indian food and you know, unless we were all the black people, used to congregate on Saturday morning,</div><div id="00:57:43.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I used to be there standing over there in the corner with her trolley, waiting for her to finish talking,</div><div id="00:57:49.840" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t get involved in their discussion, you know what I mean, and she&#039;s like, how is Lenny doing, you know what I mean,</div><div id="00:57:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Lenny, Lenny was making a name for himself and all that, so every half an hour I&#039;d freeze my nuts off,</div><div id="00:58:01.840" class="transcript_line"> like, you know what I mean, it&#039;s like, come on, what you can&#039;t shout, so, oh my God, so anyway,</div><div id="00:58:08.840" class="transcript_line"> and she used to catch the bus then and goes to West Bromwich to pick the meat up from a different place,</div><div id="00:58:13.840" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s going to buy meat around the corner, but she got this special man who does the meat, you know,</div><div id="00:58:19.840" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;ll catch, just come, we&#039;re going to West Bromwich, she&#039;s like, what for, we&#039;ve got to get the meat,</div><div id="00:58:23.840" class="transcript_line"> and you know, I&#039;m like, God, here we go, off we go, on the bus to West Brom,</div><div id="00:58:29.840" class="transcript_line"> and by this time there&#039;s a lot of football supporters who&#039;s coming out of Dudley going to the football match,</div><div id="00:58:35.840" class="transcript_line"> but the football match is not until three o&#039;clock, and these guys are catching the bus like one, two o&#039;clock, I&#039;m thinking,</div><div id="00:58:40.840" class="transcript_line"> so one Saturday morning she said to me, I want you to go to West Bromwich, she ordered the meat,</div><div id="00:58:45.840" class="transcript_line"> because she works in West Bromwich in the hospital, so she ordered the meat from the guy to be picked up on the Saturday morning,</div><div id="00:58:52.840" class="transcript_line"> so she said, go get the meat, you know, give me a bus fare and stuff to catch a bus to West Brom,</div><div id="00:59:00.840" class="transcript_line"> so I went, jumped on the bus, and it was all these full of football supporters, so I&#039;m thinking in my head,</div><div id="00:59:06.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to a football match, never been to a football match yet, so I think I&#039;m going to a football match, innit,</div><div id="00:59:11.840" class="transcript_line"> so I start following the crowd, yeah, I&#039;m following the crowd innit, and I got there and I got off the bus,</div><div id="00:59:20.840" class="transcript_line"> the crowd disappeared, you know, all the people on the bus, they just disappeared, and I stood by myself outside the football ground,</div><div id="00:59:29.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like, shit, what am I going to do, I had money to pay, so I walked around, and I walk around one entrance,</div><div id="00:59:38.840" class="transcript_line"> and I see people going into this entrance, so I thought, I&#039;ll go with this lot innit,</div><div id="00:59:44.840" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;m walking up now, the guy said to me, you&#039;re never the security guy, what team you play for man, he goes, what team you play for,</div><div id="00:59:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like, what, I said I&#039;m trying to get into the ground, and it&#039;s a good job, it was a black guy, well mixed race guy,</div><div id="01:00:02.840" class="transcript_line"> and he said, just go back there and go through there, so he let me in, so I walk along the terrace now,</div><div id="01:00:10.840" class="transcript_line"> the match haven&#039;t even started yet, so I walk along the terrace, and I go to the end,</div><div id="01:00:15.840" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re the West Brom and Jalberts supporters, I&#039;m standing there, I&#039;m trying to look for these guys now,</div><div id="01:00:20.840" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t see any, they&#039;re all white guys, you know what I mean, they&#039;re full of white, I&#039;m like, shit, so I stood behind the goals,</div><div id="01:00:28.840" class="transcript_line"> I never forget, it was Crystal Palace v West Brom and Jalberts, it was a FA Cup, it was a big match too, it was a FA Cup semi-final,</div><div id="01:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> and so I stood behind the goal, I seen three brilliant headed goals that day, a guy called Jeff Astle,</div><div id="01:00:44.840" class="transcript_line"> he was the star of the West Brom and Jalberts football team, he scored a fantastic headed hat-trick,</div><div id="01:00:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I stood right there and watched, so I started to support the Albion then, because when I was in Jamaica,</div><div id="01:00:59.840" class="transcript_line"> you hear about teams, and I used to support West Ham, and when I came to England, I found out West Ham is in London,</div><div id="01:01:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like, bloody hell, that&#039;s a farce, because they had World Cup players, see, they had Bobby Moore, they had the Jeffers,</div><div id="01:01:11.840" class="transcript_line"> and the people who actually played in the World Cup, so I want to be supporting a team which has got a name,</div><div id="01:01:18.840" class="transcript_line"> but I didn&#039;t know you had Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Brom and Jalberts, all in the vicinity of about 20 miles around Birmingham,</div><div id="01:01:28.840" class="transcript_line"> so I started to go to the Albion there, and then when I moved to Wolverhampton, I started going to the Maldives,</div><div id="01:01:37.840" class="transcript_line"> which is Wolverhampton Wanderers, and I supported them for a few years because my friend, Ralphie, a black guy I met when I went to live there,</div><div id="01:01:45.840" class="transcript_line"> he was very close to some of their players, so he introduced me to players like John Richards, Derek Dugan,</div><div id="01:01:52.840" class="transcript_line"> these are all famous footballers, and that&#039;s how close he could have got to these guys back then,</div><div id="01:01:58.840" class="transcript_line"> because they always used to do train and gamble, they always be in the band office, and they used to slip you a fiver there,</div><div id="01:02:06.840" class="transcript_line"> have a go, try, you know, and stuff like that, and Ralphie, he knew all this, so he was close to them,</div><div id="01:02:13.840" class="transcript_line"> and yeah, that&#039;s how it was, football was like, yeah man, and it continues, his life, it was,</div><div id="01:02:23.840" class="transcript_line"> but yet, in all that, it&#039;s only the one period of racism I encountered when I was in Wolverhampton,</div><div id="01:02:32.840" class="transcript_line"> and it wasn&#039;t people from Wolverhampton, these people are from, they were Jardis, they were from Newcastle,</div><div id="01:02:40.840" class="transcript_line"> other than that I never encountered, I was in a little gang called the Templar Street Mafia,</div><div id="01:02:49.840" class="transcript_line"> which, you know, you&#039;ve got to be part of something, you know, so as we were uptown boys, we used to go uptown,</div><div id="01:02:55.840" class="transcript_line"> and they had a little gang called the Templar Street Mafia, because Templar Street is where the Express and Star paper used to be,</div><div id="01:03:05.840" class="transcript_line"> and they used to have a little area where they used to stand around, you know, hang around, like something,</div><div id="01:03:13.840" class="transcript_line"> and they called themselves Templar Street Mafia, but it was all a mixture of black guys and white guys, Asian guys, you know,</div><div id="01:03:20.840" class="transcript_line"> and yeah, I met a guy, he was kind of my best, Krishna his name was, he was Sri Lankan, first Sri Lankan I ever made, you know,</div><div id="01:03:31.840" class="transcript_line"> that guy, he was a top top man, you know, everyone loved Krishna, you know, I think because he was rich,</div><div id="01:03:38.840" class="transcript_line"> because he was

class="transcript_line"> you know, I cycled down it as well, you know what I&#039;m saying, that&#039;s what I want to do, do things which I didn&#039;t get to do as a kid, you know,</div><div id="01:06:09.840" class="transcript_line"> when I was a kid, this would be a thing called Roaring River, right, and Roaring River was near to the school I went to, right, and you know, and I&#039;ve never been to Roaring River,</div><div id="01:06:24.840" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where, it&#039;s a raster community, right, where they do farming and, you know, gardens, beautiful, but as a kid, it wouldn&#039;t be like that, and they had a cave there as well,</div><div id="01:06:40.840" class="transcript_line"> never been in a cave, you know, so I said, yeah, I want to go to Roaring River, man, I go there, oh my God, my heart melted, you know what I mean, this is next door to where I grew up and born,</div><div id="01:06:51.840" class="transcript_line"> I had never been there, like 50 years later, you know what I&#039;m saying, it&#039;s like, it turns your head in, you know, yeah, man, and that&#039;s what I like to do when I go back, you know what I mean,</div><div id="01:07:03.840" class="transcript_line"> and the people, you know, they&#039;re there, they don&#039;t live there, but it&#039;s a very tourist place now, you know what I mean, you can go there, you can book a day to go there, have a meal, you know, play drums,</div><div id="01:07:16.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a proper raster camp, you know what I mean, proper documented and everything, you know, they&#039;ve got brochures where people can go and visit and stuff like that,</div><div id="01:07:26.840" class="transcript_line"> but, and that was just on the road from where I grew up, but I never knew anything about it, you know, so I thought, yeah, I&#039;ll go back and see that, you know, because you can talk about it, you know, I could remember you said,</div><div id="01:07:40.840" class="transcript_line"> because what it was, you know, sugar cane is, in Jamaica at one point, it was the biggest island for cane, when the British was controlling things there, they plant sugar cane everywhere, you know what I mean, so there was a lot of sugar cane,</div><div id="01:07:57.840" class="transcript_line"> so there was a place, they call it the Heist, right, there&#039;s a, used to be a sugar cane factory, it&#039;s on this place called Froum, and Froum, Froum was the biggest sugar cane, what do you call?</div><div id="01:08:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Plantation?</div><div id="01:08:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but where you take the cane to be turned into rum.</div><div id="01:08:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Industrial?</div><div id="01:08:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, industrial factory, right, you take it there, so what they do, they have a place called the Heist, if people want to sell the cane, they don&#039;t take it direct there, they take it to the Heist, have it weighed, and you get paid there, and then the train comes along, you put it on there, and they put it on a train, and they take it to the factory, so they could pulp it into, you know,</div><div id="01:08:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and we used to have the trucks, like the tractors, pulling the canes out, you know what I mean, and they&#039;d be guys on the top, because they don&#039;t want, they want the weight, you know what I mean, they&#039;d probably hit you as well, you know what I mean, so you&#039;d pull the cane out, the big one, but until you get to the Heist, but I&#039;ve never been further than the Heist as a kid, and all that was behind me, all the Ruhran River and all down there, was all down behind the Heist, but I&#039;d never been there, like you know, the furthest I got was up to the Heist,</div><div id="01:09:13.840" class="transcript_line"> because what, we were only kids then, you know, so I tried to go back there and I find out, you know, it&#039;s like a new world, man, got this Ruhran River place, man, it&#039;s beautiful, I don&#039;t have a photograph,

talking?</div><div id="01:09:36.840" class="transcript_line"> No, you can have a look at that, so in terms of your identity, you feel Jamaican, you don&#039;t feel British?</div><div id="01:09:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Nah, I feel more Welsh than British to be honest, because I lived here longer than I lived in England, you know, so, kids are Welsh, you know what I&#039;m saying, so Welsh is like my second home, isn&#039;t it, you know,</div><div id="01:09:59.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I go to England, I&#039;ve, nothing changed in Britain, man, too much people, that&#039;s
