I do send emails to a few of them as well</div><div id="00:00:20.960" class="transcript_line"> because I got friends over in the state. Yeah, that&#039;s a good way to kind of...</div><div id="00:00:26.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s easier than that. It was a way of FaceTime isn&#039;t it? Yeah. A version sort of.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There is, but we used to just write emails up, we used to write songs out to an email and all</div><div id="00:00:37.760" class="transcript_line"> and just send them back and forth.
