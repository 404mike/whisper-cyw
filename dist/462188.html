    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was highly indignant at the idea of flooding the whole area.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I didn&#039;t protest or anything like that, but I happened to be up in that area when this was mooted,</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was very indignant. And I could quite see why people objected as they did.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think this part of the world was aware of it for a long time,</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> because although we saw it on television, unless you happen to know something about Truberin or the area,</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> as I did, you weren&#039;t all that interested. It wasn&#039;t until it actually happened,</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> but it struck you, you know, what nerve, they had to sort of flood the place.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But there has been over the years so much of the area has been flooded.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, if you go around South Wales, you find massive areas that have flooded.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t have to go up to Truberin. But I suppose the idea...</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Another area that upset us here more possibly than Truberin was the Eppint business.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Eppint was a nasty thing. We didn&#039;t like Eppint at all. It was near home.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t think even there... It wasn&#039;t until we saw it on television that the horror of it struck home.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That is where television has this impact. It is immediate, and you can see it at once.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas if it&#039;s on the radio, it&#039;s as though it&#039;s second... you know, there&#039;s that much away from you.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But Eppint, you saw not much, but you did see and you were aware.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But Truberin really hit home because they made a big thing of Truberin.</div></div></p>
