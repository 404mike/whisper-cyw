    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go down to the Celtic deep in the late 80s, early 90s, and no one else was,</div><div id="00:00:07.200" class="transcript_line"> you know, just a few fishing boats were out there. And we saw a lot of sharks,</div><div id="00:00:11.680" class="transcript_line"> we saw a lot of common dolphins, we saw some, I remember one day seeing a massive</div><div id="00:00:17.920" class="transcript_line"> breach of some animal, but we never actually got to it. Something</div><div id="00:00:22.480" class="transcript_line"> possibly like a, you know, a humpback breaching. It was a big animal breached, a long, but it was</div><div id="00:00:29.200" class="transcript_line"> in the far distance. I almost had his name, and his name used to come regularly where there&#039;s been</div><div id="00:00:38.560" class="transcript_line"> groups. And we were all sitting all over the Sault Lair, we&#039;d stopped for lunch, flat calm day,</div><div id="00:00:44.560" class="transcript_line"> and we were all sitting all over the wheelhouse of the Sault Lair and all that, and we were all</div><div id="00:00:50.720" class="transcript_line"> lounging around on the front of the boat. And just me and this guy saw it, and we were all sitting</div><div id="00:00:56.560" class="transcript_line"> chatting, and just suddenly went, did you see that? And he said, and he did, but nobody else on the</div><div id="00:01:01.360" class="transcript_line"> boat did. He said, yeah, I did, I did. And we steeped, jumped on the, you know, in the boat,</div><div id="00:01:07.040" class="transcript_line"> fired up, headed over, headed over, headed over. And before I think we really got to that area,</div><div id="00:01:11.840" class="transcript_line"> we bumped into some common dolphins, and so everybody was distracted.</div></div></p>
