    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald. I&#039;m in Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, as part of the Longest Yarn.</div><div id="00:00:06.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m speaking to Sian Bradshaw and she&#039;s going to tell me about her memories of her father&#039;s war service.</div><div id="00:00:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Sian.</div><div id="00:00:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Hi. My dad was called Thomas Kirkman Bradshaw and he was brought up in Chester, but he spent quite a lot of time in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:23.840" class="transcript_line"> He was recruited into the RAF towards the end of the war and went over to do his training and then much of the flying that they did in Australia and in Hong Kong and the bases there.</div><div id="00:00:41.120" class="transcript_line"> He spent most of the time that he was flying in places like Japan and other Far East countries.</div><div id="00:00:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, I can&#039;t remember the names of them all, but I know that on one occasion my dad was quite pleased because they&#039;d flown into one island, and I say I can&#039;t remember which it is, and they were the first allied troops to arrive or allied service people to arrive.</div><div id="00:01:07.560" class="transcript_line"> He says, so when they got out of their planes, they were all greeted by heroes, by apparently these gorgeous women who threw garlands of flowers around their necks and sort of hailed them as their conquering heroes who they loved.</div><div id="00:01:22.640" class="transcript_line"> But the unpleasant part about it was because it was towards the end of the war, most of what my father was doing, he was flying Wellington planes.</div><div id="00:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never heard of a Wellington plane before, and Dakotas, but they were, sadly, flying back the dead bodies of soldiers from the war, which he said was a really unpleasant task, A, loading them up, and then flying them back, he said, unfortunately, the smell was so bad that they had to have the windows on the plane open as they were flying because it was so unpleasant.</div><div id="00:02:00.240" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, that&#039;s what he is. I&#039;m trying to think of anything else, and I can&#039;t specifically think.</div><div id="00:02:08.240" class="transcript_line"> So after the war, did he carry on as a pilot? Did he become a private pilot?</div><div id="00:02:13.240" class="transcript_line"> No, he didn&#039;t. He left and became a civil servant, actually, so very far and removed from that in Liverpool, which is where he met and married my mum.</div><div id="00:02:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Which was bombed out, of course, Liverpool.</div><div id="00:02:27.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Liverpool.</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> No, your mum was.</div><div id="00:02:30.040" class="transcript_line"> My mum was, yeah, but that&#039;s another one. My mum was one evening was in a church, and they were in the basement of the church because there was a bombing raid going on in Liverpool.</div><div id="00:02:45.040" class="transcript_line"> They were singing, and they were very fortunate because they were rehearsing some singing, and the bombing completely destroyed the church, and the people in the other side of the church were all killed.</div><div id="00:02:57.640" class="transcript_line"> Mum and her friends in the choir were caught in the cellar, which was filling with water, and they were having to swim around and then hold themselves up.</div><div id="00:03:12.040" class="transcript_line"> And then very, very fortunately, before they drowned, they were all rescued. So, you know, that&#039;s quite an unpleasant thing to happen as well.</div><div id="00:03:21.040" class="transcript_line"> So did your mother tell you that story?</div><div id="00:03:23.440" class="transcript_line"> She did, and she always said, I mean, I&#039;m one of seven children, and all of us are very, very poor swimmers because my mum had this almost natural fear of water.</div><div id="00:03:36.440" class="transcript_line"> It must have been terrifying.</div><div id="00:03:40.440" class="transcript_line"> It did influence her, I think, a lot, yes, sadly.</div><div id="00:03:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Mum then was evacuated, along with a lot of her school friends, to Holywell.</div><div id="00:03:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Holywell, was it? Holywell?</div><div id="00:03:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Holywell, she was with another girl, was with a farming family who, you know, they had a lovely time with, and they were safe.</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> And then I think my grandma moved over as well so that she could be here.</div><div id="00:04:14.240" class="transcript_line"> And then mum and her brothers all went back with grandma.</div><div id="00:04:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it wasn&#039;t the easiest time for any of them, was it?</div><div id="00:04:23.640" class="transcript_line"> It was quite horrendous, really. I mean, I can&#039;t imagine what it must be like as a child to be taken away from your parents, to go and live with complete and utter strangers,</div><div id="00:04:34.640" class="transcript_line"> while you know that your parents are being bombed back home.</div><div id="00:04:37.640" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re in danger.</div><div id="00:04:39.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and never knowing whether you&#039;re going to see them again.</div><div id="00:04:42.640" class="transcript_line"> It must have been quite horrendous.</div><div id="00:04:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, child, very much. Thank you.</div></div></p>
