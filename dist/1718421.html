    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Abbey here is the place where I found my wife so that&#039;s always a nice reflection.</div><div id="00:00:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to be, well I used to go running lots at the time as well and I had been running around all</div><div id="00:00:16.320" class="transcript_line"> of the hills and the farms and I&#039;d met a number of characters and of course you don&#039;t realize at the</div><div id="00:00:22.080" class="transcript_line"> time when you join things together that I&#039;d already met Diana&#039;s father because I used to run over the</div><div id="00:00:28.800" class="transcript_line"> hill at Devanna and come through the farm yard there and I&#039;d met him on the hill driving an old</div><div id="00:00:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Ferguson and he is one of my fondest memories of the village to be honest just stopping and chatting</div><div id="00:00:44.160" class="transcript_line"> to such a friendly person as he and had the time of day for anybody and so I&#039;d already met her father</div><div id="00:00:53.600" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s a long story and I&#039;ll just give you the very short version how I met Diana</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> but I was driving down the road one day and I came up behind a little Peugeot 205 and I saw</div><div id="00:01:08.800" class="transcript_line"> in the the rear view mirror this beautiful pair of eyes and these big eyebrows and I just thought</div><div id="00:01:15.360" class="transcript_line"> wow I don&#039;t know who that is I&#039;ve never seen that car or that person before so as you do in the</div><div id="00:01:21.360" class="transcript_line"> village I popped into the happy union and I asked the person at the bar next to me who happened to</div><div id="00:01:27.920" class="transcript_line"> be Dai Llanon who&#039;s David Jones from Llanon and I said I&#039;ve seen this little car on the road and</div><div id="00:01:35.120" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t happen to know who owns it he said oh that&#039;s my cousin that is that&#039;s Diana from</div><div id="00:01:39.600" class="transcript_line"> Devanna and he promptly gave me her phone number and I then rang her up on a Sunday</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> only to be told that she couldn&#039;t speak to me at that point in time because</div><div id="00:01:54.960" class="transcript_line"> she was had there was a service going on because there were the Methodist services there anyway</div><div id="00:02:00.400" class="transcript_line"> nonetheless having told me she couldn&#039;t speak to me she spent about 20 minutes chatting away</div><div id="00:02:05.680" class="transcript_line"> nicely to me and recounting the thing the various people we knew together we&#039;d never met</div><div id="00:02:11.280" class="transcript_line"> um before she asked me what on earth I wanted and I then said well I&#039;d quite like to get to know you</div><div id="00:02:19.920" class="transcript_line"> and another big highlight was the wedding with Diana where everyone in the village just turned</div><div id="00:02:26.880" class="transcript_line"> out I think there was this sense of oh thank goodness we&#039;ve got Jake under wraps now he&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> married to a nice girl down down the road that&#039;s a good good pairing and everyone turned out so</div><div id="00:02:39.040" class="transcript_line"> people outside the church it was it was brilliant and for me I went from Cross Cottage to the pub</div><div id="00:02:47.280" class="transcript_line"> had a had a whiskey to embrace myself and then walked back over the road to the church</div><div id="00:02:53.520" class="transcript_line"> and then in typical fashion Diana and myself all prepared for the whole thing because we we did it</div><div id="00:02:59.520" class="transcript_line"> all very locally we had the reception in the village hall we walked down to the village hall</div><div id="00:03:05.760" class="transcript_line"> and all the local children got a rope over the road and they which is a local tradition</div><div id="00:03:10.960" class="transcript_line"> and they only drop the rope if you put a pound in the bucket uh for them and so you pay a toll to</div><div id="00:03:16.320" class="transcript_line"> pass and then we we lined up queuing with everyone else until someone said no Jake you&#039;re meant to be</div><div id="00:03:22.400" class="transcript_line"> at the front of the queue welcoming people to go into the into the hall and um after that we then</div><div id="00:03:30.320" class="transcript_line"> had the um the party at Davana itself with a band in a marquee which we borrowed from the scouts in</div><div id="00:03:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Newtown uh and uh so all done on a on a shoestring absolutely fantastic and um the I bought all the</div><div id="00:03:45.840" class="transcript_line"> the wine for the tables here and uh there was quite a plentiful supply with John Jones and my</div><div id="00:03:51.680" class="transcript_line"> brother who was a barman in Leicester at the time both waitering they both went around and poured</div><div id="00:03:57.120" class="transcript_line"> wine and kept people well imbibed throughout but at the end there were still bottles of wine left and</div><div id="00:04:03.520" class="transcript_line"> people made their way from the village hall to Davana walking along the road carrying a bottle</div><div id="00:04:08.800" class="transcript_line"> of wine in one hand and just had a great time so that&#039;s a big highlight for me</div></div></p>
