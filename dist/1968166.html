    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They say I learned seamanship from my father and he learned it from his father and so on back into antiquity.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you know when you have a family settled in one place all the little tales get passed down from father to son.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But coming back to sailing I&#039;ve always messed about in boats. I became a sailing instructor.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was sailing instructor for the local Sea Cadet Corps and at the same time I acquired a 1904 vintage itching ferry.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She was a wreck in a shipyard and I was talking to a lad and he said, oh I&#039;m going to set fire to it.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I said don&#039;t do that, she&#039;s too pretty. Alright you have it. Ah.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So I restored it to sailing condition and oh she was really, she was a classic yacht you know.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The sort of thing you&#039;d be sailing down the haven and a powerboat would come over and all of a sudden you&#039;d find yourself looking down camera lenses</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> because people thought she was worth photographing. I thought wow they&#039;ve noticed you know.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was fun but unfortunately father time caught up with me and I thought now hang on I need to be strong to sail this thing.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought now I&#039;m not as strong as I was and not as nimble as I was so I thought now it would be sensible to let her go.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She was great fun while I had her you know and she really was a powerful boat.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> To give you an idea she was built in 1904 but she had a huge spread of sails. She had four sails on one mast.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> There was an occasion when I was coming into Milford Haven and a couple of high powered modern yachts were with me and the wind was just right.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were tearing along and these modern yachts couldn&#039;t pass us.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We were just sort of sitting in the cockpit sort of looking at things and you could hear the crews, hey treat this a bit, push that a bit, move this.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not going any faster. Why can&#039;t we catch that whole thing?</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But I thought that was terrific you know and I thought the old girls got it. But where they would have beat us is going into the wind.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know she was more difficult to take into the wind and I would have lost her there but with the wind just a little bit behind me nothing could catch her.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That was terrific you know to see all these people in expensive yachts that couldn&#039;t catch me.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fun at the time you know.</div></div></p>
