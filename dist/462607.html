    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember where you heard about...</div><div id="00:00:03.600" class="transcript_line"> My dad, really, would have read it in the newspaper and heard it on radio,</div><div id="00:00:12.240" class="transcript_line"> but my father was fiercely, fiercely concerned about that, you know.</div><div id="00:00:21.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it was. It was a very sad time for the villages of that area,</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> when they lost their homes, their church, everything just went under the water, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:36.800" class="transcript_line"> And the reason being to give water to... was it Liverpool or Birmingham?</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Liverpool.</div><div id="00:00:42.320" class="transcript_line"> Liverpool, yes. Which they don&#039;t have this water from that source now, do they?</div><div id="00:00:48.880" class="transcript_line"> So in a sense, whereas I suppose the water was their lifeblood then,</div><div id="00:00:56.160" class="transcript_line"> it all was to no avail now, from our point of view, many years later, what, 50 odd years later.</div><div id="00:01:05.680" class="transcript_line"> But I think the heartbreak it must have caused the people who lived in that village then</div><div id="00:01:13.920" class="transcript_line"> must have been tremendous. And I know my father at the time, who was quite a strong Welsh man,</div><div id="00:01:22.560" class="transcript_line"> with very high principles and very strong ideas, I know he was fiercely, fiercely</div><div id="00:01:32.080" class="transcript_line"> angered by it. And I think in the family we sensed that, and obviously it made us angry to</div><div id="00:01:43.600" class="transcript_line"> think that the Welsh people were being thrust out of their homes, losing their homes,</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> to supply water to Liverpool. And if my dad was alive today, I don&#039;t think he would have been</div><div id="00:01:56.960" class="transcript_line"> happy to know that water was no longer required. It was a beautiful part of the country, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:04.560" class="transcript_line"> It still is, it&#039;s lovely. And probably you&#039;ve passed there today. A beautiful, beautiful part.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But then a whole village was wiped out. I don&#039;t know that I would have been happy had I been</div><div id="00:02:20.320" class="transcript_line"> old enough, you know, to sort of appreciate, well, could you do anything about it? No,</div><div id="00:02:26.800" class="transcript_line"> only by subjection. But it wasn&#039;t enough, was it?</div><div id="00:02:34.080" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember it being discussed, I mean, beyond your family, I mean, in the community,</div><div id="00:02:38.240" class="transcript_line"> here?</div></div></p>
