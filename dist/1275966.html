    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 10 of a series of short stories about 1919</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and the things that were travelling across the desk with dispatches and intelligence reports</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> of the then Prime Minister David Lloyd George.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This is about the Canadian soldiers, also waiting to go home,</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> angry about not being demobbed, and it&#039;s Canadian soldiers in riots and death.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Soldiers from other countries, as I&#039;ve said, were also being denied the demobilisation they expected when they left France.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And two major riots involving Canadian soldiers demonstrate their anger and the end of battlefront discipline.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to remember just how rigid discipline is in the battlefront, and then suddenly there&#039;s very little.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The first riot was at Kinmel Bay, the army camp near Rhyl, North Wales.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 1st of March 1919 the Canadians refused to obey orders.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 4th of March they elected Sapper William Czarowicz, a Russian-born Canadian, as their leader.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, due to an administrative error, the soldiers were short of wages and had no money for alcohol and cigarettes.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So they decided to resolve this by looting the officers&#039; canteen and mess,</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> taking, as an aside, taking the red curtains that were located there and attaching them to poles to make red flags.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They then left the confines of the camp and attacked Tin Town.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Tin Town was a batch of temporary shops owned by local traders and selling goods to the armed forces of the Canadians.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they destroyed 11 of those shops.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The next day matters got even worse when there was an open battle between mutineers and officers,</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and non-commissioned officers who were trying to restore order.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> In the melee five men died.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Mutineer Gunner Jack Hickman was shot.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Sapper Czarowicz died from a bayonet wound.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Private David Gilland, who was on the officer side, was shot and two others died.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> No one was ever convicted for playing a part in the deaths.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Fifty men were court-martialed, resulting in sentences of three months to ten years.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, Kimmel Bay was a military riot.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> No civilians were involved, unlike the next major Canadian riot in Surrey.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Canadian soldiers were in a convalescence camp in Epsom in Surrey, on the edge of London.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Here were Canadian troops recovering from illness or injury.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was usual for them to get drunk, etc.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But on the 17th of June 1919, this got out of hand at the Rifleman Pub in Epsom Hybe Street.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the soldiers was arrested for fighting with the police.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then another one, John Connors, when the soldiers tried to stop him being taken to the police station.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Later that night, 400 soldiers attacked the police station using paving stones and railings</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> to smash their way into the police station where they were met by 20 or so police officers.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> In the middle of this, what happened was all of the off-duty police, hearing what was going on,</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> did their best to get to the police station, cycling, which was their main transport.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And 51-year-old Sergeant Green, an off-duty police officer, cycled to the police station when he realised there was trouble.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was struck by a railing during the attack on the station.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Seven men were charged for offences relating to the riot.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Two were acquitted, five convicted only of riot.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And yet Sergeant Green had been killed. No one was charged with his death.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Some were sentenced to a year&#039;s imprisonment.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> However, in a novel twist, in December 1919, the soldiers were all granted a royal pardon and deported to Canada.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Ten years later, Alan McMaster, one of the men convicted of riot, walked into a police station in Winnipeg, Canada</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> and confessed to the murder of Sergeant Green.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The British authorities, embarrassed by this problem, decided that the matter had been dealt with and he was freed.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now Sergeant Green, as I say, died in this riot.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Now in 1985, when P.C. Blakelock was killed in Tottenham in London in a riot,</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> it was stated he was the first police officer to be killed in a riot in the 20th century.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Now that riot involved black people and it made for a dramatic headline.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was factually incorrect.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So the other soldiers were causing just as many problems for David Lloyd George as his own soldiers.</div></div></p>
