    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so we&#039;re recording now. It is Wednesday the 2nd of December 2020 and at 11 o&#039;clock</div><div id="00:00:11.840" class="transcript_line"> in the morning. My name is Paul Hunt and what&#039;s your name?</div><div id="00:00:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Dawn Gareth. And where are you today Dawn?</div><div id="00:00:22.080" class="transcript_line"> In my flat in Newport. Newport. And so just to start with, can you</div><div id="00:00:30.280" class="transcript_line"> just say a little bit about who you live with and where you live?</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, I&#039;m my own in Newport. I work for Carderpeet First. I&#039;m going to talk to houses, very</div><div id="00:00:51.320" class="transcript_line"> uh, bosses for the houses because of the health passport. The health passport is the name</div><div id="00:01:06.040" class="transcript_line"> what you&#039;re known as, your date of birth and all stuff like that.</div><div id="00:01:10.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the stuff you do for work, is it? Yes. And do you have a partner at the moment?</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do. But he&#039;s not with me today. His name is George Lanton. We are engaged. We&#039;ve</div><div id="00:01:31.240" class="transcript_line"> been engaged since my birthday last year. We&#039;ve been together for five years.</div><div id="00:01:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, quite a long time then. Yeah. So I guess I think that I&#039;ve been with you since about whatever.</div><div id="00:02:05.240" class="transcript_line"> So mention, I suppose, the fact that you were one of the first people we interviewed at the</div><div id="00:02:10.600" class="transcript_line"> start of all of this. Yes. And so I suppose we&#039;ll make reference to that at the start,</div><div id="00:02:19.880" class="transcript_line"> but can you tell me, were you shielding at all or not when we had the first lockdown? Yes and no.</div><div id="00:02:28.920" class="transcript_line"> Answer that question correctly. Let me, yes and let me know. The reason because I live on my own.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I got to go down to the shop. I got to go see my sister, but I kept my two meters from her</div><div id="00:02:49.400" class="transcript_line"> and they go in and out at all. But then I came straight back to my house. And I was like,</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> go straight back to my flat. Okay. So back in March and all of this kicked off, how did you feel?</div><div id="00:03:11.160" class="transcript_line"> When all of this kicked off, I felt nervous and anxious and all stuff like that at first. Then it</div><div id="00:03:21.800" class="transcript_line"> felt okay. Doing online stuff and all. I&#039;m glad we got the tablet for work,</div><div id="00:03:31.080" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;m using my phone, but nevermind that.</div><div id="00:03:39.160" class="transcript_line"> As well as that, I did miss George not being with me for the first lockdown and for the second</div><div id="00:03:49.560" class="transcript_line"> lockdown as well. We did miss each other and he missed my birthday and they had</div><div id="00:03:58.840" class="transcript_line"> offered an app, Google, whatever you want to call it. What is it again?</div><div id="00:04:10.440" class="transcript_line"> You can speak to it. Oh, what do you call it? Oh, my brain&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:04:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Google. Not Google. Alexa. Oh, right. Okay. Like a smart speaker thing. Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:29.800" class="transcript_line"> And how have you found that using that? Okay. Okay. We set the alarms for work at 6.80 in the morning.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it&#039;s hard for me to do food shopping. Sometimes it&#039;s even hard for me to do cleaning</div><div id="00:04:51.080" class="transcript_line"> and all. But it&#039;s quite handy to have it now and again to listen to like state of the crop music.</div><div id="00:05:01.880" class="transcript_line"> So you mentioned that you&#039;ve missed, obviously, miss George when you had lockdown. Was there any</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> talk about you moving in together at all doing that? We&#039;re not moving in together now</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> because of the benefits issue. Okay. Would you be worse off or something? Is it? Yeah, it would be</div><div id="00:05:24.840" class="transcript_line"> maybe worse off if we moved in together. Oh, so how does that affect your plans? Obviously,</div><div id="00:05:37.640" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re engaged right now. How would that affect your ability if you got married to live together?</div><div id="00:05:43.960" class="transcript_line"> It will affect it a lot, but I don&#039;t know much. It will affect it. But it&#039;d be cadence and allowance</div><div id="00:05:53.400" class="transcript_line"> and all stuff like that. You know, so it&#039;d be what? Sorry. No, no, sorry. Would the benefits</div><div id="00:06:02.520" class="transcript_line"> situation, if it wasn&#039;t for that, would you have moved in with him by now? Yeah, I would have,</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> but because he&#039;s in the complex, yeah, like sort of complex with other people.</div><div id="00:06:23.800" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t at the moment. Is it sheltered accommodation? Is it? Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:36.840" class="transcript_line"> I see. So going back to March, did you think it would still be going on this long?</div><div id="00:06:43.320" class="transcript_line"> I thought it won&#039;t be going on too long if you know what I mean, but I&#039;m pleased now</div><div id="00:06:53.480" class="transcript_line"> coming out with these not relation things and I will allow it. I definitely will allow the</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> ejection. Yeah, because they announced that this morning, didn&#039;t they, that it&#039;s got been approved?</div><div id="00:07:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I did know that. I missed out, but I turned over to something else I did.</div><div id="00:07:18.440" class="transcript_line"> So obviously you work with kind of people first. Did you know how you were going to be able to do</div><div id="00:07:24.840" class="transcript_line"> your job when it first started back in March? We started come together in March, so we did</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> we did loads of stuff on live, holding around and all, so because the come together project</div><div id="00:07:48.600" class="transcript_line"> did finish till October anyhow. And this new project which I&#039;m doing now is about health,</div><div id="00:08:02.040" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s a different subject and this one&#039;s till March next year. Okay.</div><div id="00:08:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Did you find it, how did you find having to work from home remotely then? We did first, but I got</div><div id="00:08:21.800" class="transcript_line"> used to it, but with this new project I need to go up, because of this new project what we&#039;re doing</div><div id="00:08:31.640" class="transcript_line"> now, I need to, what I feel like I need to do is go out and talk to, instead of doing online,</div><div id="00:08:43.800" class="transcript_line"> is go out and meet and talk about this new project to start, head</div><div id="00:08:52.760" class="transcript_line"> the bosses, the top bosses like Dick, Reg, Dimensions, you name it, you know,</div><div id="00:09:00.680" class="transcript_line"> even the assembly members, you name it, I go talk to them, because we got funding from</div><div id="00:09:08.120" class="transcript_line"> public health files and we have online meetings and all on Thursday at 9.30 till</div><div id="00:09:19.400" class="transcript_line"> like 11.00, except for the other Thursday, but we still meet Thursdays at 9.30 till 10.00, or then</div><div id="00:09:32.520" class="transcript_line"> you know, sorry if I keep it on. No, no, that&#039;s fine, so you know,</div><div id="00:09:41.240" class="transcript_line"> what were the biggest differences for you between, you know, working normally in an office with people</div><div id="00:09:46.200" class="transcript_line"> and having to do it online in your house? In the office I know what I was doing and I was out more,</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> more, in the house I sometimes get tired a lot and not,</div><div id="00:10:13.160" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t not interested, but I found it weird being on my own, does that make any sense?</div><div id="00:10:24.120" class="transcript_line"> No, yeah that makes sense, yeah, so you, you may be, not putting words in your mouth, but</div><div id="00:10:32.200" class="transcript_line"> you found it difficult not being around other people? Yeah, yeah, because I&#039;m used to being</div><div id="00:10:38.840" class="transcript_line"> out and about more and I&#039;m in more, that&#039;s the only straight thing about it. And so I,</div><div id="00:10:53.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s worth mentioning I suppose that I&#039;ve worked with you before, like I&#039;ve done a couple of times,</div><div id="00:10:58.680" class="transcript_line"> is there anything that, where you think that you need support from someone that you haven&#039;t been</div><div id="00:11:02.760" class="transcript_line"> able to get? Not really, it&#039;s just I&#039;m, to be honest and truthful, sometimes I am lazy to</div><div id="00:11:17.720" class="transcript_line"> tidy the flat up and all in that respect, but in supporting ways I got loads of support off work,</div><div id="00:11:30.120" class="transcript_line"> you know, with the tablet and all stuff like that. I understand where they&#039;re coming from,</div><div id="00:11:36.200" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re coming from, if you know what I&#039;m saying, they look for our wellbeing sort of thing,</div><div id="00:11:47.560" class="transcript_line"> our stress sort of thing, but</div><div id="00:11:54.040" class="transcript_line"> because I have been tested and all stuff like this, I wish I could have been tested, but</div><div id="00:12:01.800" class="transcript_line"> because I have got none of the symptoms, which that&#039;s why, thank God,</div><div id="00:12:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pleased about.</div><div id="00:12:17.720" class="transcript_line"> And is it a worry that you could catch it at all, or are you worried about that?</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Not really, I&#039;m not all that worried if I could catch it, if I do catch it, it may be mild,</div><div id="00:12:33.640" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s, that&#039;s why</div><div id="00:12:41.880" class="transcript_line"> Wales are not doing, like London is doing, testing everybody in care homes,</div><div id="00:12:50.280" class="transcript_line"> they should do it for care homes in Wales. I think for people who&#039;s elderly, who&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:12:59.640" class="transcript_line"> dementia and all, they need to do it in Wales as well as England. So we need to do that.</div><div id="00:13:10.680" class="transcript_line"> I would like to be tested just to know if I have it or I have got it, if no one from my mind</div><div id="00:13:24.040" class="transcript_line"> arrests, so to say.</div><div id="00:13:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, I quite like that.</div><div id="00:13:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, so you said you live on your own?</div><div id="00:13:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:39.080" class="transcript_line"> During the first lockdown, did you see anyone at all?</div><div id="00:13:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Only my sister, I went up to, I went down the shop and then up to her house. I stayed outside</div><div id="00:13:52.280" class="transcript_line"> and just not on the door. And I kept, with her steps out to the front door, I kept them,</div><div id="00:14:01.960" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like two meters sort of thing. I sat on the wall, she sat on the chair. So that&#039;s</div><div id="00:14:08.680" class="transcript_line"> sort of the two meters, if you know what I&#039;m saying.</div><div id="00:14:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, what did you talk about with her?</div><div id="00:14:15.640" class="transcript_line"> Just general stuff, how she is and how she&#039;s coping and all stuff like that.</div><div id="00:14:24.200" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, at least I have a sister, only at the wrong sort of thing I&#039;m pleased about.</div><div id="00:14:33.320" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel having to live on your own for so long?</div><div id="00:14:37.400" class="transcript_line"> I sort of used to it, but I did miss George, I did miss him.</div><div id="00:14:44.840" class="transcript_line"> And how did you keep in touch with George?</div><div id="00:14:49.880" class="transcript_line"> Through WhatsApp, phone in, blue messenger, you know, we kept it in our way, so to say.</div><div id="00:15:01.720" class="transcript_line"> And how did he cope through it? I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And how did he cope through it? Obviously, you said he lived in accommodation with other people.</div><div id="00:15:08.360" class="transcript_line"> So how was he finding it compared to you?</div><div id="00:15:11.880" class="transcript_line"> He found it okay, but sometimes he said, because he thinks it is mental,</div><div id="00:15:26.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t say mental health problems, but he has mental health, sort of mental health problems.</div><div id="00:15:32.840" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;s thinking, oh, it&#039;s the cigarettes down my body and all stuff like that, because he can&#039;t</div><div id="00:15:41.560" class="transcript_line"> go to number two properly, so he&#039;s dreaming it on cigarettes. Which is</div><div id="00:15:52.760" class="transcript_line"> understandable, which, you know, it&#039;s all in his mind. So do you understand what I&#039;m saying?</div><div id="00:15:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Do you understand what I&#039;m saying? Yeah, I understand.</div><div id="00:16:08.440" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m trying to listen to him and reassuring me he&#039;s not dying and all stuff like this,</div><div id="00:16:18.760" class="transcript_line"> you name it. Which is quite difficult sometimes.</div><div id="00:16:25.640" class="transcript_line"> Were you able to talk to anyone else then about what George was going through?</div><div id="00:16:29.640" class="transcript_line"> I only work online with Sue and all because they understand George as well as I do.</div><div id="00:16:38.840" class="transcript_line"> So you felt like you had someone else to talk to? Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:44.600" class="transcript_line"> And so, thinking of like practical things like going shopping, how did you manage to go shopping</div><div id="00:16:50.440" class="transcript_line"> during the first lockdown? My sister. Your sister did the shopping for you?</div><div id="00:16:57.160" class="transcript_line"> She did it. She picked some stuff up for me normally because Darren worked for the</div><div id="00:17:06.440" class="transcript_line"> card of presses. Oh, who&#039;s Darren? My sister&#039;s partner. Oh, okay.</div><div id="00:17:13.400" class="transcript_line"> And he got a car. So he drove me and my sister to go shopping once.</div><div id="00:17:30.520" class="transcript_line"> And we used these scanners in Tesco once. They were the easiest to go in March because</div><div id="00:17:39.880" class="transcript_line"> the first lockdown. But because we were in the car, we were okay. That&#039;s only like a small little</div><div id="00:17:50.360" class="transcript_line"> bubble. Then we did online shopping sort of thing. If you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:18:01.240" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t go to many shops during lockdown then? Not all that many. If I did,</div><div id="00:18:07.880" class="transcript_line"> I did go out and go into town maybe once or twice, but I didn&#039;t go too far, you know,</div><div id="00:18:15.480" class="transcript_line"> down to Cardiff sort of thing. Yeah. And how did you find that experience going out during lockdown?</div><div id="00:18:24.360" class="transcript_line"> We were the first with the, you know, I didn&#039;t wear the mask of firsts at all.</div><div id="00:18:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you didn&#039;t, did you? No, not at first. How come? Because I got my last one.</div><div id="00:18:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay. I think they did it to the altar quite recently,</div><div id="00:18:49.720" class="transcript_line"> if I remember. So I have been wearing them now, but because I got my last one, I got careful</div><div id="00:19:03.880" class="transcript_line"> by breathing as well. Yeah. I mean, how did you, how do you find wearing a mask? I hate them.</div><div id="00:19:11.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like them, but I know why you got to do it. That&#039;s the case. If you got the invite,</div><div id="00:19:21.720" class="transcript_line"> you know, got this, wherever you want to call it. I know why. You go in the shop,</div><div id="00:19:32.920" class="transcript_line"> we go in the taxi, definitely go in on a bus, but I have seen people with these passes</div><div id="00:19:44.280" class="transcript_line"> have been attacked on buses, which is quite good.</div><div id="00:19:51.720" class="transcript_line"> Really? You feel safe on buses when other people are wearing the masks? Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:00.360" class="transcript_line"> And how do you find it talking to other people when they&#039;re wearing a mask?</div><div id="00:20:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Weird. Definitely weird. Weird in what way? You can&#039;t see them talk properly. You know they are</div><div id="00:20:17.160" class="transcript_line"> talking, because you can hear them talking, but it&#039;s difficult to hear them now and again.</div><div id="00:20:25.080" class="transcript_line"> How does that make you feel?</div><div id="00:20:35.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think about that. I don&#039;t know. Oh, that old are weird? No. No. Oh, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:20:46.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m thinking about that.</div><div id="00:20:53.880" class="transcript_line"> And another thing, actually we&#039;ll come back to that. When the lockdown first finished,</div><div id="00:20:59.480" class="transcript_line"> how did you feel knowing that you could go and see people again? I was pleased. I was happy.</div><div id="00:21:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I could go and see George, you know, and George could come up and stay here,</div><div id="00:21:14.600" class="transcript_line"> which he did do, you know. So you bubbled with George, did you? Yeah, I bubbled with George. I</div><div id="00:21:20.840" class="transcript_line"> bubbled with my sister, you know, because my sister&#039;s only live up the road and I&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:21:28.600" class="transcript_line"> seeing her mum now and again.</div><div id="00:21:34.760" class="transcript_line"> And how has your mother coped through all of it?</div><div id="00:21:39.640" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s, oh, how can I put it? She wears a mask nearly 24 hours, so she put, she got in mind</div><div id="00:21:50.760" class="transcript_line"> and sort of thing. She&#039;s scared in the way not to take the mask off. She does take the mask off</div><div id="00:22:02.840" class="transcript_line"> when she&#039;s up on the air and she takes it off when she&#039;s back home, but she don&#039;t take it off</div><div id="00:22:10.360" class="transcript_line"> when she&#039;s in town or like that. I do. Well, I&#039;m not going to the shops or anything like that,</div><div id="00:22:19.480" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m outside. I leave my mask off. You know what I&#039;m saying?</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, mum, is he upset? To me. Okay.</div><div id="00:22:39.480" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s difficult to put it into words, so to say. No, no, I understand what you mean.</div><div id="00:22:46.040" class="transcript_line"> So, I want to go back a little bit and talk about George a second. Is that okay?</div><div id="00:22:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:22:56.920" class="transcript_line"> How did you cope during lockdown with not being, like the physical side of relationship? I know</div><div id="00:23:03.640" class="transcript_line"> you could take that however you want, you know, hugging someone, just being able to be close to</div><div id="00:23:08.520" class="transcript_line"> someone. How did you find not being able to do that?</div><div id="00:23:11.320" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t. I was a naughty girl. When we had the first lockdown, that felt so difficult,</div><div id="00:23:22.520" class="transcript_line"> and when the lockdown finishes, I was pleased. So, we did it. We did it. We did it.</div><div id="00:23:33.240" class="transcript_line"> That felt so difficult, and when the lockdown finishes, I was pleased. So, we did it.</div><div id="00:23:46.200" class="transcript_line"> First, we got back to mine.</div><div id="00:23:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, sorry. I think you broke up a little bit then, Dawn.</div><div id="00:23:51.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very part that it was. I&#039;ll bring you back later.</div><div id="00:23:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So, what were you saying then?</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I was saying the first lockdown was quite difficult, but when the first lockdown</div><div id="00:24:13.480" class="transcript_line"> finishes and he could come up to mine, we did hug and kiss then.</div><div id="00:24:20.920" class="transcript_line"> But did you find it difficult not having that contact with him?</div><div id="00:24:25.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. At first, because we couldn&#039;t see each other at all.</div><div id="00:24:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, sorry.</div><div id="00:24:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Was that the longest you&#039;d been without seeing him?</div><div id="00:24:43.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a poor whore.</div><div id="00:24:51.960" class="transcript_line"> George tried to go through to my phone, that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:24:55.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, is that the longest period you&#039;ve been away from George?</div><div id="00:24:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes. I will bring you back to second off my phone.</div><div id="00:25:06.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a long time.</div><div id="00:25:11.080" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:25:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Are you talking to George or Paul right now?</div><div id="00:25:15.720" class="transcript_line"> You.</div><div id="00:25:16.440" class="transcript_line"> Me, is it? Okay. You&#039;re going to ring me back to you?</div><div id="00:25:20.120" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;ll ring George back.</div><div id="00:25:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s okay. Sorry. Getting confused.</div><div id="00:25:25.160" class="transcript_line"> When we first met, I would ring him straight back.</div><div id="00:25:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So did you feel lonely at all during lockdown?</div><div id="00:25:35.800" class="transcript_line"> A little bit lonely, but because I had my sister up the road, I did.</div><div id="00:25:43.480" class="transcript_line"> She had her partner and her boy to be.</div><div id="00:25:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Her partner and her boy to be.</div><div id="00:25:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And I felt all the old sort of things in that way.</div><div id="00:25:59.800" class="transcript_line"> I told her so.</div><div id="00:26:07.080" class="transcript_line"> In the mean way, in the nicest way.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand.</div><div id="00:26:18.440" class="transcript_line"> Has all of this affected your mood and how you feel about things in general?</div><div id="00:26:25.640" class="transcript_line"> No, not really. A little bit at the end, so it&#039;s known again, but not.</div><div id="00:26:34.200" class="transcript_line"> Not.</div><div id="00:26:36.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t feel all I have, so to say.</div><div id="00:26:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Now, what&#039;s the one thing you&#039;ve missed during the last eight months?</div><div id="00:26:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you&#039;ve missed that you would really like to be able to do?</div><div id="00:26:52.040" class="transcript_line"> Meeting people and talking to assembly members and all stuff like that.</div><div id="00:27:01.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I miss now.</div><div id="00:27:04.200" class="transcript_line"> So partly a job and just being able to see people, is it?</div><div id="00:27:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And tell them about the health passports, the new job I&#039;m doing now</div><div id="00:27:15.320" class="transcript_line"> which is, you know, and we got, you know, I know we got to do it online at the moment,</div><div id="00:27:24.680" class="transcript_line"> but hopefully before long we can, you know, go out and meet people.</div><div id="00:27:34.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;ll be a few more months, I suspect.</div><div id="00:27:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, for me.</div><div id="00:27:38.600" class="transcript_line"> What was I going to ask? Sorry, oh yes. So,</div><div id="00:27:50.840" class="transcript_line"> do you, have there any, obviously you&#039;ve mentioned George, but in terms of like your friends,</div><div id="00:27:55.960" class="transcript_line"> have you been able to stay in touch with them?</div><div id="00:27:59.480" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes on the web or WhatsApp.</div><div id="00:28:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Except for Georgia, I have tried to, no wonder times Georgia. So I kept in contact with Eddie,</div><div id="00:28:18.360" class="transcript_line"> our old phone, blue messenger, WhatsApp, Wayne, blue messenger.</div><div id="00:28:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And, oh that&#039;s the thing, I can leave a voice message for him about that job.</div><div id="00:28:38.440" class="transcript_line"> I can tell him no.</div><div id="00:28:42.200" class="transcript_line"> I think he will like that. Because it will fit my benefits.</div><div id="00:28:47.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes. Always a problem that, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:28:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, at the moment, because I&#039;m doing 10 hours, I can&#039;t do the, because this one&#039;s up to March,</div><div id="00:28:59.480" class="transcript_line"> and your one&#039;s like 15 hours, it will fit my benefits.</div><div id="00:29:05.720" class="transcript_line"> The new job, will make up for it, will fit my benefits if I do too.</div><div id="00:29:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh that&#039;s fair enough, that&#039;s understandable.</div><div id="00:29:14.680" class="transcript_line"> So I go like, no thank you, but no thank you.</div><div id="00:29:24.040" class="transcript_line"> With like friendships and maybe groups,</div><div id="00:29:26.120" class="transcript_line"> has there been any online things you&#039;ve been able to do, like quizzes or</div><div id="00:29:31.720" class="transcript_line"> people having sing-alongs and stuff like that?</div><div id="00:29:34.680" class="transcript_line"> I know I got on my tablet, the Insight app, where you talk about Paul from Inrate.</div><div id="00:29:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been on it maybe once or twice. I need to get on it because I need to talk to</div><div id="00:29:58.440" class="transcript_line"> the bosses of the houses for that, because then they know what I&#039;m talking about.</div><div id="00:30:11.720" class="transcript_line"> At the moment, I&#039;m quite, I guess not stuck,</div><div id="00:30:18.200" class="transcript_line"> it won&#039;t let me get on, because every time I put the password in, it&#039;s not recognizing it or</div><div id="00:30:30.520" class="transcript_line"> something, or I&#039;m doing something wrong. But I&#039;m like, by my head, I get a bit more sometimes.</div><div id="00:30:41.960" class="transcript_line"> So I go get on it, because they told me off.</div><div id="00:30:48.440" class="transcript_line"> But it sounds like maybe you haven&#039;t been interacting with people too much on Zoom or Teams then?</div><div id="00:30:58.600" class="transcript_line"> For work, yes. Teams, because we work on Teams with work colleagues and all, stuff like that.</div><div id="00:31:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, as well as for Zoom, we do stand-up speaking out meetings, so we do that on Zoom.</div><div id="00:31:24.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only two I&#039;m doing at the moment. I know I need to do more,</div><div id="00:31:30.360" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s just finding the time to do it.</div><div id="00:31:43.720" class="transcript_line"> I go somewhere inside that somewhere and I don&#039;t know how.</div><div id="00:31:50.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I see you, Christian.</div><div id="00:31:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sort of. Obviously, you mentioned you hate wearing a face mask and things.</div><div id="00:32:08.360" class="transcript_line"> How have you found following all of the different rules? Do you think you&#039;ve always understood them?</div><div id="00:32:12.520" class="transcript_line"> I understood the reason being why you go in face masks in shops and taxis and buses and all.</div><div id="00:32:25.160" class="transcript_line"> But when you are outside walking, I thought you don&#039;t need to wear a face mask.</div><div id="00:32:34.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the other side of things.</div><div id="00:32:38.440" class="transcript_line"> If you know what I&#039;m trying to say, but when you come back out from a shop or anything like that,</div><div id="00:32:52.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind doing that. I understand why.</div><div id="00:32:56.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing that you&#039;ve wondered or I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m supposed to do in this situation?</div><div id="00:33:04.040" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. Except for now and again, but other times, no, no.</div><div id="00:33:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Have you had support from work or someone else to understand those rules?</div><div id="00:33:17.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been looking around on Facebook, Low Disability Wales has been sending them an easy read</div><div id="00:33:27.640" class="transcript_line"> as far as they do the video thing about it. I do understand why, yes.</div><div id="00:33:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, hello.</div><div id="00:33:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Let your phone go in.</div><div id="00:33:53.720" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, it&#039;s only me and half.</div><div id="00:33:56.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re trying to get a hold of me.</div><div id="00:33:58.600" class="transcript_line"> He really wants to speak to you, doesn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:34:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, can I let him know I&#039;m on video call on the net?</div><div id="00:34:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can do that.</div><div id="00:34:17.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:34:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="00:34:43.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no. Sorry about that.</div><div id="00:34:46.760" class="transcript_line"> I said two minutes.</div><div id="00:34:49.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re nearly done, don&#039;t worry.</div><div id="00:34:54.680" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s the, do you think there&#039;s been any good things that come out of the last few months?</div><div id="00:35:01.400" class="transcript_line"> These calculations now, which goes proof, which I&#039;m pleased about, but it is</div><div id="00:35:12.600" class="transcript_line"> in the virus, as I said, all right, to stop you out of the virus.</div><div id="00:35:24.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, that&#039;s a very good thing. I was thinking more sort of like, you know,</div><div id="00:35:32.120" class="transcript_line"> some people think that it&#039;s good, like, so like me, for example, I don&#039;t have to drive to go to</div><div id="00:35:37.400" class="transcript_line"> work anymore. I&#039;m saving a lot of money on petrol.</div><div id="00:35:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Other people feel it&#039;s been quite useful because they get to spend more time at home with their</div><div id="00:35:45.080" class="transcript_line"> families, not traveling. Is there anything you found that actually you quite like about the way</div><div id="00:35:50.520" class="transcript_line"> things are right now?</div><div id="00:35:52.200" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it&#039;s the opposite.</div><div id="00:35:58.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the opposite for me. I prefer to be out than about, Paul. You should know that by now.</div><div id="00:36:05.320" class="transcript_line"> I used to be an out of my person. I&#039;d be, I don&#039;t know, like,</div><div id="00:36:16.440" class="transcript_line"> Monday or Wednesday or Friday, but if I&#039;m working, I like to be out working, not in working.</div><div id="00:36:26.360" class="transcript_line"> You spent quite a lot of time at home in the last two months. How was that?</div><div id="00:36:30.440" class="transcript_line"> How do you now think about your home?</div><div id="00:36:35.080" class="transcript_line"> I want to get out.</div><div id="00:36:40.920" class="transcript_line"> I want to get out, so to say.</div><div id="00:36:46.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll say that in the new year, hopefully, I will be moved from Newport to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:36:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay. So you lived in Cardiff before, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:36:59.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:01.000" class="transcript_line"> How come you&#039;ve decided to move back?</div><div id="00:37:05.640" class="transcript_line"> Because my partner lives in Cardiff, my work&#039;s in Cardiff, so it&#039;s got to be Cardiff.</div><div id="00:37:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay. How do you think the relationship, obviously, you said your sister and your</div><div id="00:37:18.280" class="transcript_line"> mother live close to you. How will that affect your relationship with them, do you think?</div><div id="00:37:22.520" class="transcript_line"> I want to be sort of sad but happy because she could come down to Cardiff</div><div id="00:37:29.640" class="transcript_line"> to see me. It&#039;d be difficult for all the enemy, but we still got that connection,</div><div id="00:37:40.520" class="transcript_line"> anyhow, so I could come up to her or she could come down to me, vice versa.</div><div id="00:37:50.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s understandable.</div><div id="00:37:53.720" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:37:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Be to move.</div><div id="00:37:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Be to move.</div><div id="00:37:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like you&#039;re desperate to go then.</div><div id="00:37:59.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m desperate to go, but my sister&#039;s not...</div><div id="00:38:05.720" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t like the idea of me moving from Newport, so to say.</div><div id="00:38:13.800" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m ready to do a new</div><div id="00:38:16.600" class="transcript_line"> chapter in my life.</div><div id="00:38:29.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s understandable.</div><div id="00:38:33.320" class="transcript_line"> So my last question is, is there anything you&#039;re looking forward to doing,</div><div id="00:38:38.360" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s the one thing you can&#039;t wait to do when all the rules are gone?</div><div id="00:38:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Go out, meet new people and talk and talk.</div><div id="00:38:46.280" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah, I can see why that would be important to you.</div><div id="00:38:50.200" class="transcript_line"> I go to the pub.</div><div id="00:38:57.400" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:38:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Have you found, actually I&#039;m gonna ask you one more question on that, have you found</div><div id="00:39:03.720" class="transcript_line"> it easy to stay healthy during lockdown?</div><div id="00:39:08.360" class="transcript_line"> During lockdown, like...</div><div id="00:39:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes and no.</div><div id="00:39:15.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t drink all I mention alcohol.</div><div id="00:39:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:39:21.480" class="transcript_line"> I stopped drinking alcohol after my birthday.</div><div id="00:39:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:39:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Then I got became well, because my blood pressure is up down like a yo-yo,</div><div id="00:39:45.880" class="transcript_line"> so I got became for having salt in my food.</div><div id="00:39:50.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:39:53.480" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m on blood pressure tablet, so I don&#039;t drink any alcohol,</div><div id="00:39:59.720" class="transcript_line"> but I will be drinking all Christmas anyhow.</div><div id="00:40:03.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a little bit difficult to stay healthy over lockdown, what did that mean for you?</div><div id="00:40:11.800" class="transcript_line"> Because I borderline diabetic, I will be diabetic next year.</div><div id="00:40:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:40:19.800" class="transcript_line"> So I got became for why I eat more now.</div><div id="00:40:24.360" class="transcript_line"> So is it, was it struggling with eating healthy you struggled with, is it?</div><div id="00:40:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:30.840" class="transcript_line"> I buy you drink food more than anything else.</div><div id="00:40:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay, well I think that&#039;s it done, let you get back to George who obviously wants to speak to you.</div><div id="00:40:45.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m gonna stop the recording now, and I find the button, there we go.</div></div></p>
