    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Katherine McShane interviewing Guy Harper for the Swicker Cardiff Carnival 25th</div><div id="00:00:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Anniversary Project. The date is the 12th of November 2014 and we&#039;re here in Penilan</div><div id="00:00:17.320" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff and Guy for the recording. Could you spell your name for me please?</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> G for gorilla, U for an umbrella and Y for yacht. And your second name? John or Harper.</div><div id="00:00:32.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah Harper. Sorry, H-A-R-P-E-R. Lovely. So can you remember how you got involved in</div><div id="00:00:41.800" class="transcript_line"> carnival in the first place? Yeah I got dragged along. I was doing some voluntary work for</div><div id="00:00:49.480" class="transcript_line"> City Centre Youth Project and some people I&#039;d met there. I think it was a young lady called Karen</div><div id="00:00:56.200" class="transcript_line"> and a chap called Steph and a young lady called Jane dragged me along. They said to come along</div><div id="00:01:03.400" class="transcript_line"> to this... well I think they&#039;d been before. They said, oh it&#039;s carnival&#039;s on, you&#039;ve got to come</div><div id="00:01:10.640" class="transcript_line"> along. So I went along and there&#039;s lots of dremming and I was quite interested in music anyway.</div><div id="00:01:18.840" class="transcript_line"> So they were doing lots of sort of, I don&#039;t know, the equivalent of like samba drumming.</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not that knowledgeable so I don&#039;t know what particular style it was but I just wanted to do</div><div id="00:01:34.040" class="transcript_line"> a bit of drumming and there were lots of people drumming in a big space and I thought yeah you</div><div id="00:01:42.080" class="transcript_line"> know I like this and then they started making costumes and stuff. So I got involved and then</div><div id="00:01:48.880" class="transcript_line"> carried on going for a few consecutive years. Can you remember which period that was?</div><div id="00:01:57.720" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean which period? In terms of years. Well as we were saying earlier, I seem to think it would have been</div><div id="00:02:08.120" class="transcript_line"> about 92, 93 until for about probably for about five or six years probably but it&#039;s going back</div><div id="00:02:16.960" class="transcript_line"> a long time and I can&#039;t really... I couldn&#039;t be definite about that. I think it would have been</div><div id="00:02:24.200" class="transcript_line"> about 92, 93 I would have put my head around the door there and then I would have carried on going</div><div id="00:02:32.520" class="transcript_line"> probably until about 90s. I&#039;m trying to think. I&#039;m trying to think, did Fred ever go?</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Or did I ever go well after Fred was born? I don&#039;t know. I can&#039;t remember. It would have been...</div><div id="00:02:53.680" class="transcript_line"> I would have carried on going until at least 96 I think. Okay and what was it that sort of kept you</div><div id="00:03:02.280" class="transcript_line"> being involved and interested? I just like the energy of it. The sort of drumming and then later</div><div id="00:03:08.600" class="transcript_line"> I got involved with the stoke walking and it was just... I quite like the atmosphere of the sort of</div><div id="00:03:14.520" class="transcript_line"> a lot of people getting together for a bit you know just sort of for a parade you know and</div><div id="00:03:19.560" class="transcript_line"> sort of and to make a lot of noise and to dress up and sort of just generally... well just generally sort of</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah giving a lot of people all together in a nice big space with you know sort of contributing</div><div id="00:03:36.520" class="transcript_line"> to a parade. I just like that. I really like that. Can you remember particular costumes that you</div><div id="00:03:45.560" class="transcript_line"> created or? I can remember doing the one that when the one year</div><div id="00:03:52.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember making a big horn.</div><div id="00:03:57.080" class="transcript_line"> That was about it must have been about four foot long.</div><div id="00:04:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Right. I kept that on my how I&#039;ve done now that I didn&#039;t break my neck with that I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:04.920" class="transcript_line"> And then another year some there was some sort of Egyptian. I can&#039;t remember what but I remember</div><div id="00:04:12.920" class="transcript_line"> it was Egyptian like ancient Egyptian you know sort of like Pharaoh sort of</div><div id="00:04:18.760" class="transcript_line"> sort of Tutankhamun type Egyptian and then there was that karmageddon on you</div><div id="00:04:25.880" class="transcript_line"> where we all dressed up as cardboard wrappers with sort of cardboard baseball bats caps and stuff.</div><div id="00:04:32.440" class="transcript_line"> All right. Carbons shorts and cardboard vest. Nice. That was on stilts.</div><div id="00:04:40.360" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s I can&#039;t remember much else really as to what I was wearing.</div><div id="00:04:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Now I can&#039;t remember what I can&#039;t remember the individual costumes.</div><div id="00:04:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Or the themes. Can you remember sort of any of the themes? There was that karmageddon yeah there was</div><div id="00:05:01.480" class="transcript_line"> um the themes crumbs you&#039;re really taxing my memory</div><div id="00:05:11.400" class="transcript_line"> there was yeah the karmageddon year seems to be overpowering my mind that&#039;s all</div><div id="00:05:18.520" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the only one I can think of at the moment. That&#039;s fine. What was your experience of the</div><div id="00:05:24.120" class="transcript_line"> carnival camp? I like the camp. I like the fact there&#039;s sort of lots of people getting together</div><div id="00:05:30.120" class="transcript_line"> and sort of it when the first couple years I went it was very very laid back it was very laid back</div><div id="00:05:37.080" class="transcript_line"> it was sort of it was like a camp people come out and they were there were people coming from all</div><div id="00:05:42.520" class="transcript_line"> over sort of different parts of the country and people coming from locally it was quite mellow</div><div id="00:05:47.160" class="transcript_line"> and like you said there was people sitting and sewing and and so people just sit there making</div><div id="00:05:52.200" class="transcript_line"> their costumes and stuff but as the I don&#039;t know as the years went on I think the hype factor sort</div><div id="00:05:57.640" class="transcript_line"> of stepped in a bit and it became less there was there were I think there were a lot more egos in</div><div id="00:06:04.520" class="transcript_line"> the room as as the years went on and it was it lost that I don&#039;t know my first one it was really</div><div id="00:06:11.240" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit of a hippie anyway and it had that it was like a camp it was there&#039;s people sat around</div><div id="00:06:16.680" class="transcript_line"> making their costumes there&#039;s music on you&#039;d have an interval somebody come some people get up and</div><div id="00:06:22.200" class="transcript_line"> do a bit of drumming or some people get somebody get up and play his instrument or whatever</div><div id="00:06:27.880" class="transcript_line"> and then you&#039;d go back really mellow out again and then and it was really easy going really nice</div><div id="00:06:33.400" class="transcript_line"> atmosphere really nice pleasant easy going atmosphere but as the years went on more people</div><div id="00:06:41.720" class="transcript_line"> it got bigger if you know what I mean more it seemed to get bigger and as it got bigger inevitably</div><div id="00:06:47.160" class="transcript_line"> it got a little bit more stressful so it&#039;s a it didn&#039;t I don&#039;t know I don&#039;t think it</div><div id="00:06:53.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it I really I preferred it I quite like it when it was still fairly small because it</div><div id="00:07:00.600" class="transcript_line"> was it did have that really it was like a camp it was and which venue was that that was in Cotez</div><div id="00:07:08.120" class="transcript_line"> there was because then then there was a there was talk about um that little cafe there</div><div id="00:07:15.480" class="transcript_line"> and somebody got the franchise for it or something and</div><div id="00:07:20.920" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d gone from passing around the sandwiches to to a franchise cafe and it was I don&#039;t know it</div><div id="00:07:28.520" class="transcript_line"> just it didn&#039;t seem yeah you got the feeling that I got the feeling that you know it was</div><div id="00:07:37.400" class="transcript_line"> as it picked up more people were getting interested then there was more people who were worrying</div><div id="00:07:45.560" class="transcript_line"> it had to be done right you know so it&#039;s a which yeah that&#039;s nice you know it&#039;s a big parade and</div><div id="00:07:52.360" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of people going to turn out to see it you want it to be done right</div><div id="00:07:56.440" class="transcript_line"> but at the same time up you lost a little bit of that homegrownness about it it&#039;s uh yeah</div><div id="00:08:07.480" class="transcript_line"> so can you remember any particular characters from those years or people that you met during</div><div id="00:08:14.120" class="transcript_line"> can come to you like kevin and augie and and kora because they did they did they they taught me how</div><div id="00:08:23.080" class="transcript_line"> to do taught me how to do the stilt walking i really i really buzzed on that there was that um</div><div id="00:08:32.520" class="transcript_line"> that chat that big chat mo there&#039;s graham can you remember graham with the drums he still has</div><div id="00:08:39.880" class="transcript_line"> i see him on up in trail bridge actually he&#039;s moved to he lived in trail bridge i think he&#039;s</div><div id="00:08:44.440" class="transcript_line"> got something wrong with his leg because he&#039;s always got he&#039;s always walking with a stick</div><div id="00:08:49.240" class="transcript_line"> i know you remember the one the liver peglian one yes scarce one yeah uh marion with the

memorable carnival incident can you remember</div><div id="00:10:04.200" class="transcript_line"> specific stories or incidents thrown out getting banned</div><div id="00:10:12.760" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s charming loyalty would be nice as well</div><div id="00:10:17.320" class="transcript_line"> oh</div><div id="00:10:21.880" class="transcript_line"> and what did you do to get banned i threw i i one of the stanley knives used for cutting up the</div><div id="00:10:28.680" class="transcript_line"> bits of material and i i threw it into a piece of wood and then i got banned</div><div id="00:10:37.640" class="transcript_line"> health and safety i presume so yeah do you have any positive carnival memories</div><div id="00:10:43.800" class="transcript_line"> well yeah i just said i really enjoyed you know i really enjoyed the drumming and the stoke walking</div><div id="00:10:51.640" class="transcript_line"> and the sort of jamboree-ness of it all and i really enjoyed the i really enjoyed the atmosphere</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> in the first the sort of i quite enjoyed the sort of camp the sort of mellow sort of atmosphere</div><div id="00:11:03.480" class="transcript_line"> for a couple of years as well so in terms of the parade experience what do you sort of remember</div><div id="00:11:10.280" class="transcript_line"> of the parade days</div><div id="00:11:17.720" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;m just getting on with it yeah the performance aspect of it i suppose</div><div id="00:11:22.760" class="transcript_line"> yeah well you don&#039;t you don&#039;t sort of you don&#039;t really clock so much of the performance while</div><div id="00:11:26.920" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re actually doing it right because you&#039;re you&#039;ve got you&#039;re focused on what you&#039;re supposed</div><div id="00:11:32.440" class="transcript_line"> to be doing so it&#039;s a what you&#039;re sort of you know what you&#039;re doing you can&#039;t really see who&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:37.400" class="transcript_line"> behind you that well and and that sort of thing you i would usually be involved with a drum with</div><div id="00:11:43.880" class="transcript_line"> a sort of drummy sort of section so you sort of that that takes up all your attention really your</div><div id="00:11:50.760" class="transcript_line"> drums are quite they&#039;re quite loud and sort of look at me so you don&#039;t you tend not to see</div><div id="00:11:56.200" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s behind you tend to catch people what other people do more during the evenings</div><div id="00:12:02.200" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re working towards it if you know i mean you sort of</div><div id="00:12:06.840" class="transcript_line"> while they&#039;re doing a rehearsal or we&#039;ll get out and do this then you you see what&#039;s happening but</div><div id="00:12:11.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s on the actual parade day itself and you you&#039;re quite focused on whatever you&#039;re doing</div><div id="00:12:17.960" class="transcript_line"> which is you would usually be playing the drums in some sort of uh in some sort of capacity i</div><div id="00:12:23.880" class="transcript_line"> suppose do you remember much about um the reception the parade got in terms of the crowd</div><div id="00:12:31.800" class="transcript_line"> on the kids yeah it all seemed to be very good it always seemed to be very good there was it</div><div id="00:12:36.520" class="transcript_line"> it seemed to be a nice mix of people who were just bringing the kids out for the afternoon and</div><div id="00:12:42.520" class="transcript_line"> and and people who knew people you know you&#039;d always get somebody shouting somebody&#039;s name out</div><div id="00:12:48.600" class="transcript_line"> people who knew people and with a nice mix of people who were just out for the you know who</div><div id="00:12:55.480" class="transcript_line"> just come out for the for the evening you know sort of read i don&#039;t know whether they read it in the</div><div id="00:12:59.720" class="transcript_line"> echo or whatever and what was your sort of least enjoyable aspect of being involved in carnival</div><div id="00:13:13.400" class="transcript_line"> as i said it got very stressful towards the the last sort of year or so it got i think they would</div><div id="00:13:22.120" class="transcript_line"> it got bigger and it did seem to attract a lot of egos it got very</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> very they didn&#039;t it seemed to be about</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> it seemed to be a lot more about particular individuals than</div><div id="00:13:38.200" class="transcript_line"> then the thoughts of a car you know the car on the carnival atmosphere the the sort of</div><div id="00:13:44.520" class="transcript_line"> bring your friends and family along bring the kiddies along bring granny along</div><div id="00:13:50.680" class="transcript_line"> and live a little love a little that all seemed to it all seemed to be very much about</div><div id="00:14:00.920" class="transcript_line"> particularly egos in the room rather than so for you i suppose my next question was</div><div id="00:14:08.120" class="transcript_line"> what does carnival mean to you what does a carnival experience mean to you it would be that</div><div id="00:14:12.920" class="transcript_line"> it was a it&#039;s a community that it was a community a community getting together to be create</div><div id="00:14:21.000" class="transcript_line"> creatively to say we&#039;re going to sit and enjoy each other&#039;s company work towards a goal</div><div id="00:14:29.800" class="transcript_line"> see what we can come up with artistically creatively and then at the end of it we&#039;re</div><div id="00:14:35.400" class="transcript_line"> going to enjoy it so it&#039;s a we&#039;re going to you know we&#039;re going to have a ball you know so it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:14:39.960" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s that&#039;s what it was a that&#039;s what it was about i suppose that&#039;s why why do you know of</div><div id="00:14:45.480" class="transcript_line"> any other deaf and what was it would you know something i don&#039;t i know different people pick</div><div id="00:14:51.720" class="transcript_line"> out different aspects that is what carnival means to them depending on how they&#039;ve been involved and</div><div id="00:14:58.520" class="transcript_line"> you know for some people it is the performance or yeah yeah i see what you mean yeah yeah</div><div id="00:15:03.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah</div><div id="00:15:06.440" class="transcript_line"> so what in terms of um the value of cart of carnival it is that</div><div id="00:15:14.600" class="transcript_line"> being open access and bringing the community together or</div><div id="00:15:20.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah i think so i wasn&#039;t i was i never really looked at it yeah i want to get in a high profile</div><div id="00:15:29.320" class="transcript_line"> high stress levels a lot of pressure on to be you know tip top i quite like the quality of</div><div id="00:15:41.320" class="transcript_line"> in terms of the pressure in terms of the pressure i was quite i quite liked it like</div><div id="00:15:47.640" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what i liked about it initially was that it was you could meet people and it was very</div><div id="00:15:53.080" class="transcript_line"> it was very a way to meet people that was very laid back</div><div id="00:15:58.360" class="transcript_line"> but you but you&#039;re sort of working towards something so it&#039;s not it&#039;s not like down the pub</div><div id="00:16:07.720" class="transcript_line"> oh i&#039;m fed up you give me another lager it was it was sort of you sat there quite</div><div id="00:16:12.280" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d be exactly being constructive and you get so you get to see people talk to people whilst</div><div id="00:16:17.640" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re being constructive you see so it&#039;s a i quite but but laid back about you know not like</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> in a job situation where the boss are being by three and it&#039;s got to be done you know it is</div><div id="00:16:29.160" class="transcript_line"> i quite like that it was laid back you know it was i didn&#039;t really</div><div id="00:16:35.960" class="transcript_line"> i wasn&#039;t really getting it it was a there was a champion of egos there really it was a</div><div id="00:16:43.160" class="transcript_line"> it was lost on me to be honest it&#039;s i didn&#039;t really you know it didn&#039;t really occur to me</div><div id="00:16:47.880" class="transcript_line"> yeah that there is that level of carnival this is you sort of said all they were like actors or</div><div id="00:16:54.920" class="transcript_line"> whatever in a in some sort of you know i i could now you say i can see it but it&#039;s a but i didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:02.440" class="transcript_line"> really get it at the time i just thought well you know we&#039;re we&#039;re sort of malloring out doing our</div><div id="00:17:06.840" class="transcript_line"> thing and there&#039;s a lot of people being very affecting sorry excuse me excuse my language</div><div id="00:17:14.440" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of people with heavy vibes you know heavy vibes and i didn&#039;t really</div><div id="00:17:20.280" class="transcript_line"> i didn&#039;t really sort of i didn&#039;t really take to that but now you say</div><div id="00:17:24.440" class="transcript_line"> you know now you put it in that light i can i can i can understand yeah well maybe</div><div id="00:17:29.560" class="transcript_line"> so the performance element of it was was was you know sort of was that was their thing you know</div><div id="00:17:36.360" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s a i didn&#039;t really i just got they were being a bit</div><div id="00:17:44.520" class="transcript_line"> i got they were just adding a they they were just it just seemed to be a lot of stress to what</div><div id="00:17:49.640" class="transcript_line"> would otherwise have been quite a quite the sort of quite the pleasant time you see so would you</div><div id="00:17:56.360"
