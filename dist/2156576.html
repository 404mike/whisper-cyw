    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, it is the 23rd of August 2022 and I&#039;m here talking to, recording an interview with Ian May there.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Ian, just as a cross reference, could you tell me the year in which you were born?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant, thank you. And to start off, could you give me a little bit of information about yourself, your childhood, where you grew up,</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> what your career path followed?</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep, I was kind of born in Ashford in Kent, went to school at the William Harvey Grammar School in Fogsten.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I did a degree at Reading University and then I worked as a community worker for a couple of years.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I joined the NHS management training scheme, I worked in the NHS for a number of years, I worked for the Audit Commission.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I retrained, when I was 40, I retrained in public health and struggled to pass the exams, but eventually got there and became consultant in public health.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m married, I&#039;ve got two children, one of whom is upstairs at the moment.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, my interests are music, I like music. I play the accordion badly and I&#039;m a very keen tennis player.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. And what is your connection with the GOAT group, the Getting Old in the Shed group?</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we&#039;re not getting old, we&#039;re getting on at the Shed.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, beg your pardon, sorry.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a play on words, we get on in that we meet at the Shed and we get on because we are getting old.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a bit more delicate than getting old.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And how?</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My link with that is I&#039;ve...</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It stems from involvement with our local park, which is a gorgeous old Victorian park, Cottridge Park.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been involved in the Friends group for on and off for the last 20, 25 years, 1997.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> A wonderful woman who is the real driving force behind it.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> She was aware that the council was going to decommission the park.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t quite sure what that meant, but it didn&#039;t seem like a good thing.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And you thought this is the thin end of the wedge.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Next thing you know, they&#039;ll be building on the park.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And she made a very powerful argument that you can&#039;t do this.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Our Victorian forebears left this for the enjoyment of the people of Birmingham.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can&#039;t simply make a political choice at this stage just to save money.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So we have managed to hold on to the park.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And ever since then, we&#039;ve kind of built from doing an annual music festival to them putting on things in the park.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the building, the shed, as it&#039;s called, was put up in...</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was opened in August 2020.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So we actually had our second anniversary.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a birthday party on Sunday, which unfortunately I couldn&#039;t attend because I was at Green Man.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But the goats came about because, and this was just pre-COVID, we put in a bid with the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s probably not... Neighbourhood Network Scheme, that&#039;s what it is locally for a group that...</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a building in the park which was called the Sons of Rest building.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was put up by the Cadbury&#039;s as a place for industrial workers who&#039;d retired to meet up.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were kind of drawing on that idea for a group called like the goats.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And we put in a bid. So we had some funding initially to get it off the ground.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, during COVID, all we were able to do really was Zoom calls.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But it got a lot of thinking done.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> People were involved in that about what we wanted, what our aims would be.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the goats, we were looking at...</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of us were interested in walking.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I looked at a local walking group called Walkspace.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And on their rather fantastic website, they had some stuff about...</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That they&#039;d come across about a woman who&#039;d done the walking the pipe thing.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And that turned out to be Kate Green.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I got in touch with her and she sent me all her stuff.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And at one point, we had this rather wild idea that we would walk, do her walk basically.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But some of the people in our group are not sufficiently mobile to do that.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So although we&#039;ve done a couple of walks out there, done some stretches and actually seen some aqueduct architecture,</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve certainly haven&#039;t done the whole walk.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> 73 miles, yes.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really endeared us to Kate.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think the thing that really endeared us to Kate, or the other way around,</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> was that she&#039;d sent me this songbook of songs she&#039;d written.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a few people who are musicians within our group.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So we recorded a couple of her songs, actually did them live at the Shed.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I sent her the recordings, which is a bit cheeky because we&#039;d actually rewritten some of the verses as well.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But she kind of thought it was marvelous.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she came and visited and then there was that whole Cannon Hill Park bit.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, it&#039;s intriguing how these things just work out.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You just follow your nose and wonderful things happen.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And last week, you came to the Ellen Vahey for the first time.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me what your impressions were of it?</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I just made me think, why haven&#039;t I been here before?</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I should have come years and years and years ago.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it was all so relevant and intriguing.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose it was the culmination of the little bits and pieces that we&#039;ve done around the pipe.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But to actually see where the water comes from and just enjoy the countryside and marvel at the engineering.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And because you were fantastic hosts, I think the group are rather stunned about how we were treated.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It was gorgeous staying in that what looks on the face of it to be a brand new spanking brand new building in the bunkhouse and then having our little tour around.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, everyone&#039;s really kind of very chuffed, really.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was lovely to meet you all.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But were you aware of where your water came from before, sort of like your connection with Kate and coming down to visit us?</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I was. And I think if you question the group, probably 50-50.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, some of our group are old enough that they did as school kids go out to Elan Valley.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I don&#039;t think any of the ones that were on the trip fall into that category.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But certainly we&#039;ve got one of our number is a history teacher.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, he has to look after his wife a lot of the time, so he couldn&#039;t come for an overnight stay.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But he remembers taking kids there.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was another guy down the road who suffers from COPD, so he couldn&#039;t make it.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But he remembers going out as a kid and people remember the model in their child.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the Cannon Hill Valley model.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They remember going there in the 60s as children and pottering around.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And because I didn&#039;t know he had a little motor, so it was actually a working model.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess it was because it&#039;s now it&#039;s now quite run down and it just sits there looking rather kind of sorry for itself.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re hoping, obviously, for the 150th anniversary of Cannon Hill Park next year to get the model refurbished and restarted.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know our archivist, Matt, working with Kate Green on that.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So hopefully it will all come together the right time.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I sincerely hope so.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And if we can help in any way, we&#039;d be only too pleased to do what we can do.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for that.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And thank you very much for this interview, Ian.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s been really good to talk to you.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a pleasure.</div></div></p>
