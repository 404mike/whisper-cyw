Yes.</div><div id="00:01:05.520" class="transcript_line"> I remember well because I worked my first job after school. My first job when I left school,</div><div id="00:01:12.480" class="transcript_line"> I worked for Bistis Shipchandler. He was Andriotis, the nabodinander. And I worked in the office with</div><div id="00:01:24.080" class="transcript_line"> lots of other people. The Pasco family. John Pasco was in charge of the office.</div><div id="00:01:30.480" class="transcript_line"> That was just one of them, wasn&#039;t it? Bistis. Mr. Bistis himself was Bistis Shipstoss.</div><div id="00:01:37.920" class="transcript_line"> Where was Bistis? Where was his writing?</div><div id="00:01:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Down the bay. Just past.</div><div id="00:01:45.920" class="transcript_line"> On Bute Street?</div><div id="00:01:47.920" class="transcript_line"> On Bute Street.</div><div id="00:01:49.920" class="transcript_line"> Just past where the bank is now.</div><div id="00:01:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh no.</div><div id="00:01:53.920" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;re renovating the bank.

That&#039;s where it was.</div><div id="00:02:02.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where Bistis was. And that&#039;s where I worked as a young girl of 15, I think, when I left school.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> If I don&#039;t mind, when was that? 1960?</div><div id="00:02:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was only 47, so.</div><div id="00:02:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Father Spiro got me the job. The priest at the time here. He was from Kerkira.</div><div id="00:02:27.920" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, that was one of them. Then Mr. Kallinikos had his.</div><div id="00:02:32.880" class="transcript_line"> It was in James Street.</div><div id="00:02:34.880" class="transcript_line"> James Street. That was the Greek Consulate.</div><div id="00:02:38.160" class="transcript_line"> And also he had ship shantlers. A lot of young men and ladies worked in his offices too.</div><div id="00:02:47.120" class="transcript_line"> One of them was Alego Dant. He was passed away recently.</div><div id="00:02:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember when? Where on?</div><div id="00:02:53.120" class="transcript_line"> In James Street.</div><div id="00:02:55.120" class="transcript_line"> Approximately on James Street?</div><div id="00:02:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Just off. Just behind.</div><div id="00:02:59.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s where the new houses are now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:01.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s where that new estate is in James Street.</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> What? Century Walk?</div><div id="00:03:07.120" class="transcript_line"> The Louisa Estate. The one with the brick.</div><div id="00:03:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes. The red brick.</div><div id="00:03:11.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when it was. It was all knocked down.</div><div id="00:03:13.120" class="transcript_line"> And the new housing estate.</div><div id="00:03:15.680" class="transcript_line"> When did Kallinikos close?</div><div id="00:03:17.680" class="transcript_line"> The Consulate.</div><div id="00:03:19.680" class="transcript_line"> When he actually closed his stores.</div><div id="00:03:23.680" class="transcript_line"> The stores? No, he was working the stores as well as the Consulate.</div><div id="00:03:29.680" class="transcript_line"> But when did he close? Because he was taking the ship from the ship shantlers.</div><div id="00:03:35.680" class="transcript_line"> The Consulate from his home address.</div><div id="00:03:37.680" class="transcript_line"> The Consulate closed in 1984.</div><div id="00:03:42.240" class="transcript_line"> I know this because Father Sanopatas remembered about this.</div><div id="00:03:48.240" class="transcript_line"> He gave me a couple of portraits of Kallinikos.</div><div id="00:03:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Any other old buildings?</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had Samonas.</div><div id="00:03:58.240" class="transcript_line"> The ship shantlers as well.</div><div id="00:04:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Samonas.</div><div id="00:04:04.240" class="transcript_line"> First time I&#039;m hearing about this.</div><div id="00:04:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Were the Kolakidists down there or not?</div><div id="00:04:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Samonas were pretty.</div><div id="00:04:12.800" class="transcript_line"> I have no idea.</div><div id="00:04:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Who was Samonas?</div><div id="00:04:16.800" class="transcript_line"> Somebody was talking about Samonas.</div><div id="00:04:18.800" class="transcript_line"> He was just like Serike Pola and Tasia.</div><div id="00:04:24.800" class="transcript_line"> Tasia Bridge.</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> She was here.</div><div id="00:04:28.800" class="transcript_line"> She was there.</div><div id="00:04:30.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think.</div><div id="00:04:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Metissera.</div><div id="00:04:34.800" class="transcript_line"> That was Mandros.</div><div id="00:04:36.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:39.360" class="transcript_line"> Mandros ship shantlers.</div><div id="00:04:43.360" class="transcript_line"> The guy who had Mandros, now he has a ship shantlers in London.</div><div id="00:04:49.360" class="transcript_line"> So I contacted him and he actually sent me quite a lot of photos from his old shop.</div><div id="00:04:57.360" class="transcript_line"> He sent me five or six different photos.</div><div id="00:04:59.360" class="transcript_line"> Because that was one of the last that&#039;s been...</div><div id="00:05:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they all moved to London.</div><div id="00:05:03.360" class="transcript_line"> The Kolakis as well.</div><div id="00:05:05.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Most of these people lived in Bari.</div><div id="00:05:09.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where they resided.</div><div id="00:05:11.920" class="transcript_line"> Their businesses were down the bay, but they lived.</div><div id="00:05:13.920" class="transcript_line"> Their residence was in Bari.</div><div id="00:05:15.920" class="transcript_line"> So all Bari people, well, Nisiotis, stayed in Bari at the time when the port was in its heyday of course.</div><div id="00:05:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Who else was there?</div><div id="00:05:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Kalamatousides.</div><div id="00:05:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Kalamatousides.</div><div id="00:05:36.480" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re still growing very strong.</div><div id="00:05:38.480" class="transcript_line"> Big supporters of the church to this day.</div><div id="00:05:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Is there any way that I can contact him, this family, so if they have any old pictures?</div><div id="00:05:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Kalamatousides, his father&#039;s got all the information.</div><div id="00:05:48.480" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got contact numbers and he&#039;s in contact with them quite a lot.</div><div id="00:05:54.480" class="transcript_line"> And the Kolakis.</div><div id="00:05:56.480" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s been in contact with them most recently.</div><div id="00:05:58.480" class="transcript_line"> He sent us a donation to the North Kolakis.</div><div id="00:06:03.040" class="transcript_line"> So he has a lot of information that you could, they would have, they would have ample material that you could use.</div><div id="00:06:11.040" class="transcript_line"> There was mainly photos.</div><div id="00:06:15.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Because of the religious nature.</div><div id="00:06:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so much.</div><div

have this, but I&#039;ve seen this here at some point.</div><div id="00:06:35.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I think there&#039;s some over there.</div><div id="00:06:37.600" class="transcript_line"> You might find some photographs of interest there.</div><div id="00:06:41.600" class="transcript_line"> There was lots of other.</div><div id="00:06:43.600"

40s and 50s all along Butte Street.</div><div id="00:07:12.160" class="transcript_line"> And all along the main street in Butte Street there was all Greek houses.</div><div id="00:07:18.160" class="transcript_line"> The old houses where they&#039;d been knocked down completely.</div><div id="00:07:20.720" class="transcript_line"> All Greek families, which I know the old folk have died and
