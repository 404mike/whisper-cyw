    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is Hannah Romani interviewing Jenny Allen on the 4th of December 2017 for the</div><div id="00:00:12.920" class="transcript_line"> HLF Wander Brass 25 project.</div><div id="00:00:18.080" class="transcript_line"> Could you just confirm that you&#039;re willing to do this interview and you&#039;ve been informed</div><div id="00:00:22.360" class="transcript_line"> of purpose and you give your informed consent?</div><div id="00:00:25.680" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:00:26.680" class="transcript_line"> You do?</div><div id="00:00:27.680" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:00:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="00:00:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Okay so maybe if you could just start off by telling me a little bit about when you</div><div id="00:00:33.640" class="transcript_line"> joined Wander Brass?</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I joined Wander Brass probably about nine years ago after a couple of us had been</div><div id="00:00:42.240" class="transcript_line"> playing in another musical project which was a very community based scratch band when we</div><div id="00:00:46.880" class="transcript_line"> all picked up instruments that we hadn&#039;t played for a year since school and then we just sort</div><div id="00:00:52.040" class="transcript_line"> of played in that performance and we all really enjoyed playing together so much that we looked</div><div id="00:00:56.280" class="transcript_line"> for other things that we could join.</div><div id="00:00:58.600" class="transcript_line"> At first they were like, Wander Brass were like, yeah, trumpets sound great but don&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:02.440" class="transcript_line"> worry about the flutes.</div><div id="00:01:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh no!</div><div id="00:01:04.440" class="transcript_line"> So were there no flutes in Wander Brass then?</div><div id="00:01:07.080" class="transcript_line"> There were, there was just Brett and Kaz and a lady called Kate and they were like,</div><div id="00:01:10.920" class="transcript_line"> yeah come along but we&#039;re more interested in the trumpets.</div><div id="00:01:14.160" class="transcript_line"> So Anna Rogers and I joined on flute and Matt and Keith and Fran joined on trumpet and loved</div><div id="00:01:22.360" class="transcript_line"> it.</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh cool, I didn&#039;t realise all four of you joined together.</div><div id="00:01:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we all joined together.</div><div id="00:01:27.120" class="transcript_line"> It was just at the start of a project we were doing with King Django so we did our learning</div><div id="00:01:34.680" class="transcript_line"> period and then we did some street gigs and then eventually we ended up playing at Brecon</div><div id="00:01:39.520" class="transcript_line"> with King Django which was really fun.</div><div id="00:01:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh brilliant.</div><div id="00:01:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay, great so, okay so the four of you joined together.</div><div id="00:01:55.080" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to tell me a bit more about the King Django project?</div><div id="00:01:57.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know much about that one.</div><div id="00:01:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Well that was working with a guy called King Django from America.</div><div id="00:02:02.080" class="transcript_line"> I think he&#039;s from New York and he&#039;s a scar musician, he plays the trombone and he came</div><div id="00:02:09.680" class="transcript_line"> over and he brought some of his tracks that he&#039;d written and he taught them to us.</div><div id="00:02:16.160" class="transcript_line"> One of them we still do, it&#039;s called Buccaneer Bay.</div><div id="00:02:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh no way!</div><div id="00:02:21.600" class="transcript_line"> He got us to do some sort of scar music which I think, I wasn&#039;t in the band before this</div><div id="00:02:27.760" class="transcript_line"> but I think it kind of changed the direction of the band a little bit away from more sort</div><div id="00:02:32.200" class="transcript_line"> of jazz and New Orleans stuff into a new sort of scar idea which shook things up a bit and</div><div id="00:02:39.600" class="transcript_line"> it was interesting.</div><div id="00:02:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Some of the songs had singing in them so we did what he calls, I think he&#039;s like a crowd</div><div id="00:02:47.200" class="transcript_line"> of jerks in a room.</div><div id="00:02:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Singing is not meant to sound good, it&#039;s meant to sound like a load of people just</div><div id="00:02:53.240" class="transcript_line"> shouting words and having a good time so we did some tunes like that and we recorded them</div><div id="00:02:59.240" class="transcript_line"> in the atrium.</div><div id="00:03:00.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what happened to the recording and we just did them in Brecon and did a couple</div><div id="00:03:07.240" class="transcript_line"> of gigs.</div><div id="00:03:08.240" class="transcript_line"> We did one in the Club de la Barre and yeah that was kind of the introduction to the band</div><div id="00:03:14.240" class="transcript_line"> for us, the first project.</div><div id="00:03:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Sounds awesome.</div><div id="00:03:17.280" class="transcript_line"> So I remember one of the albums, one of the older albums is quite scary isn&#039;t it so I</div><div id="00:03:22.280" class="transcript_line"> guess that must have been, you must have made that one around that time.</div><div id="00:03:24.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure actually, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:03:26.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got like Scaravan.</div><div id="00:03:28.280" class="transcript_line"> I think that was before actually, maybe just before, I&#039;m not sure, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:03:34.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a while ago.</div><div id="00:03:35.280" class="transcript_line"> You say you went away?</div><div id="00:03:36.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah I went after that project when we were recording the album after that, I went</div><div id="00:03:42.280" class="transcript_line"> away for a year, travelled.</div><div id="00:03:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh okay.</div><div id="00:03:45.280" class="transcript_line"> Cool.</div><div id="00:03:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Did you miss it while you were gone?</div><div id="00:03:48.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, loads.</div><div id="00:03:49.320" class="transcript_line"> And when we came back they said we could come in and record over our solos.</div><div id="00:03:55.320" class="transcript_line"> I actually am on the album.</div><div id="00:03:57.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so nice.</div><div id="00:03:58.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so smart but we&#039;re not actually playing in the heads of stuff, we&#039;ve just got a couple</div><div id="00:04:01.320" class="transcript_line"> of solos on two tracks.</div><div id="00:04:03.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really cool.</div><div id="00:04:04.320" class="transcript_line"> So which album was that?</div><div id="00:04:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s Blown Away, whichever one&#039;s got Buckethead Bay on it.</div><div id="00:04:09.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay cool.</div><div id="00:04:10.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all a bit blur.</div><div id="00:04:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh nice.</div><div id="00:04:13.360" class="transcript_line"> So can you tell me about any projects that have really massively stood out for you?</div><div id="00:04:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Maybe it&#039;s the King Dango or maybe it&#039;s something else.</div><div id="00:04:21.360" class="transcript_line"> I guess the biggest one aside from this project has been the 2012 project with Jason Yard.</div><div id="00:04:27.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it brought the band together in more ways than one because musically the piece</div><div id="00:04:34.360" class="transcript_line"> was really difficult and I think it put us all in the same boat for a while because obviously</div><div id="00:04:39.400" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of different skill levels in Wunderbass.</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not just for beginners and it&#039;s not just for professionals but I think everybody found</div><div id="00:04:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Jason&#039;s piece quite tough to get the hang of and spending two days in the studio learning</div><div id="00:04:55.400" class="transcript_line"> it, getting it down, I think it was a good leveller and everybody felt like we&#039;d sort</div><div id="00:04:59.400" class="transcript_line"> of bonded a bit around that, especially getting to travel to London and be part of something</div><div id="00:05:04.400" class="transcript_line"> in a wider context.</div><div id="00:05:05.440" class="transcript_line"> So that one really stood out and obviously Jason&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:05:08.440" class="transcript_line"> Got to go to the Druidstone and do some workshops with him there and that&#039;s always really good</div><div id="00:05:13.440" class="transcript_line"> for the band because everybody has a really good time.</div><div id="00:05:15.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s the sort of thing that makes Wunderbass what it is because if you&#039;re</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> happy and you&#039;re having a good time the music that you make is going to be better rather</div><div id="00:05:24.440" class="transcript_line"> than like a gruelling sort of schedule that&#039;s going to sort of demand a lot of you.</div><div id="00:05:29.440" class="transcript_line"> But having a challenge, something to work towards is something that&#039;s really good,</div><div id="00:05:33.480" class="transcript_line"> especially when you get there and it all works and it comes together, I think that makes</div><div id="00:05:36.480" class="transcript_line"> people feel like they&#039;re really part of something.</div><div id="00:05:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:05:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Cool.</div><div id="00:05:43.480" class="transcript_line"> And has being in Wunderbass led to any other sort of musical endeavours for you?</div><div id="00:05:49.480" class="transcript_line"> It has, yes.</div><div id="00:05:50.480" class="transcript_line"> I now play in a swing band with Rob and with Yorri who sometimes drums for Wunderbass.</div><div id="00:05:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Rob and Jenny Bradley and I formed a sort of gypsy, Balkan dance band called Capra Mame</div><div id="00:06:04.520" class="transcript_line"> which was always fun.</div><div id="00:06:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And just generally meeting people through Wunderbass has opened up some opportunities.</div><div id="00:06:12.520" class="transcript_line"> I played in a show called Magic with Jenny and somebody who used to be in Wunderbass,</div><div id="00:06:18.520" class="transcript_line"> Gareth Roberts, who&#039;s the conductor and that was really fun.</div><div id="00:06:22.520" class="transcript_line"> And we did West Side Story, the music for that, which is hard.</div><div id="00:06:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it just opened up quite a few chances to do things which I wouldn&#039;t ever have done</div><div id="00:06:33.560" class="transcript_line"> had it not been for Wunderbass.</div><div id="00:06:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think about the way the band has changed over the years, both musically</div><div id="00:06:43.560" class="transcript_line"> and in terms of the people who are in it and the atmosphere and obviously your own position</div><div id="00:06:49.560" class="transcript_line"> within the band.</div><div id="00:06:50.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re on the committee now, obviously.</div><div id="00:06:52.600" class="transcript_line"> So obviously when you join you just turn up with your flute and you don&#039;t know many people</div><div id="00:06:58.600" class="transcript_line"> and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:06:59.600" class="transcript_line"> So how do you feel?</div><div id="00:07:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, that was a lot of questions in one.</div><div id="00:07:04.600" class="transcript_line"> I think all the changes that happen in Wunderbass are pretty organic because the fundamentals</div><div id="00:07:09.600" class="transcript_line"> of the band don&#039;t change.</div><div id="00:07:10.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve always rehearsed on a Tuesday at half past seven until ten o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:07:14.600" class="transcript_line"> We always have a break in the middle.</div><div id="00:07:16.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think that the changes that happen are to do with the people who join and the projects</div><div id="00:07:21.640" class="transcript_line"> that we do.</div><div id="00:07:23.640" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always a core of people who are behind what happens with the band and that&#039;s generally</div><div id="00:07:27.640" class="transcript_line"> the people on the committee.</div><div id="00:07:29.640" class="transcript_line"> And I think a lot of the time that that&#039;s...</div><div id="00:07:32.640" class="transcript_line"> I think everybody on the committee tries to listen to what the band wants to do and be</div><div id="00:07:37.640" class="transcript_line"> proactive as well.</div><div id="00:07:39.640" class="transcript_line"> So obviously that will push the band in different directions.</div><div id="00:07:44.640" class="transcript_line"> My position in the band&#039;s obviously changed a lot and I&#039;m quite involved with everything</div><div id="00:07:49.640" class="transcript_line"> now.</div><div id="00:07:50.680" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s really good because you get a lot out of it as well.</div><div id="00:07:54.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s helped my personal career development.</div><div id="00:07:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got work, like professional work, not musical work through Wunderbass that I wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:08:01.680" class="transcript_line"> have got if I hadn&#039;t had the chance to develop certain skills through the band.</div><div id="00:08:07.680" class="transcript_line"> So I think you get out what you put in a lot of the time.</div><div id="00:08:11.680" class="transcript_line"> I think the band changes when people realise that more, once they realise what they put</div><div id="00:08:17.680" class="transcript_line"> in is actually making the band better.</div><div id="00:08:19.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s making themselves have a better experience and doing more projects drives that.</div><div id="00:08:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Going to Budapest I think was a big changer as well for people who realise actually this</div><div id="00:08:31.720" class="transcript_line"> is really fun.</div><div id="00:08:33.720" class="transcript_line"> If we have fun when we&#039;re playing it gets more fun.</div><div id="00:08:36.720" class="transcript_line"> So I think the changes are driven by the people in the band and the projects that we do.</div><div id="00:08:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that makes sense.</div><div id="00:08:43.720" class="transcript_line"> What professional skills have you learnt that you&#039;re just saying that they contributed to</div><div id="00:08:47.720" class="transcript_line"> your career development?</div><div id="00:08:48.760" class="transcript_line"> What have you learnt?</div><div id="00:08:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Fundraising.</div><div id="00:08:51.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been working with Jenny Bradley on raising funds for the band, getting sponsorship,</div><div id="00:08:57.760" class="transcript_line"> not sponsorship, grants and awards, which obviously she&#039;s very experienced at and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:09:04.760" class="transcript_line"> amazing to get the chance to work in situ in a real life situation with somebody who&#039;s</div><div id="00:09:09.760" class="transcript_line"> got those skills and that experience and you can learn a lot from that and putting it into</div><div id="00:09:14.760" class="transcript_line"> practice and seeing it be successful is really good.</div><div id="00:09:18.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s meant that I&#039;ve been able to do that for other parts of my work.</div><div id="00:09:25.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s also a platform, it&#039;s not just a platform for me to play and to perform, it means that</div><div id="00:09:31.760" class="transcript_line"> the opportunities are there to develop things like marketing skills and writing web copy</div><div id="00:09:36.760" class="transcript_line"> and developing web content.</div><div id="00:09:38.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s just great, it looks really good on your CV if you can say I did the website</div><div id="00:09:42.760" class="transcript_line"> for this and this and Wunderbress is one of them because everybody knows Wunderbress so</div><div id="00:09:46.800" class="transcript_line"> just think about that really.</div><div id="00:09:49.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, cool.</div><div id="00:09:51.800" class="transcript_line"> What do you think would be your proudest moment being in Wunderbress?</div><div id="00:09:57.800" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s when we got the acceptance that we&#039;d got the HLF grant, I think that was</div><div id="00:10:04.800" class="transcript_line"> like a really, because we put in a lot of effort, both of us, actually all of us did,</div><div id="00:10:09.800" class="transcript_line"> everybody on the committee put in a lot of work and seeing it pay off and it&#039;s great</div><div id="00:10:15.840" class="transcript_line"> and also just like whenever the band plays really and it goes down really well it&#039;s like</div><div id="00:10:23.840" class="transcript_line"> an achievement for everybody, it&#039;s nice to see.</div><div id="00:10:26.840" class="transcript_line"> What about musically, what&#039;s your...</div><div id="00:10:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:10:30.840" class="transcript_line"> I guess the Jason project was quite an achievement, I mean that music was difficult and the fact</div><div id="00:10:38.840" class="transcript_line"> that everybody, I was equally proud to be part of something that sounded like that but</div><div id="00:10:43.880" class="transcript_line"> I was also proud of everybody&#039;s, how hard everyone had worked to make it come together,</div><div id="00:10:48.880" class="transcript_line"> people practiced in their own time, they didn&#039;t just rock up at rehearsal and put in the bare</div><div id="00:10:54.880" class="transcript_line"> minimum of effort, people really tried and I think that paid off.</div><div id="00:11:00.880" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I&#039;d say the Jason project and recently when we did the Community Music Wales 25th</div><div id="00:11:08.920" class="transcript_line"> Birthday, that was really nice as well, that was just like a, because yeah, it was two</div><div id="00:11:14.920" class="transcript_line"> different gigs in the same day, we&#039;d done some evening work out in the street and then</div><div id="00:11:19.920" class="transcript_line"> we went and we played in there in the theatre in front of a seated audience who really enjoyed</div><div id="00:11:24.920" class="transcript_line"> it and everybody got really on board and that was a good performance.</div><div id="00:11:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Okay, do you have anything else you&#039;d like to say about Wander Brass, anything you think</div><div id="00:11:39.960" class="transcript_line"> that really needs to be recorded for the future, for people to know about?</div><div id="00:11:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I do, I think Rob has done an amazing thing, it&#039;s not an easy job what he has to</div><div id="00:11:51.960" class="transcript_line"> do and a lot of the time it can be really challenging and I think that letting it be</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and letting it develop as it is has just really contributed massively to the community and</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> kind of not just the musical community but generally, I mean it gives people the opportunity</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> to just really actively partake in something that&#039;s creative and I think it&#039;s a model</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> that people could copy and use elsewhere, I think that would be really great if people</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> could see how Wander Brass works and develop their own thing, I think it would be amazing</div><div id="00:12:26.040" class="transcript_line"> for different communities.</div><div id="00:12:29.040" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think about the way that it sort of fluctuates between being, obviously</div><div id="00:12:36.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not a band in which you&#039;re meant to come to learn your instruments but sometimes</div><div id="00:12:40.040" class="transcript_line"> we have to modify rehearsals for example to accommodate people who have lower levels of</div><div id="00:12:45.040" class="transcript_line"> experience or whatever, how do you feel about the way that rehearsals work to accommodate</div><div id="00:12:51.040" class="transcript_line"> that?</div><div id="00:12:52.080" class="transcript_line"> I think that in order for the band to be successful and to actually be what it is, we have to</div><div id="00:12:57.080" class="transcript_line"> put out professional standard performances because by being part of something that is</div><div id="00:13:04.080" class="transcript_line"> professional standard, that is what gives people the confidence and something to work</div><div id="00:13:09.080" class="transcript_line"> towards and the sense of pride when they&#039;ve achieved it and so I think that, yeah, I think</div><div id="00:13:14.080" class="transcript_line"> we need to maintain the professional standard but it needs to be accessible to people as</div><div id="00:13:19.120" class="transcript_line"> well, so tailoring rehearsals like you mentioned is a really good way of doing that.</div><div id="00:13:25.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean we don&#039;t have the capacity to teach instrument, like the techniques of basic</div><div id="00:13:30.120" class="transcript_line"> instrumentation, not that word, playing your instrument.</div><div id="00:13:36.120" class="transcript_line"> So realistically we could never get down to that level but in order to put out the product</div><div id="00:13:45.160" class="transcript_line"> that we sell, because ultimately that&#039;s what it is, then we have to make it as good as</div><div id="00:13:51.160" class="transcript_line"> we can possibly make it but by letting people in at an entry level, I think that&#039;s all,</div><div id="00:13:59.160" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a platform for people to aim at and there&#039;s a way in to get there if that makes</div><div id="00:14:04.160" class="transcript_line"> sense, kind of, clumsily put but yeah, I think it does two jobs in one.</div><div id="00:14:10.200" class="transcript_line"> So that.</div><div id="00:14:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, cool.</div><div id="00:14:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, great, I think that&#039;s everything.</div><div id="00:14:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Do you have anything to add?</div><div id="00:14:16.200" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s
