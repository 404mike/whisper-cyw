    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, and I&#039;m going to talk to</div><div id="00:00:06.540" class="transcript_line"> Mike Goodall about his family memories during the war, particularly his mother.</div><div id="00:00:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Mike.</div><div id="00:00:14.280" class="transcript_line"> My mother, she was, as I say, born in, brought up in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire in</div><div id="00:00:20.880" class="transcript_line"> the Midlands, the brewery town, and during the war, I know the first year of the war,</div><div id="00:00:26.540" class="transcript_line"> she went as a land army girl down in Devon, and after that she returned home and then</div><div id="00:00:34.340" class="transcript_line"> became a member of the NAFI, based at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, and from what I know,</div><div id="00:00:42.140" class="transcript_line"> it was mainly a training base for Canadian airmen, as there was one or two airfields</div><div id="00:00:50.700" class="transcript_line"> in the Midlands, particularly one at Fradley in Staffordshire, where at St Stephen&#039;s Church</div><div id="00:00:55.580" class="transcript_line"> there are many Canadian airmen who are buried in the churchyard there.</div><div id="00:01:01.900" class="transcript_line"> And I know my mother had four, from what I know, from what she said, that she had four</div><div id="00:01:07.020" class="transcript_line"> happy years in the NAFI.</div><div id="00:01:09.780" class="transcript_line"> She was only about 20 miles away from home, so it wasn&#039;t too far away from home, but</div><div id="00:01:16.340" class="transcript_line"> they had certain events, and as I think to say, it was quite an experience, but quite</div><div id="00:01:23.660" class="transcript_line"> an enjoyable time that she had.</div><div id="00:01:26.820" class="transcript_line"> It was an American base, was it?</div><div id="00:01:28.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Canadian.</div><div id="00:01:29.820" class="transcript_line"> Canadian.</div><div id="00:01:30.820" class="transcript_line"> So did she have those privileges of having bananas and oranges and sweets and chewing</div><div id="00:01:35.420" class="transcript_line"> gum, which a lot of people have mentioned to me?</div><div id="00:01:38.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, as I say, although they were mainly under campus, but they were quite well looked</div><div id="00:01:46.060" class="transcript_line"> after, and as I say, it wasn&#039;t particularly, from what she told me, it wasn&#039;t a hard time,</div><div id="00:01:54.540" class="transcript_line"> but it was a lot of work and very hard work, long hours.</div><div id="00:01:58.660" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because she would have had these three meals a day.</div><div id="00:02:02.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:03.620" class="transcript_line"> And good meals too.</div><div id="00:02:04.620" class="transcript_line"> So was she a cook or was she, do you know what she did?</div><div id="00:02:07.980" class="transcript_line"> Just general, she&#039;s actually served in the NAFI, in the canteen for setting everything</div><div id="00:02:12.980" class="transcript_line"> up and then obviously all the washing up and everything else that went with it.</div><div id="00:02:17.980" class="transcript_line"> And then she met your father later.</div><div id="00:02:20.100" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:21.100" class="transcript_line"> He had also been through the war.</div><div id="00:02:23.300" class="transcript_line"> My father was in the Royal Artillery and was initially in North Africa with the Eighth</div><div id="00:02:31.020" class="transcript_line"> Army, with the Rommel Brigade, and he was actually carrying, most of the time, he was</div><div id="00:02:38.100" class="transcript_line"> carrying ammunition, so it was a very dangerous job.</div><div id="00:02:40.580" class="transcript_line"> He was transporting ammunition to the front lines in North Africa.</div><div id="00:02:45.220" class="transcript_line"> And then the last year of the war, as it started to go, they were moved up into Italy, because</div><div id="00:02:51.820" class="transcript_line"> Italy then was with the Germans and they were pushing the Germans out of Italy, starting</div><div id="00:02:57.100" class="transcript_line"> down in Sicily and then moving north in North Africa.</div><div id="00:03:02.740" class="transcript_line"> And he spent five years, five years altogether, he had the whole five years.</div><div id="00:03:06.580" class="transcript_line"> Five years and he came back unabashedly.</div><div id="00:03:08.540" class="transcript_line"> Came back safely, yes.</div><div id="00:03:09.540" class="transcript_line"> And they got married after.</div><div id="00:03:10.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:11.980" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s such a lovely story.</div><div id="00:03:12.980" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for sharing it with me, particularly about your mother, because we</div><div id="00:03:16.340" class="transcript_line"> want to know about the women during the war, possibly they&#039;re not mentioned very often.</div><div id="00:03:21.460" class="transcript_line"> So thank you so much.</div><div id="00:03:22.700" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:03:23.700" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:03:24.700" class="transcript_line"> Pleasure.</div><div id="00:03:25.700" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve forgotten to ask your mother&#039;s name, so perhaps you can tell me what she was called.</div><div id="00:03:29.700" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my mother&#039;s name was Doris Oldham, sorry, Doris Mabel Oldham.</div><div id="00:03:33.700" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s lovely that we&#039;re remembering her today.</div><div id="00:03:36.700" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div></div></p>
