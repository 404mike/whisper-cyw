So,</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> during the interview</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> we wanted to give each other a little something</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> relatively minimal for the show.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What happens if he doesn&#039;t do it?</div><div id="00:03:36.000"

re-delicates the living being.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But in many different parts,</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> so that in a company of singers</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> which one frequently meets within the way,</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> you will hear as many different parts and voices</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> as there are performers,</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> who all at once unite with organic melody,</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> in one consonant and the soft sweetness of B flat,</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> which I love very much,</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> since I got close to Alessandro Huaglia with B flat.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I can record any grade</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> on the sounds that wereivoen in</div><div id="00:04:35.420" class="transcript_line"> in Cerdorieth too.</div><div id="00:04:37.100" class="transcript_line"> More than ever, the work of the composer was creating Cerdorieth for that purpose.</div><div id="00:04:42.420" class="transcript_line"> And the essence of the song was to know the meaning of the words of the lyrics to fit the song.</div><div id="00:04:50.720" class="transcript_line"> So here you can see the main point, the very beginning of the song.</div><div id="00:04:55.960" class="transcript_line"> The art of Cerdorieth.</div><div id="00:04:58.400" class="transcript_line"> We are one line going on the bottom of the page.</div><div id="00:05:31.260" class="transcript_line"> The first song in Cerdorieth is called,</div><div id="00:05:33.260" class="transcript_line"> One, Two, Three, Four, and One, Two, Three, Four.</div><div id="00:05:36.260" class="transcript_line"> The first song in Cerdorieth was written by a composer called Hedon Humly.</div><div id="00:05:42.260" class="transcript_line"> He said,</div><div id="00:05:43.260" class="transcript_line"> It was a good song, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:45.260" class="transcript_line"> No, it was a good song, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:47.260" class="transcript_line"> Because at one point, the composer, the composer,</div><div id="00:05:51.260" class="transcript_line"> the French composer, the Welsh composer, Sean Gwyneth, was the first song.</div><div id="00:05:58.260" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the music of the songs, and this is the point going forward,</div><div id="00:06:03.260" class="transcript_line"> the music of the songs was the main point.</div><div id="00:06:07.260" class="transcript_line"> And it was the source of the music of the lyrics in Cerdorieth,</div><div id="00:06:13.260" class="transcript_line"> to work with the other musicians and to create Cerdorieth,</div><div id="00:06:19.260" class="transcript_line"> and to write, and to write other songs,</div><div id="00:06:22.260" class="transcript_line"> to write other songs, and so on, and so forth, in the lyrics.</div><div id="00:06:25.260" class="transcript_line"> There was also Robert Jones, John Floyd,</div><div id="00:06:28.260" class="transcript_line"> John Floyd, and of course, there was also Floyd in the lyrics.</div><div id="00:06:32.260" class="transcript_line"> But this is the first song in Cerdorieth,</div><div id="00:06:37.260" class="transcript_line"> and it was written by a composer called Gael.</div><div id="00:06:39.260" class="transcript_line"> He said,</div><div id="00:06:40.260" class="transcript_line"> The songs and the lyrics are the most important things in the music.</div><div id="00:06:46.260" class="transcript_line"> I have a different story, not the one I have written,</div><div id="00:06:52.260" class="transcript_line"> but I have written a story about the ballads.</div><div id="00:06:56.260" class="transcript_line"> The ballads are of course, the songs of the songs in Cerdorieth.</div><div id="00:07:02.260" class="transcript_line"> In Cerdorieth, there are songs like this,</div><div id="00:07:06.260" class="transcript_line"> the songs of the songs,</div><div id="00:07:09.260" class="transcript_line"> the songs of the songs,</div><div id="00:07:12.260" class="transcript_line"> in Cerdorieth, there are songs like this,</div><div id="00:07:17.260" class="transcript_line"> to have a great job,</div><div id="00:07:19.260" class="transcript_line"> to be a great composer,</div><div id="00:07:22.260" class="transcript_line"> in the music, and in the lyrics,</div><div id="00:07:25.260" class="transcript_line"> there is a big hole between the two songs,</div><div id="00:07:28.260" class="transcript_line"> and of course, in the lyrics,</div><div id="00:07:30.260" class="transcript_line"> there are three of the two songs in the lyrics,</div><div id="00:07:33.260" class="transcript_line"> and they all say,</div><div id="00:07:35.260" class="transcript_line"> to the music, and to the lyrics,</div><div id="00:07:37.260" class="transcript_line"> of course, everyone knows,</div><div id="00:07:39.260" class="transcript_line"> you have a great audience here,</div><div id="00:07:41.260" class="transcript_line"> everyone knows,</div><div id="00:07:43.260" class="transcript_line"> and everyone knows,</div><div id="00:09:14.260" class="transcript_line"> But that, I said,</div><div id="00:09:16.260" class="transcript_line"> is what we need to learn,</div><div id="00:09:18.260" class="transcript_line"> to be able to live in the music,</div><div id="00:09:22.260" class="transcript_line"> to be able to live in the lyrics,</div><div id="00:09:26.260" class="transcript_line"> to be able to live in the music.</div><div id="00:09:28.260" class="transcript_line"> But that, I said,</div><div id="00:09:30.260" class="transcript_line"> we have to go online,</div><div id="00:09:34.260" class="transcript_line"> to find a picture,</div><div id="00:09:36.260" class="transcript_line"> to find a picture,</div><div id="00:09:38.260" class="transcript_line"> to find a picture,</div><div id="00:09:40.260" class="transcript_line"> to find a picture,</div><div id="00:09:42.260" class="transcript_line"> to find a picture,</div><div id="00:09:44.260" class="transcript_line"> also we have the cloud music,</div><div id="00:09:46.260" class="transcript_line"> instead, we have a different boat on board,</div><div id="00:09:48.260" class="transcript_line"> instead, we have the cloud music,</div><div id="00:09:50.260" class="transcript_line"> we have a different boat on board,</div><div id="00:09:52.260" class="transcript_line"> and we have to work.</div><div id="00:09:54.260" class="transcript_line"> And none other than 들어온 날 마주.</div><div id="00:09:58.260" class="transcript_line"> these people,</div><div id="00:10:00.260" class="transcript_line"> These people are there with us,</div><div id="00:10:02.260" class="transcript_line"> and the Scythian, the Islamic Scythian, the Fajr Nobunin, the Scythian, the Scythian,</div><div id="00:10:09.260" class="transcript_line"> the Jogini, the Jogini.</div><div id="00:10:11.260" class="transcript_line"> By looking back to the first half of the last century, we have the renaissance of the Scythians.</div><div id="00:10:18.260" class="transcript_line"> And we feel greatly indebted to Kha Nidloy, Nathin, and Bethesda as the center from which we had the greatest right.</div><div id="00:10:29.260" class="transcript_line"> And we feel greatly indebted to the Scythians.</div><div id="00:10:34.260" class="transcript_line"> And so I think that the last century has been a good year.</div><div id="00:10:40.260" class="transcript_line"> The good year is the people and the people&#039;s success.</div><div id="00:10:46.260" class="transcript_line"> So for the people, it&#039;s a good time to rest and to take a break and to show our good work.</div><div id="00:10:57.260" class="transcript_line"> Now, the second half of the last century was the time of the Capernaum, the capital of the Capernaum.</div><div id="00:11:08.260" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the beginning of the story about the Capernaum.</div><div id="00:11:17.260" class="transcript_line"> Of course, it will start, as you know, with the Capernaum.</div><div

I&#039;m going to read it.</div><div id="00:32:47.720" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going to say thank you to the people who watched my work because I&#039;ve played in the people.</div><div

rehearsing and practicing in a place near the Laman Flag.</div><div id="00:33:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I think I was in the Laman Flag in Amsterdam for three days.</div><div id="00:33:09.720" class="transcript_line"> The Laman Flag was already there and I had to go there.</div><div id="00:33:14.720" class="transcript_line"> I was there for three days and I was there for three days.</div><div id="00:33:18.720" class="transcript_line"> I was there for three days and I was there for three days.</div><div id="00:33:21.720" class="transcript_line"> The Laman Flag was there.</div><div id="00:33:24.720" class="transcript_line"> William Marsh was there.</div><div id="00:34:26.720" class="transcript_line"> He was the mind of the music production in his most elementary

chief of the band.</div><div id="00:35:01.720" class="transcript_line"> When the history of the brass band of the country comes to be written,</div><div id="00:35:07.720" class="transcript_line"> there can be no doubt that Savarta will be found occupying in it one of the proudest positions.</div><div id="00:35:14.720" class="transcript_line"> And its last able conductor, George Lindley, will be regarded as one of the most urbane</div><div id="00:35:21.720" class="transcript_line"> and the top-class leader of his days and generations.</div><div id="00:35:26.720" class="transcript_line"> So

Germany today,</div><div id="00:35:41.720" class="transcript_line"> are working on organising and writing the whole of Germany in the brass band for some years.</div><div id="00:35:46.720"

from the rest of the world.</div><div id="00:40:48.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the technical side of it.</div><div id="00:40:51.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you about a woman named Aida Fon.</div><div id="00:40:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what Aida Fon is?</div><div id="00:41:00.220" class="transcript_line"> Aida Fon is a woman who has been married

face.</div><div id="00:41:13.220" class="transcript_line"> And with her face, she shows him the face of the world.</div><div id="00:41:17.220" class="transcript_line"> You can see her face with the glasses she wears in the sputniks.</div><div id="00:41:24.220" class="transcript_line"> To show the face of the world.</div><div id="00:41:26.720" class="transcript_line"> And in the story, in the story, there&#039;s a woman named Aida Fon.</div><div id="00:41:32.720" class="transcript_line"> She has a picture of a white man walking through Aida Fon.</div><div id="00:41:40.720" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s wearing Aida Fon.</div><div id="00:41:43.720" class="transcript_line"> And at the end of the day, she&#039;s wearing a black dress.</div><div id="00:41:47.720" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s wearing a picture of a black man.</div><div id="00:41:49.720" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s not wearing this.</div><div id="00:41:51.720" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s wearing a black dress.</div><div id="00:41:53.720" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s wearing a black dress.</div><div id="00:41:55.720" class="transcript_line"> And the story is quite interesting.</div><div id="00:41:59.220" class="transcript_line"> What is the story of Aida Fon?</div><div id="00:42:01.220" class="transcript_line"> I

the revolutions that happened in the last few years,</div><div id="00:42:17.720" class="transcript_line"> and all the revolutions that happened in the last few years,</div><div id="00:42:20.720" class="transcript_line"> were developed.</div><div id="00:42:22.720" class="transcript_line"> And this is how it happened.</div><div id="00:42:24.720" class="transcript_line"> It happened in February.</div><div id="00:42:26.720" class="transcript_line"> And as a result,</div><div id="00:42:28.720" class="transcript_line"> the story of Aida Fon is now being told.</div><div id="00:42:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:42:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Because of the fact that</div><div id="00:42:38.720" class="transcript_line"> the people in the world don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:42:40.720" class="transcript_line"> what happened in the last few years.</div><div id="00:43:42.720" class="transcript_line"> He carries us to the highest heights of musical inspiration.</div><div id="00:43:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Higher and higher.</div><div id="00:43:51.720" class="transcript_line"> Tenderer and stronger.</div><div

Brushing into a loud voice.</div><div id="00:44:13.720" class="transcript_line"> Rending the sky and awakening the echo.</div><div id="00:44:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Now he wants to be like his soul.</div><div id="00:44:23.720" class="transcript_line"> Then in the magic of the imperial voice,</div><div id="00:44:26.720" class="transcript_line"> he rushes to the golden stairs in the middle.</div><div id="00:44:29.720" class="transcript_line"> And strikes, seeing above the stairs,</div><div id="00:44:34.720" class="transcript_line"> like seeing above it.</div><div id="00:44:36.720" class="transcript_line"> The strong king is controlling and accumulating in force.</div><div id="00:44:41.720" class="transcript_line"> And inspirational.</div><div id="00:44:43.720" class="transcript_line"> As he advances brilliantly through the sound</div><div id="00:44:47.720" class="transcript_line"> until the effect at the close is simply wonderful.</div><div id="00:44:51.720" class="transcript_line"> In a dark world.</div><div id="00:44:53.720" class="transcript_line"> Different day to do it.</div><div id="00:44:55.720" class="transcript_line"> And start the day.</div><div id="00:44:57.720" class="transcript_line"> And start the day.</div><div id="00:45:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Now he wants to come to find.</div><div id="00:45:32.720" class="transcript_line"> So the theme and theme are the same.</div><div id="00:45:35.720" class="transcript_line"> The love of the heart and the power of the mind.</div><div id="00:45:40.720" class="transcript_line"> The ability and the need.</div><div id="00:45:42.720" class="transcript_line"> In the piano.</div><div id="00:45:44.720" class="transcript_line"> In the voice.</div><div id="00:45:46.720" class="transcript_line"> In the hope that the power of the mind will be there.</div><div id="00:45:50.720" class="transcript_line"> In the piano.</div><div id="00:45:52.720" class="transcript_line"> In the voice.</div><div id="00:45:54.720" class="transcript_line"> In the river.</div><div id="00:45:57.720" class="transcript_line"> The power of the heart.</div><div id="00:46:00.720" class="transcript_line"> For this.</div><div id="00:46:03.720" class="transcript_line"> To learn to practice sound.</div><div id="00:46:13.720" class="transcript_line"> What is this?</div><div id="00:46:19.720" class="transcript_line"> One of his outstanding features was his interpretive ability, not only musical sound, but also of words.</div><div id="00:46:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Some of you have heard of words. He was instinctive, with a technical genius, which combined with rare religiousness.</div><div id="00:46:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Do you know the tapas? I can&#039;t find the tapas.</div><div id="00:46:42.720" class="transcript_line"> He did rehearsals, not only in music, but also in education.</div></div></p>
