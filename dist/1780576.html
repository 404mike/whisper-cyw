I&#039;ve just got to say that my name is Marsha Mani and I&#039;m here with Hugh Grant, not the Hugh Grant.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The better looking one.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Stop it John. Then John Southerl and John Southerl.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Southerl.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Southerl and Mrs Southerl. What&#039;s your Christian name?</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Valerie.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Valerie and then it&#039;s, we&#039;re at, I can&#039;t say it, Koikouniou.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Koikouniou.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Koikouniou.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, translated means Cornishman&#039;s Wood.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Curnow is the Cornish way of saying Corn or Curnow. It&#039;s just like a corruption of Curnow, Curniou and Koid as well as for wood, as in, not a lump of wood, as in a clump of trees.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s this Cornishman&#039;s Wood.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Do we know why?</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it goes back to King, was it? Back to early medieval times when he granted this land to the Duke or, I think it would be the Duke of Cornwall.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And hence it was called then Koid Curniou, Cornishman&#039;s Wood.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know everything, ma&#039;am. I have independently found out certain things.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if it was, who was it, Edward Longshanks, it might have been, the Hammer of the Scots, it might have been him or his son.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> With the third or the fourth.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the third, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Longshanks.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Longshanks, yeah. Yeah, so, the Hammer of the Scots. I think it might have been him or his son that granted this to the Earl of Cornwall or the Duke of Cornwall or whatever.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s April the 18th, 2019. I&#039;ve just got to have those details down for archival purposes. So, do you mind me, Valerie, if I ask your date of birth?</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody asks me that. I don&#039;t know what date it is.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> 29th of the 13th, I&#039;m just 29th.

Well, Castleton it was then.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> The address was Castleton. Between McMarshfield and...</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> In Gathley Bay?</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, in Gathley... No, yeah, Gathley Bay.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the farm?</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you spell that?</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we always spelled it G-double-L-Y-B-A-R.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was G-double-L-I?</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No, when I was living down there it was G-double-L-Y-B-E-A-R, Gathley Bay, is what it was called.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And what does that mean?</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. But people after altered it and they put it to Gathley Gay.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So, people only know it really as Gathley Gay, not Gathley Bay.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Even, you know, when I was living down there.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Gathley Bay.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Gathley Bay, though.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether they call it Gathley Bay.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s Gathley Bay.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Gathley Bay, but it must be spelled different.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> G-double-L-I-B-E-R.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s still there?</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s a...</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the farm as it was when I was there.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more like a mansion, though.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So, but John, you were saying it was the old... it said to be the oldest house in Mummarsh here?</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That was always the thought, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That Gathley Bay was the oldest house in Mummarsh.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, it was always said. I don&#039;t know how true that was.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to say about this woman that it was drawn during the big floods, you know, in the...</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was supposed to be drawn in the window above the porch.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But rather it wasn&#039;t true, though, was it? It was found out there was...</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a lot of these old tales, they tell you to be...</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It got altered, you know. But it was true, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But she wasn&#039;t the ghost, though, was she?</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never seen a ghost on a house.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, they had a corridor going between the rooms up there there?</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There was three... no, two and a half, actually, planks like that of an oak tree cut in the...</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the floorboards.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Just three?</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were... as they were cut from the tree, you know, just...</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> shizzled off, like, you know, polished sort of thing.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s phenomenal.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he went down the steps then into a little room, and that room was where she&#039;s supposed to have drowned.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the original story.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So who was she? Do we know who she was?</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You knew the name, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can&#039;t remember it.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard the story, yeah, and I remember then...</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh...</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I read it not so long ago somewhere.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll get back to you in an hour, Marcia.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll definitely get back to you in an hour.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I know I&#039;ve got that written down somewhere.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a history...</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I remember thinking, oh, Christ, I must remember to tell that to Mam.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a history of that in Marshfield Church, my darling, the records of...</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> ...of the plan, because it was built the same year.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was built the same year as the church?</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So is it to Norman Church?</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I know it was a monastery years ago.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> What, the church or the farmhouse?</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The farmhouse.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> A monastery?</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re looking from the farmhouse, like looking down here, you&#039;d be looking at the church.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, to get the fields down.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, apparently the sea used to come...</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no seawall then, look, and that was...</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The ships used to come up down here, and the pirates used to go in the church,</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and they had a tunnel from the church up into the farmhouse, look.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to have spirits and all, you know, do all that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were...</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The archaeologists did come there digging up after we left, like, you know.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to know a lot about it, because they&#039;d heard these stories,</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and they did find the beginning of a path of a tunnel, but it was all...</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> All gone in, like, you know, sunk in.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So on the slope you could...</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it would look...</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d look straight into the...</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, from the porch to the church porch, you was more or less looking straight in.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They were identical.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh!</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s almost a straight line.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The walls were seven foot thick in that place, right?</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s believable.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So how old do you think it is?</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s...</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether that was true.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not very good with the centuries.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was built in the 11th century.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if that was right.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But that would make it Norman.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that sounds about right.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was...</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> When it was built then, it was only...</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just like a small place, but it was built...</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The front of it was the same, you know.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And in 1909, Lord Trudeegan had it altered, because the house itself was down in the ground,</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> like, part of it, and they dug it all out, and they filled part of the house in,</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> the cellar that was to be there, with all the rubble and the stuff from the orchard,</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> because my gran was...</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> She married my grandfather, I don&#039;t know what year it was.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She was 18, he was 21, I think, and she used to have a few words with him.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d go in...</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was before it was dug out now, and she&#039;d climb out through the pantry window</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and run up back to her father in St. Melan&#039;s, to her father&#039;s house,</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and then they dug it all out.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big boat this width, I suppose, of paving in all round,</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you had the orchard, it was set in a circle, like, you know.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So was it like a walled orchard?</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They never put a wall there, the orchard was left as a bank.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But the host...</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they do a pre-casted part of it then, you know,</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> but the top part, I think, was left as it was.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> There were 13 rooms in then, after they&#039;d done it all,</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but when the monks were there, it was only a small place,</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> because we had a photograph of that from someone,</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t even know what happened to that.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you know who the monks were?</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> How curious.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they...</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you, the old vicar from Marshfield,</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s where we used to get a lot of our knowledge of the farm,</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but he was very interested in all that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What was his name?</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Karen Stanley.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And he did a lot of...</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t it Stanley Stanley?</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t it Stanley Stanley?</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we always called him Karen Stanley.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you remember seeing him.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s his son, he was a doctor.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was Stanley Stanley.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He was Stanley, yes, Stanley Stanley.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No, that was that place.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, Dr Stanley Stanley.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, I remember, I know Dr Stanley Stanley,</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> not a reverend, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So did it belong to the Tredegas then?</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Tredegas, yeah, it always belonged to Tredegas.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a tenanted farm?</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Tenancy, yeah, there was no...</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I left there, there was no water, no electric,</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> no... nothing like that down there.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So describe it to me, what did it look like,</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and what rooms did you have?</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you look at the front of the church,</div><div id="00:09:25.000"
