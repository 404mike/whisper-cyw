id="00:10:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was all a sin, you know,</div><div id="00:10:34.680" class="transcript_line"> even if you can remember as a little girl,</div><div id="00:10:36.680" class="transcript_line"> they used to have what they called nibbles or something,</div><div id="00:10:40.680" class="transcript_line"> pushchairs.</div><div id="00:10:41.680" class="transcript_line"> They were only like little support,</div><div id="00:10:43.680" class="transcript_line"> you put dolls&#039; pushchairs in,</div><div id="00:10:45.680" class="transcript_line"> put dolls in, and you could fold them up and open them up.</div><div id="00:10:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, we used to weld the joints of them,</div><div id="00:10:50.680" class="transcript_line"> and, well, I used to do the riveting and the joints,</div><div id="00:10:54.680" class="transcript_line"> and that little girl working with them,</div><div id="00:10:56.680" class="transcript_line"> she used to do the welding.</div><div id="00:10:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was simple work.</div><div id="00:11:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And were you on a line?</div><div id="00:11:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, kind of a line, yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:06.680" class="transcript_line"> You had to do a certain amount during the day.</div><div id="00:11:08.680" class="transcript_line"> You were expected to do a certain amount.</div><div id="00:11:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what your wages were</div><div id="00:11:13.680" class="transcript_line"> when you started working there?</div><div id="00:11:18.680" class="transcript_line"> I know I was earning in the office about £2 odd a week,</div><div id="00:11:25.680" class="transcript_line"> and when I went there, it was nearly double,</div><div id="00:11:28.680" class="transcript_line"> so I must have been earning about £4.</div><div id="00:11:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, that was a lot of money</div><div id="00:11:33.680" class="transcript_line"> compared to what I&#039;d been earning then, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Would you say that was a lot of money in those days?</div><div id="00:11:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, not a lot, not a lot,</div><div id="00:11:43.680" class="transcript_line"> but it was better than office work.</div><div id="00:11:45.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, everybody went into a factory</div><div id="00:11:50.680" class="transcript_line"> simply because you had more money than in an office.</div><div id="00:11:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:11:56.680" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, when I finished there,</div><div id="00:11:58.680" class="transcript_line"> I was having my first little boy.</div><div id="00:12:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I did my work for quite a few years then.</div><div id="00:12:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, then I started doing odd jobs two days a week</div><div id="00:12:08.680" class="transcript_line"> if I could have somebody to look after.</div><div id="00:12:10.680" class="transcript_line"> I had a sister in the house to look after my little boy</div><div id="00:12:13.680" class="transcript_line"> so many days a week.</div><div id="00:12:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, then I moved from Ylgerddig, Merthyrd,</div><div id="00:12:17.680" class="transcript_line"> down here to live then.</div><div id="00:12:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, then the only jobs that were down here,</div><div id="00:12:21.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the co-operative for a while.</div><div id="00:12:23.680" class="transcript_line"> And I had a neighbour here,</div><div id="00:12:25.680" class="transcript_line"> he was to keep an eye on him when he came home from school</div><div id="00:12:27.680" class="transcript_line"> and things like that.</div><div id="00:12:29.680" class="transcript_line"> You had to do jobs in those days</div><div id="00:12:31.680" class="transcript_line"> that suited your family really.</div><div id="00:12:34.680" class="transcript_line"> But going back to lines then,</div><div id="00:12:39.680" class="transcript_line"> do you remember what you did used to do with your money?</div><div id="00:12:44.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you spend your money?</div><div id="00:12:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, mostly we&#039;d had a little cottage.</div><div id="00:12:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And all it was basically was four walls.</div><div id="00:12:55.680" class="transcript_line"> So every pound we had spare, we spent on that house.</div><div id="00:13:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Trying to make it a home then, innit?</div><div id="00:13:04.680" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember saying we&#039;d just put a little bathroom,</div><div id="00:13:07.680" class="transcript_line"> built a bathroom, put hot water in.</div><div id="00:13:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I&#039;m never ever going to move from here</div><div id="00:13:13.680" class="transcript_line"> unless I get hot water.</div><div id="00:13:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, in the meantime, the lady that lived here</div><div id="00:13:18.680" class="transcript_line"> was my father&#039;s aunt.</div><div id="00:13:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And her daughter offered us the house.</div><div id="00:13:23.680" class="transcript_line"> And of course, my husband said,</div><div id="00:13:26.680" class="transcript_line"> oh, it&#039;s a lovely house, man, you can do something with that.</div><div id="00:13:29.680" class="transcript_line"> And of course, by then I had two children.</div><div id="00:13:31.680" class="transcript_line"> We needed a bigger house.</div><div id="00:13:34.680" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, we came down here, no hot water, no electric.</div><div id="00:13:38.680" class="transcript_line"> We had to start from scratch again.</div><div id="00:13:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And my husband would say,</div><div id="00:13:44.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to do this, I&#039;d like to do that.</div><div id="00:13:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, I do.</div><div id="00:13:49.680" class="transcript_line"> What if I make a mess of it, Marge?</div><div id="00:13:51.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d scrap it and we&#039;d start again.</div><div id="00:13:54.680" class="transcript_line"> And whatever job he did, I was working with him.</div><div id="00:13:58.680" class="transcript_line"> If he was mixing cement, I was mixing cement.</div><div id="00:14:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Or I was mixing it and he was using it.</div><div id="00:14:04.680" class="transcript_line"> We mixed, I don&#039;t know how many tonnes of cement</div><div id="00:14:07.680" class="transcript_line"> up in our first home up there.</div><div id="00:14:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And then we sold it and moved down here.</div><div id="00:14:13.680" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s your answer.</div><div id="00:14:15.680" class="transcript_line"> We spent it all on our own,</div><div id="00:14:18.680" class="transcript_line"> trying to get a little home together.</div><div id="00:14:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me some other things then?</div><div id="00:14:28.680" class="transcript_line"> What were your first impressions of the factory?</div><div id="00:14:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, up until then I&#039;d never been inside a factory.</div><div id="00:14:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, my first impressions were just noisy.</div><div id="00:14:44.680" class="transcript_line"> I knew that after a day or so.</div><div id="00:14:47.680" class="transcript_line"> How many of you worked there?</div><div id="00:14:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, now I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:14:51.680" class="transcript_line"> There was hundreds working there altogether</div><div id="00:14:53.680" class="transcript_line"> in the different departments.</div><div id="00:14:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I was lucky I had a good charge on that little girl&#039;s brother.</div><div id="00:15:02.680" class="transcript_line"> From the first time he knew me,</div><div id="00:15:05.680" class="transcript_line"> I think he remembered my husband as a young boy going to school.</div><div id="00:15:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as he knew I was pregnant,</div><div id="00:15:12.680" class="transcript_line"> he did a little job, what we&#039;d call a cushy little job.</div><div id="00:15:16.680" class="transcript_line"> As long as I did my work, and he was good to me, very good to me.</div><div id="00:15:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to wear a kind of overall oen?</div><div id="00:15:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, we had to wear, well, you could see in the photo,</div><div id="00:15:28.680" class="transcript_line"> leather, over our overalls.</div><div id="00:15:33.680" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t worry.</div><div id="00:15:35.680" class="transcript_line"> We came home and we had a good wash and that was it.</div><div id="00:15:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Were those supplied by the company?</div><div id="00:15:42.680" class="transcript_line"> The overalls were.</div><div id="00:15:45.680" class="transcript_line"> The airplanes were, but not the overalls.</div><div id="00:15:47.680" class="transcript_line"> We provided our own overalls.</div><div id="00:15:50.680" class="transcript_line"> And how many of you who worked there were women?</div><div id="00:15:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Was it mainly women?</div><div id="00:16:04.680" class="transcript_line"> I would say 50-50.</div><div id="00:16:08.680" class="transcript_line"> And I can always remember once I was put on a job,</div><div id="00:16:14.680" class="transcript_line"> and I thought, this is easy, going hell for leather, as you say.</div><div id="00:16:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And one of the men came up to me and said, take it easy.</div><div id="00:16:24.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, what do you mean? Take it easy?</div><div id="00:16:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course they had time and motion to study for all these jobs.</div><div id="00:16:30.680" class="transcript_line"> And you had to do a certain job.</div><div id="00:16:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was going far higher than what I was expected to.</div><div id="00:16:35.680" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re spoiling that job for the men, he said.</div><div id="00:16:38.680" class="transcript_line"> It just didn&#039;t make sense to me in those days,</div><div id="00:16:43.680" class="transcript_line"> because I thought, well, if I do my job, perhaps I&#039;ll have a bonus,</div><div id="00:16:46.680" class="transcript_line"> which I did have, innit?</div><div id="00:16:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But they were telling me to go slow because I was spoiling the rate for men.</div><div id="00:16:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And I was a woman.</div><div id="00:16:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Were you paid the same as the men?</div><div id="00:16:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, you didn&#039;t have the same rate as the men.</div><div id="00:17:00.680" class="transcript_line"> But you were doing the same work as the men?</div><div id="00:17:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what the men were paid?</div><div id="00:17:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I haven&#039;t got a clue, love, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:17:07.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t even remember what I was having by the time I got finished there.</div><div id="00:17:14.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, when you look back, the value of money has gone.</div><div id="00:17:20.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s exploded since then.</div><div id="00:17:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Are you thinking of it now, when I first had a house of my own,</div><div id="00:17:25.680" class="transcript_line"> a loaf of bread was four pence, old pence.</div><div id="00:17:29.680" class="transcript_line"> And that was delivered to the door for four pence.</div><div id="00:17:34.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, looking at the price of things today,</div><div id="00:17:36.680" class="transcript_line"> and when we tell the answers what we pay, they don&#039;t believe us.</div><div id="00:17:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they don&#039;t believe that we could have lived on five pound a week,</div><div id="00:17:44.680" class="transcript_line"> but we had to.</div><div id="00:17:46.680" class="transcript_line"> I was paying a pound a week rent,</div><div id="00:17:48.680" class="transcript_line"> and I had five pounds to live on,</div><div id="00:17:50.680" class="transcript_line"> so you can imagine you didn&#039;t have a lot to play around with.</div><div id="00:17:55.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you get to work every day?</div><div id="00:17:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I lived in Yorgerig, I was catching a bus from where I lived,</div><div id="00:18:04.680" class="transcript_line"> down to the village.</div><div id="00:18:06.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I walked from where I lived, about half a mile down to the village,</div><div id="00:18:09.680" class="transcript_line"> and caught a bus from there down to Lines.</div><div id="00:18:13.680" class="transcript_line"> And was that public transport?</div><div id="00:18:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:17.680" class="transcript_line"> So you had to pay for that?</div><div id="00:18:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:18:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And when did you have to go to work in the morning, do you remember?</div><div id="00:18:23.680" class="transcript_line"> I had to start work at eight o&#039;clock,</div><div id="00:18:26.680" class="transcript_line"> so I was catching a bus up in the village about twenty past seven,</div><div id="00:18:31.680" class="transcript_line"> so I had to leave the house at seven o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:18:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you clock in then?</div><div id="00:18:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And what about breaks during the day?</div><div id="00:18:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what your breaks were?</div><div id="00:18:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had breaks, yeah, ten minute breaks.</div><div id="00:18:47.680" class="transcript_line"> In the morning and the afternoon?</div><div id="00:18:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember how long you had for lunch?</div><div id="00:18:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Probably three-quarters of an hour, or an hour I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll have.</div><div id="00:18:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s go back to work.</div><div id="00:19:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And when did you finish the day then, if you started at eight?</div><div id="00:19:06.680" class="transcript_line"> At quarter past four.</div><div id="00:19:08.680" class="transcript_line"> That was our finishing time.</div><div id="00:19:11.680" class="transcript_line"> That was quite a good day then?</div><div id="00:19:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Good long day, yes.</div><div id="00:19:15.680" class="transcript_line"> What about...</div><div id="00:19:21.680" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to ask you, so what was the relationship,</div><div id="00:19:24.680" class="transcript_line"> the working and between you and the men?</div><div id="00:19:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you get on with the men?</div><div id="00:19:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, very well, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:32.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel though about the fact that you were told?</div><div id="00:19:36.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you one little story.</div><div id="00:19:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course, by the time I was told,</div><div id="00:19:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d tell you one little story.</div><div id="00:19:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course, by the time I&#039;d finished, I was very short.</div><div id="00:19:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course, by the time I finished, I was quite a little tub.</div><div id="00:19:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And the men used to shout after when they did,</div><div id="00:19:54.680" class="transcript_line"> here she comes, Mrs Five by Five, five foot high and five foot wide.</div><div id="00:19:59.680" class="transcript_line"> That was a way of teasing me.</div><div id="00:20:01.680" class="transcript_line"> But they were very good to me, yeah, I&#039;ve got to say that.</div><div id="00:20:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you feel resentful that they earned more money than you,</div><div id="00:20:10.680" class="transcript_line"> although you knew you were doing the same?</div><div id="00:20:12.680" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know any difference in those days, did we?</div><div id="00:20:14.680" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t know any difference.</div><div id="00:20:17.680" class="transcript_line"> How about unions in the factory then? Was it unionized then?</div><div id="00:20:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I wasn&#039;t in an union.</div><div id="00:20:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I wasn&#039;t there long enough really.</div><div id="00:20:28.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I joined an union when I was there</div><div id="00:20:30.680" class="transcript_line"> because I knew I wasn&#039;t going to be there for a while.</div><div id="00:20:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, then over the years I worked in offices</div><div id="00:20:37.680" class="transcript_line"> and if I was ill, I was paid.</div><div id="00:20:39.680" class="transcript_line"> So I only paid what they called a married woman stamp, a basic stamp.</div><div id="00:20:44.680" class="transcript_line"> And I worked then until I was 49.</div><div id="00:20:48.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked in a garage in Merthyr.</div><div id="00:20:51.680" class="transcript_line"> I was in the stores, in the office, in the stores.</div><div id="00:20:55.680" class="transcript_line"> And they were talking about taking the garage down.</div><div id="00:20:58.680" class="transcript_line"> They did take it down eventually.</div><div id="00:21:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course, everybody was looking for a job.</div><div id="00:21:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And then a friend of mine who worked in High Tat...</div><div id="00:21:05.680" class="transcript_line"> well, GC it was then.</div><div id="00:21:07.680" class="transcript_line"> She said, when are you going to come and work in the factory with us?</div><div id="00:21:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know, I said.</div><div id="00:21:14.680" class="transcript_line"> I ammed and hired and then I did go.</div><div id="00:21:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And then I thought, well, if I&#039;m going to work in the factory now,</div><div id="00:21:19.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not going to be paid if I&#039;m ill.</div><div id="00:21:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So I paid the full stamp then and I joined the union then when I was 49.</div><div id="00:21:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Okay, okay.</div><div id="00:21:29.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll come back to that.</div><div id="00:21:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But do you remember then you weren&#039;t in the union in Lyons?</div><div id="00:21:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Was it Triang then or was it Lyons?</div><div id="00:21:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Or does it matter?</div><div id="00:21:40.680" class="transcript_line"> It was the same...</div><div id="00:21:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was the same.</div><div id="00:21:44.680" class="transcript_line"> People were working there, different firms took over.</div><div id="00:21:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I think Lyons was the wartime name for the factory.</div><div id="00:21:53.680" class="transcript_line"> And then Triang was the...</div><div id="00:21:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, they made prams as well, as well as toys.</div><div id="00:21:58.680" class="transcript_line"> They made full-size prams and toys, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:02.680" class="transcript_line"> But you only worked on the toys, did you?</div><div id="00:22:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Right, you weren&#039;t a member, but do you remember any disputes, problems, strikes, anything like that?</div><div id="00:22:13.680" class="transcript_line"> No, not while I was there, no.</div><div id="00:22:15.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was a really happy...</div><div id="00:22:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, it was quite a good factory.</div><div id="00:22:19.680" class="transcript_line"> What about your relationship with the other women?</div><div id="00:22:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe that to me?</div><div id="00:22:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I got on all right with everybody.</div><div id="00:22:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you go out with them?</div><div id="00:22:31.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I was a married woman then, wasn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:22:34.680" class="transcript_line"> So you never went out with them?</div><div id="00:22:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Married women didn&#039;t go out on their own in those days.</div><div id="00:22:38.680" class="transcript_line"> They only went out with their husbands.</div><div id="00:22:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And that wasn&#039;t very often.</div><div id="00:22:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Right, right.</div><div id="00:22:45.680" class="transcript_line"> What about Christmas parties or anything like that though?</div><div id="00:22:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Was anything like that going, you know, did Triang put on?</div><div id="00:22:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I say, I was only there just before one Christmas.</div><div id="00:22:55.680" class="transcript_line"> And then I worked a few months into the following year.</div><div id="00:22:58.680" class="transcript_line"> So I wasn&#039;t really there the second Christmas.</div><div id="00:23:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:23:03.680" class="transcript_line"> And you didn&#039;t have a... yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:23:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think the work was dangerous in any way?</div><div id="00:23:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, there were some jobs.</div><div id="00:23:16.680" class="transcript_line"> I even went to work on them.</div><div id="00:23:19.680" class="transcript_line"> They had guards on them.</div><div id="00:23:21.680" class="transcript_line"> They did have guards on them, so they could have been dangerous.</div><div id="00:23:24.680" class="transcript_line"> If they didn&#039;t have the guards on them.</div><div id="00:23:27.680" class="transcript_line"> They were quite a safe factory, I think.</div><div id="00:23:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Were you made aware of health and safety?</div><div id="00:23:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Were there any accidents were you aware of?</div><div id="00:23:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember anybody having an accident, no.</div><div id="00:23:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember any of the rules and regulations?</div><div id="00:23:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Not really.</div><div id="00:23:53.680" class="transcript_line"> What about the facilities in the factory?</div><div id="00:23:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Was the factory heated? Was it lit?</div><div id="00:24:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:03.680" class="transcript_line"> What about other facilities?</div><div id="00:24:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had toilets.</div><div id="00:24:07.680" class="transcript_line"> There were other wrong toilets.</div><div id="00:24:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what we used to do for lunch.</div><div id="00:24:17.680" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t remember if there was a canteen on them?</div><div id="00:24:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think there was a canteen there.</div><div id="00:24:22.680" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t go there for breaks, but we went there for lunch.</div><div id="00:24:25.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:27.680" class="transcript_line"> What did you do during breaks then?</div><div id="00:24:30.680" class="transcript_line"> We usually took something, went to a toilet,</div><div id="00:24:32.680" class="transcript_line"> and had a cup of tea there, you know.</div><div id="00:24:35.680" class="transcript_line"> But going back now, this is six-odd years.</div><div id="00:24:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Things are not really as cut and dried as I&#039;d like to tell you they were.</div><div id="00:24:45.680" class="transcript_line"> You remember, it does go a little bit easy after six-odd years.</div><div id="00:24:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, no, you&#039;re doing really well.</div><div id="00:24:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, I know you weren&#039;t there very long, but how many days did you work a week?</div><div id="00:25:07.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked full time.</div><div id="00:25:09.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was five days a week?</div><div id="00:25:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Was there any weekend work?</div><div id="00:25:13.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:25:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Or shift work?</div><div id="00:25:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Not women, anyway.</div><div id="00:25:19.680" class="transcript_line"> I never did shift work.</div><div id="00:25:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Did the factory, did it shut on the weekend, do you think, or you don&#039;t remember?</div><div id="00:25:32.680" class="transcript_line"> I should imagine some of the men worked on the weekend, you know, to get overtime.</div><div id="00:25:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I never worked anyway, just the five days.</div><div id="00:25:44.680" class="transcript_line"> So you never did overtime or anything like that?</div><div id="00:25:46.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:25:48.680" class="transcript_line"> So you were allowed to talk while you worked?</div><div id="00:25:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:25:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And you said you sang when you worked?</div><div id="00:25:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;d sing sometimes.</div><div id="00:25:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they put records on?</div><div id="00:25:58.680" class="transcript_line"> No, not really.</div><div id="00:26:00.680" class="transcript_line"> It was too noisy to put records on, you know.</div><div id="00:26:02.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was just somebody in the factory standing?</div><div id="00:26:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sitting alongside you, yes.</div><div id="00:26:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what you sang?</div><div id="00:26:10.680" class="transcript_line"> A lot of different songs in those days.</div><div id="00:26:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember anything?</div><div id="00:26:14.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:16.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean most of the songs then were all wartime songs, you know, that we picked up during the war.</div><div id="00:26:23.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t remember what songs they were.</div><div id="00:26:25.680" class="transcript_line"> But I will tell you that every song I learned, I still can sing, all the words.</div><div id="00:26:31.680" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t forget songs, do you?</div><div id="00:26:33.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:34.680" class="transcript_line"> What we learned when we were young.</div><div id="00:26:36.680" class="transcript_line"> But I mean the songs that come out today, there&#039;s no words for them, is there?</div><div id="00:26:39.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:42.680" class="transcript_line"> So were they like Gracie Field songs or Vera Lynn songs, that kind of thing?</div><div id="00:26:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Probably, yes.</div><div id="00:26:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it wasn&#039;t long after the war, like, was it?</div><div id="00:26:50.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:51.680" class="transcript_line"> It was only a couple of years.</div><div id="00:26:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any holidays while you were there?</div><div id="00:27:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember?</div><div id="00:27:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I worked until the holidays.</div><div id="00:27:07.680" class="transcript_line"> That was in the July.</div><div id="00:27:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I started there after the Christmas and I worked there until the July full time.</div><div id="00:27:13.680" class="transcript_line"> And I finished then.</div><div id="00:27:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, in those days you were entitled to six weeks&#039; wages prior to having a baby and six weeks afterwards.</div><div id="00:27:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, it was more than six weeks to go.</div><div id="00:27:30.680" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going up to the door and signing on the door.</div><div id="00:27:34.680" class="transcript_line"> The first week she tried to send me over to Rickers and I said, I can&#039;t get transport over there.</div><div id="00:27:39.680" class="transcript_line"> That was it.</div><div id="00:27:40.680" class="transcript_line"> So the second time I went up she said, what is your trouble?</div><div id="00:27:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Are you pregnant?</div><div id="00:27:45.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s not trouble, I said, but I&#039;m pregnant, yes.</div><div id="00:27:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you don&#039;t want a job, do you?</div><div id="00:27:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I said, I said, I&#039;ve got until November to go, I said.</div><div id="00:27:54.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, three months&#039; work is better than nothing, I said.</div><div id="00:27:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Or three months&#039; toll, I said, I don&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:28:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, I&#039;d fill it in.</div><div id="00:28:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So I had six weeks&#039; toll before I went on the sick then.</div><div id="00:28:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Why did you leave Lyons then?</div><div id="00:28:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, I was getting quite big then, you know, and by the time the fortnight holidays would have been over, I was just about ready to give up work then.</div><div id="00:28:23.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you can&#039;t do factory work when you&#039;re very heavily pregnant.</div><div id="00:28:28.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I was just wondering, because you said you worked up to the holidays.</div><div id="00:28:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Up to the holidays, yes.</div><div id="00:28:34.680" class="transcript_line"> But you were still looking for work.</div><div id="00:28:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t really want work.</div><div id="00:28:38.680" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted a couple of weeks grace until I had my pregnancy money, maternity money, rather.</div><div id="00:28:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:28:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:28:51.680" class="transcript_line"> My, you know, there were girls going up to the door then with babies in prams and signing on for years after they&#039;d had the baby, and they got away with it.</div><div id="00:29:02.680" class="transcript_line"> I just didn&#039;t have the cheek to do it.</div><div id="00:29:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of having bank holidays with pay while you were there?</div><div id="00:29:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had my holiday pay because I was finishing then, you see.</div><div id="00:29:22.680" class="transcript_line"> So you think you would have had paid bank holidays?</div><div id="00:29:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they were having bank holiday pay then, yes.</div><div id="00:29:37.680" class="transcript_line"> What was the attitude, do you think, of the factory to women who had children?</div><div id="00:29:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Could you have gone back to work there with children if you wanted to?</div><div id="00:29:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, if you want somebody to look after your children for you, yes.</div><div id="00:29:53.680" class="transcript_line"> No reason why you couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:29:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there were girls working with me then that had children, yes.</div><div id="00:29:58.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, probably living next door to their parents or sisters or whatever, yes.</div><div id="00:30:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was perfectly okay in the factory.</div><div id="00:30:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh, yes.</div><div id="00:30:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they have any kind of childcare facilities?</div><div id="00:30:08.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:30:10.680" class="transcript_line"> No such thing in those days, no.</div><div id="00:30:13.680" class="transcript_line"> So what was the age of the women working there? Did they go from very young to...?</div><div id="00:30:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, my best friend worked until she was 60, all her life in the factory because she never had children.</div><div id="00:30:25.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was the range. And she had a sister-in-law who lived with her and she worked in the factory until she was 60.</div><div id="00:30:33.680" class="transcript_line"> And that was in Triang?</div><div id="00:30:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:30:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Are you still in touch with some of the people who worked there?</div><div id="00:30:40.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all dead, love.</div><div id="00:30:45.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, even some of the girls that were living here, a lot younger than me, they&#039;ve all died.</div><div id="00:30:51.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m past myself, I&#039;d put it that way.</div><div id="00:30:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:30:57.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel about the time you worked in Triang? Tell me how you felt about it.</div><div id="00:31:02.680" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:31:05.680" class="transcript_line"> What did you enjoy most about it, do you think?</div><div id="00:31:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, with an office job you&#039;ve got to keep on going and I don&#039;t know what it is.</div><div id="00:31:13.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a different attitude, a different atmosphere to office work.</div><div id="00:31:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Was that the people you worked with, you think?</div><div id="00:31:23.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. It was just a different kind of work.</div><div id="00:31:29.680" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, over the years I went to other offices, I worked in different shops.</div><div id="00:31:35.680" class="transcript_line"> You had to do all sorts of jobs to suit your family then.</div><div id="00:31:38.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, when you want somebody to look after the children, right, you took a job.</div><div id="00:31:43.680" class="transcript_line"> So you told me after having your children and a bit later on you went back to a factory.</div><div id="00:31:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell me about that?</div><div id="00:31:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the time of the disaster I was working in a co-op locally.</div><div id="00:32:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, then I tried to get a job in the co-op part time,</div><div id="00:32:07.680" class="transcript_line"> but the management that I had down here, he didn&#039;t want part time as he wanted full time.</div><div id="00:32:13.680" class="transcript_line"> In the meantime I got a job then in an office, a garage in Merthyr, in the store&#039;s office.</div><div id="00:32:22.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for many years and I only left there to live, to work in a high taxi because they were going to pull the factory down.</div><div id="00:32:35.680" class="transcript_line"> There was a culvert running under it and they were talking about taking it down.</div><div id="00:32:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was looking for a job from there, but I worked there quite a few years, but it was all part time.</div><div id="00:32:47.680" class="transcript_line"> What factory was this now?</div><div id="00:32:49.680" class="transcript_line"> No, it was a garage. Howells garage in Merthyr and I worked in the store&#039;s office there.</div><div id="00:32:59.680" class="transcript_line"> As I said, I had no intentions of ever leaving. I was only doing part time work because my son was working and things.</div><div id="00:33:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course then everybody was looking for jobs because we knew the garage was coming down</div><div id="00:33:15.680" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s why I went to work back then full time in High Tatchy.</div><div id="00:33:20.680" class="transcript_line"> What was it when you started working there?</div><div id="00:33:24.680" class="transcript_line"> GC, in Merthyr it was. Eventually High Tatchy took over half of it.</div><div id="00:33:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Then they transferred us from Merthyr then over to Hirawayn and then High Tatchy took it over all then.</div><div id="00:33:43.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to say they were quite a good firm to work for.</div><div id="00:33:47.680" class="transcript_line"> What was the difference between when you worked for GC in Merthyr and when you worked for High Tatchy in Hirawayn?</div><div id="00:33:55.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a different kind of factory to start with. It was a cleaner factory. High Tatchy was spotlessly cleaned.</div><div id="00:34:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Other than that, you still had to do your job, you still had to do your number every day.</div><div id="00:34:10.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you get to Hirawayn to work?</div><div id="00:34:17.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a bus. First of all we had a bus coming around here, then they stopped that.</div><div id="00:34:25.680" class="transcript_line"> We had to go from here up to the next village to catch it. Then we had a bus all the way over.</div><div id="00:34:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But eventually I started using my car. I had a car then.</div><div id="00:34:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Last go off we didn&#039;t have a bus. In fact the lady that used to take us to work to start with,</div><div id="00:34:42.680" class="transcript_line"> my mother lived over there and she was a widow. She used to come down here and pick the two of us up here.</div><div id="00:34:50.680" class="transcript_line"> She picked another one up then in Merthyr. She used to take about four of us to work every day.</div><div id="00:34:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Margaret, she was a lovely person, a quiet woman.</div><div id="00:35:04.680" class="transcript_line"> She took us now and then when the holidays came, she took her mother, picked her mother up and took her to Ponty in Merthyr.</div><div id="00:35:13.680" class="transcript_line"> They crashed down in Eddwardsville and she got killed.</div><div id="00:35:17.680" class="transcript_line"> I had to take my car to work. There was no other way of getting there.</div><div id="00:35:23.680" class="transcript_line"> So for the last year or two I took my car to work then.</div><div id="00:35:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean at the time my husband was working in Hoovers and he was on shift so he managed with the one car then.</div><div id="00:35:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe what GEC was like to work in Merthyr?</div><div id="00:35:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, quite a good factory.</div><div id="00:35:46.680" class="transcript_line"> What did you make?</div><div id="00:35:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, in Merthyr, when they started off in Merthyr, they were only making what they called the boards.</div><div id="00:35:58.680" class="transcript_line"> You put all the circuit boards.</div><div id="00:36:04.680" class="transcript_line"> And my job was cutting the little wires off the back, making sure there were no blind ants soldering them and then they&#039;d be passed over.</div><div id="00:36:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I did that for a couple of years because when we went over to Hirwine, they were making the complete sets over there.</div><div id="00:36:22.680" class="transcript_line"> And although I went to work on the circuit board to start with, I went on other jobs after and they were all nice clean jobs.</div><div id="00:36:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a uniform to work in both places?</div><div id="00:36:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I got one with me and an uniform I think.</div><div id="00:36:44.680" class="transcript_line"> So did they provide the uniform for you?</div><div id="00:36:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we didn&#039;t pay for the uniform.</div><div id="00:36:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember again your first day at work when you went to GEC? What was it like?</div><div id="00:37:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, the first time I went to GEC it was so different from anything I&#039;d done for many, many years.</div><div id="00:37:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Whatever it was, it was strange, but you know, you get used to things after a day or two don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:37:16.680" class="transcript_line"> What year was that then?</div><div id="00:37:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I was 49, so 28. 38, 48, 58, 68, 70, 77 was it?</div><div id="00:37:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in 1967 I went over there. I was 49 when I went there, see, that&#039;s how I know.</div><div id="00:37:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And I joined the union then and started paying a full stamp then because up until then I&#039;d been paid whatever.</div><div id="00:37:44.680" class="transcript_line"> If I was out sick I was always paid in the office.</div><div id="00:37:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Is that why you joined the union?</div><div id="00:37:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. I never belonged to one before. Well, if you&#039;re in small firms you didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:38:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Was it mainly a women workforce in GEC?</div><div id="00:38:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I would say mainly, but there were still a lot of men there, yes.</div><div id="00:38:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Again, did you do the same kind of jobs?</div><div id="00:38:16.680" class="transcript_line"> The men were mostly the foremen and the chargers and we had quite a few young Japanese trainees there, you know.</div><div id="00:38:24.680" class="transcript_line"> We used to send them over here to be trained and then they&#039;d send them back home.</div><div id="00:38:28.680" class="transcript_line"> In GEC now?</div><div id="00:38:30.680" class="transcript_line"> No, in Itachi.</div><div id="00:38:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, okay, yes.</div><div id="00:38:34.680" class="transcript_line"> In Itachi.</div><div id="00:38:36.680" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got to say this, they got on well with the Welsh boys that they were working with.</div><div id="00:38:42.680" class="transcript_line"> The Japanese?</div><div id="00:38:44.680" class="transcript_line"> The Japanese boys, they were very, very sociable boys.</div><div id="00:38:48.680" class="transcript_line"> And I say this now, you know, get friendly with the local boys and the boys would take them out for a drink in the night.</div><div id="00:38:56.680" class="transcript_line"> But once the Japanese found out they were going out for a drink, they were sent back home.</div><div id="00:39:02.680" class="transcript_line"> That was frowned upon.</div><div id="00:39:04.680" class="transcript_line"> But you went there when you were a bit older. How long were you in GEC before you went to Itachi, before you became Itachi men?</div><div id="00:39:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, about forty, forty-nine.</div><div id="00:39:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, quite a couple of years before we were taken over by Itachi, yes.</div><div id="00:39:30.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember how many.</div><div id="00:39:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to train for this job, the GEC job?</div><div id="00:39:36.680" class="transcript_line"> No, not really.</div><div id="00:39:38.680" class="transcript_line"> You just picked it up?</div><div id="00:39:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:39:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And what was he, so can you remember how much you were paid then a week when you started now in GEC in Merthyr?</div><div id="00:39:54.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:39:58.680" class="transcript_line"> But perhaps two or three years ago I would have told you.</div><div id="00:40:02.680" class="transcript_line"> I know when I, it was nearly double.</div><div id="00:40:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I went to, no, wait a minute now, I went to work full time and I was having double what I was having part time.</div><div id="00:40:16.680" class="transcript_line"> More than double, so I was, you know, I felt quite well off when I went there.</div><div id="00:40:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what you had in Itachi then when you went there?</div><div id="00:40:26.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I mean over the years it was going up and up and up, you know.</div><div id="00:40:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But there wasn&#039;t a leap up or anything?</div><div id="00:40:32.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, not really.</div><div id="00:40:34.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a kind of gradual?</div><div id="00:40:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:38.680" class="transcript_line"> But it went up every year then?</div><div id="00:40:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, like everybody else&#039;s isn&#039;t it, it goes up every year.</div><div id="00:40:44.680" class="transcript_line"> The only thing is we did have to pay our own bus fare over to Hirwaen. We had to provide our own transport.</div><div id="00:40:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did you?</div><div id="00:40:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:40:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Was that expensive?</div><div id="00:40:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, having a special bus, it wasn&#039;t too bad, you know, but I mean I can&#039;t remember now what we paid.</div><div id="00:41:05.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was a special bus put on by Itachi?</div><div id="00:41:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:41:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:41:11.680" class="transcript_line"> It was worked out for, well, whoever was using it before I started and it was a local bus anyway that started down the valley and picked us up.</div><div id="00:41:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And then picked us up in Merthyrn and then took us over.</div><div id="00:41:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Were there other industries over in Hirwaen that had Itachi?</div><div id="00:41:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, quite a lot, yes.</div><div id="00:41:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So there was a lot of you going by bus over there?</div><div id="00:41:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Most of the ones on our bus were going to Itachi, but we did have an odd one or two working in other factories there, yes.</div><div id="00:41:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And you joined the union when you entered GC. Do you remember which union it was?</div><div id="00:41:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I think we had a, I don&#039;t think there was much of a choice. It was something to do with electrical works here.</div><div id="00:42:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the name of it, no.</div><div id="00:42:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you feel the workers were fairly treated there in GC?</div><div id="00:42:16.680" class="transcript_line"> I think so, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:42:18.680" class="transcript_line"> And what about Itachi afterwards?</div><div id="00:42:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:42:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they accept the union when you went over there?</div><div id="00:42:24.680" class="transcript_line"> No, then. Well, the Japs, I think, were compelled to accept the union because the union was going before they got there.</div><div id="00:42:34.680" class="transcript_line"> But as I told you, when they first came and took over, they said, too many whiteheads here.</div><div id="00:42:42.680" class="transcript_line"> They meant grey-haired women.</div><div id="00:42:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But of course, you know, youngsters, they go down the toilet, they have a cigarette, they&#039;re down there ten minutes, quarter of an hour.</div><div id="00:42:52.680" class="transcript_line"> If we went to the toilet, we were back in two minutes. And whether they noticed that or what, we don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:42:59.680" class="transcript_line"> So after a couple of months, they said they would like to withdraw their statement, whiteheads work well.</div><div id="00:43:08.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we have.</div><div id="00:43:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Did your experience pay off as well, do you think? You know, just life experience?</div><div id="00:43:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think so, too, yes.</div><div id="00:43:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think the older women were quite quick at work?</div><div id="00:43:24.680" class="transcript_line"> It isn&#039;t that we were quicker than the young ones, but we stuck at it.</div><div id="00:43:30.680" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t go out the toilet back and forth all day like the youngsters.</div><div id="00:43:34.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the youngsters were very smart and, you know, quick, doing their job.</div><div id="00:43:39.680" class="transcript_line"> What were the conditions like in First GC and then Itashi?</div><div id="00:43:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Would you say it was a good working environment?</div><div id="00:43:51.680" class="transcript_line"> On the whole, yes, I think.</div><div id="00:43:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Only one thing I can remember, when we were in Merthyn, I think it was,</div><div id="00:44:03.680" class="transcript_line"> and you know, the printed circuit board comes up and it goes over a solder bath</div><div id="00:44:10.680" class="transcript_line"> and then the woman takes them off and puts them in a bin</div><div id="00:44:15.680" class="transcript_line"> and then we take them from there and do it.</div><div id="00:44:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, this particular day, I said to her, Gwen,</div><div id="00:44:22.680" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s something falling down on me all the time, she said.</div><div id="00:44:27.680" class="transcript_line"> And all of a sudden, they were maggots.</div><div id="00:44:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Evidently, a pigeon or whatever had been up there</div><div id="00:44:37.680" class="transcript_line"> and the fumes from the solder bath must have killed it.</div><div id="00:44:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And it had died there and it had gone rotten</div><div id="00:44:45.680" class="transcript_line"> and they had just covered them.</div><div id="00:44:47.680" class="transcript_line"> They had to go up to have a look, the men had to go up</div><div id="00:44:49.680" class="transcript_line"> and there was a pigeon up there full of maggots and falling on her as she was working.</div><div id="00:44:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Of course, they could kill it, that would have been smartish, yes.</div><div id="00:45:01.680" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s a solder bath? Can you explain that to me?</div><div id="00:45:05.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bath of boiling solder and the circuit boards,</div><div id="00:45:17.680" class="transcript_line"> they would come up on a track and it would just about fit over it like that</div><div id="00:45:23.680" class="transcript_line"> and it would go round like that and then she&#039;d pick them off as they were coming off then.</div><div id="00:45:29.680" class="transcript_line"> What it meant was the little feet of all the, what girl,</div><div id="00:45:34.680" class="transcript_line"> were just touching the solder bath.</div><div id="00:45:37.680" class="transcript_line"> And then of course, once it had gone past, the solder bath was still there boiling all day.</div><div id="00:45:43.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a hot job, that was, but she never complained.</div><div id="00:45:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Was it usually women who did that job?</div><div id="00:45:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:45:53.680" class="transcript_line"> So you did the kind of, did the women usually do the kind of micro?</div><div id="00:45:58.680" class="transcript_line"> When I was working, I worked with a screen.</div><div id="00:46:04.680" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t see the little pin on the, what they call dry joints.</div><div id="00:46:09.680" class="transcript_line"> As it went over the solder, perhaps there would be a bubble or something</div><div id="00:46:14.680" class="transcript_line"> and it would burst and you&#039;d have a dry joint.</div><div id="00:46:16.680" class="transcript_line"> And they had to be re-solidated before it would go any further then.</div><div id="00:46:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Was that hard on your eyes?</div><div id="00:46:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, not because we had it like a frame and we used to put it behind there,</div><div id="00:46:27.680" class="transcript_line"> we used to work with it under a frame, yeah.</div><div id="00:46:30.680" class="transcript_line"> My eyesight was pretty good.</div><div id="00:46:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Was the work dangerous in any way?</div><div id="00:46:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, having boiling solder, it could have been I suppose,</div><div id="00:46:42.680" class="transcript_line"> but we didn&#039;t regard it as dangerous at all, no.</div><div id="00:46:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Were you made aware of health and safety once again?</div><div id="00:46:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose that whoever arranged all this,</div><div id="00:46:55.680" class="transcript_line"> they were aware of the health and the safety of the staff.</div><div id="00:46:59.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember anything happening that was dangerous anyway, no.</div><div id="00:47:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Except the poor old pigeon.</div><div id="00:47:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Except the poor old pigeon up atop.</div><div id="00:47:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they have time in motion in those days as well?</div><div id="00:47:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:47:18.680" class="transcript_line"> You had a certain amount to do, yeah.</div><div id="00:47:21.680" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you what they did do, they used to pay us a bonus.</div><div id="00:47:27.680" class="transcript_line"> If we were early every day.</div><div id="00:47:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, there was no fault of ours if we were late.</div><div id="00:47:33.680" class="transcript_line"> It would be the bus at fault,</div><div id="00:47:36.680" class="transcript_line"> but we still had to be there early every day to get this one bonus, yeah.</div><div id="00:47:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember how much that was?</div><div id="00:47:45.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:47:46.680" class="transcript_line"> A couple of bobics.</div><div id="00:47:49.680" class="transcript_line"> What were the facilities like in GZ and then in Hitachi, you know?</div><div id="00:47:53.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a nurse, yeah.</div><div id="00:47:56.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a nurse in the both places.</div><div id="00:47:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Toilets?</div><div id="00:48:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, lovely toilets, clean toilets.</div><div id="00:48:03.680" class="transcript_line"> And what about a canteen?</div><div id="00:48:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And a lovely canteen, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:07.680" class="transcript_line"> In both places?</div><div id="00:48:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Would you say Hitachi was?</div><div id="00:48:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Hitachi had a very good canteen there, yes.</div><div id="00:48:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Would you say you had better facilities in Hitachi?</div><div id="00:48:18.680" class="transcript_line"> I think so, yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:20.680" class="transcript_line"> How was the relationship between the workers and the management of Hitachi?</div><div id="00:48:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, the Japanese management, we had little to do with them.</div><div id="00:48:38.680" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have any conversation with them at all.</div><div id="00:48:41.680" class="transcript_line"> It was all done through our foremen and our charge-hands.</div><div id="00:48:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But they seemed to get on well.</div><div id="00:48:47.680" class="transcript_line"> They used to have meetings and all this and that and sort things out, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Would you say they were good employers?</div><div id="00:48:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I thought so, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:58.680" class="transcript_line"> And fair?</div><div id="00:48:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:49:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Were people allowed to talk while they worked?</div><div id="00:49:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you could talk, but I mean, you had to concentrate more on that job than what we did in lines.</div><div id="00:49:16.680" class="transcript_line"> What about smoking and things like that?</div><div id="00:49:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you weren&#039;t allowed to smoke.</div><div id="00:49:20.680" class="transcript_line"> You had to go outside to smoke, to the toilet to smoke.</div><div id="00:49:25.680" class="transcript_line"> That didn&#039;t matter to me at all.</div><div id="00:49:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think you&#039;ve suffered any long-term health effects from working from any other factories?</div><div id="00:49:34.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:49:37.680" class="transcript_line"> What was the relationship again between the women and the men in, first of all, GC and then Hitachi?</div><div id="00:49:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Was that a good relationship?</div><div id="00:49:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, most of the men did different types of work in Hitachi to start with.</div><div id="00:49:56.680" class="transcript_line"> It was more skilled, what the men were doing.</div><div id="00:50:00.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were working on television.</div><div id="00:50:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Mine was different to just a board they were working on.</div><div id="00:50:06.680" class="transcript_line"> They were working on televisions, the men were.</div><div id="00:50:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they earn a lot more money than you?</div><div id="00:50:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I should imagine so, yes.</div><div id="00:50:14.680" class="transcript_line"> But you weren&#039;t aware of what they earned?</div><div id="00:50:16.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:50:21.680" class="transcript_line"> When you worked, you said you were married twice.</div><div id="00:50:27.680" class="transcript_line"> How did your husband&#039;s, different husband&#039;s...</div><div id="00:50:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, my second husband, I didn&#039;t get married to until I was 70.</div><div id="00:50:35.680" class="transcript_line"> That was years later, that was.</div><div id="00:50:37.680" class="transcript_line"> What was the reaction of your husband to the fact that you worked?</div><div id="00:50:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Was he all right with that?</div><div id="00:50:45.680"

No.</div><div id="01:00:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Looking back now, how do you feel about the time you worked in these factories you worked in?</div><div id="01:00:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, as far as I was concerned, it was all good for me. We got things that we couldn&#039;t have got otherwise.</div><div id="01:01:07.680" class="transcript_line"> My husband was a fanatic about changing his car. So of course, when I worked, it was to change his car. My first husband that was.</div><div id="01:01:17.680" class="transcript_line"> What about you? What did you get out of it?</div><div id="01:01:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had holidays and whatever I wanted in the house I had.</div><div id="01:01:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not always as old-fashioned as this because, as I say, my first husband&#039;s gone now 23 years. There&#039;s nothing been done since he&#039;s gone.</div><div id="01:01:42.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great, Marge. Thank you very much.</div><div id="01:01:44.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome, love, if I&#039;ve been any use to you.</div></div></p>
