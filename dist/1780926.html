    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I wonder if you can just say who you are and where we are.</div><div id="00:00:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;m Martin Morgan and I&#039;m secretary of the Black Rock Labenet Fisherman&#039;s Association,</div><div id="00:00:11.280" class="transcript_line"> an association of traditional salmon fishermen founded by my great grandfather William Corbyn</div><div id="00:00:16.520" class="transcript_line"> on his return from the First World War.</div><div id="00:00:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Now I didn&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:00:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s...</div><div id="00:00:22.800" class="transcript_line"> He did...</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> They fished before that, but when they returned from the First World War...</div><div id="00:00:30.400" class="transcript_line"> Can I switch this a bit closer, Martin?</div><div id="00:00:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Sorry? Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:33.040" class="transcript_line"> Just so I&#039;m sure it picks it all out.</div><div id="00:00:35.880" class="transcript_line"> When he returned from the First World War, they fished prior to going off to war.</div><div id="00:00:40.640" class="transcript_line"> He was one of four brothers from Chepstow that went to war.</div><div id="00:00:46.160" class="transcript_line"> And he grew up in Chepstow.</div><div id="00:00:49.080" class="transcript_line"> His nickname was Nester because he climbed the cliffs of Chepstow,</div><div id="00:00:54.400" class="transcript_line"> the Chepstow Y, collecting seagulls&#039; eggs for food.</div><div id="00:00:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And that was his nickname.</div><div id="00:00:59.400" class="transcript_line"> And his paddy trick was to jump off the railway dive, actually,</div><div id="00:01:04.080" class="transcript_line"> off the railway bridge that goes across the Y.</div><div id="00:01:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Are you kidding me?</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That was when he was a young boy.</div><div id="00:01:11.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:01:13.720" class="transcript_line"> When they returned from the war, they found that the fishery had been let</div><div id="00:01:18.920" class="transcript_line"> by the Y board, I think it was, at the time, on the fishery,</div><div id="00:01:23.520" class="transcript_line"> to a guy from Gloucester, a merchant from Gloucester, called Purcell,</div><div id="00:01:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Purcell.</div><div id="00:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s records of this in the Newport Museum, I think,</div><div id="00:01:36.680" class="transcript_line"> or the records office.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> When they returned, it had been let by the Y board to this Purcell fella.</div><div id="00:01:42.920" class="transcript_line"> And he said to them, you can fish in the fishery,</div><div id="00:01:47.120" class="transcript_line"> but you&#039;ve got to sell the fish to me at my price.</div><div id="00:01:51.640" class="transcript_line"> So obviously, they weren&#039;t going to have that.</div><div id="00:01:53.880" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s records of a little bit of a fight they wrote to their MP</div><div id="00:02:00.320" class="transcript_line"> in the day, and the sort of powers that be.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s unclear what happened, but shortly afterwards,</div><div id="00:02:05.920" class="transcript_line"> they obtained a lease of such and such a board.</div><div id="00:02:11.720" class="transcript_line"> So they got the fishery back.</div><div id="00:02:13.240" class="transcript_line"> What year was this?</div><div id="00:02:14.520" class="transcript_line"> This would have been around about 1920.</div><div id="00:02:17.600" class="transcript_line"> So again, I&#039;ve got a copy of the actual first lease of the fishery.</div><div id="00:02:28.360" class="transcript_line"> From that day forward, people from Subrote Portscuit Caldicot</div><div id="00:02:33.440" class="transcript_line"> fished on what was the ancient name, was the Gruggy Rocks Fishery.</div><div id="00:02:38.480" class="transcript_line"> And that was our local fishery.</div><div id="00:02:40.080" class="transcript_line"> So every year up until we were stopped in 2007 or 2008,</div><div id="00:02:49.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember which now.</div><div id="00:02:51.960" class="transcript_line"> And they refused to.</div><div id="00:02:53.680" class="transcript_line"> It became like a lease in inverted commas that was renewed every year.</div><div id="00:03:00.960" class="transcript_line"> But there was no formal agreement other than the formal agreement taken out</div><div id="00:03:05.520" class="transcript_line"> all those years ago when my great grandfather took one out.</div><div id="00:03:08.560" class="transcript_line"> So they then insisted that we had a lease.</div><div id="00:03:10.760" class="transcript_line"> So they being?</div><div id="00:03:12.440" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, the Environment Agency Wales.</div><div id="00:03:15.680" class="transcript_line"> The Environment Agency.</div><div id="00:03:16.640" class="transcript_line"> So they refused to let us fish until we signed a lease of sorts.</div><div id="00:03:22.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was negotiated.</div><div id="00:03:24.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s another story.</div><div id="00:03:27.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the fishery, there were nine licenses granted by the Wye Board.</div><div id="00:03:36.800" class="transcript_line"> As I say, people, my great grandfather, Brooke Beasley, John Mason,</div><div id="00:03:46.880" class="transcript_line"> Herbert Williams, Bob.</div><div id="00:03:49.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the names.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a picture of him there in the net.</div><div id="00:03:52.640" class="transcript_line"> They were some of the original fishermen back in the day.</div><div id="00:03:57.040" class="transcript_line"> So when you say fishing, fishery, what sort of fish?</div><div id="00:04:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:04:07.280" class="transcript_line"> The Grungy Rocks fishery and the Black Rock Lave Net fishery is a salmon fishery.</div><div id="00:04:14.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s simply that.</div><div id="00:04:16.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what they were fishing for, salmon.</div><div id="00:04:20.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not anything else.</div><div id="00:04:23.120" class="transcript_line"> But adjacent to that, back in those days and up until roughly the,</div><div id="00:04:32.440" class="transcript_line"> I would say the early 80s, 1980s, there was people also fish with a type of lave net,</div><div id="00:04:39.520" class="transcript_line"> very similar, for whitefish.</div><div id="00:04:42.640" class="transcript_line"> Now, there was no license required for that.</div><div id="00:04:46.880" class="transcript_line"> No license at all.</div><div id="00:04:47.760" class="transcript_line"> People just done it.</div><div id="00:04:48.520" class="transcript_line"> It was a common sight.</div><div id="00:04:50.040" class="transcript_line"> And if you spoke to anybody in the local villages,</div><div id="00:04:53.680" class="transcript_line"> they would fish for whitefish with a lave net.</div><div id="00:04:56.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different to the salmon fishing.</div><div id="00:04:58.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a completely different thing.</div><div id="00:05:00.400" class="transcript_line"> Salmon fishermen wouldn&#039;t be seen dead fishing for whitefish.</div><div id="00:05:05.240" class="transcript_line"> They were fishermen, proper fishermen, if you like.</div><div id="00:05:08.840" class="transcript_line"> But people fished for whitefish, for food for the table.</div><div id="00:05:15.280" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a commercial fishery or anything.</div><div id="00:05:16.960" class="transcript_line"> It was just subsistence.</div><div id="00:05:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And those fish would have been mullets, soul, flounder, and eels, perhaps.</div><div id="00:05:28.600" class="transcript_line"> It was done in a completely different area.</div><div id="00:05:32.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a local area, just offshore.</div><div id="00:05:35.360" class="transcript_line"> But there were different names for these areas, the lubi and the bar,</div><div id="00:05:40.680" class="transcript_line"> the bedwins and the lake.</div><div id="00:05:44.520" class="transcript_line"> They were the whitefish fishing areas.</div><div id="00:05:47.560" class="transcript_line"> But a completely different method, but a very similar net.</div><div id="00:05:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was.</div><div id="00:05:56.440" class="transcript_line"> So when you talk about licensing, this is licensing to fish for salmon?</div><div id="00:06:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:03.040" class="transcript_line"> You needed...</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> This fishery, this area is regarded, is said to be owned...</div><div id="00:06:12.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been handed down through...</div><div id="00:06:15.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it originally belonged to the St. Pierre manor house, the fishery.</div><div id="00:06:22.240" class="transcript_line"> The fishing area, if you like.</div><div id="00:06:25.840" class="transcript_line"> That was then gifted to the Wye Board, which then became the Rivers Authority, is it?</div><div id="00:06:35.480" class="transcript_line"> NRA.</div><div id="00:06:36.240" class="transcript_line"> And then the Environment Agency, and now of late, Natural Resources Wales.</div><div id="00:06:42.840" class="transcript_line"> So the title to the fishery has been handed down.</div><div id="00:06:46.440" class="transcript_line"> So to fish in what is termed a private fishery, you need permission to fish.</div><div id="00:06:53.520" class="transcript_line"> And that was, you know, in the Great Grandfather&#039;s Day lease agreement,</div><div id="00:06:56.920" class="transcript_line"> and then in Aero Day laterally, sort of a lease agreement, permission to fish.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> In addition to that, you then need a license to fish for salmon,</div><div id="00:07:06.040" class="transcript_line"> as a Ron Angler would, a license to fish for salmon.</div><div id="00:07:09.120" class="transcript_line"> So, but you need the two things to be able to fish out here,</div><div id="00:07:12.320" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s deemed a private fishery.</div><div id="00:07:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Now, in the late, I think, late 70s, early 80s,</div><div id="00:07:21.800" class="transcript_line"> the River Board tried to prosecute somebody fishing for whitefish with a lathe net.</div><div id="00:07:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Now...</div><div id="00:07:30.040" class="transcript_line"> Here?</div><div id="00:07:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Here, in Subrock.</div><div id="00:07:33.080" class="transcript_line"> Toomla was handled the case, the solicitor.</div><div id="00:07:37.200" class="transcript_line"> The guy&#039;s name was Ted Beaman.</div><div id="00:07:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, as it happens, his nephew fishes with us.</div><div id="00:07:45.280" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got a license to fish, you know, for salmon.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But we can&#039;t get the information off him.</div><div id="00:07:52.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been trying to get...</div><div id="00:07:54.200" class="transcript_line"> They reckon they win the case, but who knows?</div><div id="00:07:57.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s just sitting in the pipeline.</div><div id="00:08:00.160" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to try and get that information</div><div id="00:08:02.320" class="transcript_line"> regarding that sort of aspect of the fishing.</div><div id="00:08:04.840" class="transcript_line"> But they tried to prosecute him.</div><div id="00:08:06.560" class="transcript_line"> It went on for about five years, apparently, this case.</div><div id="00:08:09.920" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:08:10.880" class="transcript_line"> So, but he must have had, what do you call it,</div><div id="00:08:14.520" class="transcript_line"> when you don&#039;t pay for legal advice.</div><div id="00:08:17.680" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, again, that&#039;s another story.</div><div id="00:08:20.120" class="transcript_line"> But it sort of died out anyway.</div><div id="00:08:22.160" class="transcript_line"> You know, things changed.</div><div id="00:08:23.520" class="transcript_line"> People, you know, drifted away from the estuary, perhaps,</div><div id="00:08:27.520" class="transcript_line"> certainly regarding getting fish.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So, before your grandfather came here, what was here?</div><div id="00:08:34.480" class="transcript_line"> There was a fishery here?</div><div id="00:08:37.400" class="transcript_line"> People, local people, would have fished for salmon.</div><div id="00:08:40.120" class="transcript_line"> There was no formal arrangement, as far as I understand,</div><div id="00:08:45.400" class="transcript_line"> that people would have fished for salmon.</div><div id="00:08:48.080" class="transcript_line"> But people probably didn&#039;t know about it.</div><div id="00:08:51.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was just coming from years, years and years back,</div><div id="00:08:56.640" class="transcript_line"> people just fished for salmon.</div><div id="00:08:57.720" class="transcript_line"> They just went out there and fished for salmon.</div><div id="00:08:59.680" class="transcript_line"> But then things, I think, started to get a little bit tighter.</div><div id="00:09:03.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, perhaps after the First World War,</div><div id="00:09:05.680" class="transcript_line"> and things changed as such.</div><div id="00:09:08.280" class="transcript_line"> Because the fishery,</div><div id="00:09:09.760" class="transcript_line"> my great-grandfather&#039;s day was secretive, super secretive.</div><div id="00:09:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was, how can you say?</div><div id="00:09:18.840" class="transcript_line"> They were told, they were explicitly told,</div><div id="00:09:23.160" class="transcript_line"> you know, or knew, not to talk about salmon fishing.</div><div id="00:09:27.040" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:09:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Because of money.</div><div id="00:09:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Because they got money?</div><div id="00:09:31.080" class="transcript_line"> People would be jealous.</div><div id="00:09:31.920" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how much money was involved,</div><div id="00:09:33.320" class="transcript_line"> but they wouldn&#039;t brag about fishing.</div><div id="00:09:36.280" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t tell anybody about fishing.</div><div id="00:09:37.720" class="transcript_line"> And even in my day, sort of when I was a kid,</div><div id="00:09:40.880" class="transcript_line"> if you walked up to Doug Brown, one of the fishermen,</div><div id="00:09:43.800" class="transcript_line"> said, any fish about Doug, he&#039;d have one under his arm.</div><div id="00:09:45.680" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d say, no.</div><div id="00:09:47.400" class="transcript_line"> They were that sort of, and fast.</div><div id="00:09:49.960" class="transcript_line"> And nobody outside sub-Rook,</div><div id="00:09:52.760" class="transcript_line"> and possibly probably knew about lay net fishing</div><div id="00:09:54.920" class="transcript_line"> until I came into the fishery, and my brother.</div><div id="00:09:57.440" class="transcript_line"> It was super secretive.</div><div id="00:09:58.880" class="transcript_line"> So nobody would really have known about this fishery.</div><div id="00:10:01.880" class="transcript_line"> So they were quite protective about it.</div><div id="00:10:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Protected about the bounty?</div><div id="00:10:06.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, well, yeah, probably that.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s their patch.</div><div id="00:10:09.400" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t want anybody coming poachers, for instance.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Once you start knowing that there&#039;s people,</div><div id="00:10:14.600" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s fish there, and there&#039;s a way of catching fish,</div><div id="00:10:16.760" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s, you can get out there.</div><div id="00:10:19.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, nobody, it was a deadly dangerous river.</div><div id="00:10:22.440" class="transcript_line"> But if some people knew somebody was making money</div><div id="00:10:27.040" class="transcript_line"> by catching salmon, and there was a way of getting out there,</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d be watched, and people would follow them out there.</div><div id="00:10:32.120" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it&#039;s all, people just kept it close.</div><div id="00:10:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was, as I say, up until, I would say,</div><div id="00:10:40.520" class="transcript_line"> probably, with our first war with the environment agency</div><div id="00:10:44.400" class="transcript_line"> in the late 90s, nobody knew about it</div><div id="00:10:48.280" class="transcript_line"> other than people, local people.</div><div id="00:10:50.480" class="transcript_line"> And then-</div><div id="00:10:51.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really interesting.</div><div id="00:10:52.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s, the only reason people know about it now</div><div id="00:10:56.360" class="transcript_line"> is because the environment agency tried to stop it.</div><div id="00:10:59.400" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been a, you know, a difficult thing,</div><div id="00:11:03.040" class="transcript_line"> but some good has come out of it.</div><div id="00:11:05.520" class="transcript_line"> They sort of, you know, I first,</div><div id="00:11:09.040" class="transcript_line"> the license is, you know, I fished with the license first.</div><div id="00:11:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, fished with the lead net first</div><div id="00:11:17.960" class="transcript_line"> in when I was about 10 years of age.</div><div id="00:11:21.640" class="transcript_line"> I was born in 1960, so I was probably about 1970.</div><div id="00:11:27.080" class="transcript_line"> With your dad?</div><div id="00:11:27.920" class="transcript_line"> No, all the fishing is on my mother&#039;s side of the family.</div><div id="00:11:31.080" class="transcript_line"> So, my mother, my great-grandfather, William Corbyn,</div><div id="00:11:36.480" class="transcript_line"> and my grandfather, Jack Harris,</div><div id="00:11:38.840" class="transcript_line"> all the family grew up in the same house,</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> 13 Cam Road, Subrock, and that was known as HQ,</div><div id="00:11:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Immigrant Grandfather&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:11:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:11:50.520" class="transcript_line"> By locals and-</div><div id="00:11:51.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, everybody.</div><div id="00:11:52.480" class="transcript_line"> Because all the salmon were taken to HQ</div><div id="00:11:59.880" class="transcript_line"> prior to being sent off to Billingsgate or wherever</div><div id="00:12:03.360" class="transcript_line"> back in the day.</div><div id="00:12:04.760" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d be tipped into a tin bath.</div><div id="00:12:08.800" class="transcript_line"> My mother used to say that, you know,</div><div id="00:12:10.320" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;d have to wait until the bath was empty</div><div id="00:12:12.480" class="transcript_line"> before they could have a bath.</div><div id="00:12:14.280" class="transcript_line"> So, the back kitchen was where they brought the fish.</div><div id="00:12:19.360" class="transcript_line"> What, like cart or?</div><div id="00:12:21.240" class="transcript_line"> No, no, well, carry it.</div><div id="00:12:22.440" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t have that many fish,</div><div id="00:12:23.600" class="transcript_line"> but they would just bring, any fish they caught</div><div id="00:12:25.800" class="transcript_line"> would be taken there and then taken off</div><div id="00:12:28.320" class="transcript_line"> to Port Ski with a station,</div><div id="00:12:29.840" class="transcript_line"> because there was a station there, you know,</div><div id="00:12:31.800" class="transcript_line"> going back to the 20s and 30s,</div><div id="00:12:34.840" class="transcript_line"> that sort of date, like, you know, sort of a long time ago.</div><div id="00:12:42.160" class="transcript_line"> But 13 Cam Road, I spent a lot of time there</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and sort of grew up there.</div><div id="00:12:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I was always there, seeing my grandparents,</div><div id="00:12:51.240" class="transcript_line"> and there was always a lathe net there.</div><div id="00:12:53.880" class="transcript_line"> My mother had three brothers,</div><div id="00:12:57.160" class="transcript_line"> and one of them was quite a keen fish,</div><div id="00:13:00.240" class="transcript_line"> well, actually two of them were fishermen.</div><div id="00:13:03.360" class="transcript_line"> One was quite keen.</div><div id="00:13:04.680" class="transcript_line"> They never had licenses, salmon licenses,</div><div id="00:13:06.560" class="transcript_line"> but they fished for whitefish,</div><div id="00:13:09.520" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d always been nagging to be taken out.</div><div id="00:13:12.080" class="transcript_line"> So, one beautiful summer&#039;s day,</div><div id="00:13:14.080" class="transcript_line"> I was taken out onto the estuary.</div><div id="00:13:17.640" class="transcript_line"> In a boat?</div><div id="00:13:18.480" class="transcript_line"> No, we walked out from Severock across the Roman camp there,</div><div id="00:13:22.040" class="transcript_line"> down the foreshore, and then through the mud and gravel</div><div id="00:13:26.680" class="transcript_line"> out to a place they call the Luby, L-U-B-E-Y.</div><div id="00:13:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And we fished the tide out,</div><div id="00:13:36.680" class="transcript_line"> and we stood on top of the camp,</div><div id="00:13:38.160" class="transcript_line"> and my uncle said to me,</div><div id="00:13:39.880" class="transcript_line"> as soon as the black stones show,</div><div id="00:13:41.880" class="transcript_line"> the black bedwinds start to show,</div><div id="00:13:44.560" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when we start walking.</div><div id="00:13:45.960" class="transcript_line"> It was quite an easy walk then, sort of through the mud.</div><div id="00:13:48.760" class="transcript_line"> I never had waders, I&#039;m not quite sure if he did,</div><div id="00:13:52.440" class="transcript_line"> but you&#039;d have an old pair of boots,</div><div id="00:13:57.240" class="transcript_line"> some jeans, and a T-shirt.</div><div id="00:14:00.720" class="transcript_line"> And the way that was done,</div><div id="00:14:02.920" class="transcript_line"> you had a bit of a lathe net cobbled together,</div><div id="00:14:05.920" class="transcript_line"> nothing like a salmon fishing lathe net.</div><div id="00:14:08.800" class="transcript_line"> The lathe net, was it a monofilament one,</div><div id="00:14:10.760" class="transcript_line"> or it was a XCM?</div><div id="00:14:13.840" class="transcript_line"> The one my uncle had was made from some sort of,</div><div id="00:14:16.840" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t hemp, I don&#039;t think, but it wasn&#039;t mono.</div><div id="00:14:19.800" class="transcript_line"> But mine was made, basically made from garden sheeting,</div><div id="00:14:23.280" class="transcript_line"> so that it was just anything we could find to make it</div><div id="00:14:25.600" class="transcript_line"> knock up a bit of a lathe net for me,</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> a little tiny makeshift, half-size,</div><div id="00:14:30.600" class="transcript_line"> tiny lathe net, just to have a go.</div><div id="00:14:32.600" class="transcript_line"> So I was taken out, I fished.</div><div id="00:14:37.080" class="transcript_line"> What you first do, you sort of get to</div><div id="00:14:39.360" class="transcript_line"> where the black bedwinds start,</div><div id="00:14:41.320" class="transcript_line"> and then you wait for a gravel bank called the bar,</div><div id="00:14:45.480" class="transcript_line"> B-A-R, to show.</div><div id="00:14:48.440" class="transcript_line"> So you fish there for about 10 minutes.</div><div id="00:14:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s safe, you mean,</div><div id="00:14:52.120" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when you wait for it to...</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The water level is dropping,</div><div id="00:14:55.360" class="transcript_line"> this is done on a spring tide when you fish a tide out, okay?</div><div id="00:14:58.760" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re waiting, you stood there,</div><div id="00:15:00.640" class="transcript_line"> the water&#039;s up to your waist.</div><div id="00:15:02.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God!</div><div id="00:15:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And you stood there with a net in the water,</div><div id="00:15:06.200" class="transcript_line"> the same principle as the salmon fishing,</div><div id="00:15:07.920" class="transcript_line"> you put your hand in there and you feel for a fish.</div><div id="00:15:10.160" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re not looking for a fish with,</div><div id="00:15:12.360" class="transcript_line"> when they fish for white fish,</div><div id="00:15:13.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re just feeling for a fish going in there.</div><div id="00:15:16.840" class="transcript_line"> And the first fish I caught was a green eel,</div><div id="00:15:19.560" class="transcript_line"> big green eel, about two pound.</div><div id="00:15:21.600" class="transcript_line"> And he asked me if I wanted to keep it, I said, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:23.880" class="transcript_line"> So I picked out the net and dropped it into a Hessian sack.</div><div id="00:15:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Because again, that&#039;s what they used to use,</div><div id="00:15:30.400" class="transcript_line"> Hessian sacks over your shoulder on a string,</div><div id="00:15:33.960" class="transcript_line"> and put it in there.</div><div id="00:15:35.880" class="transcript_line"> As the water level drops there,</div><div id="00:15:38.440" class="transcript_line"> you wade onto the bar,</div><div id="00:15:40.080" class="transcript_line"> and get onto the bar, which is a high gravel bank.</div><div id="00:15:45.360" class="transcript_line"> And then you work your way down there as the tide is dropping.</div><div id="00:15:49.560" class="transcript_line"> One interesting thing in those days was that</div><div id="00:15:52.720" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d probably catch a soul there,</div><div id="00:15:54.480" class="transcript_line"> which is, you know, don&#039;t get too many soul out there</div><div id="00:15:58.040" class="transcript_line"> in the late night.</div><div id="00:15:59.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always floundered.</div><div id="00:16:00.640" class="transcript_line"> But the interesting thing back in the day,</div><div id="00:16:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I can remember saying to him, why is the water red?</div><div id="00:16:06.640" class="transcript_line"> And he said, well, that&#039;s the mill, the baby mill.</div><div id="00:16:10.880" class="transcript_line"> And so you&#039;re up to your waist in what was basically</div><div id="00:16:15.920" class="transcript_line"> the effluent from the mill.</div><div id="00:16:17.080" class="transcript_line"> So the, and it was just pure red, and you could smell it.</div><div id="00:16:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Why red?</div><div id="00:16:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Because that was the color of the effluent</div><div id="00:16:24.280" class="transcript_line"> that used to come out of the paper mill,</div><div id="00:16:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Ashton paper mill at the time.</div><div id="00:16:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:16:27.760" class="transcript_line"> It was pumped out.</div><div id="00:16:29.200" class="transcript_line"> They had a license to discharge effluent.</div><div id="00:16:31.440" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was one hour or before,</div><div id="00:16:34.280" class="transcript_line"> and high tide, and two hours afterwards,</div><div id="00:16:38.480" class="transcript_line"> two and a half hours after.</div><div id="00:16:39.600" class="transcript_line"> You know, don&#039;t quote me on that,</div><div id="00:16:40.880" class="transcript_line"> but it was roughly those sort of times.</div><div id="00:16:43.040" class="transcript_line"> But they pumped it out 24 seven, forever.</div><div id="00:16:47.360" class="transcript_line"> 24 seven.</div><div id="00:16:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And it was filthy down there.</div><div id="00:16:50.720" class="transcript_line"> Dead zone, really.</div><div id="00:16:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Sort of, but-</div><div id="00:16:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Gone now though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Gone now, it&#039;s been closed down for a few years now.</div><div id="00:16:56.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s houses being built on it at the moment.</div><div id="00:16:58.760" class="transcript_line"> But I can remember saying to him, you know, what&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:17:02.200" class="transcript_line"> And he said, obviously, effluent from the mill,</div><div id="00:17:04.040" class="transcript_line"> but you know, it didn&#039;t bat an eye.</div><div id="00:17:05.520" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t think it bad for me to be studying it,</div><div id="00:17:07.960" class="transcript_line"> or I never knew about effluent or paper mills</div><div id="00:17:11.200" class="transcript_line"> and chemicals and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:17:13.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m still here to tell the tale.</div><div id="00:17:15.320" class="transcript_line"> So perhaps it wasn&#039;t that bad.</div><div id="00:17:17.400" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s, do you remember your impressions</div><div id="00:17:20.160" class="transcript_line"> being that first time?</div><div id="00:17:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, I mean, it was just a massive adventure.</div><div id="00:17:24.920" class="transcript_line"> And you know, sort of, and he sort of planted the seed,</div><div id="00:17:28.400" class="transcript_line"> you know, sort of back then.</div><div id="00:17:29.560" class="transcript_line"> And you fished in, and it was so exciting,</div><div id="00:17:34.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, waiting for that fish to sort of bump the net.</div><div id="00:17:36.640" class="transcript_line"> And then you tied his head in a way,</div><div id="00:17:41.560" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re walking down the bar,</div><div id="00:17:43.040" class="transcript_line"> and they said, right, time to go now.</div><div id="00:17:44.800" class="transcript_line"> We walked to the next mark,</div><div id="00:17:46.240" class="transcript_line"> and you sort of walk back up the bar.</div><div id="00:17:49.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now dry, and into what they call the luby.</div><div id="00:17:53.800" class="transcript_line"> And again, it&#039;s like a channel, a channel that dries out.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When you get there, it&#039;s quite wide,</div><div id="00:18:03.200" class="transcript_line"> not much tide running through it.</div><div id="00:18:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Again, the interesting thing about that is that</div><div id="00:18:07.840" class="transcript_line"> where the tide in the estuary ebbs from east to west,</div><div id="00:18:14.240" class="transcript_line"> in the luby goes in the opposite direction.</div><div id="00:18:16.600" class="transcript_line"> It runs out from west to east,</div><div id="00:18:20.440" class="transcript_line"> because in what it is, the higher ground to the west</div><div id="00:18:23.280" class="transcript_line"> of you is sort of draining out through this particular gully.</div><div id="00:18:26.200" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s, I suppose, two or 300 yards wide at the start.</div><div id="00:18:29.760" class="transcript_line"> And then as the tide, the ebbing tide goes on,</div><div id="00:18:32.800" class="transcript_line"> the current, the run gets faster in it.</div><div id="00:18:35.600" class="transcript_line"> And then you start, the fish start to come down,</div><div id="00:18:38.480" class="transcript_line"> and back in the day, you might get 20, 25 flounder,</div><div id="00:18:43.400" class="transcript_line"> a couple of millet, perhaps.</div><div id="00:18:46.560" class="transcript_line"> What are the dangers?</div><div id="00:18:48.640" class="transcript_line"> Dangers, I mean, you get washed off your feet.</div><div id="00:18:51.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we hadn&#039;t heard of life jackets in those days.</div><div id="00:18:54.440" class="transcript_line"> You sort of get cut off by the tide.</div><div id="00:18:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, you just, I mean, that&#039;s,</div><div id="00:19:01.760" class="transcript_line"> did that ever happen to you?</div><div id="00:19:04.880" class="transcript_line"> Cut off by the tide.</div><div id="00:19:06.240" class="transcript_line"> When I was a kid, yeah, I mean, several times,</div><div id="00:19:08.800" class="transcript_line"> we never had tide tables, and sort of,</div><div id="00:19:11.120" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d be out there sort of playing, fishing,</div><div id="00:19:13.720" class="transcript_line"> collecting things, and just exploring generally.</div><div id="00:19:17.360" class="transcript_line"> And several times, we had to swim across gullies,</div><div id="00:19:20.920" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you know, sort of,</div><div id="00:19:24.040" class="transcript_line"> you just don&#039;t think anything of it, do you?</div><div id="00:19:27.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I learned to swim out there.</div><div id="00:19:28.400" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s, you know, your mother,</div><div id="00:19:31.200" class="transcript_line"> and all, keep out the estuary, keep out the estuary,</div><div id="00:19:34.200" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s, you know, a course of all the local boys,</div><div id="00:19:36.920" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s where we spent all our time.</div><div id="00:19:38.160" class="transcript_line"> In the estuary?</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> In the estuary, sort of swimming, exploring,</div><div id="00:19:41.920" class="transcript_line"> fishing, digging bait, collecting, fishing tackle.</div><div id="00:19:45.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s where it all started for me, really.</div><div id="00:19:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Sort of, you know, fishing with a rod and line, hand line.</div><div id="00:19:52.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite funny, really, out fishing with the boys</div><div id="00:19:55.680" class="transcript_line"> on the boat and everything, with rods and lines,</div><div id="00:19:57.720" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, I&#039;m thinking to myself,</div><div id="00:19:59.680" class="transcript_line"> shall I say it, I first started with an hand line.</div><div id="00:20:02.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, we didn&#039;t have a fishing rod.</div><div id="00:20:03.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, you just didn&#039;t have a fishing rod.</div><div id="00:20:05.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, you&#039;d have to make up a bit of a hand line.</div><div id="00:20:08.400" class="transcript_line"> Can you explain to me what a hand line is?</div><div id="00:20:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Hand line, well, just a piece of,</div><div id="00:20:14.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, you&#039;d have a stick, basically,</div><div id="00:20:16.160" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d wind line, any line you could find, basically,</div><div id="00:20:20.040" class="transcript_line"> and a bit of monofilament tied to the end of it.</div><div id="00:20:24.720" class="transcript_line"> And even that, you didn&#039;t, you know,</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t go to tackle shops or anything.</div><div id="00:20:30.480" class="transcript_line"> We just collected stuff that other people lost</div><div id="00:20:33.120" class="transcript_line"> off the foreshore and tied it to the end of a line.</div><div id="00:20:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d dig some garden worms at the back</div><div id="00:20:37.400" class="transcript_line"> of the grandparents&#039; house,</div><div id="00:20:39.560" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d be using garden worms for baits, sort of thing,</div><div id="00:20:43.720" class="transcript_line"> or kipper for cong reels out there.</div><div id="00:20:46.880" class="transcript_line"> So if you were growing up here,</div><div id="00:20:49.280" class="transcript_line"> this is part of your childhood,</div><div id="00:20:51.440" class="transcript_line"> going out there fishing and swimming.</div><div id="00:20:53.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that was it.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, our childhood was, you know,</div><div id="00:20:56.280" class="transcript_line"> when you think about it, pretty tough, I suppose,</div><div id="00:20:58.840" class="transcript_line"> but it was, you know, we had the estuary to play in.</div><div id="00:21:03.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we&#039;d swim in there endlessly.</div><div id="00:21:04.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d swim from the several dock to Black Rock,</div><div id="00:21:07.680" class="transcript_line"> back at Tye Tide, sort of, you know,</div><div id="00:21:10.800" class="transcript_line"> with the last of the flood, we&#039;d get it diving off the dock,</div><div id="00:21:15.400" class="transcript_line"> swim to Black Rock,</div><div id="00:21:16.240" class="transcript_line"> and then go back with the first of the ebb.</div><div id="00:21:18.080" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:21:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Did anyone get into trouble?</div><div id="00:21:21.480" class="transcript_line"> Never, nobody.</div><div id="00:21:23.200" class="transcript_line"> In my time, I never heard of anybody drowning.</div><div id="00:21:26.400" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we had a few close calls.</div><div id="00:21:28.520" class="transcript_line"> I can remember a boy, I won&#039;t mention his name,</div><div id="00:21:32.240" class="transcript_line"> but...</div><div id="00:21:35.040" class="transcript_line"> We were all swimming in the dock,</div><div id="00:21:36.960" class="transcript_line"> with the water from the seven tunnel pumping station</div><div id="00:21:41.200" class="transcript_line"> is pumped out.</div><div id="00:21:42.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a good swimming area in there,</div><div id="00:21:44.800" class="transcript_line"> pretty cold, the spring water,</div><div id="00:21:46.760" class="transcript_line"> but it was high tide,</div><div id="00:21:49.520" class="transcript_line"> and somebody pushed the one boy in,</div><div id="00:21:52.840" class="transcript_line"> and he couldn&#039;t swim.</div><div id="00:21:54.320" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, which they thought was great fun, like.</div><div id="00:21:58.160" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s flapping around in the water,</div><div id="00:22:00.240" class="transcript_line"> floating, quite sort of big lump of a boy,</div><div id="00:22:03.120" class="transcript_line"> you know, one of the bigger boys, like.</div><div id="00:22:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s there in the water flapping around,</div><div id="00:22:08.120" class="transcript_line"> and all of a sudden he said, I can&#039;t swim,</div><div id="00:22:10.920" class="transcript_line"> and he just went straight down, gone.</div><div id="00:22:14.280" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no tide in there as such,</div><div id="00:22:16.520" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s pretty deep water.</div><div id="00:22:17.680" class="transcript_line"> So of course, two or three of the other boys</div><div id="00:22:19.440" class="transcript_line"> dived in to catch hold of him and pull him out.</div><div id="00:22:22.160" class="transcript_line"> And he was so big and strong,</div><div id="00:22:24.040" class="transcript_line"> he was just fighting everybody off.</div><div id="00:22:26.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well that&#039;s a scary bit, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:22:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And then he goes straight back down again,</div><div id="00:22:29.840" class="transcript_line"> straight back, and he didn&#039;t want until he was full of,</div><div id="00:22:32.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, full of water, and sort of quietened down a bit,</div><div id="00:22:34.200" class="transcript_line"> that they were able to sort of drag him out.</div><div id="00:22:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:22:37.120" class="transcript_line"> But that was just part and parcel of the day.</div><div id="00:22:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was, you know, fishing,</div><div id="00:22:42.600" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, as they say, collecting bait,</div><div id="00:22:45.760" class="transcript_line"> collecting, you know, looking for fishing tackle,</div><div id="00:22:48.600" class="transcript_line"> running around the rocks.</div><div id="00:22:49.440" class="transcript_line"> And it had been for your parents and your grandparents too,</div><div id="00:22:52.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, generations.</div><div id="00:22:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh yeah, I mean,</div><div id="00:22:55.560" class="transcript_line"> yeah, they&#039;ve all sort of grown up there,</div><div id="00:22:57.520" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you know,</div><div id="00:22:59.880" class="transcript_line"> it was a pretty idyllic life when you look back at it,</div><div id="00:23:03.360" class="transcript_line"> as far as, you know, you didn&#039;t have to,</div><div id="00:23:05.120" class="transcript_line"> nobody was watching you, you just got on with it,</div><div id="00:23:07.160" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you didn&#039;t, when you went swimming,</div><div id="00:23:09.320" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t have a towel, you&#039;d dry your jumper,</div><div id="00:23:12.400" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you know, that would,</div><div id="00:23:13.920" class="transcript_line"> think nothing of it.</div><div id="00:23:14.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, today, your parents would be horrified</div><div id="00:23:18.720" class="transcript_line"> what we were doing.</div><div id="00:23:19.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re perhaps overly protective, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:23:21.880" class="transcript_line"> but we were just, as long as you come back</div><div id="00:23:24.040" class="transcript_line"> at the end of the day, it was no problem.</div><div id="00:23:26.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have a mobile phone to check, you know, it was strange.</div><div id="00:23:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, I know.</div><div id="00:23:30.400" class="transcript_line"> But, yeah, it was a different world, a different life.</div><div id="00:23:34.440" class="transcript_line"> But, for me, it planted the seed of fishing,</div><div id="00:23:39.640" class="transcript_line"> being taken out there when I was a young boy, come back.</div><div id="00:23:44.480" class="transcript_line"> When I got back, my eel had gone through a hole</div><div id="00:23:47.480" class="transcript_line"> in the corner of the Essie and Sack,</div><div id="00:23:49.800" class="transcript_line"> but we had a few flatfish,</div><div id="00:23:51.520" class="transcript_line"> and my grandmother would cook them up with chips</div><div id="00:23:53.200" class="transcript_line"> in blooming, a great big, I can&#039;t remember it now,</div><div id="00:23:56.240" class="transcript_line"> a great big chip pan full of white fat.</div><div id="00:23:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Whatever it was.</div><div id="00:24:00.520" class="transcript_line"> Every house had one of those.</div><div id="00:24:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so, but she&#039;d cook lovely, beautiful chips,</div><div id="00:24:05.280" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;d fry the flounder up for me,</div><div id="00:24:07.680" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what we used to do.</div><div id="00:24:09.560" class="transcript_line"> So, we went out then, anyway, time went on.</div><div id="00:24:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, I&#039;d sneak out there on my own,</div><div id="00:24:16.120" class="transcript_line"> if I could find that old net and be out there</div><div id="00:24:18.200" class="transcript_line"> with the boys, two or three of us.</div><div id="00:24:20.120" class="transcript_line"> One of the fishermen now, Paul Watkins,</div><div id="00:24:22.400" class="transcript_line"> he would grow up with me, a year or so older than me,</div><div id="00:24:24.760" class="transcript_line"> but he&#039;d come out there, two or three of the other boys.</div><div id="00:24:28.080" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d sneak out there, and we&#039;d be up to all sorts.</div><div id="00:24:30.720" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d find any net we could, and sort of peg it out there,</div><div id="00:24:35.240" class="transcript_line"> and fish with the lathe net, fish with the rods.</div><div id="00:24:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Turn over rocks looking reels.</div><div id="00:24:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Just endless sort of fun.</div><div id="00:24:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Then, of course, you&#039;d have all the life in there,</div><div id="00:24:52.440" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d wind up until about 14,</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and then other things kick in,</div><div id="00:24:55.280" class="transcript_line"> and you sort of drifted away from it.</div><div id="00:24:57.760" class="transcript_line"> And then, exams, school.</div><div id="00:25:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Women.</div><div id="00:25:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Women, yeah, all that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:25:05.920" class="transcript_line"> And then, well, before you knew it, apprentice,</div><div id="00:25:09.240" class="transcript_line"> and then before you got married quite young,</div><div id="00:25:11.360" class="transcript_line"> and sort of house, mortgage quite young.</div><div id="00:25:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And then, I spent the next 20 years,</div><div id="00:25:18.320" class="transcript_line"> until I was about in my late 40s, sorry, 30s,</div><div id="00:25:24.680" class="transcript_line"> working seven days a week.</div><div id="00:25:26.240" class="transcript_line"> So, it was, you know, all of a sudden,</div><div id="00:25:30.720" class="transcript_line"> any thoughts of fishing, really,</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> even the odd rod fishing trip, you know, were gone.</div><div id="00:25:35.320" class="transcript_line"> I had other things on my mind, other sort of things.</div><div id="00:25:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And fishing was forgotten, really.</div><div id="00:25:40.400" class="transcript_line"> It was time moved on.</div><div id="00:25:43.320" class="transcript_line"> And then, in the mid-90s, 1990s, mid to late 1990s,</div><div id="00:25:52.280" class="transcript_line"> we had a phone call from the secretary of the association.</div><div id="00:25:56.600" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t call it,</div><div id="00:25:57.440" class="transcript_line"> they may have still called it a syndicate then.</div><div id="00:26:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Dick Obede, he was the secretary then.</div><div id="00:26:07.880" class="transcript_line"> He was based in the shipyard at Sobrook.</div><div id="00:26:11.720" class="transcript_line"> And he phoned up and he said,</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> would you like to have a license?</div><div id="00:26:19.320" class="transcript_line"> And a late night fishing license?</div><div id="00:26:22.920" class="transcript_line"> And you and your brother?</div><div id="00:26:24.480" class="transcript_line"> And I said, yeah, of course we would.</div><div id="00:26:28.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where they got our names from,</div><div id="00:26:30.160" class="transcript_line"> but at the time, one of the old fishermen,</div><div id="00:26:32.320" class="transcript_line"> Ron Williams and Doug Brown,</div><div id="00:26:35.960" class="transcript_line"> who we vaguely sort of would bump into a new ex-fisherman,</div><div id="00:26:42.440" class="transcript_line"> it was their licenses, basically.</div><div id="00:26:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Because what would happen is that these fishermen</div><div id="00:26:51.320" class="transcript_line"> would stop fishing,</div><div id="00:26:52.640" class="transcript_line"> but they would not give up their license.</div><div id="00:26:55.760" class="transcript_line"> They called it dead man&#039;s shoes, locally,</div><div id="00:26:58.080" class="transcript_line"> because, dead man&#039;s shoes,</div><div id="00:27:00.200" class="transcript_line"> because the license would only sort of turn up</div><div id="00:27:03.720" class="transcript_line"> when they were dead.</div><div id="00:27:05.080" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s one of the reasons</div><div id="00:27:07.800" class="transcript_line"> why the fishery was sort of dying.</div><div id="00:27:10.640" class="transcript_line"> The sort of numbers were dwindling.</div><div id="00:27:12.640" class="transcript_line"> So we had the call off deck, Richard Obede,</div><div id="00:27:17.080" class="transcript_line"> and we said yes.</div><div id="00:27:19.640" class="transcript_line"> And he said, well, what do we do?</div><div id="00:27:23.760" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll just turn up down Black Rock in the fishing season.</div><div id="00:27:27.040" class="transcript_line"> It was basically it.</div><div id="00:27:29.120" class="transcript_line"> So we were rushing around.</div><div id="00:27:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Now we had an idea of how to make a net,</div><div id="00:27:33.760" class="transcript_line"> and so we cobbled together the net the best we could.</div><div id="00:27:39.760" class="transcript_line"> But then Richard Obede,</div><div id="00:27:40.960" class="transcript_line"> he knew of your family&#039;s connections.</div><div id="00:27:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:44.760" class="transcript_line"> They were all several people,</div><div id="00:27:45.960" class="transcript_line"> and sort of they would have known it.</div><div id="00:27:48.880" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t, sort of,</div><div id="00:27:51.880" class="transcript_line"> they were a quite close-knit bunch, really, all of them.</div><div id="00:27:57.880" class="transcript_line"> But they would have heard our names,</div><div id="00:28:00.240" class="transcript_line"> knew we were interested in fishing,</div><div id="00:28:01.720" class="transcript_line"> and so on and so forth,</div><div id="00:28:02.920" class="transcript_line"> and obviously known the family.</div><div id="00:28:06.040" class="transcript_line"> But it was fate, I think, all of it.</div><div id="00:28:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Fate that I was taken in when I was a young boy.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Fate that all of a sudden those licenses</div><div id="00:28:17.640" class="transcript_line"> became available when they did.</div><div id="00:28:19.440" class="transcript_line"> So we grabbed them with both hands,</div><div id="00:28:21.040" class="transcript_line"> and cobbled together a net of sorts,</div><div id="00:28:24.960" class="transcript_line"> and turned up one day on a fishing tide in season.</div><div id="00:28:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Sent a gay dick our money, our licensed money,</div><div id="00:28:34.280" class="transcript_line"> and got our licenses, turned up fishing,</div><div id="00:28:38.840" class="transcript_line"> and we knew Denny Lee, who was still fishing, Bob,</div><div id="00:28:45.520" class="transcript_line"> and Dick rarely fished, I&#039;d never seen him fish.</div><div id="00:28:51.600" class="transcript_line"> But basically when we turned up,</div><div id="00:28:53.080" class="transcript_line"> there was just Dennis Lee and Bob Leonard fishing.</div><div id="00:28:59.280" class="transcript_line"> It was Peter, Peter may have had a license,</div><div id="00:29:02.200" class="transcript_line"> Bob&#039;s brother at the time as well,</div><div id="00:29:04.480" class="transcript_line"> but didn&#039;t see too much of him in the early days.</div><div id="00:29:06.720" class="transcript_line"> So basically it was me, Richard, my brother,</div><div id="00:29:10.560" class="transcript_line"> and Dennis and Bob fishing.</div><div id="00:29:13.400" class="transcript_line"> And they quietly introduced us to it,</div><div id="00:29:20.080" class="transcript_line"> and started to show us the ropes, not immediately,</div><div id="00:29:23.880" class="transcript_line"> until they check you out first,</div><div id="00:29:25.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, on your attitude and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:29:29.200" class="transcript_line"> But quietly we sort of become, you know,</div><div id="00:29:34.480" class="transcript_line"> members of the team sort of thing.</div><div id="00:29:36.800" class="transcript_line"> And then, a year or so later,</div><div id="00:29:43.520" class="transcript_line"> you had the first sort of thing.</div><div id="00:29:45.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never sort of thought or heard or sort of understood</div><div id="00:29:50.720" class="transcript_line"> or had anything to do with politics,</div><div id="00:29:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and especially fishing politics.</div><div id="00:29:55.920" class="transcript_line"> And before we knew it, you know,</div><div id="00:30:01.560" class="transcript_line"> you had this, the 1999 Salmon Baseline Laws or whatever,</div><div id="00:30:07.080" class="transcript_line"> come about, and that was when 60% of the season</div><div id="00:30:10.080" class="transcript_line"> was taken away to protect salmon stocks.</div><div id="00:30:13.520" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s funny, you know, when you look back,</div><div id="00:30:19.040" class="transcript_line"> because what are we gonna do?</div><div id="00:30:21.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not having any effect on salmon stocks.</div><div id="00:30:24.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, why would they do that to us?</div><div id="00:30:26.880" class="transcript_line"> So we basically wrote two sentences to that effect.</div><div id="00:30:33.400" class="transcript_line"> And I got the letter at home,</div><div id="00:30:35.800" class="transcript_line"> someone wrote a copy of it, and everybody signed it.</div><div id="00:30:39.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s like signatures, just like all over,</div><div id="00:30:42.720" class="transcript_line"> like you&#039;re doing school, some of the, you know,</div><div id="00:30:45.160" class="transcript_line"> one diagonal, you know, just all over the sheet of paper,</div><div id="00:30:47.880" class="transcript_line"> just send it off.</div><div id="00:30:49.240" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, of course that didn&#039;t do any good.</div><div id="00:30:51.440" class="transcript_line"> So that came back.</div><div id="00:30:53.600" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, it was a national thing, really.</div><div id="00:30:55.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were gonna do it, and they&#039;d done it,</div><div id="00:30:57.360" class="transcript_line"> and perhaps, you know, it needed to be done</div><div id="00:30:59.520" class="transcript_line"> to a certain degree, but, you know, there you go.</div><div id="00:31:04.560" class="transcript_line"> That was, we&#039;d been in the group five minutes,</div><div id="00:31:07.720" class="transcript_line"> and all of a sudden, 60% of the season had gone.</div><div id="00:31:11.600" class="transcript_line"> We used to start in February.</div><div id="00:31:12.560" class="transcript_line"> February the 2nd was the start date</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> for salmon fishing on the estuary.</div><div id="00:31:16.440" class="transcript_line"> And then, another year or so passed,</div><div id="00:31:22.440" class="transcript_line"> passes and seven estuary action plan.</div><div id="00:31:30.440" class="transcript_line"> That was the next thing.</div><div id="00:31:31.760" class="transcript_line"> And the writing was on the wall with that.</div><div id="00:31:34.920" class="transcript_line"> They basically, all the other salmon fisheries</div><div id="00:31:38.320" class="transcript_line"> had been closed down.</div><div id="00:31:39.520" class="transcript_line"> It was just us on the Welsh region of the estuary.</div><div id="00:31:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Where were the others then?</div><div id="00:31:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Goldcliff, Butcherank, Undy Butcherank,</div><div id="00:31:48.040" class="transcript_line"> Port and Butcherank, the stop boats in Chapstow,</div><div id="00:31:52.240" class="transcript_line"> all over like a 30-odd year period, one by one.</div><div id="00:31:55.680" class="transcript_line"> St. Nett&#039;s, Mathurn, Slime Road,</div><div id="00:31:59.640" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s drifting into England, perhaps.</div><div id="00:32:01.240" class="transcript_line"> But all the Butcheranks, you know,</div><div id="00:32:03.640" class="transcript_line"> it sort of, you know, bar a few upstream on the Severn,</div><div id="00:32:07.800" class="transcript_line"> had been closed.</div><div id="00:32:08.640" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh region, there was nothing other than us left.</div><div id="00:32:12.360" class="transcript_line"> Had they been closed because of the declining salmon numbers?</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was the reason in behind it.</div><div id="00:32:18.800" class="transcript_line"> You know, bought out, closed down by, you know,</div><div id="00:32:21.800" class="transcript_line"> one by one, chipped away.</div><div id="00:32:23.880" class="transcript_line"> There had been a decline in salmon stocks</div><div id="00:32:25.960" class="transcript_line"> and the Environment Agency or the Natural Rivers Authority,</div><div id="00:32:30.880" class="transcript_line"> they had a program, really, of closure,</div><div id="00:32:33.560" class="transcript_line"> as far as I can see it.</div><div id="00:32:34.760" class="transcript_line"> And then there was just us left.</div><div id="00:32:37.080" class="transcript_line"> And when the Severn Estuary Action Plan,</div><div id="00:32:41.800" class="transcript_line"> the proposed action plan, came out,</div><div id="00:32:44.240" class="transcript_line"> it was obvious to us we were next in line.</div><div id="00:32:47.720" class="transcript_line"> And Dick, Richard Obday, phoned us up</div><div id="00:32:53.080" class="transcript_line"> and said, look, they want to meet us at Subrock Club,</div><div id="00:32:56.280" class="transcript_line"> the Subrock Non-Political, not, sorry,</div><div id="00:32:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Subrock Non-Political Club in Subrock there.</div><div id="00:33:02.640" class="transcript_line"> So eventually that was arranged.</div><div id="00:33:05.800" class="transcript_line"> And I was, what, 39-ish then, 40 perhaps,</div><div id="00:33:11.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, full of fight, obviously.</div><div id="00:33:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And my brother, you know, I had my brother with me as well.</div><div id="00:33:20.560" class="transcript_line"> There was Dick Obday, I think Pete Leonard,</div><div id="00:33:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Dan Lee, and Bob at the meeting.</div><div id="00:33:29.160" class="transcript_line"> And two people from the Environment Agency turned up,</div><div id="00:33:31.840" class="transcript_line"> and I think it was some head of enforcement,</div><div id="00:33:35.440" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t imagine his name,</div><div id="00:33:36.400" class="transcript_line"> but another nice enough guy, Mr. Purvis.</div><div id="00:33:42.400" class="transcript_line"> And they sat down and sat and ran through it all,</div><div id="00:33:47.440" class="transcript_line"> blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, all the spiel.</div><div id="00:33:51.600" class="transcript_line"> And I said to my brother, previous, I said,</div><div id="00:33:54.880" class="transcript_line"> right, you sit right at the back, I said,</div><div id="00:33:56.640" class="transcript_line"> and everything they say, write it down,</div><div id="00:33:58.120" class="transcript_line"> and make sure that they see you writing in ten.</div><div id="00:34:02.720" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, there was a nerve in him a little bit.</div><div id="00:34:04.560" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, I said, that&#039;s fair, I said, fair enough,</div><div id="00:34:08.880" class="transcript_line"> I said, you know, we understand that,</div><div id="00:34:11.880" class="transcript_line"> and what you said, but can we show you this?</div><div id="00:34:15.600" class="transcript_line"> And I brought out a petition that we started</div><div id="00:34:18.520" class="transcript_line"> against further restrictions.</div><div id="00:34:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, if I did, the head of enforcement,</div><div id="00:34:22.400" class="transcript_line"> you just hit the ceiling basically, sort of.</div><div id="00:34:25.800" class="transcript_line"> And whereas we can close you down anytime we like,</div><div id="00:34:32.720" class="transcript_line"> and of course, the red rag to a bull to me.</div><div id="00:34:37.720" class="transcript_line"> Can they?</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> No, basically, they need to go through,</div><div id="00:34:43.120" class="transcript_line"> so do certain things to be able to close us down.</div><div id="00:34:46.920" class="transcript_line"> But he went off on one, and it was, you know,</div><div id="00:34:52.440" class="transcript_line"> some of those things he said.</div><div id="00:34:54.080" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, that sort of showed us really</div><div id="00:34:59.880" class="transcript_line"> what they were about.</div><div id="00:35:00.720" class="transcript_line"> And apparently, they were gonna publish this report</div><div id="00:35:06.120" class="transcript_line"> after, I think it was six weeks or eight weeks.</div><div id="00:35:09.320" class="transcript_line"> It took them a year to do it,</div><div id="00:35:10.920" class="transcript_line"> because immediately, we were invited to the Welsh Assembly</div><div id="00:35:14.120" class="transcript_line"> with like a three and a half thousand signature petition.</div><div id="00:35:17.320" class="transcript_line"> We met, Kamie Jones was the Minister</div><div id="00:35:19.440" class="transcript_line"> for Rural Affairs at the time,</div><div id="00:35:22.360" class="transcript_line"> Rodri Morgan, just when the national,</div><div id="00:35:26.760" class="transcript_line"> the Welsh Assembly was formed.</div><div id="00:35:29.480" class="transcript_line"> And we all went there with all our little placards,</div><div id="00:35:32.440" class="transcript_line"> a few little posters and things.</div><div id="00:35:34.400" class="transcript_line"> It was quite pathetic, really.</div><div id="00:35:36.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, a couple of things stuck to cardboard things.</div><div id="00:35:40.600" class="transcript_line"> But they welcomed us, and Kamie Jones, he said to me,</div><div id="00:35:45.080" class="transcript_line"> he said, look, we were chatting,</div><div id="00:35:46.960" class="transcript_line"> and he said, look, they gotta come through me.</div><div id="00:35:51.240" class="transcript_line"> I said, but, but, but, but, and he said,</div><div id="00:35:54.040" class="transcript_line"> he just looked at me and said,</div><div id="00:35:55.480" class="transcript_line"> they gotta come through me.</div><div id="00:35:56.960" class="transcript_line"> So it never happened.</div><div id="00:35:58.920" class="transcript_line"> It took them over a year to publish a report,</div><div id="00:36:02.760" class="transcript_line"> and we were okay at the end of the day.</div><div id="00:36:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Get ready to go fishing again already, look.</div><div id="00:36:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Ah, yeah, everybody.</div><div id="00:36:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, obviously, it&#039;s been like May, June already.</div><div id="00:36:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, not bad, is it?</div><div id="00:36:13.320" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t believe it, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="00:36:15.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really weird.</div><div id="00:36:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Everything&#039;s bloody.</div><div id="00:36:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Like, there&#039;s some marigolds coming up,</div><div id="00:36:20.200" class="transcript_line"> the rosebushes, bloody, they&#039;re flaming.</div><div id="00:36:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s weird.</div><div id="00:36:24.820" class="transcript_line"> Seasons, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:36:25.660" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:36:27.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it should be foot deep in the snow or whatever.</div><div id="00:36:30.320" class="transcript_line"> That might happen yet.</div><div id="00:36:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ll have it.</div><div id="00:36:33.240" class="transcript_line"> We are worn, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:36:35.480" class="transcript_line"> Went out fishing, got the ties we left yesterday,</div><div id="00:36:37.680" class="transcript_line"> a long one, then went to the end</div><div id="00:36:39.360" class="transcript_line"> and fished that back in from the lower,</div><div id="00:36:41.160" class="transcript_line"> took the lower, and, got one little codling, that was it.</div><div id="00:36:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, quiet out there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:36:47.320" class="transcript_line"> It is quiet out there.</div><div id="00:36:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Everybody&#039;s been saying that.</div><div id="00:36:51.800" class="transcript_line"> There was a match, Newport,</div><div id="00:36:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Newport,</div><div id="00:36:56.040" class="transcript_line"> sea fishing, sea anglers,</div><div id="00:36:59.280" class="transcript_line"> on the South Brooklyn on here.</div><div id="00:37:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:37:01.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to get the report on it,</div><div id="00:37:02.640" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t find the report on it, I think.</div><div id="00:37:05.480" class="transcript_line"> I expected it would be online somewhere.</div><div id="00:37:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, he did send me the site,</div><div id="00:37:08.920" class="transcript_line"> but I went on it, it was not gonna put it up.</div><div id="00:37:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:14.200" class="transcript_line"> I thought there were five fish in the tree.</div><div id="00:37:17.400" class="transcript_line"> I think one fell out.</div><div id="00:37:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Or somebody whipped it, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:37:24.200" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:37:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was far gone, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:37:27.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was...</div><div id="00:37:33.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there you go.</div><div id="00:37:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Ready, buddy?</div><div id="00:37:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Can we just go back to the very beginning,</div><div id="00:37:41.840" class="transcript_line"> your great-grandfather, William Corbyn.</div><div id="00:37:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about him.</div><div id="00:37:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, William Corbyn, right.</div><div id="00:37:50.040" class="transcript_line"> He, as I say, grew up in Chapstow, Nester,</div><div id="00:37:53.160" class="transcript_line"> and went off to war.</div><div id="00:37:55.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he died when I was,</div><div id="00:37:58.480" class="transcript_line"> perhaps six, seven, eight, that sort of age.</div><div id="00:38:04.480" class="transcript_line"> I could always remember him.</div><div id="00:38:05.960" class="transcript_line"> My brother can&#039;t remember him,</div><div id="00:38:07.160" class="transcript_line"> but I can remember him in Cameroon, Subrook, not fishing.</div><div id="00:38:10.920" class="transcript_line"> He was too old then.</div><div id="00:38:17.920" class="transcript_line"> They had a massive cast iron range in the kitchen,</div><div id="00:38:21.240" class="transcript_line"> in the back room there where they lived.</div><div id="00:38:23.360" class="transcript_line"> My great-grandparents lived in one bit,</div><div id="00:38:26.480" class="transcript_line"> and grandparents in the other.</div><div id="00:38:28.280" class="transcript_line"> But I can always remember,</div><div id="00:38:30.120" class="transcript_line"> I have three or four memories of him, and that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:38:35.040" class="transcript_line"> The one is sat in the chair.</div><div id="00:38:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Always his chair on the one side of the fire,</div><div id="00:38:40.720" class="transcript_line"> and my great-grandmother on the other side,</div><div id="00:38:42.120" class="transcript_line"> on the rocking chair,</div><div id="00:38:42.960" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t have rocking chair on the other side,</div><div id="00:38:44.960" class="transcript_line"> and he was in a big, soft, high-backed chair</div><div id="00:38:46.960" class="transcript_line"> on the other side.</div><div id="00:38:48.440" class="transcript_line"> I always remember him doing that.</div><div id="00:38:49.800" class="transcript_line"> I can remember also them walking me down the Cliff Road,</div><div id="00:38:55.040" class="transcript_line"> at the back end of Subrook there by the shipyard,</div><div id="00:38:57.440" class="transcript_line"> and I can also remember him making me a whistle.</div><div id="00:39:04.520" class="transcript_line"> A wooden whistle?</div><div id="00:39:05.520" class="transcript_line"> No, it was made from a big bulb of seaweed.</div><div id="00:39:12.560" class="transcript_line"> If you look in seaweed down there,</div><div id="00:39:13.800" class="transcript_line"> you get sort of a bladder rack,</div><div id="00:39:16.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure what it&#039;s called,</div><div id="00:39:18.400" class="transcript_line"> but one of the bigger,</div><div id="00:39:20.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how he&#039;d done it,</div><div id="00:39:22.360" class="transcript_line"> but I can remember him with a little knife</div><div id="00:39:24.760" class="transcript_line"> bringing up a piece of seaweed with a big bulb,</div><div id="00:39:28.640" class="transcript_line"> and making some sort of whistle.</div><div id="00:39:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And sat on the Roman camp,</div><div id="00:39:33.000" class="transcript_line"> just at the back of the house there,</div><div id="00:39:35.720" class="transcript_line"> on the point by the Holy Trinity Church,</div><div id="00:39:38.960" class="transcript_line"> right on the end there,</div><div id="00:39:39.800" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s a little depression on the end.</div><div id="00:39:42.320" class="transcript_line"> And I was sat there with him, and he made a whistle.</div><div id="00:39:44.880" class="transcript_line"> I can also remember him with his tobacco 10,</div><div id="00:39:50.640" class="transcript_line"> mixing two types of tobacco,</div><div id="00:39:53.160" class="transcript_line"> making a roll up, and sat there smoking it.</div><div id="00:39:57.080" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that, you know.</div><div id="00:39:59.160" class="transcript_line"> So has he been a fisherman before the war?</div><div id="00:40:01.760" class="transcript_line"> He must have been, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, must have been, must have been.</div><div id="00:40:04.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, they say there&#039;s a lot of fishermen</div><div id="00:40:07.200" class="transcript_line"> in his family, sort of thing.</div><div id="00:40:09.520" class="transcript_line"> He was a Victorian.</div><div id="00:40:11.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he was, you know, a Victorian, you know, sort of.</div><div id="00:40:16.360" class="transcript_line"> But as I say, he fished up until he was,</div><div id="00:40:23.120" class="transcript_line"> must have been in his late 70s.</div><div id="00:40:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And Bob, the fisherman that trained me and Richard,</div><div id="00:40:33.000" class="transcript_line"> fished with my great-grandfather.</div><div id="00:40:35.160" class="transcript_line"> So Bob would have been a young boy then.</div><div id="00:40:37.760" class="transcript_line"> So Bob, even though my great-grandfather</div><div id="00:40:42.680" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t pass down all the summer fishing,</div><div id="00:40:44.920" class="transcript_line"> Bob did, which again, I think was probably fate.</div><div id="00:40:49.440" class="transcript_line"> Because Bob was the youngest of the fishermen.</div><div id="00:40:52.960" class="transcript_line"> What was it, Bob?</div><div id="00:40:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Leonard, Leonard.</div><div id="00:40:55.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in beyond the picture, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:40:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Here.</div><div id="00:41:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:01.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in over there as well, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:41:01.960" class="transcript_line"> The Wye Valley Tourist People have come down</div><div id="00:41:09.640" class="transcript_line"> to take a picture of us.</div><div id="00:41:12.440" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the picture.</div><div id="00:41:13.280" class="transcript_line"> He was in all the publications.</div><div id="00:41:16.280" class="transcript_line"> Bob turned up there.</div><div id="00:41:17.720" class="transcript_line"> He said, Bob, you haven&#039;t had a shave.</div><div id="00:41:20.040" class="transcript_line"> And he said, what&#039;s about your mouth?</div><div id="00:41:25.240" class="transcript_line"> He said, I forgot my bottom teeth.</div><div id="00:41:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:41:29.240" class="transcript_line"> So he looks a little bit...</div><div id="00:41:30.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:41:31.760" class="transcript_line"> But yeah.</div><div id="00:41:32.880" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I mean, Bob showed us everything, really.</div><div id="00:41:38.640" class="transcript_line"> But when he fished with my great-grandfather,</div><div id="00:41:45.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were pretty close as well.</div><div id="00:41:47.600" class="transcript_line"> And the classic tale is, Bob repeated endlessly,</div><div id="00:41:53.440" class="transcript_line"> was that they were down the hole,</div><div id="00:41:55.600" class="transcript_line"> the other side of the bridge fishing,</div><div id="00:41:57.680" class="transcript_line"> my great-grandfather, Bob, and two or three others.</div><div id="00:42:00.800" class="transcript_line"> And my great-grandfather had a fish in the net.</div><div id="00:42:05.480" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t pick the net up.</div><div id="00:42:08.640" class="transcript_line"> He was 77 years of age, and it was his 77th birthday.</div><div id="00:42:11.640" class="transcript_line"> Luckily, there were men either side of him</div><div id="00:42:13.480" class="transcript_line"> to catch all of the reams.</div><div id="00:42:14.440" class="transcript_line"> They pulled it up, and the fish was 57 pounds in weight.</div><div id="00:42:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Monster fishing.</div><div id="00:42:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Most fishermen, late net fishermen,</div><div id="00:42:21.520" class="transcript_line"> never seen a fish over 40 pounds.</div><div id="00:42:23.360" class="transcript_line"> 57 pounds?</div><div id="00:42:24.200" class="transcript_line"> 57 pounds of net.</div><div id="00:42:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Salmon?</div><div id="00:42:25.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:42:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Is that what they call an American trunk?</div><div id="00:42:29.200" class="transcript_line"> God knows.</div><div id="00:42:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But it was quite impressive.</div><div id="00:42:33.040" class="transcript_line"> But that was taken to a Bob, again, to tell a story.</div><div id="00:42:37.040" class="transcript_line"> He took it to a hotel in Chinchon,</div><div id="00:42:40.880" class="transcript_line"> knocked on the back door at night,</div><div id="00:42:42.680" class="transcript_line"> which also sounds a bit dodgy to me.</div><div id="00:42:44.440" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s sort of, and...</div><div id="00:42:50.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he must have had a sort of contact to sell it.</div><div id="00:42:53.120" class="transcript_line"> And the guy, he showed him the fish.</div><div id="00:42:56.600" class="transcript_line"> He said, never seen a fish like it.</div><div id="00:42:59.440" class="transcript_line"> And the hotel owner had a party of anglers in there.</div><div id="00:43:03.000" class="transcript_line"> He must have, I think he owned a fishing beat, Bob said.</div><div id="00:43:06.200" class="transcript_line"> And Bob took it in and rolled it out on the carpet.</div><div id="00:43:09.480" class="transcript_line"> And the landlord said, that&#039;s just your tag</div><div id="00:43:13.400" class="transcript_line"> for tomorrow, boys.</div><div id="00:43:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:43:16.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a great story.</div><div id="00:43:17.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:19.560" class="transcript_line"> I think Bob may have added a pound or two to it</div><div id="00:43:21.840" class="transcript_line"> over the decades.</div><div id="00:43:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m the one who does that, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:43:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:24.760" class="transcript_line"> But that was his thing.</div><div id="00:43:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;d say that my great-grandfather</div><div id="00:43:29.640" class="transcript_line"> was mad keen for it all the time.</div><div id="00:43:32.880" class="transcript_line"> Bob would say that it would be a stinking night.</div><div id="00:43:36.680" class="transcript_line"> It would be tipping down with rain.</div><div id="00:43:37.760" class="transcript_line"> The wind wouldn&#039;t be quite right.</div><div id="00:43:41.400" class="transcript_line"> And Bob lived on the farm.</div><div id="00:43:46.280" class="transcript_line"> He would look down towards the boat.</div><div id="00:43:47.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d be pitch dark at night.</div><div id="00:43:49.360" class="transcript_line"> And he would see a dim light on the boat.</div><div id="00:43:52.920" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d know then that that was my great-grandfather</div><div id="00:43:55.760" class="transcript_line"> down there, so he&#039;d have to go down there to fish.</div><div id="00:43:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="00:44:00.240" class="transcript_line"> So fishing at night time isn&#039;t unknown.</div><div id="00:44:02.520" class="transcript_line"> No, they would fish at night.</div><div id="00:44:04.040" class="transcript_line"> They would fish at night.</div><div id="00:44:06.080" class="transcript_line"> There was more fish back in the day, years and years ago.</div><div id="00:44:09.120" class="transcript_line"> And there would always be a chance</div><div id="00:44:11.240" class="transcript_line"> of a fish swimming into the net.</div><div id="00:44:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Because with a lave net, you&#039;re fishing in two ways.</div><div id="00:44:15.560" class="transcript_line"> It is completely different to anything else.</div><div id="00:44:18.160" class="transcript_line"> When I mention white fishing and all the rest of it,</div><div id="00:44:20.440" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re out there standing in a traditional spot.</div><div id="00:44:26.200" class="transcript_line"> And even though the fishery is defined,</div><div id="00:44:29.560" class="transcript_line"> there is a line running from Caldecott</div><div id="00:44:32.800" class="transcript_line"> right up to the chutes in the middle,</div><div id="00:44:34.800" class="transcript_line"> right up to Black Rock.</div><div id="00:44:35.880" class="transcript_line"> But people think you can just fish anywhere, and you can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:44:38.760" class="transcript_line"> You can fish only at specific spots.</div><div id="00:44:42.520" class="transcript_line"> Is it possible that fishermen</div><div id="00:44:43.920" class="transcript_line"> have stood in those spots for hundreds of years?</div><div id="00:44:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.</div><div id="00:44:47.720" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s all sorts of things down there,</div><div id="00:44:49.760" class="transcript_line"> what we call stanks, which are lines of rocks on edge.</div><div id="00:44:54.880" class="transcript_line"> That, you know, air fishermen didn&#039;t put them there,</div><div id="00:44:57.920" class="transcript_line"> but they put there long, long before that.</div><div id="00:45:02.760" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I mean, there&#039;s specific spots</div><div id="00:45:08.320" class="transcript_line"> with names already known by the fishermen out there.</div><div id="00:45:11.520" class="transcript_line"> You run through them, the Guts, Lighthouse Fier,</div><div id="00:45:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Gruggy, the Marrow.</div><div id="00:45:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s the Hole, and then there&#039;s the Ground Stand.</div><div id="00:45:24.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the salmon fishing spots.</div><div id="00:45:27.480" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s also other names out there,</div><div id="00:45:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Monkey Tump, there&#039;s another one.</div><div id="00:45:31.120" class="transcript_line"> But these were names that don&#039;t appear on maps,</div><div id="00:45:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and sort of used by the fishermen to describe where they fish.</div><div id="00:45:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And the fishermen...</div><div id="00:45:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:45:39.640" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s just something you all share anecdotally.</div><div id="00:45:43.640" class="transcript_line"> It hasn&#039;t been ever logged on a map.</div><div id="00:45:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Again, we, you know, in recent years,</div><div id="00:45:47.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean, obviously, we&#039;ve tried to get the fish in,</div><div id="00:45:49.640" class="transcript_line"> sort of, you know, out there, you know,</div><div id="00:45:51.440" class="transcript_line"> and you can see, you know, what we&#039;ve done.</div><div id="00:45:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But years ago, you could talk in a pub,</div><div id="00:45:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and nobody would know what you were talking about.</div><div id="00:46:01.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, but...</div><div id="00:46:02.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a secret language in the way.</div><div id="00:46:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, sort of, yeah.</div><div id="00:46:04.760" class="transcript_line"> But we, you know, we have typically meat here,</div><div id="00:46:07.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve laid that fish in.</div><div id="00:46:10.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all about three things.</div><div id="00:46:11.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about the size of the tide, height of the tide,</div><div id="00:46:15.080" class="transcript_line"> which we get from a tide table, the Aerosmiths,</div><div id="00:46:18.480" class="transcript_line"> the direction and strength of the wind.</div><div id="00:46:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, you want it as calm as possible,</div><div id="00:46:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and light as possible, the wind.</div><div id="00:46:23.600" class="transcript_line"> But winds in certain directions,</div><div id="00:46:26.520" class="transcript_line"> you would select certain fishing spots.</div><div id="00:46:29.360" class="transcript_line"> So, say we had a southeasterly wind,</div><div id="00:46:32.600" class="transcript_line"> five mile an hour, you know, 10 mile an hour,</div><div id="00:46:35.040" class="transcript_line"> you would choose to fish in what we call Gruggy.</div><div id="00:46:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:46:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Because when, what happens, you can either walk,</div><div id="00:46:42.000" class="transcript_line"> we wade out, or we take the boat.</div><div id="00:46:45.440" class="transcript_line"> And when you get there, you put the net in front of you,</div><div id="00:46:48.160" class="transcript_line"> open the net out, unfold it, put it in front of you,</div><div id="00:46:50.880" class="transcript_line"> put your hand in the net to feel for a fish swimming in.</div><div id="00:46:53.360" class="transcript_line"> Years ago, if more fish about,</div><div id="00:46:55.120" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d have more chance of one just actually</div><div id="00:46:57.720" class="transcript_line"> swimming into the net.</div><div id="00:46:59.040" class="transcript_line"> But the second part of it, you&#039;re looking,</div><div id="00:47:00.800" class="transcript_line"> continuously scanning and looking for a fish.</div><div id="00:47:04.120" class="transcript_line"> So does that mean you&#039;re reading the surface of the water?</div><div id="00:47:06.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the calmer the better, so the flatter the better.</div><div id="00:47:09.960" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re looking for a ripple,</div><div id="00:47:12.720" class="transcript_line"> the wake, the loom of the fish,</div><div id="00:47:14.720" class="transcript_line"> as it swims through the water.</div><div id="00:47:15.720" class="transcript_line"> And this might only happen-</div><div id="00:47:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Wake and the loom?</div><div id="00:47:18.200" class="transcript_line"> We call the wake the loom,</div><div id="00:47:19.920" class="transcript_line"> the sort of-</div><div id="00:47:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, do you?</div><div id="00:47:21.600" class="transcript_line"> The line going through the water.</div><div id="00:47:23.080" class="transcript_line"> Is that unique to you here?</div><div id="00:47:25.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, but that&#039;s what we say.</div><div id="00:47:28.040" class="transcript_line"> We say we&#039;re looking for the wake, the loom,</div><div id="00:47:30.760" class="transcript_line"> the mark of fish swimming through the water.</div><div id="00:47:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And that might only last for a few seconds,</div><div id="00:47:35.800" class="transcript_line"> and then you dip down and be gone.</div><div id="00:47:37.760" class="transcript_line"> So if you miss it, you won&#039;t see the fish.</div><div id="00:47:40.600" class="transcript_line"> In the summertime, and when we fish now,</div><div id="00:47:43.680" class="transcript_line"> we can only fish from the 1st of June</div><div id="00:47:45.000" class="transcript_line"> to the 31st of August on paper.</div><div id="00:47:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Bob always used to say that the water become warm</div><div id="00:47:53.720" class="transcript_line"> and the fish always go slow and quiet.</div><div id="00:47:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so they&#039;re moving very quiet,</div><div id="00:47:59.680" class="transcript_line"> so you might only get one chance to see them.</div><div id="00:48:02.000" class="transcript_line"> If you see the fish, you pick up the net,</div><div id="00:48:03.800" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s not gonna come to you,</div><div id="00:48:04.640" class="transcript_line"> and then you&#039;ve gotta try and get around the fish</div><div id="00:48:07.360" class="transcript_line"> onto his nose, no good being behind him or on his side.</div><div id="00:48:10.400" class="transcript_line"> So you gotta move through the water as quick as you dare.</div><div id="00:48:12.960" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve gotta know what&#039;s under the water to do that.</div><div id="00:48:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Because some areas is full of holes and gullies,</div><div id="00:48:18.200" class="transcript_line"> others-</div><div id="00:48:19.040" class="transcript_line"> He might drop something.</div><div id="00:48:19.860" class="transcript_line"> You break your leg.</div><div id="00:48:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a particular gully out there now</div><div id="00:48:24.520" class="transcript_line"> that never used to be there.</div><div id="00:48:25.360" class="transcript_line"> When they built the second seven crossing,</div><div id="00:48:27.920" class="transcript_line"> they ran a trench from the crossing</div><div id="00:48:30.760" class="transcript_line"> to the red beacon on the lady bench,</div><div id="00:48:34.520" class="transcript_line"> which is about two foot deep and about 18 inches wide.</div><div id="00:48:38.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a cable running through it</div><div id="00:48:40.400" class="transcript_line"> to take electricity to the beacon.</div><div id="00:48:44.720" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t fill it in properly with concrete,</div><div id="00:48:47.040" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s right behind what we call the pillars,</div><div id="00:48:49.960" class="transcript_line"> two little rocks where we fish in, Gruggy.</div><div id="00:48:54.200" class="transcript_line"> And with a gully like that,</div><div id="00:48:55.600" class="transcript_line"> you will break your leg if you run through it.</div><div id="00:48:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So we try to show all the fishermen,</div><div id="00:49:02.320" class="transcript_line"> train them sort of not to do that.</div><div id="00:49:05.120" class="transcript_line"> But when they see a fish, what do they do?</div><div id="00:49:08.400" class="transcript_line"> So this might sound like a stupid question, Martin.</div><div id="00:49:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Why do you use nets and not a line?</div><div id="00:49:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, in the seven estuary,</div><div id="00:49:18.040" class="transcript_line"> you couldn&#039;t fish for salmon with a line.</div><div id="00:49:24.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, it wouldn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:49:29.400" class="transcript_line"> You know, you can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:49:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s completely different to rod and line fishing.</div><div id="00:49:36.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite annoying really that, you know,</div><div id="00:49:39.880" class="transcript_line"> you get all the time with your powers of B,</div><div id="00:49:41.960" class="transcript_line"> you get this rod fishing, net fishing thing.</div><div id="00:49:47.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all lumped into one.</div><div id="00:49:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s a completely different thing altogether.</div><div id="00:49:50.920" class="transcript_line"> You know, completely different thing.</div><div id="00:49:52.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s okay, you catch fish,</div><div id="00:49:56.680" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s like comparing a cat and a dog.</div><div id="00:49:58.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all got four legs,</div><div id="00:50:01.120" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s a completely different thing.</div><div id="00:50:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s our way of life out there,</div><div id="00:50:05.520" class="transcript_line"> you know, sort of fishing with a laid net.</div><div id="00:50:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s been passed down to me,</div><div id="00:50:08.720" class="transcript_line"> and I hope to pass it on to others.</div><div id="00:50:13.720" class="transcript_line"> So who taught you how to make nets?</div><div id="00:50:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Right, when I came into the fishing in the 90s,</div><div id="00:50:19.200" class="transcript_line"> all the nets were not hand knitted, okay?</div><div id="00:50:23.160" class="transcript_line"> They still made the frames exactly as we make them</div><div id="00:50:25.840" class="transcript_line"> from willow, ash and pine.</div><div id="00:50:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Crop nearby?</div><div id="00:50:31.880" class="transcript_line"> Each fisherman would make their own nets,</div><div id="00:50:33.720" class="transcript_line"> and perhaps not always the case,</div><div id="00:50:38.720" class="transcript_line"> you know, because you get some more proficient</div><div id="00:50:40.920" class="transcript_line"> and more sort of keen than others</div><div id="00:50:42.640" class="transcript_line"> and more handy if you like,</div><div id="00:50:44.640" class="transcript_line"> but they still made the nets from the,</div><div id="00:50:47.640" class="transcript_line"> willow for the reams, pine for the headboard,</div><div id="00:50:50.000" class="transcript_line"> ash for the rock staff.</div><div id="00:50:52.160" class="transcript_line"> But what had happened over the years</div><div id="00:50:54.320" class="transcript_line"> is that up until the 1950s, 60s,</div><div id="00:50:57.880" class="transcript_line"> the nets were made from hemp twine, okay?</div><div id="00:51:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was one particular guy in sub-rock</div><div id="00:51:03.560" class="transcript_line"> that lived next door, 12 Camp Road,</div><div id="00:51:06.440" class="transcript_line"> Smacker Williams, that was proficient in knitting nets.</div><div id="00:51:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bob used to tell us that you could knit a day</div><div id="00:51:15.120" class="transcript_line"> and a half.</div><div id="00:51:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:51:16.800" class="transcript_line"> The net is a horseshoe shaped,</div><div id="00:51:19.240" class="transcript_line"> but I think it was probably a family effort.</div><div id="00:51:20.800" class="transcript_line"> They would hang it up on a bar in the living room</div><div id="00:51:23.080" class="transcript_line"> or a rope and knit off that, but a day and a half.</div><div id="00:51:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Hemp twine would only last for two seasons,</div><div id="00:51:29.680" class="transcript_line"> so they would be constantly knitting nets.</div><div id="00:51:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course, come say the 1960s, modern materials come in.</div><div id="00:51:38.240" class="transcript_line"> This stuff, polyester nylon.</div><div id="00:51:41.480" class="transcript_line"> And,</div><div id="00:51:46.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, no doubt Smacker knitted all the nets.</div><div id="00:51:49.480" class="transcript_line"> And these things are virtually indestructible.</div><div id="00:51:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so all of a sudden, the nets were not being remade</div><div id="00:51:56.440" class="transcript_line"> and the skills weren&#039;t being passed down</div><div id="00:51:58.040" class="transcript_line"> because they all had nets.</div><div id="00:52:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then five years, 10 years passed.</div><div id="00:52:03.600" class="transcript_line"> What happened?</div><div id="00:52:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Nets, eventually they get ripped and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:52:08.880" class="transcript_line"> Lost and one thing and another.</div><div id="00:52:11.480" class="transcript_line"> And someone like Smacker Williams,</div><div id="00:52:13.160" class="transcript_line"> would it have been a full-time job?</div><div id="00:52:14.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:52:16.400" class="transcript_line"> He was,</div><div id="00:52:20.080" class="transcript_line"> it was old.</div><div id="00:52:20.920" class="transcript_line"> Nobody really made a living out of this fishery</div><div id="00:52:22.680" class="transcript_line"> after the Second World War,</div><div id="00:52:24.040" class="transcript_line"> what we would call a living.</div><div id="00:52:25.560" class="transcript_line"> It was subsistence.</div><div id="00:52:27.200" class="transcript_line"> They would get a few bob.</div><div id="00:52:30.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, there was no living to be made out of it.</div><div id="00:52:34.080" class="transcript_line"> No, for a long time back, really.</div><div id="00:52:37.720" class="transcript_line"> It was just in addition to whatever else,</div><div id="00:52:39.680" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d done their pension or their bubbles and their jobs.</div><div id="00:52:43.440" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a sort of life.</div><div id="00:52:45.600" class="transcript_line"> It was just a little bit extra, I think.</div><div id="00:52:47.720" class="transcript_line"> Do you know when your grandfather died then?</div><div id="00:52:49.600" class="transcript_line"> So who did his, was it his daughter who,</div><div id="00:52:54.200" class="transcript_line"> so you said it was passed through your mother&#039;s line?</div><div id="00:52:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:58.400" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother was his daughter.</div><div id="00:53:01.600" class="transcript_line"> And then,</div><div id="00:53:05.160" class="transcript_line"> my grandmother had four children,</div><div id="00:53:07.080" class="transcript_line"> my mother and four boys.</div><div id="00:53:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So did your grandmother have anything to do with this?</div><div id="00:53:12.640" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing at all.</div><div id="00:53:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Even my great-grandmother, you know,</div><div id="00:53:15.640" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, don&#039;t recall her sort of having anything to do</div><div id="00:53:18.440" class="transcript_line"> with the fishing, really.</div><div id="00:53:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And my mother, no, not really.</div><div id="00:53:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was all really, I mean.</div><div id="00:53:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Your grandfather?</div><div id="00:53:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He did, yeah.</div><div id="00:53:26.840" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather fished a little bit.</div><div id="00:53:28.360" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d never had a license, but he,</div><div id="00:53:33.320" class="transcript_line"> fished for whitefish.</div><div id="00:53:34.480" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t recall him ever saying he went</div><div id="00:53:38.800" class="transcript_line"> sort of salmon fishing, sort of, you know,</div><div id="00:53:42.520" class="transcript_line"> not 100% sure about that, sort of, but,</div><div id="00:53:46.320" class="transcript_line"> what can I say?</div><div id="00:53:47.640" class="transcript_line"> But it was mainly my uncle sort of,</div><div id="00:53:49.840" class="transcript_line"> that sort of, you know, told me about it</div><div id="00:53:52.800" class="transcript_line"> and sort of showed me how to do it, like said before.</div><div id="00:53:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s your uncle?</div><div id="00:53:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Philip, Philip Harris.</div><div id="00:53:57.040" class="transcript_line"> And then he, you know, not long after he took me to,</div><div id="00:54:01.280" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s the one who took you out the first day?</div><div id="00:54:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, Philip.</div><div id="00:54:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Not long after that, he emigrated to Australia.</div><div id="00:54:08.880" class="transcript_line"> Sort of, 10 pound palms at the time, you know?</div><div id="00:54:12.480" class="transcript_line"> Sort of, so a few months.</div><div id="00:54:15.280" class="transcript_line"> So what other exhibitions with your uncle do you remember?</div><div id="00:54:18.040" class="transcript_line"> What sort of things did you do?</div><div id="00:54:21.200" class="transcript_line"> He was a young man then.</div><div id="00:54:22.480" class="transcript_line"> He was a young man.</div><div id="00:54:23.880" class="transcript_line"> He was a rod and line, he fished with a rod and line,</div><div id="00:54:26.840" class="transcript_line"> but he also did fish for whitefish,</div><div id="00:54:28.920" class="transcript_line"> but he never had a salmon license either.</div><div id="00:54:31.720" class="transcript_line"> The oldest brother, son, Uncle John,</div><div id="00:54:37.560" class="transcript_line"> he was taken out by my great-grandfather.</div><div id="00:54:40.640" class="transcript_line"> He told me that, fishing.</div><div id="00:54:45.440" class="transcript_line"> But, they didn&#039;t sort of hit it off.</div><div id="00:54:50.000" class="transcript_line"> With my great-grandfather,</div><div id="00:54:51.000" class="transcript_line"> everything had to be done right.</div><div id="00:54:53.480" class="transcript_line"> There was no, you know, you didn&#039;t talk.</div><div id="00:54:56.680" class="transcript_line"> If you were out there, you would not utter a word.</div><div id="00:54:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, what he would think of some of the boys</div><div id="00:55:01.080" class="transcript_line"> we got with us now on their phones every two minutes</div><div id="00:55:04.040" class="transcript_line"> and all the rest of it, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:55:05.240" class="transcript_line"> But, you would not utter a word,</div><div id="00:55:07.400" class="transcript_line"> and you would do everything to the book.</div><div id="00:55:09.880" class="transcript_line"> With us out there, you follow a set routine,</div><div id="00:55:13.280" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what keeps it sort of safe, you know?</div><div id="00:55:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Sort of, but he would, you know,</div><div id="00:55:18.040" class="transcript_line"> he was a Victorian type, Bob used to say.</div><div id="00:55:21.280" class="transcript_line"> And, he was a boat builder.</div><div id="00:55:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a boat builder?</div><div id="00:55:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Boat builder as well.</div><div id="00:55:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Your great-grandfather?</div><div id="00:55:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was shipwright.</div><div id="00:55:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Really, where?</div><div id="00:55:29.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, he was shipwright by trade.</div><div id="00:55:33.080" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:55:33.920" class="transcript_line"> He would say he could put a roof on a house with, by eye.</div><div id="00:55:37.800" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yeah.</div><div id="00:55:38.640" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:55:39.480" class="transcript_line"> There was a picture of him on the Facebook repairing a boat.</div><div id="00:55:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:55:44.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite an interesting thing.</div><div id="00:55:45.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re at Facebook again saying about that.</div><div id="00:55:51.120" class="transcript_line"> A guy got in contact, Duncan, I can&#039;t remember his name now.</div><div id="00:55:54.400" class="transcript_line"> But, he said, we may have some pictures of,</div><div id="00:55:57.400" class="transcript_line"> you know, this lot there, this lot, sort of back in the day.</div><div id="00:56:00.520" class="transcript_line"> And he sent us a picture of Grantley,</div><div id="00:56:03.000" class="transcript_line"> which was Bob&#039;s father, with a salmon,</div><div id="00:56:06.200" class="transcript_line"> which has got to be 40 pound, stood there.</div><div id="00:56:08.600" class="transcript_line"> We got no pictures of Grantley.</div><div id="00:56:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And, he said, how they met was,</div><div id="00:56:19.560" class="transcript_line"> they lived in a pill, not, not, not pill.</div><div id="00:56:23.680" class="transcript_line"> On the other side somewhere anyway.</div><div id="00:56:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Somewhere anyway, of the estuary.</div><div id="00:56:29.720" class="transcript_line"> His family set off, or his, you know,</div><div id="00:56:31.760" class="transcript_line"> his grandfather or his great grandfather set off</div><div id="00:56:34.080" class="transcript_line"> on the seven estuary, in the boat, with a couple of others.</div><div id="00:56:37.360" class="transcript_line"> And they got into trouble.</div><div id="00:56:39.160" class="transcript_line"> So they eventually come in, Black Rock.</div><div id="00:56:42.840" class="transcript_line"> The home guard arrested them,</div><div id="00:56:45.080" class="transcript_line"> or took them into sort of custody, you know.</div><div id="00:56:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Something they were invaded.</div><div id="00:56:49.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, something like that.</div><div id="00:56:51.240" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, but eventually, anyway,</div><div id="00:56:53.760" class="transcript_line"> they sort of met Grantley and his wife at the time,</div><div id="00:56:59.880" class="transcript_line"> who lived just on the cliff edge, just up there.</div><div id="00:57:02.920" class="transcript_line"> And I think, they all then sort of become sort of involved.</div><div id="00:57:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Like there&#039;s lots of, there&#039;s a picture of them all,</div><div id="00:57:11.640" class="transcript_line"> sort of, you know, they become good friends anyway.</div><div id="00:57:13.600" class="transcript_line"> So, they came off to the other side of the estuary.</div><div id="00:57:15.640" class="transcript_line"> Like, yeah. Really?</div><div id="00:57:16.520" class="transcript_line"> It was, and the picture on the website is,</div><div id="00:57:20.640" class="transcript_line"> the great grandfather repairing one of their boats, I think.</div><div id="00:57:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Really? So, on the Black Rock face of things?</div><div id="00:57:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, on the, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:57:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really? I&#039;m gonna look at that.</div><div id="00:57:27.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s quite interesting.</div><div id="00:57:28.760" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;s there, he&#039;s only a little, small, wiry fella, like,</div><div id="00:57:32.920" class="transcript_line"> and he should work.</div><div id="00:57:34.800" class="transcript_line"> So, it functioned during the war, though.</div><div id="00:57:37.280" class="transcript_line"> So, this was still running, Black Rock.</div><div id="00:57:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. I mean, it&#039;s second world war.</div><div id="00:57:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. Must have been, yeah.</div><div id="00:57:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So, I wonder if it was an important source of food.</div><div id="00:57:48.760" class="transcript_line"> Well.</div><div id="00:57:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Or did most of it go off to London?</div><div id="00:57:50.960" class="transcript_line"> I honestly don&#039;t know, really.</div><div id="00:57:53.200" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they would have sold it.</div><div id="00:57:55.040" class="transcript_line"> But people never starve down here.</div><div id="00:57:56.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, my grandfather used to say,</div><div id="00:57:58.240" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll never starve and you&#039;ll never freeze</div><div id="00:58:00.760" class="transcript_line"> because you could go there and catch a fish,</div><div id="00:58:04.520" class="transcript_line"> anything you like.</div><div id="00:58:06.880" class="transcript_line"> And you turn over a stone down there</div><div id="00:58:08.120" class="transcript_line"> and you get a fish, you know, an eel.</div><div id="00:58:10.640" class="transcript_line"> The other thing, regarding keeping warm,</div><div id="00:58:14.400" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they used to have a bit of coal,</div><div id="00:58:16.200" class="transcript_line"> but normally it was just wood.</div><div id="00:58:17.960" class="transcript_line"> And just off Subrook, just off the camp there,</div><div id="00:58:22.960" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got an area called the Wharf.</div><div id="00:58:26.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like it is today.</div><div id="00:58:27.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all filled in there.</div><div id="00:58:28.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all this green stuff, this mass grass type of stuff</div><div id="00:58:32.120" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve planted years ago,</div><div id="00:58:33.720" class="transcript_line"> has completely changed the foreshore front</div><div id="00:58:37.240" class="transcript_line"> from Magot to Subrook.</div><div id="00:58:39.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like it was when I was a kid at all.</div><div id="00:58:42.600" class="transcript_line"> And at the Wharf, it was like a bay,</div><div id="00:58:45.400" class="transcript_line"> and you had actually a shell beach there,</div><div id="00:58:48.400" class="transcript_line"> you know, and they used to call it the beach.</div><div id="00:58:50.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where they went to the beach.</div><div id="00:58:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:58:53.640" class="transcript_line"> Back in the day.</div><div id="00:58:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:55.320" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:58:56.160" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t go off to, you know, wherever.</div><div id="00:58:57.680" class="transcript_line"> There would be, you know,</div><div id="00:58:59.520" class="transcript_line"> people with no money would be down on the beach.</div><div id="00:59:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Not even in your time?</div><div id="00:59:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:04.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, when I was a kid,</div><div id="00:59:05.040" class="transcript_line"> there was still sand and shell there.</div><div id="00:59:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:59:07.520" class="transcript_line"> It caused sand.</div><div id="00:59:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:09.200" class="transcript_line"> And you get a lot of wood washed up there.</div><div id="00:59:14.040" class="transcript_line"> And what they used to do is put a stone on the wood.</div><div id="00:59:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:21.240" class="transcript_line"> So anybody who, if you&#039;ve seen a stone on top of a log,</div><div id="00:59:26.720" class="transcript_line"> somebody claimed it.</div><div id="00:59:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, really?</div><div id="00:59:29.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:30.480" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember a little cat in the back yard</div><div id="00:59:32.240" class="transcript_line"> of my grandparents&#039; house,</div><div id="00:59:34.400" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what they would use.</div><div id="00:59:35.440" class="transcript_line"> They would go down with a cat and bring the wood back</div><div id="00:59:37.800" class="transcript_line"> and chop it up.</div><div id="00:59:38.920" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:59:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:41.560" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about Bob Leonard.</div><div id="00:59:44.200" class="transcript_line"> Is he a chap who passed away last year?</div><div id="00:59:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he passed away this time last year, January, February.</div><div id="00:59:49.360" class="transcript_line"> And the nicest bloke you could wish to meet.</div><div id="00:59:53.480" class="transcript_line"> And he grew up, his dad was Grantley Leonard.</div><div id="00:59:57.920" class="transcript_line"> He was one of several children.</div><div id="01:00:01.200" class="transcript_line"> And Grantley, his father was a fisherman.</div><div id="01:00:06.360" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the fishermen in the group,</div><div id="01:00:08.040" class="transcript_line"> they were all related.</div><div id="01:00:09.720" class="transcript_line"> Cousins, Dougie, Jim Foster.</div><div id="01:00:14.520" class="transcript_line"> There was like a little hamlet down here.</div><div id="01:00:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Okay?</div><div id="01:00:19.920" class="transcript_line"> His dad was like a butcher.</div><div id="01:00:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And they butchered cows down here,</div><div id="01:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> sheep and all sorts down here,</div><div id="01:00:26.440" class="transcript_line"> McCollum and all sorts.</div><div id="01:00:28.800" class="transcript_line"> And Bob, I&#039;m not sure if he was one of the youngest,</div><div id="01:00:32.880" class="transcript_line"> but he was brought into the fishing</div><div id="01:00:37.880" class="transcript_line"> when he was a young man.</div><div id="01:00:39.040" class="transcript_line"> He worked in the brewery.</div><div id="01:00:45.280" class="transcript_line"> He finished up in the brewery anyway.</div><div id="01:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d done loads of different jobs, Bob.</div><div id="01:00:50.520" class="transcript_line"> But he was basically the one who taught us how to fish.</div><div id="01:00:54.840" class="transcript_line"> As I say, when we joined the fishing,</div><div id="01:00:57.280" class="transcript_line"> he took us under a wing and we had a little boat.</div><div id="01:01:02.320" class="transcript_line"> And they weren&#039;t at that time,</div><div id="01:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> they were struggling to get it into the water</div><div id="01:01:05.640" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s quite laborious trying to get that boat</div><div id="01:01:09.280" class="transcript_line"> down from the foreshore,</div><div id="01:01:10.520" class="transcript_line"> down onto a mooring, what we call the bay,</div><div id="01:01:13.120" class="transcript_line"> onto a chain mooring.</div><div id="01:01:14.960" class="transcript_line"> And they were basically just fishing in the gut,</div><div id="01:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> just off Black Rock Bayer.</div><div id="01:01:20.960" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t able to go sort of offshore.</div><div id="01:01:22.520" class="transcript_line"> So Bob was glad in a way that we served a purpose really,</div><div id="01:01:27.560" class="transcript_line"> I suppose.</div><div id="01:01:28.400" class="transcript_line"> Two young lads.</div><div id="01:01:29.240" class="transcript_line"> Two young boys come in.</div><div id="01:01:30.600" class="transcript_line"> And over the years, we sort of got closer and closer,</div><div id="01:01:36.440" class="transcript_line"> you know, sort of Bob, me and Richard.</div><div id="01:01:38.640" class="transcript_line"> And basically at one point,</div><div id="01:01:40.080" class="transcript_line"> it was just me, Bob and Richard fishing.</div><div id="01:01:42.160" class="transcript_line"> And Bob, I&#039;d say to him,</div><div id="01:01:44.200" class="transcript_line"> it could be quite rough down there.</div><div id="01:01:45.480" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d say, I&#039;d say, where do you want to go, Bob?</div><div id="01:01:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Down the hole.</div><div id="01:01:51.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say, a bit rough, Bob.</div><div id="01:01:52.320" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s all right.</div><div id="01:01:53.680" class="transcript_line"> And off we go.</div><div id="01:01:54.600" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d always want to go down to the hole.</div><div id="01:01:56.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, we&#039;ll get a fish down there.</div><div id="01:01:57.160" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d get a fish down there.</div><div id="01:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And off we go and sort of down there.</div><div id="01:02:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Was he actually right?</div><div id="01:02:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, it was always a chance,</div><div id="01:02:04.480" class="transcript_line"> but he loved it.</div><div id="01:02:05.320" class="transcript_line"> It was his favorite spot as such.</div><div id="01:02:06.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, he&#039;d always want to go down there.</div><div id="01:02:07.800" class="transcript_line"> If the wind was right,</div><div id="01:02:09.320" class="transcript_line"> because you always got to go with the wind,</div><div id="01:02:10.640" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t go against the wind.</div><div id="01:02:12.880" class="transcript_line"> But he was a sort of,</div><div id="01:02:18.240" class="transcript_line"> he showed us the ways.</div><div id="01:02:20.680" class="transcript_line"> When my brother and I come into the fishing,</div><div id="01:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> the one like it is today, okay,</div><div id="01:02:25.440" class="transcript_line"> is you have to do it for yourself.</div><div id="01:02:28.800" class="transcript_line"> You have to make your own.</div><div id="01:02:30.400" class="transcript_line"> No, they would,</div><div id="01:02:31.280" class="transcript_line"> and the youngs just come into the fishing today.</div><div id="01:02:34.480" class="transcript_line"> We help them sort of, you know,</div><div id="01:02:35.680" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll help them make a net</div><div id="01:02:37.080" class="transcript_line"> and all the rest of them show them the ropes.</div><div id="01:02:38.600" class="transcript_line"> But they sort of, you know,</div><div id="01:02:40.880" class="transcript_line"> they would not show you a great deal.</div><div id="01:02:43.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was just different completely.</div><div id="01:02:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Bob did take us under our wing</div><div id="01:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d tell us all the old stories</div><div id="01:02:49.320" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you know, show us how to fish,</div><div id="01:02:52.280" class="transcript_line"> what to do, what not to do.</div><div id="01:02:54.360" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of things did he show?</div><div id="01:02:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="01:02:56.960" class="transcript_line"> What sort of stories did he tell you?</div><div id="01:02:58.160" class="transcript_line"> What sort of things did he show you to do?</div><div id="01:03:00.080" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he told us one story.</div><div id="01:03:02.920" class="transcript_line"> He told us the other one was,</div><div id="01:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a railway side in Justin Blackrock</div><div id="01:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> where the queen, the Royal Family used to come in overnight</div><div id="01:03:15.800" class="transcript_line"> to stop on their way back to London.</div><div id="01:03:17.920" class="transcript_line"> And one day he sat there and he said,</div><div id="01:03:21.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah, me and Doug were walking back from the fishing.</div><div id="01:03:23.360" class="transcript_line"> We had two salmon and who should we bump into?</div><div id="01:03:26.280" class="transcript_line"> It was Prince Philip.</div><div id="01:03:27.440" class="transcript_line"> No, he said, don&#039;t go back, this must have been the 50s.</div><div id="01:03:32.720" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh yeah, he sort of said hello, good morning.</div><div id="01:03:36.640" class="transcript_line"> And ended up giving them a salmon.</div><div id="01:03:40.080" class="transcript_line"> So that was on the road.</div><div id="01:03:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Because there was a line of cottages on the side end.</div><div id="01:03:45.320" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d gone there.</div><div id="01:03:46.520" class="transcript_line"> And with Dougie and a few of the others lived.</div><div id="01:03:50.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d all been, and they were walking on</div><div id="01:03:52.720" class="transcript_line"> and they bumped into Prince Philip.</div><div id="01:03:53.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s hilarious.</div><div id="01:03:54.400" class="transcript_line"> And he wouldn&#039;t lie.</div><div id="01:03:55.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he sort of, he did.</div><div id="01:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d often attempted to write to Prince Philip</div><div id="01:04:01.200" class="transcript_line"> to ask if he remembers the event.</div><div id="01:04:03.080" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I mean, he&#039;d tell you about, oh crikey.</div><div id="01:04:09.280" class="transcript_line"> We would, they&#039;d been converted now,</div><div id="01:04:11.840" class="transcript_line"> the houses that you drove past.</div><div id="01:04:15.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s the first house, the stone house.</div><div id="01:04:18.680" class="transcript_line"> And when we first started off,</div><div id="01:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s where we used to keep the nets.</div><div id="01:04:23.200" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d always kept the nets in there.</div><div id="01:04:24.520" class="transcript_line"> It was just a Bob&#039;s band.</div><div id="01:04:30.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d done a little exhibition for somebody in there.</div><div id="01:04:34.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going back, 15, more than 15 years ago.</div><div id="01:04:40.120" class="transcript_line"> And we were in there, setting out all the pictures</div><div id="01:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> and all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:04:45.440" class="transcript_line"> And I said to Bob, I said, what&#039;s that?</div><div id="01:04:49.440" class="transcript_line"> And there was a wooden post with a ring in it</div><div id="01:04:58.760" class="transcript_line"> in the corner of this band.</div><div id="01:05:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Post was, oh, post with a big steel ring in it.</div><div id="01:05:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, that&#039;s where we used to draw him in.</div><div id="01:05:10.320" class="transcript_line"> I said, what?</div><div id="01:05:13.760" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d draw him in on that, he said.</div><div id="01:05:15.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, as a matter of fact.</div><div id="01:05:17.920" class="transcript_line"> I said, draw what in?</div><div id="01:05:20.120" class="transcript_line"> He said, the beast.</div><div id="01:05:22.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, what?</div><div id="01:05:24.960" class="transcript_line"> And he said, yeah, we put a rope through there.</div><div id="01:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d pull a beast in through the door in the back</div><div id="01:05:29.800" class="transcript_line"> and then, boom, hit him over the edge of the sledgehammer.</div><div id="01:05:33.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m not joking.</div><div id="01:05:36.440" class="transcript_line"> He was a country man.</div><div id="01:05:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And they say his father,</div><div id="01:05:41.400" class="transcript_line"> they used to be a butcher and all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:05:43.920" class="transcript_line"> Even on the door frame of that particular building,</div><div id="01:05:46.400" class="transcript_line"> there were two real hooks, if you like.</div><div id="01:05:51.160" class="transcript_line"> And again, there was one missing,</div><div id="01:05:53.040" class="transcript_line"> but the one little forged hook.</div><div id="01:05:56.600" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, what&#039;s that in, Bob?</div><div id="01:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, well, that&#039;s where we used to hang up the sheep.</div><div id="01:06:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yeah.</div><div id="01:06:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be blood running down the rubble,</div><div id="01:06:05.320" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t you think, you know?</div><div id="01:06:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:06:07.120" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, that&#039;s how they done it in those days.</div><div id="01:06:10.480" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of cautionary tales did he ever tell you?</div><div id="01:06:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Black fog was a big one, I suppose.</div><div id="01:06:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Black fog.</div><div id="01:06:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, black fog.</div><div id="01:06:20.960" class="transcript_line"> He used to tell us,</div><div id="01:06:24.400" class="transcript_line"> beware of the black fog, you know,</div><div id="01:06:26.080" class="transcript_line"> when we started off and all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:06:27.720" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, yeah, we&#039;d take all the pinch of salt.</div><div id="01:06:34.760" class="transcript_line"> What happens is that you can be out there fishing</div><div id="01:06:38.600" class="transcript_line"> and the fog will descend</div><div id="01:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and you just can&#039;t see nothing, basically.</div><div id="01:06:42.280" class="transcript_line"> And he likened it to somebody just turning off the light.</div><div id="01:06:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think he was probably talking more so</div><div id="01:06:52.440" class="transcript_line"> when it&#039;s dark, you know, in the evening, perhaps.</div><div id="01:06:56.280" class="transcript_line"> But he would always go on about,</div><div id="01:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> be very careful of the fog, you know,</div><div id="01:06:59.720" class="transcript_line"> the fog and all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:07:00.920" class="transcript_line"> Take your compass and, you know,</div><div id="01:07:02.720" class="transcript_line"> sort of know what you&#039;re doing.</div><div id="01:07:06.600" class="transcript_line"> But we would, we&#039;d take it with a pinch of salt.</div><div id="01:07:08.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d never seen nothing.</div><div id="01:07:09.440" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of just didn&#039;t bother us, really.</div><div id="01:07:12.440" class="transcript_line"> But then my brother one day was out there in Gruggy</div><div id="01:07:15.840" class="transcript_line"> on his own.</div><div id="01:07:17.320" class="transcript_line"> He hadn&#039;t been fishing that long,</div><div id="01:07:19.480" class="transcript_line"> but he&#039;s a river fan I like</div><div id="01:07:21.480" class="transcript_line"> and he sort of knows about the estuary.</div><div id="01:07:23.400" class="transcript_line"> He spent a lot of time out there.</div><div id="01:07:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And he said he was at the,</div><div id="01:07:26.480" class="transcript_line"> 20 minutes before the end of the fishing,</div><div id="01:07:27.960" class="transcript_line"> bloody and calm morning, early morning,</div><div id="01:07:31.640" class="transcript_line"> when we were able to fish in the early part of the year.</div><div id="01:07:34.320" class="transcript_line"> And he looked to the west,</div><div id="01:07:35.880" class="transcript_line"> there was a bank of fog coming in.</div><div id="01:07:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And he took the compass bearing,</div><div id="01:07:42.240" class="transcript_line"> picked his net up, gone onto the bank.</div><div id="01:07:44.400" class="transcript_line"> It was there in mid channel.</div><div id="01:07:46.560" class="transcript_line"> And it enveloped him within minutes.</div><div id="01:07:49.600" class="transcript_line"> And he couldn&#039;t hear the traffic on the bridge.</div><div id="01:07:51.960" class="transcript_line"> Couldn&#039;t hear the water coming out of the pumping station,</div><div id="01:07:55.240" class="transcript_line"> seven tunnel pumping station,</div><div id="01:07:56.400" class="transcript_line"> where it flows out by the dock.</div><div id="01:07:57.880" class="transcript_line"> Could he just close all the noise out completely.</div><div id="01:08:01.600" class="transcript_line"> And he couldn&#039;t see his hand in front of his face.</div><div id="01:08:03.880" class="transcript_line"> It was so thick.</div><div id="01:08:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s scary.</div><div id="01:08:05.720" class="transcript_line"> So he knew he had 20 minutes to get back</div><div id="01:08:08.240" class="transcript_line"> to the last channel, the gut,</div><div id="01:08:09.680" class="transcript_line"> before he started filling up behind him.</div><div id="01:08:11.800" class="transcript_line"> So he got across a reef called the Lady Bench</div><div id="01:08:14.600" class="transcript_line"> and another little gully,</div><div id="01:08:18.640" class="transcript_line"> onwards then to the gut.</div><div id="01:08:20.040" class="transcript_line"> So he was picking his way back as best he could.</div><div id="01:08:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Sort of had his beer in,</div><div id="01:08:25.440" class="transcript_line"> sort of knew the terrain differs all the time.</div><div id="01:08:30.120" class="transcript_line"> He got a good understanding of that, watching his feet.</div><div id="01:08:32.800" class="transcript_line"> Try not to panic.</div><div id="01:08:34.280" class="transcript_line"> When he got to the guts, the last gully, it had filled in.</div><div id="01:08:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And he went through all his tiptoes.</div><div id="01:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He had no radio, no phone, no life jacket on that there.</div><div id="01:08:43.120" class="transcript_line"> So he was very lucky to get back.</div><div id="01:08:45.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very, very lucky.</div><div id="01:08:47.560" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, he&#039;d...</div><div id="01:08:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m always amazed</div><div id="01:08:51.920" class="transcript_line"> when you put these photographs up.</div><div id="01:08:53.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m thinking, because I&#039;ve only crossed the estuary</div><div id="01:08:57.560" class="transcript_line"> on the bridge, you know.</div><div id="01:08:58.840" class="transcript_line"> And it always looks like such a treacherous stretch</div><div id="01:09:01.400" class="transcript_line"> of water to me.</div><div id="01:09:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="01:09:03.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s deadly.</div><div id="01:09:04.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s...</div><div id="01:09:07.520" class="transcript_line"> You get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time</div><div id="01:09:09.520" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re dead.</div><div id="01:09:10.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no way you will drown.</div><div id="01:09:12.240" class="transcript_line"> But it was...</div><div id="01:09:15.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s unforgiving.</div><div id="01:09:17.480" class="transcript_line"> I was out there a couple of times</div><div id="01:09:19.880" class="transcript_line"> I nearly came unstuck.</div><div id="01:09:23.040" class="transcript_line"> One was, I used to work in a steelworks,</div><div id="01:09:25.760" class="transcript_line"> non-shifts, and I would do anything</div><div id="01:09:27.920" class="transcript_line"> when the tide was right to get out to go fishing.</div><div id="01:09:31.240" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d be on a night shift and they&#039;d always say to me,</div><div id="01:09:34.120" class="transcript_line"> why do you always take your holidays?</div><div id="01:09:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Two hours, you&#039;re in two hours there.</div><div id="01:09:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And I would just, you know, it&#039;d be 10 till six at night.</div><div id="01:09:41.120" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d be wanting to get out to the Abbas</div><div id="01:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> two in the morning, sort of thing.</div><div id="01:09:44.280" class="transcript_line"> And you just knew it.</div><div id="01:09:45.840" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, this one morning, I was pretty tired, right?</div><div id="01:09:49.400" class="transcript_line"> And the fishing was at Abbas three in June.</div><div id="01:09:54.160" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re talking about just getting light</div><div id="01:09:56.120" class="transcript_line"> when the fishing starts, which is what these days</div><div id="01:09:58.520" class="transcript_line"> is when we, the only time we&#039;ll ever fish in the day.</div><div id="01:10:02.120" class="transcript_line"> So I finished work Abbas two,</div><div id="01:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> drove down to Black Rock, nobody asked down here,</div><div id="01:10:08.800" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;m on my own.</div><div id="01:10:09.960" class="transcript_line"> So off I go, it was pretty calm, I&#039;m on a bad tide.</div><div id="01:10:13.760" class="transcript_line"> So I thought I&#039;d go down the oar,</div><div id="01:10:15.400" class="transcript_line"> denied the engine, so I had to row down.</div><div id="01:10:18.040" class="transcript_line"> And we always used to keep three oars in the boat,</div><div id="01:10:21.560" class="transcript_line"> two for rowing, one for sculling.</div><div id="01:10:24.360" class="transcript_line"> So jumped in the boat, took it off the mooring,</div><div id="01:10:26.920" class="transcript_line"> rowed out into the stream,</div><div id="01:10:28.840" class="transcript_line"> heading down towards the bridge</div><div id="01:10:31.960" class="transcript_line"> and then went under the bridge.</div><div id="01:10:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Just starting to get light.</div><div id="01:10:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Again, in those days, we didn&#039;t have life jackets</div><div id="01:10:38.720" class="transcript_line"> or nothing really.</div><div id="01:10:40.280" class="transcript_line"> And the way to do it,</div><div id="01:10:44.640" class="transcript_line"> when the hole is quite a treacherous place,</div><div id="01:10:47.240" class="transcript_line"> because what happens, you&#039;ve got like a deep area</div><div id="01:10:52.280" class="transcript_line"> and a shallow area and then another deep area.</div><div id="01:10:55.200" class="transcript_line"> And the idea is to anchor on this rocky reef,</div><div id="01:11:00.080" class="transcript_line"> we call the hole.</div><div id="01:11:02.080" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a bar that makes it so,</div><div id="01:11:07.120" class="transcript_line"> in theory, you can&#039;t go wrong.</div><div id="01:11:08.880" class="transcript_line"> With an engine, you&#039;ll go past the bar</div><div id="01:11:11.040" class="transcript_line"> and then come back up against the ebb and tide, okay?</div><div id="01:11:14.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got, it&#039;s impossible to row against the tide,</div><div id="01:11:16.880" class="transcript_line"> the tide is so fierce, it might be five or six knots.</div><div id="01:11:19.600" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s just tearing through it.</div><div id="01:11:21.760" class="transcript_line"> So what you do is stop well before the bar and the reef</div><div id="01:11:25.320" class="transcript_line"> and turn the boat around with the oars,</div><div id="01:11:28.600" class="transcript_line"> whip it around with the oars,</div><div id="01:11:30.640" class="transcript_line"> and then bring the oars in</div><div id="01:11:34.680" class="transcript_line"> and go forward to the anchor.</div><div id="01:11:38.840" class="transcript_line"> And as the boat goes back down backwards,</div><div id="01:11:40.960" class="transcript_line"> you throw the anchor out and hopefully you&#039;ll grip</div><div id="01:11:44.520" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ll end up in the right place.</div><div id="01:11:46.360" class="transcript_line"> So I row down, I spin the boat around,</div><div id="01:11:50.640" class="transcript_line"> position the boat the best I could,</div><div id="01:11:52.720" class="transcript_line"> going backwards down with the tide now to my mark.</div><div id="01:11:57.960" class="transcript_line"> I run, well not run, I try to get forward as quick as I can.</div><div id="01:12:01.320" class="transcript_line"> So I mean, I read to get the anchor down</div><div id="01:12:04.360" class="transcript_line"> and I get my foot caught in an oar on the way forward</div><div id="01:12:07.800" class="transcript_line"> and I go over the side of the boat.</div><div id="01:12:10.680" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m half in, half out.</div><div id="01:12:12.320" class="transcript_line"> The oar flew up in the air and it was gone.</div><div id="01:12:15.080" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m hanging there.</div><div id="01:12:16.720" class="transcript_line"> So I let go of the anchor, sort of,</div><div id="01:12:19.520" class="transcript_line"> sort of, and it was a nightmare.</div><div id="01:12:21.960" class="transcript_line"> And I just-</div><div id="01:12:22.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how frightening, were you scared?</div><div id="01:12:24.120" class="transcript_line"> It happened so quick.</div><div id="01:12:25.520" class="transcript_line"> And I just, I was there, I&#039;m in, I&#039;m out.</div><div id="01:12:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Just managed to drag myself back over the boat was tipping,</div><div id="01:12:33.320" class="transcript_line"> but I just managed to pull myself back into the boat.</div><div id="01:12:36.240" class="transcript_line"> Nobody would have known how did it go.</div><div id="01:12:38.280" class="transcript_line"> So just like that.</div><div id="01:12:39.120" class="transcript_line"> You were lucky, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:12:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very lucky.</div><div id="01:12:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Did you stay or did you come back in?</div><div id="01:12:41.640" class="transcript_line"> No, I carried on fishing.</div><div id="01:12:43.480" class="transcript_line"> So it was just, you know, a wake up call, like, you know,</div><div id="01:12:47.760" class="transcript_line"> really, and, you know, I hasten to say that these days,</div><div id="01:12:51.280" class="transcript_line"> you know, we all got life jackets and all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:12:53.520" class="transcript_line"> When I started, none of them wore anything like that.</div><div id="01:12:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Most of them couldn&#039;t swim.</div><div id="01:12:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Not that swimming&#039;s gonna do you much good out there,</div><div id="01:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> but we said, what are we gonna do?</div><div id="01:13:01.600" class="transcript_line"> We used to say, well, we can do it.</div><div id="01:13:02.760" class="transcript_line"> The boat goes down all the way, it&#039;s a mean going.</div><div id="01:13:04.600" class="transcript_line"> They would just say, do this, do that.</div><div id="01:13:08.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re just gonna drown.</div><div id="01:13:09.080" class="transcript_line"> You all got waders on, like, you know,</div><div id="01:13:10.520" class="transcript_line"> you just got no chance.</div><div id="01:13:12.160" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re pretty safety conscious these days.</div><div id="01:13:14.040" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re also often posted about</div><div id="01:13:16.160" class="transcript_line"> some of the amazing things you find.</div><div id="01:13:19.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, it&#039;s, oh gosh.</div><div id="01:13:23.520" class="transcript_line"> What have we found over the years?</div><div id="01:13:24.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, somebody asked me that today,</div><div id="01:13:27.040" class="transcript_line"> and probably the most, you know,</div><div id="01:13:32.880" class="transcript_line"> the best thing we&#039;ve found, I suppose,</div><div id="01:13:34.400" class="transcript_line"> is the fishing baskets, the ancient fishing baskets</div><div id="01:13:37.440" class="transcript_line"> that were found on the fishing grounds.</div><div id="01:13:40.600" class="transcript_line"> Now, when they built the second seven croft,</div><div id="01:13:42.640" class="transcript_line"> when we were kids, we would go out</div><div id="01:13:45.040" class="transcript_line"> and find baskets occasionally, okay?</div><div id="01:13:49.280" class="transcript_line"> These fishing baskets.</div><div id="01:13:50.120" class="transcript_line"> You mean like this, putchers you mean?</div><div id="01:13:51.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, not putchers.</div><div id="01:13:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Like this.</div><div id="01:13:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh really, okay.</div><div id="01:13:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay, off sub-rock you would find them.</div><div id="01:14:00.880" class="transcript_line"> And they would be uncovered one day, gone the next.</div><div id="01:14:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Covered back up, I should say, the next.</div><div id="01:14:07.120" class="transcript_line"> When we were kids, and never give it a second thought.</div><div id="01:14:11.320" class="transcript_line"> When they built second seven crossings,</div><div id="01:14:12.800" class="transcript_line"> they altered the estuary completely.</div><div id="01:14:15.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you wouldn&#039;t believe the changes out there.</div><div id="01:14:18.640" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean?</div><div id="01:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The foreshore, for a start.</div><div id="01:14:22.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there were fishing communities in Caldicot Pill.</div><div id="01:14:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Not salmon fishing, whitefish fishing communities</div><div id="01:14:30.360" class="transcript_line"> that used to walk from Caldicot Pill,</div><div id="01:14:35.320" class="transcript_line"> Carver&#039;s Town they used to call it,</div><div id="01:14:37.480" class="transcript_line"> out to the Luby and the man, and the Bedwins,</div><div id="01:14:42.520" class="transcript_line"> and the lake, beyond that.</div><div id="01:14:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:14:47.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, there might be dozens of them in there.</div><div id="01:14:50.160" class="transcript_line"> Used to fish on a regular basis to submit again subsistence.</div><div id="01:14:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:14:54.680" class="transcript_line"> And they would walk out, in Caldicot Pill,</div><div id="01:14:57.600" class="transcript_line"> and the mud and shingle would be no deeper than that.</div><div id="01:15:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay, ankle deep, thigh deep, not sorry, thigh deep.</div><div id="01:15:04.480" class="transcript_line"> Ankle deep, calf deep.</div><div id="01:15:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Easy walk, anybody can do it.</div><div id="01:15:10.520" class="transcript_line"> When they built the bridge,</div><div id="01:15:11.680" class="transcript_line"> the mud level increased substantially.</div><div id="01:15:15.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now, you&#039;d be up to your thighs,</div><div id="01:15:17.880" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s impossible to do it.</div><div id="01:15:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely impossible to do it.</div><div id="01:15:22.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s changed that much out there.</div><div id="01:15:24.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s getting deeper, I think.</div><div id="01:15:26.880" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s in the Caldicot, sort of suburb area.</div><div id="01:15:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Again, when I used to walk out when I was a kid,</div><div id="01:15:34.800" class="transcript_line"> it was quite easy.</div><div id="01:15:35.640" class="transcript_line"> Now, when you get sort of anywhere near the Luby out there,</div><div id="01:15:39.480" class="transcript_line"> it is almost impossible.</div><div id="01:15:42.920" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s one big change.</div><div id="01:15:46.280" class="transcript_line"> And also, behind the caissons, some of the caissons,</div><div id="01:15:50.880" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got massive gravel banks built up, loose stone,</div><div id="01:15:53.680" class="transcript_line"> which is off to the floor of the estuary.</div><div id="01:15:58.480" class="transcript_line"> But the main one, I&#039;d say, is the depth of the mud</div><div id="01:16:01.200" class="transcript_line"> on the foreshore, quite substantially.</div><div id="01:16:03.680" class="transcript_line"> And those, it&#039;s impossible to walk out there now from there.</div><div id="01:16:09.800" class="transcript_line"> It must be a thrill finding something, though.</div><div id="01:16:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I mean, finding those baskets,</div><div id="01:16:16.880" class="transcript_line"> as I say, when we were kids,</div><div id="01:16:17.720" class="transcript_line"> we used to see them occasionally and thought nothing of it.</div><div id="01:16:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And then after the bridge was built,</div><div id="01:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> certain areas out there started to scour away.</div><div id="01:16:24.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s constantly changing.</div><div id="01:16:26.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got pools where there were never pools before,</div><div id="01:16:28.920" class="transcript_line"> banks where there were never banks before.</div><div id="01:16:30.840" class="transcript_line"> And then the one day we were out there,</div><div id="01:16:32.160" class="transcript_line"> it was 2006, I think, after a winter storm.</div><div id="01:16:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And we stumbled across not one,</div><div id="01:16:39.520" class="transcript_line"> but about two dozen of these baskets.</div><div id="01:16:43.080" class="transcript_line"> Also, hedging, putts.</div><div id="01:16:45.400" class="transcript_line"> Hedging, did you say?</div><div id="01:16:46.880" class="transcript_line"> Hedging is like a leader that leads into a bigger fish trap.</div><div id="01:16:52.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got those big putts there.</div><div id="01:16:54.880" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a copy of, we found those out there.</div><div id="01:16:57.240" class="transcript_line"> All turned to peat as such, not peat,</div><div id="01:16:59.600" class="transcript_line"> but, you know, sort of old, very old.</div><div id="01:17:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Because what happens, the silt is scoured away,</div><div id="01:17:06.800" class="transcript_line"> you get down to the blue clay,</div><div id="01:17:08.720" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where the stuff is, okay?</div><div id="01:17:10.440" class="transcript_line"> And we had never seen so many.</div><div id="01:17:14.440" class="transcript_line"> And again, we sort of hesitated a little bit,</div><div id="01:17:17.480" class="transcript_line"> so left it, and then before long,</div><div id="01:17:19.760" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t getting recovered like it did years ago.</div><div id="01:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It wouldn&#039;t get recovered.</div><div id="01:17:23.200" class="transcript_line"> It was just scouring and scouring,</div><div id="01:17:24.720" class="transcript_line"> and the rocks would roll across the entry bed</div><div id="01:17:26.880" class="transcript_line"> and smash them up.</div><div id="01:17:28.120" class="transcript_line"> So we thought we&#039;d better do something about it.</div><div id="01:17:29.880" class="transcript_line"> So we found Caddo and a guy called Rick Turner,</div><div id="01:17:32.760" class="transcript_line"> who again, has recently passed away.</div><div id="01:17:36.920" class="transcript_line"> So Rick come down, and he had a look,</div><div id="01:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and then he got ready and university involved,</div><div id="01:17:43.480" class="transcript_line"> and they, Cab and dated.</div><div id="01:17:45.960" class="transcript_line"> They took samples, we took them down,</div><div id="01:17:47.360" class="transcript_line"> on a terrible, terrible January day,</div><div id="01:17:52.080" class="transcript_line"> like it was Halloween Gale,</div><div id="01:17:53.720" class="transcript_line"> and they were really sort of impressed</div><div id="01:17:56.040" class="transcript_line"> with what they were seeing,</div><div id="01:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were taking Cab and samples of all these baskets.</div><div id="01:18:00.600" class="transcript_line"> And they were, you know, lots like this,</div><div id="01:18:03.120" class="transcript_line"> this ear and shape, lots and lots,</div><div id="01:18:04.760" class="transcript_line"> but there were others as well,</div><div id="01:18:05.760" class="transcript_line"> that were completely different, so older.</div><div id="01:18:08.680" class="transcript_line"> And you look at them,</div><div id="01:18:12.200" class="transcript_line"> and some of them look like they were made yesterday.</div><div id="01:18:14.480" class="transcript_line"> Do you know how old they were?</div><div id="01:18:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were Cab dated</div><div id="01:18:18.080" class="transcript_line"> till between the 11th and 15th century.</div><div id="01:18:20.920" class="transcript_line"> Are you kidding me?</div><div id="01:18:22.760" class="transcript_line"> The 11th and 15th century.</div><div id="01:18:24.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, is that exciting?</div><div id="01:18:25.240" class="transcript_line"> And Rick Turner did a paper on it,</div><div id="01:18:27.080" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;ve researched it.</div><div id="01:18:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:18:30.640" class="transcript_line"> For the seven levels research committee,</div><div id="01:18:32.880" class="transcript_line"> I think it was at the time.</div><div id="01:18:35.280" class="transcript_line"> And he did a paper on that find,</div><div id="01:18:39.920" class="transcript_line"> and it was described as significant,</div><div id="01:18:45.200" class="transcript_line"> and all the rest of it,</div><div id="01:18:46.360" class="transcript_line"> and it was very impressive anyway.</div><div id="01:18:48.080" class="transcript_line"> But he was with Caddo?</div><div id="01:18:49.640" class="transcript_line"> He was with Caddo.</div><div id="01:18:50.480" class="transcript_line"> So I might find that there.</div><div id="01:18:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but the seven levels research committee</div><div id="01:18:55.200" class="transcript_line"> was one of these organizations,</div><div id="01:18:57.160" class="transcript_line"> they had it until round about that time.</div><div id="01:18:59.320" class="transcript_line"> So God knows it could have been by then.</div><div id="01:19:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, probably gone now,</div><div id="01:19:02.080" class="transcript_line"> but I think he&#039;d done the paper in 2007, perhaps, you know,</div><div id="01:19:07.920" class="transcript_line"> and 18 rings down as well.</div><div id="01:19:11.240" class="transcript_line"> It might have been number 18 publication or something.</div><div id="01:19:15.400" class="transcript_line"> I did have a copy of it, but I can&#039;t find it.</div><div id="01:19:18.080" class="transcript_line"> Wow, how fascinating.</div><div id="01:19:19.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was that.</div><div id="01:19:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Do you really are treading in the Foots, Texas?</div><div id="01:19:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:19:26.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re four bears, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:19:27.280" class="transcript_line"> We feel that when we&#039;re out there,</div><div id="01:19:28.600" class="transcript_line"> and people are fished out there forever.</div><div id="01:19:31.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean,</div><div id="01:19:32.360" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re in the footsteps of your ancestors,</div><div id="01:19:38.920" class="transcript_line"> your forefathers,</div><div id="01:19:40.760" class="transcript_line"> and to me, that&#039;s a big part of it.</div><div id="01:19:44.360" class="transcript_line"> I feel it&#039;s a gift really.</div><div id="01:19:45.720" class="transcript_line"> And I think all that&#039;s happened over the last 20 years</div><div id="01:19:49.960" class="transcript_line"> has been fate.</div><div id="01:19:52.240" class="transcript_line"> If we hadn&#039;t have got the licenses when we did,</div><div id="01:19:55.000" class="transcript_line"> the fishing wouldn&#039;t have been here now.</div><div id="01:19:56.800" class="transcript_line"> Without a doubt, it would have gone.</div><div id="01:19:59.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d be gone forever.</div><div id="01:20:00.280" class="transcript_line"> And all the skills and knowledge,</div><div id="01:20:02.360" class="transcript_line"> and what arms it didn&#039;t do any air,</div><div id="01:20:04.640" class="transcript_line"> but it, you know, and we&#039;ve built this fishery now.</div><div id="01:20:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay, you know, we&#039;ve had to agree to restrictions,</div><div id="01:20:15.440" class="transcript_line"> severe restrictions really,</div><div id="01:20:17.480" class="transcript_line"> but the new fishermen now don&#039;t know any different.</div><div id="01:20:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So, and I&#039;m realistic to know</div><div id="01:20:24.880" class="transcript_line"> that you ain&#039;t gonna get anything back.</div><div id="01:20:26.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, once it takes everything,</div><div id="01:20:27.400" class="transcript_line"> they ain&#039;t gonna give it back.</div><div id="01:20:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Natural resources as well, so aren&#039;t anybody else.</div><div id="01:20:31.320" class="transcript_line"> But that said, we&#039;re quite happy.</div><div id="01:20:33.760" class="transcript_line"> As long as they leave us alone,</div><div id="01:20:35.280" class="transcript_line"> and don&#039;t give us all the grief,</div><div id="01:20:36.960" class="transcript_line"> and then why should they?</div><div id="01:20:38.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;re doing no harm.</div><div id="01:20:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Closing us down is not gonna make a bloody</div><div id="01:20:42.360" class="transcript_line"> minute difference to salmon stock.</div><div id="01:20:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Neither are the other fisheries</div><div id="01:20:45.880" class="transcript_line"> that have been closed down proportionately.</div><div id="01:20:47.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they&#039;ve closed them all down.</div><div id="01:20:49.160" class="transcript_line"> The problems lie on the rivers.</div><div id="01:20:52.360" class="transcript_line"> So as those salmon take a turn into the rivers,</div><div id="01:20:55.040" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re under so much pressure, you wouldn&#039;t believe.</div><div id="01:20:59.800" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t possibly overfish anyway, can you here?</div><div id="01:21:01.400" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s possible, because you cannot fish</div><div id="01:21:03.800" class="transcript_line"> for 99.9% of the time.</div><div id="01:21:06.160" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s, for me, you see, you know,</div><div id="01:21:07.680" class="transcript_line"> when you go down the coast a bit,</div><div id="01:21:09.800" class="transcript_line"> the footprint that they find,</div><div id="01:21:11.800" class="transcript_line"> the stone age footprints of women and their child,</div><div id="01:21:14.600" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s celebrated, which is fantastic, fine,</div><div id="01:21:18.640" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t help, for me, you see,</div><div id="01:21:21.280" class="transcript_line"> social historian, you are really treading in the footsteps</div><div id="01:21:24.560" class="transcript_line"> of your ancestors in keeping this alive.</div><div id="01:21:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we are, and it&#039;s been recorded on the estuary</div><div id="01:21:32.360" class="transcript_line"> in the 17th century, but it must predate that.</div><div id="01:21:34.920" class="transcript_line"> Must do. Must do.</div><div id="01:21:37.120" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of things are important to me,</div><div id="01:21:39.720" class="transcript_line"> but preserving a way of life is important,</div><div id="01:21:43.520" class="transcript_line"> and what they don&#039;t realize is if I thought</div><div id="01:21:47.160" class="transcript_line"> we were having any effect on salmon stock,</div><div id="01:21:48.800" class="transcript_line"> so I would have stopped a long time ago,</div><div id="01:21:50.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have walked away.</div><div id="01:21:51.480" class="transcript_line"> If we had been stringing a net across the mouth of the Y,</div><div id="01:21:55.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have said, hang on, boys,</div><div id="01:21:56.680" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re gonna sort of stop and think about this,</div><div id="01:21:58.960" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s funny how things have happened.</div><div id="01:22:00.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we&#039;ve sort of, you know, we&#039;ve got it out there,</div><div id="01:22:04.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, people understand what we&#039;re trying to do,</div><div id="01:22:08.480" class="transcript_line"> they see what we&#039;re trying to do,</div><div id="01:22:09.760" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s more to be lost and to be gained</div><div id="01:22:12.960" class="transcript_line"> than closing this fishery, you know, that&#039;s for sure,</div><div id="01:22:16.360" class="transcript_line"> and even, you know, some pretty powerful people</div><div id="01:22:20.320" class="transcript_line"> in the rod sort of fishing sort of side of it,</div><div id="01:22:22.880" class="transcript_line"> on the Y, for instance, you know,</div><div id="01:22:25.320" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re quite sympathetic, you know,</div><div id="01:22:27.240" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the vibe I get off of anyway, what we&#039;re doing,</div><div id="01:22:30.320" class="transcript_line"> because another thing they can see is that</div><div id="01:22:33.240" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not bailiffs anymore, you know,</div><div id="01:22:35.040" class="transcript_line"> and I was reading your book about, with George and everything,</div><div id="01:22:38.240" class="transcript_line"> and you know, I met him, you know, two or three times,</div><div id="01:22:40.560" class="transcript_line"> you know, down here, again, when we were in the middle</div><div id="01:22:42.600" class="transcript_line"> of a war, we were in the emergency,</div><div id="01:22:44.640" class="transcript_line"> but are they naive enough to think</div><div id="01:22:49.320" class="transcript_line"> that there are still not poachers on the estuary,</div><div id="01:22:52.320" class="transcript_line"> or if stock picked up a little bit,</div><div id="01:22:55.280" class="transcript_line"> there wouldn&#039;t be more poachers on the estuary,</div><div id="01:22:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean, and you&#039;ve got people looking after the river,</div><div id="01:23:01.840" class="transcript_line"> but part of what our fishing now,</div><div id="01:23:04.160" class="transcript_line"> we spend so much time out here, not all of us,</div><div id="01:23:06.480" class="transcript_line"> but three or four of us, that there&#039;s always a presence there</div><div id="01:23:10.160" class="transcript_line"> and people see it, I mean, that guy that came down here,</div><div id="01:23:12.440" class="transcript_line"> just then, he&#039;s always down here,</div><div id="01:23:14.880" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s one you&#039;ve got to watch, like, so it&#039;s,</div><div id="01:23:20.560" class="transcript_line"> you know, he&#039;s all right, you know, but we know.</div><div id="01:23:23.920" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re looking after your patch, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:23:25.360" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re watching our patch, and that&#039;s important,</div><div id="01:23:28.360" class="transcript_line"> and I think people with common sense see that as well,</div><div id="01:23:34.400" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s just another thing, you know, if we&#039;re not here,</div><div id="01:23:37.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, I know that if somebody starts taking nets out there,</div><div id="01:23:40.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to know about it, and people around you</div><div id="01:23:42.400" class="transcript_line"> that are thinking of doing it, know that I&#039;m around,</div><div id="01:23:46.320" class="transcript_line"> or my brother, or two or three of the others are about,</div><div id="01:23:50.160" class="transcript_line"> and we still get to hear about it, it&#039;s a small town.</div><div id="01:23:52.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a real take-care, really, aren&#039;t you,</div><div id="01:23:54.200" class="transcript_line"> until you hand it on to the next generation.</div><div id="01:23:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Exactly, yeah.</div><div id="01:23:57.280" class="transcript_line"> And have you got enough people coming through?</div><div id="01:23:59.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s another thing.</div><div id="01:24:00.560" class="transcript_line"> When we started with, you know, I thought it was finished,</div><div id="01:24:04.240" class="transcript_line"> really, I mean, it was just me, and Bob, and Rich,</div><div id="01:24:07.640" class="transcript_line"> and Den was fishing in the Guts, and...</div><div id="01:24:14.680" class="transcript_line"> my uncle, John, I mentioned the family,</div><div id="01:24:18.920" class="transcript_line"> who was getting on a bit then,</div><div id="01:24:20.680" class="transcript_line"> he must have been 70, all of a sudden, he took up a licence.</div><div id="01:24:26.520" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="01:24:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Is he sitting alive?</div><div id="01:24:28.720" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s sitting, I know he&#039;s sitting home at the moment, yeah.</div><div id="01:24:30.760" class="transcript_line"> So, but he was the eldest son of my great-grandfather,</div><div id="01:24:35.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, his grandfather was William Corbyn,</div><div id="01:24:38.160" class="transcript_line"> so he fished for three or four years,</div><div id="01:24:39.880" class="transcript_line"> so he sort of came into the fishing then,</div><div id="01:24:44.840" class="transcript_line"> and then he sort of packed it in,</div><div id="01:24:46.760" class="transcript_line"> and then Den-el packed it in,</div><div id="01:24:48.680" class="transcript_line"> and it was back to me and Bob again,</div><div id="01:24:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and I thought, oh, tricky.</div><div id="01:24:53.520" class="transcript_line"> And then, well, out to the blue, Tim Bevan,</div><div id="01:24:57.920" class="transcript_line"> again, I mentioned his name early on,</div><div id="01:24:59.440" class="transcript_line"> a local boy, whose uncle had fished many years ago,</div><div id="01:25:04.640" class="transcript_line"> he took up a licence, and things were sort of being,</div><div id="01:25:08.360" class="transcript_line"> you were seeing it on TV, TV companies were getting involved</div><div id="01:25:11.200" class="transcript_line"> and coming down to watch the fishing,</div><div id="01:25:12.640" class="transcript_line"> and people doing little books and magazines,</div><div id="01:25:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and it was, people in the village</div><div id="01:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> were starting to take notice of the fishing,</div><div id="01:25:19.840" class="transcript_line"> because a lot of them probably never heard of it before,</div><div id="01:25:21.880" class="transcript_line"> poor security has changed, I mean, it&#039;s huge</div><div id="01:25:23.720" class="transcript_line"> compared to what it used to be.</div><div id="01:25:24.920" class="transcript_line"> So many incomeers.</div><div id="01:25:26.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, lots of incomeers,</div><div id="01:25:27.640" class="transcript_line"> and then they were taking an interest,</div><div id="01:25:29.640" class="transcript_line"> but Tim took up a licence, and then, of course,</div><div id="01:25:33.680" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s in the pub, and he&#039;s talking to somebody,</div><div id="01:25:36.160" class="transcript_line"> and then a couple of other boys expressed an interest,</div><div id="01:25:38.880" class="transcript_line"> and they took up licences, and before you knew it,</div><div id="01:25:41.040" class="transcript_line"> we had seven or eight, the maximum, sort of fishermen,</div><div id="01:25:44.280" class="transcript_line"> and it sort of, a new lease of life,</div><div id="01:25:46.800" class="transcript_line"> all of a sudden, when I started, I was the second youngest,</div><div id="01:25:50.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m now the second oldest, so it&#039;s, yeah,</div><div id="01:25:53.040" class="transcript_line"> which is quite frightening.</div><div id="01:25:53.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a bit sobering, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:25:54.720" class="transcript_line"> It is, very sobering.</div><div id="01:25:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it happens to us all.</div><div id="01:25:56.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was so great,</div><div id="01:26:00.400" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s brought a new lease of life to the fishery,</div><div id="01:26:02.600" class="transcript_line"> and I really feel this turn in the corner,</div><div id="01:26:05.480" class="transcript_line"> it certainly has in that respect,</div><div id="01:26:07.480" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got boys suggesting Facebook pages,</div><div id="01:26:12.200" class="transcript_line"> and you might think I&#039;m cranky and what&#039;s that about,</div><div id="01:26:16.120" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s proved a marvellous thing.</div><div id="01:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, yeah, I share your views on that,</div><div id="01:26:20.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m slightly, oh, God, really, it&#039;s so much, you know,</div><div id="01:26:25.200" class="transcript_line"> self-obsession, but with the River Project,</div><div id="01:26:28.120" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s been a fantastic way of reaching people,</div><div id="01:26:31.120" class="transcript_line"> as has your page.</div><div id="01:26:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, it&#039;s really got it out there,</div><div id="01:26:34.240" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s a frightening, it&#039;s quite,</div><div id="01:26:36.520" class="transcript_line"> they say drugs are addictive and booze is addictive,</div><div id="01:26:38.880" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s an addictive thing.</div><div id="01:26:39.920" class="transcript_line"> I know, that&#039;s the trouble.</div><div id="01:26:40.760" class="transcript_line"> You can be dragged right into it,</div><div id="01:26:42.760" class="transcript_line"> but for the page, it&#039;s been a great thing,</div><div id="01:26:44.680" class="transcript_line"> and long may it continue.</div><div id="01:26:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, as far as you couldn&#039;t be in a better place,</div><div id="01:26:52.640" class="transcript_line"> we could not be in a better place.</div><div id="01:26:54.440" class="transcript_line"> The only fly in the ointment at the moment is that</div><div id="01:26:59.680" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve managed to get our new 10-year lease,</div><div id="01:27:01.880" class="transcript_line"> they did change it about,</div><div id="01:27:03.120" class="transcript_line"> and God knows what they put in it,</div><div id="01:27:04.600" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t really know at the end of the day,</div><div id="01:27:06.200" class="transcript_line"> but we had to sign it to be able to fish,</div><div id="01:27:09.880" class="transcript_line"> but the latest big idea of Natural Resources Wales</div><div id="01:27:12.640" class="transcript_line"> is total catch and release for all salmon in Wales.</div><div id="01:27:17.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the latest thing that&#039;s been,</div><div id="01:27:18.680" class="transcript_line"> that was presented, I think, last year</div><div id="01:27:20.280" class="transcript_line"> to the Minister for Rural Affairs, Leslie Griffiths,</div><div id="01:27:23.880" class="transcript_line"> and she has put it up for a public inquiry.</div><div id="01:27:28.120" class="transcript_line"> So is she in Anglia at all, or are they fishing?</div><div id="01:27:30.160" class="transcript_line"> I have no idea what she is.</div><div id="01:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s the Minister for Rural Affairs</div><div id="01:27:32.640" class="transcript_line"> in the Welsh Assembly.</div><div id="01:27:34.320" class="transcript_line"> So she has now ordered a public inquiry,</div><div id="01:27:38.520" class="transcript_line"> which starts on the 15th of January.</div><div id="01:27:41.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve questioned whether we&#039;re sort of gonna be,</div><div id="01:27:46.680" class="transcript_line"> that restriction would be put on us,</div><div id="01:27:49.720" class="transcript_line"> but you know, right into these people</div><div id="01:27:52.320" class="transcript_line"> is like, clean your air out,</div><div id="01:27:53.960" class="transcript_line"> but we have got letters that sort of say that</div><div id="01:27:57.560" class="transcript_line"> at the moment, at this time, and all the rest of it,</div><div id="01:28:01.120" class="transcript_line"> that it won&#039;t be, because the why is probably not at risk.</div><div id="01:28:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Why in us can he help?</div><div id="01:28:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Why in us, the Foundation?</div><div id="01:28:10.720" class="transcript_line"> They would be well aware of what we&#039;re doing.</div><div id="01:28:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but are they in need of help?</div><div id="01:28:14.640" class="transcript_line"> I met Stephen Marsh Smith,</div><div id="01:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I met the guy who took over from him.</div><div id="01:28:19.440" class="transcript_line"> Again, they didn&#039;t seem to have any problem</div><div id="01:28:21.480" class="transcript_line"> with what we&#039;re doing.</div><div id="01:28:23.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:28:24.600" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s Natural Resources Wales,</div><div id="01:28:29.280" class="transcript_line"> and the people within it.</div><div id="01:28:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Piddi Gough, I mean, he goes back 20 years</div><div id="01:28:33.640" class="transcript_line"> when we first started all this.</div><div id="01:28:35.280" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s been there ever since, and I think he&#039;s outbent,</div><div id="01:28:38.120" class="transcript_line"> I think he&#039;s deluded, I think he&#039;s outbent on finishing us.</div><div id="01:28:41.200" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t looked at all this sort of stuff</div><div id="01:28:42.760" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;re gonna say at this inquiry,</div><div id="01:28:44.440" class="transcript_line"> but all these names keep popping up,</div><div id="01:28:47.080" class="transcript_line"> the people from 20 years ago, Guy Morrill.</div><div id="01:28:50.840" class="transcript_line"> If you read the evidence and all the rest of it on it.</div><div id="01:28:54.480" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if you need to press the heritage</div><div id="01:28:56.520" class="transcript_line"> side of the street side a bit.</div><div id="01:28:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Actually.</div><div id="01:28:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s why I mentioned footprints</div><div id="01:29:01.680" class="transcript_line"> down the road there, you know,</div><div id="01:29:03.200" class="transcript_line"> they make a big deal of that.</div><div id="01:29:05.040" class="transcript_line"> But it makes no difference, Maash,</div><div id="01:29:07.280" class="transcript_line"> with the environment agency, Natural Resources Wales,</div><div id="01:29:10.480" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;ve got endless letters.</div><div id="01:29:13.800" class="transcript_line"> We push it with them, and they say,</div><div id="01:29:16.240" class="transcript_line"> yeah, you can have your heritage, you know, great.</div><div id="01:29:18.960" class="transcript_line"> You can go out there and fish any time you like.</div><div id="01:29:20.960" class="transcript_line"> But you put the fish back, oh, you can stand there</div><div id="01:29:22.680" class="transcript_line"> with a hole cut in the back of your net</div><div id="01:29:24.120" class="transcript_line"> so the fish can swim through it.</div><div id="01:29:26.080" class="transcript_line"> And you just think, what planet these people are,</div><div id="01:29:28.680" class="transcript_line"> you just wanna pull your hair out.</div><div id="01:29:30.040" class="transcript_line"> So we learned years ago, I learned straight away,</div><div id="01:29:33.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, basically, I went to a meeting back,</div><div id="01:29:36.760" class="transcript_line"> oh, Christ, when was it?</div><div id="01:29:38.600" class="transcript_line"> 2006, 2005, at the Elam Valley.</div><div id="01:29:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. All sort of naive</div><div id="01:29:44.680" class="transcript_line"> and sort of you&#039;re gonna make a difference.</div><div id="01:29:46.960" class="transcript_line"> And you walk into this meeting,</div><div id="01:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and all of a sudden these people come out to the woodwork,</div><div id="01:29:53.640" class="transcript_line"> and you know, the big guns, like all the rest of it.</div><div id="01:29:57.680" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re just thinking,</div><div id="01:29:59.160" class="transcript_line"> well, you know, all the netsmen resigned anyway,</div><div id="01:30:01.920" class="transcript_line"> they just said, no, we&#039;re not having any of this.</div><div id="01:30:05.280" class="transcript_line"> You could deal with them, you know, it&#039;s just frightening.</div><div id="01:30:08.560" class="transcript_line"> They talk each other&#039;s language, you see.</div><div id="01:30:10.320" class="transcript_line"> They do, and you just cannot compete.</div><div id="01:30:12.040" class="transcript_line"> No, I just thought, I can&#039;t compete.</div><div id="01:30:14.040" class="transcript_line"> So I thought.</div><div id="01:30:15.480" class="transcript_line"> But I think you&#039;re doing the right thing</div><div id="01:30:17.960" class="transcript_line"> by doing this, you know, social media,</div><div id="01:30:21.120" class="transcript_line"> raising a profile, and you have had lots of profile.</div><div id="01:30:24.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, it&#039;s amazing, incredible.</div><div id="01:30:26.800" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s never been off TV in the last 20 years,</div><div id="01:30:30.240" class="transcript_line"> and the new name has been on it.</div><div id="01:30:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, okay, you know,</div><div id="01:30:35.320" class="transcript_line"> I wish I could compete in other ways,</div><div id="01:30:37.160" class="transcript_line"> but you know you can&#039;t, so you just do what you can.</div><div id="01:30:41.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I think right-minded people</div><div id="01:30:43.360" class="transcript_line"> that, you know, sort of support us.</div><div id="01:30:45.080" class="transcript_line"> And we, and locally, I mean,</div><div id="01:30:47.080" class="transcript_line"> you never believe the support we get.</div><div id="01:30:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we used to, when we built this net house,</div><div id="01:30:52.280" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s pictures there on the wall, 2006, I think it was.</div><div id="01:30:56.600" class="transcript_line"> We had an open day for the fishery</div><div id="01:30:59.320" class="transcript_line"> at the end of the season.</div><div id="01:31:01.120" class="transcript_line"> And it was just family and friends, really.</div><div id="01:31:04.280" class="transcript_line"> So we, you know, 20 people, the rest of it.</div><div id="01:31:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And we happened last year, all these years later,</div><div id="01:31:10.760" class="transcript_line"> and there was like 300 more people there.</div><div id="01:31:13.960" class="transcript_line"> So, and the people from Faramoy, the locality,</div><div id="01:31:17.360" class="transcript_line"> and they all sort of support us.</div><div id="01:31:19.080" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="01:31:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Part of my remit is to organize a series of events.</div><div id="01:31:22.880" class="transcript_line"> One is to let people know about the wider project,</div><div id="01:31:25.720" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s volunteer recruitment as well.</div><div id="01:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So would you be willing to come along to one of those</div><div id="01:31:32.120" class="transcript_line"> and pay for your expenses and stuff,</div><div id="01:31:34.040" class="transcript_line"> just to talk about what you do,</div><div id="01:31:35.120" class="transcript_line"> maybe bring some of this along?</div><div id="01:31:36.800" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s lots of new developments going up.</div><div id="01:31:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And the question is, do they know about their locality,</div><div id="01:31:46.800" class="transcript_line"> their heritage?</div><div id="01:31:48.320" class="transcript_line"> And so is that something you might need to do?</div><div id="01:31:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, I do stuff every day of the week, actually.</div><div id="01:31:54.960" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t think I need it?</div><div id="01:31:56.320" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, I don&#039;t mind doing it at all.</div><div id="01:31:59.800" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately, I gotta be absolutely,</div><div id="01:32:04.840" class="transcript_line"> a few more blocks.</div><div id="01:32:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, of course, yeah.</div><div id="01:32:06.520" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;m not greedy at all, but at all.</div><div id="01:32:09.440" class="transcript_line"> So how much would you expect then?</div><div id="01:32:11.280" class="transcript_line"> For what?</div><div id="01:32:12.120" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be coming along to talk a bit about the fishery.</div><div id="01:32:17.400" class="transcript_line"> What, for a day or after?</div><div id="01:32:18.840" class="transcript_line"> It would be for just for an hour.</div><div id="01:32:20.360" class="transcript_line"> An hour?</div><div id="01:32:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it wouldn&#039;t be just an hour, would it?</div><div id="01:32:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ve got to prepare, get your stuff there.</div><div id="01:32:26.640" class="transcript_line"> So half a day.</div><div id="01:32:28.280" class="transcript_line"> Half a day, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:32:32.240" class="transcript_line"> 50 quid plus your expenses, something like that?</div><div id="01:32:34.480" class="transcript_line"> You know, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:32:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s what I do for talks.</div><div id="01:32:38.080" class="transcript_line"> When I do a talk for the river,</div><div id="01:32:39.600" class="transcript_line"> I charge 50 quid plus expenses.</div><div id="01:32:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when I do a talk, you know, depending on where it is,</div><div id="01:32:45.880" class="transcript_line"> you know, I charge 35, 40 quid plus my expenses.</div><div id="01:32:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, it&#039;s, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:32:50.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I think 50 quid&#039;s fair enough, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:32:52.600" class="transcript_line"> I know some people would do 100,</div><div id="01:32:53.880" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t know if I can charge 100 yet.</div><div id="01:32:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, if I&#039;m out for a day,</div><div id="01:32:59.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s generally somewhere around that.</div><div id="01:33:02.400" class="transcript_line"> But it depends what I&#039;m doing.</div><div id="01:33:04.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it depends who it is,</div><div id="01:33:06.080" class="transcript_line"> depends, you know, what money they got, you know.</div><div id="01:33:08.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:33:09.040" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="01:33:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Fancy a quick question about eels and elvers.</div><div id="01:33:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Did you have people, elver fishing?</div><div id="01:33:16.840" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s, elver, there are,</div><div id="01:33:20.800" class="transcript_line"> the licenses for elver fishing have been,</div><div id="01:33:23.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure whether they&#039;ve been frozen,</div><div id="01:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> or whether, you know, you can&#039;t get any more licenses.</div><div id="01:33:29.200" class="transcript_line"> But there is some elver fishing locally,</div><div id="01:33:32.480" class="transcript_line"> although there was.</div><div id="01:33:34.040" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t, I&#039;m not 100% sure if it&#039;s still happening,</div><div id="01:33:37.400" class="transcript_line"> but certainly a few years ago, no.</div><div id="01:33:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And they fish on the pils.</div><div id="01:33:42.520" class="transcript_line"> Caldicat Pils have seen them fishing,</div><div id="01:33:44.080" class="transcript_line"> Mega Pils have seen them fishing.</div><div id="01:33:48.600" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not like it is up the rivers.</div><div id="01:33:50.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it would be a small catch.</div><div id="01:33:54.800" class="transcript_line"> It is quite frightening really,</div><div id="01:33:57.720" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;ve done a little film actually</div><div id="01:34:00.440" class="transcript_line"> on the pils the other day, just a little,</div><div id="01:34:02.920" class="transcript_line"> when the wind was light, you know, the camera I got,</div><div id="01:34:04.720" class="transcript_line"> if there&#039;s any wind blowing,</div><div id="01:34:06.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s terrible, you can&#039;t hear what I&#039;m saying.</div><div id="01:34:08.200" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, when I was a kid,</div><div id="01:34:13.320" class="transcript_line"> it made me think about the pils.</div><div id="01:34:15.920" class="transcript_line"> The Caldicat Castle, right, the Neddon.</div><div id="01:34:22.240" class="transcript_line"> When I was a kid, there&#039;s a bridge,</div><div id="01:34:23.800" class="transcript_line"> a little road bridge just by the, next to the castle,</div><div id="01:34:27.680" class="transcript_line"> and the Neddon brook would run through there,</div><div id="01:34:30.240" class="transcript_line"> all the way down to the 7S Strait.</div><div id="01:34:35.240" class="transcript_line"> It was always crystal clear, okay?</div><div id="01:34:38.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the ream, which the elvers,</div><div id="01:34:41.240" class="transcript_line"> talking about elvers, are making their way into.</div><div id="01:34:44.040" class="transcript_line"> The brooks and the reams, you know, bordering the levels,</div><div id="01:34:48.560" class="transcript_line"> or on the levels.</div><div id="01:34:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And I would go, when was that?</div><div id="01:34:54.080" class="transcript_line"> That would be the mid 70s, or perhaps early 70s.</div><div id="01:34:59.200" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be down there, scouting school under the bridge,</div><div id="01:35:01.960" class="transcript_line"> as such, or whatever, or playing or messing about,</div><div id="01:35:04.960" class="transcript_line"> and you would be able to catch sticklebacks and newts.</div><div id="01:35:09.160" class="transcript_line"> It was crystal clear and full of fish.</div><div id="01:35:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went down there last year,</div><div id="01:35:17.920" class="transcript_line"> or a few years back, and last year, and it&#039;s black.</div><div id="01:35:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:35:24.200" class="transcript_line"> Black and full of just shit, you know, so rich,</div><div id="01:35:28.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, sort of, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s so rich,</div><div id="01:35:29.760" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s just not what it was.</div><div id="01:35:33.200" class="transcript_line"> So these elvers, I think, in lots of places,</div><div id="01:35:36.120" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re coming through from the estuary,</div><div id="01:35:38.680" class="transcript_line"> through the sluice gates, another thing.</div><div id="01:35:40.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not 100% sure about these sluice gates, either,</div><div id="01:35:43.520" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m not quite sure,</div><div id="01:35:44.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they used to be there,</div><div id="01:35:45.880" class="transcript_line"> or in the same shape and form.</div><div id="01:35:47.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, where they can actually get through the sea defenses,</div><div id="01:35:49.800" class="transcript_line"> through these sluice gates.</div><div id="01:35:52.320" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, when they actually get into some of these reams,</div><div id="01:35:55.360" class="transcript_line"> the reams are filthy, you know, they&#039;re not what they used to be.</div><div id="01:35:58.120" class="transcript_line"> So habitat, I think, has been destroyed.</div><div id="01:36:00.800" class="transcript_line"> So when you were a kid, you used to play on the reams, did you?</div><div id="01:36:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, we used to go up to, on the levels,</div><div id="01:36:07.800" class="transcript_line"> the furthest one we used to go to was St. Pierre Pill.</div><div id="01:36:11.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:36:11.880" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a ream, there&#039;s reams behind there,</div><div id="01:36:15.040" class="transcript_line"> and it would be full of fish, full of fish,</div><div id="01:36:20.720" class="transcript_line"> tadpoles, a lot of them haven&#039;t been drenched out.</div><div id="01:36:23.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s another thing they do on these reams,</div><div id="01:36:26.200" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re constantly raking them out.</div><div id="01:36:28.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not sure in some cases that it is a good idea,</div><div id="01:36:31.840" class="transcript_line"> disturbing sort of nature.</div><div id="01:36:34.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:36:35.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if they&#039;ve got the management</div><div id="01:36:37.560" class="transcript_line"> of these things right, no expert on it at all.</div><div id="01:36:40.280" class="transcript_line"> But I sometimes do wonder that, you know,</div><div id="01:36:44.160" class="transcript_line"> the one example I can state is the one at the Nedenbrook,</div><div id="01:36:47.920" class="transcript_line"> and that is not what it used to be, but a long, long time.</div><div id="01:36:53.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a heavy industry right now.</div><div id="01:36:55.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I think it could be housing.</div><div id="01:36:57.720" class="transcript_line"> I think they did do some sort of study in the environment agency</div><div id="01:37:00.840" class="transcript_line"> regarding the pollution that&#039;s going into that particular ream.</div><div id="01:37:04.880" class="transcript_line"> And they put it down to bad plumbing on housing,</div><div id="01:37:08.200" class="transcript_line"> the stuff, you know, and gardeners&#039; work.</div><div id="01:37:11.160" class="transcript_line"> But it is just an example of how things have changed</div><div id="01:37:13.840" class="transcript_line"> over the years.</div><div id="01:37:15.920" class="transcript_line"> You used to get all sorts of reams, sort of eels,</div><div id="01:37:20.280" class="transcript_line"> bigger eels, and you don&#039;t see that anymore.</div><div id="01:37:23.160" class="transcript_line"> They look dead to me, to be honest.</div><div id="01:37:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I spend a lot of time on the levels.</div><div id="01:37:26.840" class="transcript_line"> We cut a willow for the nets on the levels.</div><div id="01:37:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Where?</div><div id="01:37:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, just on the calicate levels.</div><div id="01:37:33.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a pollinated trees.</div><div id="01:37:35.360" class="transcript_line"> The reams have always been made from willow,</div><div id="01:37:38.240" class="transcript_line"> cut that in the winter.</div><div id="01:37:39.880" class="transcript_line"> Need a ladder to get up the tree now,</div><div id="01:37:41.520" class="transcript_line"> but you cut it in the winter, struck the bark off.</div><div id="01:37:48.360" class="transcript_line"> So you source everything locally?</div><div id="01:37:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, everything that&#039;s made, the frame of the lathe net is,</div><div id="01:37:54.400" class="transcript_line"> and the main thing is the willow.</div><div id="01:37:57.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, because you&#039;ve got the pollinated trees</div><div id="01:37:58.800" class="transcript_line"> down the levels,</div><div id="01:37:59.760" class="transcript_line"> and that sort of curve that comes out the top of the tree</div><div id="01:38:06.520" class="transcript_line"> after about two years,</div><div id="01:38:08.280" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, that little curve,</div><div id="01:38:10.840" class="transcript_line"> about two inches in diameter.</div><div id="01:38:14.280" class="transcript_line"> You watch the tree grow,</div><div id="01:38:16.360" class="transcript_line"> and then get up there and chop a couple of eels.</div><div id="01:38:20.280" class="transcript_line"> As far as the handle, the rock staff goes,</div><div id="01:38:24.240" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not on the levels, but behind the levels.</div><div id="01:38:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Slade wood perhaps is a good place.</div><div id="01:38:31.680" class="transcript_line"> You get an ash sapne growing,</div><div id="01:38:33.760" class="transcript_line"> and what happens is that you get this one there.</div><div id="01:38:43.880" class="transcript_line"> Much harder than the other one, honestly.</div><div id="01:38:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And you get an ash sapne growing just like that,</div><div id="01:38:50.360" class="transcript_line"> and you have two shoots on it,</div><div id="01:38:51.720" class="transcript_line"> and that one becomes dominant, that one falls off.</div><div id="01:38:55.880" class="transcript_line"> And you see that, and you&#039;re looking for that kick</div><div id="01:39:00.960" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s produced when that comes away,</div><div id="01:39:05.960" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s common in ash sapnes,</div><div id="01:39:09.600" class="transcript_line"> and you cut that again in January, February,</div><div id="01:39:14.040" class="transcript_line"> the sap is down, strip the back off straight away,</div><div id="01:39:17.120" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s your handle,</div><div id="01:39:18.920" class="transcript_line"> and what we call the rock staff,</div><div id="01:39:20.040" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s the traditional shape.</div><div id="01:39:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Ash is very hard, and the handle of the net</div><div id="01:39:28.520" class="transcript_line"> is not only used for a handle,</div><div id="01:39:29.680" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s used for a walking stick, a feeler,</div><div id="01:39:34.000" class="transcript_line"> as the name rock staff involved.</div><div id="01:39:36.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when you&#039;re wading,</div><div id="01:39:37.880" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re wading, you&#039;re sort of out there,</div><div id="01:39:41.160" class="transcript_line"> use this to feel,</div><div id="01:39:43.200" class="transcript_line"> you know roughly what&#039;s in the water in front of you,</div><div id="01:39:45.080" class="transcript_line"> but you&#039;re sort of feeling for holes and gullies,</div><div id="01:39:48.920" class="transcript_line"> and if you feel a hole in gully,</div><div id="01:39:49.880" class="transcript_line"> you just move to the one side.</div><div id="01:39:51.440" class="transcript_line"> Also, the tie can be running on your body at five or six knots,</div><div id="01:39:57.560" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got a job to stand up sometimes,</div><div id="01:40:00.320" class="transcript_line"> and you use this for balance,</div><div id="01:40:03.120" class="transcript_line"> sort of to help yourself stay upright,</div><div id="01:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> or if you trip, put it down,</div><div id="01:40:08.760" class="transcript_line"> and sort of stop yourself falling on your face.</div><div id="01:40:11.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a terrifying thing.</div><div id="01:40:12.080" class="transcript_line"> As such.</div><div id="01:40:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m gonna just check the time,</div><div id="01:40:15.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m gonna have to go.</div><div id="01:40:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to add, Martin?</div><div id="01:40:20.520" class="transcript_line"> Any other memories or characters or stuff?</div><div id="01:40:23.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:40:25.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s probably all coming to you after I&#039;ve gone.</div><div id="01:40:26.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know it will, yeah.</div><div id="01:40:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="01:40:30.880" class="transcript_line"> You can always add it when I&#039;ve done the transcription,</div><div id="01:40:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll put it back, and you can add things to it.</div><div id="01:40:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, we&#039;ll do that.</div><div id="01:40:38.040" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d love to come out one day,</div><div id="01:40:39.400" class="transcript_line"> would that be possible?</div><div id="01:40:40.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, come out and see,</div><div id="01:40:41.920" class="transcript_line"> the trick is to pick a big spring tide,</div><div id="01:40:46.960" class="transcript_line"> on a very calm day, so watch the weather,</div><div id="01:40:49.920" class="transcript_line"> and lighter winds are better.</div><div id="01:40:51.560" class="transcript_line"> That means absolutely nothing to me.</div><div id="01:40:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they&#039;ll phone me up then,</div><div id="01:40:54.800" class="transcript_line"> just message me and I&#039;ll be good.</div><div id="01:40:55.640" class="transcript_line"> I will never clear what a light wind is.</div><div id="01:40:57.440" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="01:40:58.280" class="transcript_line"> You know?</div><div id="01:40:59.120" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you&#039;d be best off coming out in that situation,</div><div id="01:41:03.560" class="transcript_line"> because you could go out in the boat then,</div><div id="01:41:06.760" class="transcript_line"> you could go out mid-channel,</div><div id="01:41:07.600" class="transcript_line"> or even walk out if you wanted to.</div><div id="01:41:09.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:41:10.880" class="transcript_line"> You could take a cross onto the island and...</div><div id="01:41:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Leave me?</div><div id="01:41:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="01:41:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Charge you to come back.</div><div id="01:41:16.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div
