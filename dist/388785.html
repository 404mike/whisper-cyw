That&#039;s what I enjoyed, was Lillian.</div><div id="00:03:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Especially Thompson as well.</div><div id="00:03:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, you couldn&#039;t get more aggressive than those two, could you?</div><div id="00:03:47.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:03:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Some of the matches, though, that we did play in, Newtown, Llandud, Lewis,</div><div id="00:03:53.600" class="transcript_line"> I know that they were particularly venomous on occasions.</div><div id="00:03:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Llandud, Lewis played hard, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:03:59.600" class="transcript_line"> Especially Meredeth.</div><div id="00:04:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the wicket keeper.</div><div id="00:04:03.600" class="transcript_line"> And of course, Chinke from Newtown, Keith Harding.</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Horrible little man.</div><div id="00:04:08.600" class="transcript_line"> He was always...</div><div id="00:04:10.600" class="transcript_line"> You two were always going at one another.</div><div id="00:04:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Always.</div><div id="00:04:14.600" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d see someone back.</div><div id="00:04:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:18.600" class="transcript_line"> And you wouldn&#039;t let him lay.</div><div id="00:04:20.600" class="transcript_line"> No, he was a good spinballer.</div><div id="00:04:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Very good spinballer.</div><div id="00:04:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the one year, the first year that Montgomery won, Lee, I think.</div><div id="00:04:31.600" class="transcript_line"> We had to beat Newtown up there, and we had to get a draw with them,</div><div id="00:04:36.600" class="transcript_line"> and beat Chelmarsh, I think, in the final game.</div><div id="00:04:39.600" class="transcript_line"> And Montgomery were reduced to about...</div><div id="00:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Newtown batted very well, they made 180 or something.</div><div id="00:04:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Montgomery were about 60 for five.</div><div id="00:04:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Kinsey was still in.</div><div id="00:04:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Gareth Jones came in, and they played a bit,</div><div id="00:04:58.600" class="transcript_line"> and Kinsey decided, he said to Gareth,</div><div id="00:05:01.600" class="transcript_line"> You play Harding, I will play Alan Williamson, Brian Jones.</div><div id="00:05:05.600" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what they did, they stayed.</div><div id="00:05:07.600" class="transcript_line"> And Gareth was one of the few who could play Harding.</div><div id="00:05:10.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, he spun the ball, John could play it, because he used to go out to it.</div><div id="00:05:14.600" class="transcript_line"> No, Gareth could play him, because Gareth could play him on the leg side.</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Kinsey used to go out to a 6&#039;3 or 7&#039;2 field.</div><div id="00:05:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, he used to get me out regularly, Harding.</div><div id="00:05:23.600" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t find him at all.</div><div id="00:05:24.600" class="transcript_line"> In the end, I decided, because I wasn&#039;t fleet footed,</div><div id="00:05:27.600" class="transcript_line"> I used to go right back on the stumps and watch the ball,</div><div id="00:05:30.600" class="transcript_line"> and he couldn&#039;t get me out then, but when I used to play forward,</div><div id="00:05:32.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d add it straight away by going right back on the stumps and watching the ball come on.</div><div id="00:05:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Nice little man.</div><div id="00:05:38.600" class="transcript_line"> There were a lot of incidents with Newtown, especially during and after.</div><div id="00:05:42.600" class="transcript_line"> It got worse after I was there about a year ago.</div><div id="00:05:45.600" class="transcript_line"> League cricket.</div><div id="00:05:46.600" class="transcript_line"> You had to have a new ball.</div><div id="00:05:48.600" class="transcript_line"> The Nigel Owen was working for the Post Office at the time,</div><div id="00:05:51.600" class="transcript_line"> and he didn&#039;t finish in time, and they would hold the game up.</div><div id="00:05:54.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Nigel hadn&#039;t come, so Harding had forgotten the ball,</div><div id="00:05:59.600" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d have to go home for the ball.</div><div id="00:06:00.600" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d bring Nigel, how long are you going to be?</div><div id="00:06:02.600" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come back, there wasn&#039;t a new ball.</div><div id="00:06:04.600" class="transcript_line"> There was something else.</div><div id="00:06:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was another employer of theirs.</div><div id="00:06:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Rob, our captain of the town, go out and toss a coin.</div><div id="00:06:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the captain hasn&#039;t come.</div><div id="00:06:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Go out and toss a coin with somebody, and oh, win the toss.</div><div id="00:06:21.600" class="transcript_line"> And then the captain would show up.</div><div id="00:06:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, didn&#039;t authorise him to toss.</div><div id="00:06:25.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have to toss the coin again.</div><div id="00:06:27.600" class="transcript_line"> That wasn&#039;t Newtown.</div><div id="00:06:28.600" class="transcript_line"> That would have happened once, but we didn&#039;t agree to it, did we?</div><div id="00:06:32.600" class="transcript_line"> It used to be the most bad.</div><div id="00:06:33.600" class="transcript_line"> It happened more than once.</div><div id="00:06:34.600" class="transcript_line"> It happened once, I can remember it happening once,</div><div id="00:06:37.600" class="transcript_line"> and we refused to toss again.</div><div id="00:06:39.600" class="transcript_line"> This is after my time.</div><div id="00:06:41.600" class="transcript_line"> This was an iterated bad, even, Newtown, there.</div><div id="00:06:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I couldn&#039;t accept that we had come up and were as good as they were.</div><div id="00:06:49.600" class="transcript_line"> They were always the top dogs in MacGonish, weren&#039;t they, Newtown?</div><div id="00:06:52.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Always.</div><div id="00:06:54.600" class="transcript_line"> They did have good players, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:06:56.600" class="transcript_line"> All their players.</div><div id="00:06:57.600" class="transcript_line"> In our time.</div><div id="00:06:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Edgar Williams was a very good captain and player.</div><div id="00:07:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Because Edward was a captain.</div><div id="00:07:02.600" class="transcript_line"> He counted, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:07:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:04.600" class="transcript_line"> He followed John Bennett as captain, I think, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:07:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Edgar was a fierce competitor, but he was one of these little tricks about Edgar.</div><div id="00:07:12.600" class="transcript_line"> He played it hard and he played it fair.</div><div id="00:07:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, same with football, I believe.</div><div id="00:07:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Terrific.</div><div id="00:07:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that, I mean, you sort of mentioned sort of chatter and things during the play.</div><div id="00:07:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Did that change, do you think, in the time that you were all playing?</div><div id="00:07:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Did it get worse?</div><div id="00:07:28.600" class="transcript_line"> It got worse.</div><div id="00:07:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, they say I chatted a lot.</div><div id="00:07:31.600" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t think I chatted a lot.</div><div id="00:07:33.600" class="transcript_line"> It did.</div><div id="00:07:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it did.</div><div id="00:07:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t mind that.</div><div id="00:07:37.600" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:07:38.600" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was good.</div><div id="00:07:40.600" class="transcript_line"> Because it can work psychologically to your own advantage, somebody going on.</div><div id="00:07:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I would hate it coming into the wicket batting in Newtown players.</div><div id="00:07:55.600" class="transcript_line"> Because the innuendos that you get, you knew what they were trying to do.</div><div id="00:08:02.600" class="transcript_line"> And it was very, very intimidating, especially for one so young.</div><div id="00:08:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Nigel Owen particularly was a good daft hand at sledging.</div><div id="00:08:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Sledging wasn&#039;t as widespread as today, probably, but he used to sledge, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:08:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:08:16.600" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got eyes up the head.</div><div id="00:08:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:18.600" class="transcript_line"> I think one or two others, Keith Harding did as well.</div><div id="00:08:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he was always, he was one of the main protagonists.</div><div id="00:08:23.600" class="transcript_line"> And the wicket keeper, what&#039;s his name?</div><div id="00:08:24.600" class="transcript_line"> He kicked the stump.</div><div id="00:08:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Fred Taylor.</div><div id="00:08:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Fred who kicked the stump.</div><div id="00:08:27.600" class="transcript_line"> He kicked the stump so?</div><div id="00:08:28.600" class="transcript_line"> With his toe.</div><div id="00:08:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Because he did come and play for Montgomery.</div><div id="00:08:33.600" class="transcript_line"> He played for Montgomery, right.</div><div id="00:08:34.600" class="transcript_line"> He went on that tour.</div><div id="00:08:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Because he always used to tell me how he used to do it, like, with the stump.</div><div id="00:08:38.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:39.600" class="transcript_line"> Very competitive.</div><div id="00:08:40.600" class="transcript_line"> Very competitive.</div><div id="00:08:41.600" class="transcript_line"> I think there were bowlers just as quick then as there are today, but maybe not as many</div><div id="00:08:46.600" class="transcript_line"> as there are these days, perhaps.</div><div id="00:08:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:08:48.600" class="transcript_line"> The only quick ones I can remember is Nigel and Richardson Church.</div><div id="00:08:54.600" class="transcript_line"> He was quick.</div><div id="00:08:55.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he was quick, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:56.600" class="transcript_line"> No, not what, oh, of course, Noel Jones.</div><div id="00:08:58.600" class="transcript_line"> He gave the impression of being quick because he was a big bloke, like, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:09:02.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Because he always used to smoke a pipe as well, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:09:05.600" class="transcript_line"> The Evercross was quick at Welshpool.</div><div id="00:09:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Not as quick as Ken Lewis, but Ken Lewis must have been the quickest.</div><div id="00:09:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Probably quicker than Nigel, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:09:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Probably.</div><div id="00:09:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Nigel got a big advantage of height.</div><div id="00:09:18.600" class="transcript_line"> He would always bowl.</div><div id="00:09:20.600" class="transcript_line"> The bloody thing was up under your height.</div><div id="00:09:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Ken Lewis beat the bowl more.</div><div id="00:09:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Ken Lewis was a skiddy sort of bowler.</div><div id="00:09:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and he moved it back.</div><div id="00:09:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Like, for a fast bowler, what was Ken?</div><div id="00:09:28.600" class="transcript_line"> Five foot eight or nine?</div><div id="00:09:29.600" class="transcript_line"> He wasn&#039;t much taller, was he?</div><div id="00:09:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he wasn&#039;t much taller.</div><div id="00:09:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Nigel was Llyrwood more than that.</div><div id="00:09:33.600" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s, as you say, Malcolm Marshall later times.</div><div id="00:09:36.600" class="transcript_line"> They always said Malcolm Marshall&#039;s bounce was the most hard to deal with because it was lower trajectory than the big six foot six like Garner and Mosh and Ambrose.</div><div id="00:09:47.600" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:50.600" class="transcript_line"> But the big difference, the wickets must be a lot better now.</div><div id="00:09:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, they are.</div><div id="00:09:54.600" class="transcript_line"> Much.</div><div id="00:09:55.600" class="transcript_line"> Certainly local cricket anyway.</div><div id="00:09:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Some of the wickets we played on were diabolical, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:10:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, come on.</div><div id="00:10:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Not just here, but in Landbathlin.</div><div id="00:10:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, Landbathlin is still the same now as it was then.</div><div id="00:10:06.600" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:10:07.600" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t play over there.</div><div id="00:10:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Caersers?</div><div id="00:10:09.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:10:10.600" class="transcript_line"> De Funct.</div><div id="00:10:11.600" class="transcript_line"> De Funct.</div><div id="00:10:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Is it?</div><div id="00:10:13.600" class="transcript_line"> We had a few run-ins with Fordham.</div><div id="00:10:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:10:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Because I was reading some of the old reports that one match was abandoned and your name was mentioned.</div><div id="00:10:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Never.</div><div id="00:10:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Who was the main one?</div><div id="00:10:28.600" class="transcript_line"> Stafford.</div><div id="00:10:29.600" class="transcript_line"> He was.</div><div id="00:10:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Paul Stafford.</div><div id="00:10:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he was a nasty.</div><div id="00:10:32.600" class="transcript_line"> Beauty Stafford and Paul Stafford.</div><div id="00:10:33.600" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a good memory.</div><div id="00:10:34.600" class="transcript_line"> He was a nasty bit of goods.</div><div id="00:10:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Paul Stafford.</div><div id="00:10:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Paul Stafford was a good cricket to Herbie.</div><div id="00:10:39.600" class="transcript_line"> But he was a nasty piece of goods.</div><div id="00:10:40.600" class="transcript_line"> Paul Stafford could be.</div><div id="00:10:42.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember Herbie had two little boys, Lance and George, you might know them.</div><div id="00:10:48.600" class="transcript_line"> They were about Lance Stafford.</div><div id="00:10:52.600" class="transcript_line"> They used to have sheep running round on the field then.</div><div id="00:10:56.600" class="transcript_line"> I can see Herbie running off in the middle of an over to sort these boys out and say, slapping Lance around the yard and saying, God say that, those are not currents.</div><div id="00:11:05.600" class="transcript_line"> And he was stuffing his bum in.</div><div id="00:11:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Chomping.</div><div id="00:11:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Chomping.</div><div id="00:11:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Chomping spotlings.</div><div id="00:11:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was the elf feeling there sometimes.</div><div id="00:11:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Now we&#039;re out sort of the other way around.</div><div id="00:11:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Games where you played, you know, where there was respect between the two sides.</div><div id="00:11:24.600" class="transcript_line"> It was a good game to play.</div><div id="00:11:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Did you remember Goods Side?</div><div id="00:11:28.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Hardcourt was one, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Hardcourt was a nice match.</div><div id="00:11:32.600" class="transcript_line"> Played in a good spirit.</div><div id="00:11:33.600" class="transcript_line"> Wiggins.</div><div id="00:11:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Church Stratford.</div><div id="00:11:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Wiggins too.</div><div id="00:11:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Henry Wiggins.</div><div id="00:11:37.600" class="transcript_line"> That was a great fixture.</div><div id="00:11:39.600" class="transcript_line"> They had a very good bowling bowler.</div><div id="00:11:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Ball right through always.</div><div id="00:11:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Guy Mortis was another one.</div><div id="00:11:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Guy Mortis.</div><div id="00:11:45.600" class="transcript_line"> You see, you tend to forget the nice things.</div><div id="00:11:48.600" class="transcript_line"> You remember the incidents, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:11:51.600" class="transcript_line"> In life, not just in cricket.</div><div id="00:11:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember, I can only remember once, somebody turning up drunk to play for Montgomery Cricket Club.</div><div id="00:11:58.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether you remember that.</div><div id="00:12:00.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="00:12:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t Robinson?</div><div id="00:12:02.600" class="transcript_line"> Tim Robinson.</div><div id="00:12:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Gerald Robinson.</div><div id="00:12:05.600" class="transcript_line"> Did he, gentlemen?</div><div id="00:12:06.600" class="transcript_line"> We went up to Lannadus to play and he was drunk as anybody could be.</div><div id="00:12:11.600" class="transcript_line"> He was staggering about.</div><div id="00:12:12.600" class="transcript_line"> He kicked the wicket.</div><div id="00:12:13.600" class="transcript_line"> He was f***ing and blinding.</div><div id="00:12:14.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the only time I&#039;ve seen a cricketer sent off the field.</div><div id="00:12:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Harry sent him off.</div><div id="00:12:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Harry sent him, go.</div><div id="00:12:19.600" class="transcript_line"> He sent him off.</div><div id="00:12:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s terrible.</div><div id="00:12:21.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we went down very well as Lannadus.</div><div id="00:12:24.600" class="transcript_line"> So what were the circumstances behind that?</div><div id="00:12:26.600" class="transcript_line"> He had a lift with someone.</div><div id="00:12:27.600" class="transcript_line"> He used to go in the pub, didn&#039;t he, before the matches, Tim?</div><div id="00:12:30.600" class="transcript_line"> He used to go in the checkers before we went.</div><div id="00:12:32.600" class="transcript_line"> He used to be there two hours drinking.</div><div id="00:12:34.600" class="transcript_line"> He could be a good batsman.</div><div id="00:12:36.600" class="transcript_line"> He was a good sportsman.</div><div id="00:12:37.600" class="transcript_line"> So I remember Tim and John, they were playing in the same club.</div><div id="00:12:41.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember Tim and John knocking up 120 to win without a wicket going down against Cork over.</div><div id="00:12:47.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he should have put on over 100 once.</div><div id="00:12:48.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember that, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Once.</div><div id="00:12:50.600" class="transcript_line"> He could be a good wicketkeeper when he was sober.</div><div id="00:12:54.600" class="transcript_line"> I shouldn&#039;t be saying these things about people, probably.</div><div id="00:12:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Talking about wicketkeepers, in my time we&#039;ve had two outstanding wicketkeepers.</div><div id="00:13:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Ed Williams, square man, came.</div><div id="00:13:06.600" class="transcript_line"> Lanny Boy worked in Kent and played fairly high class league cricket in Kent.</div><div id="00:13:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Came back, couldn&#039;t get him now.</div><div id="00:13:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, he lived in Guildfield, but he wanted to play for Lannadus.</div><div id="00:13:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Lyn Meredith was Lannadus wicketkeeper, he was a county wicketkeeper.</div><div id="00:13:20.600" class="transcript_line"> So Ed came here and he made a big difference.</div><div id="00:13:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, he made a big difference to me because I became friendly with him.</div><div id="00:13:28.600" class="transcript_line"> He coached my boys and Andrew in high school.</div><div id="00:13:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Later we had Phil Stevenson came who had played, who was a very, he was a spiky character.</div><div id="00:13:43.600" class="transcript_line"> Whereas a lot of us didn&#039;t confront unless somebody confronted us, Stevenson went out to confront people.</div><div id="00:13:51.600" class="transcript_line"> He would start it.</div><div id="00:13:54.600" class="transcript_line"> I was always within the rules, but I was not comfortable with umpiring when Stevenson was playing, quite honestly.</div><div id="00:14:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever, when you were an umpire, were you ever mindful of what was going on and have to speak?</div><div id="00:14:09.600" class="transcript_line"> I spoke to one, I used to speak to Stevenson quite often.</div><div id="00:14:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Look, talking about wicketkeepers, going back to the 50s, Gordon Evans was a good wicketkeeper.</div><div id="00:14:16.600" class="transcript_line"> He was a decent wicketkeeper.</div><div id="00:14:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Sound rather than brilliant.</div><div id="00:14:21.600" class="transcript_line"> But then, you know, wicketkeepers like I remember, wicketkeepers in those days, especially in Montgomery, fast forward bowling,</div><div id="00:14:26.600" class="transcript_line"> you stopped a lot with your pads because they did come straight along the ground.</div><div id="00:14:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, or jumped up at you.</div><div id="00:14:32.600" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have thigh pads though in those days.</div><div id="00:14:36.600" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:14:37.600" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t no. Helmets would come in and it was a different ball game, wasn&#039;t it, altogether?</div><div id="00:14:42.600" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:14:43.600" class="transcript_line"> It was all right for somebody like John, he was fast on his feet.</div><div id="00:14:46.600" class="transcript_line"> And get up or get hit, did you?</div><div id="00:14:48.600" class="transcript_line"> The rest of us were a bit slower on our feet used to get hit.</div><div id="00:14:51.600" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t slow, Brian. You make out, you were.</div><div id="00:14:54.600" class="transcript_line"> Old man in your 20s you made out.</div><div id="00:14:59.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a laden footed compared with you now.</div><div id="00:15:02.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:15:04.600" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re running yourself down, I think.</div><div id="00:15:05.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I was wrong.</div><div id="00:15:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Princess of modesty, you think?</div><div id="00:15:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is, yes.</div><div id="00:15:11.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that outfield was so diabolical, wasn&#039;t it? You couldn&#039;t hit a four, it was hard going.</div><div id="00:15:16.600" class="transcript_line"> It must have been.</div><div id="00:15:17.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember Harry had scored 50 or something and he had blisters all over his hands and some cut in the ball.</div><div id="00:15:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:24.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s because of the job he did. Remember when he said, you walked an inch your nose against Bishop&#039;s Castle, was it?</div><div id="00:15:32.600" class="transcript_line"> No, I cut my eye there.</div><div id="00:15:33.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, your eye, was it?</div><div id="00:15:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Off the top edge.</div><div id="00:15:36.600" class="transcript_line"> Off the top edge of a slow bowler.</div><div id="00:15:38.600" class="transcript_line"> I did the same at Condover once. I think Noel Jones bowled and I came up, I was straight into the infirmary.</div><div id="00:15:44.600" class="transcript_line"> I had six stitches across here at Condover. There was blood all over the place.</div><div id="00:15:50.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I&#039;d played for about a month after.</div><div id="00:15:52.600" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that, there was no serious injury.</div><div id="00:15:54.600" class="transcript_line"> No, no serious injury.</div><div id="00:15:56.600" class="transcript_line"> There was somebody from, got a terrible band down here one day from knocking over.</div><div id="00:16:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember? But there weren&#039;t many, were there?</div><div id="00:16:03.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:16:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Very few and far between.</div><div id="00:16:06.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got one tale that you two will know but Philip knows about.</div><div id="00:16:11.600" class="transcript_line"> In that we went to, oh, what&#039;s that place by Bridge North?</div><div id="00:16:19.600" class="transcript_line"> Rowslake?</div><div id="00:16:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Craven Arms?</div><div id="00:16:21.600" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:16:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Werfield?</div><div id="00:16:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Warfield.</div><div id="00:16:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Warfield.</div><div id="00:16:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Philip was umpiring.</div><div id="00:16:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:16:27.600" class="transcript_line"> And Jonathan was fielding at Deep Square Lines.</div><div id="00:16:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Jonathan Williams.</div><div id="00:16:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Jonathan Williams.</div><div id="00:16:32.600" class="transcript_line"> Jonathan Williams.</div><div id="00:16:33.600" class="transcript_line"> And the ball went out to him and he threw it in.</div><div id="00:16:36.600" class="transcript_line"> And I was, I think I was watching, I was standing on the boundary by Jonathan when he threw it in.</div><div id="00:16:42.600" class="transcript_line"> And this ball hit Philip the umpire from the back of my head.</div><div id="00:16:47.600" class="transcript_line"> Full tilt.</div><div id="00:16:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Full tilt.</div><div id="00:16:49.600" class="transcript_line"> And Jonathan never said a word when he threw it.</div><div id="00:16:51.600" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t shout, look out, or anything like that.</div><div id="00:16:53.600" class="transcript_line"> And it laid him.</div><div id="00:16:55.600" class="transcript_line"> It laid me out.</div><div id="00:16:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Did it?</div><div id="00:16:57.600" class="transcript_line"> It was absolutely amazing.</div><div id="00:16:59.600" class="transcript_line"> It really was.</div><div id="00:17:00.600" class="transcript_line"> It was such a good aim.</div><div id="00:17:01.600" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t, you know, I had a lump, but I didn&#039;t have a headache.</div><div id="00:17:05.600" class="transcript_line"> I did give Jonathan a few choice words.</div><div id="00:17:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Was he as, I don&#039;t remember him bowling like you, was Jonathan as quick as Chris here when he was a school boy?</div><div id="00:17:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Almost so, when he was at his best.</div><div id="00:17:15.600" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s the quickest since Chris was out.</div><div id="00:17:17.600" class="transcript_line"> He hadn&#039;t got good, well, control when he was fast.</div><div id="00:17:22.600" class="transcript_line"> He learned control later.</div><div id="00:17:24.600" class="transcript_line"> He hadn&#039;t got the nastiness in him that this man had got.</div><div id="00:17:27.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:17:28.600" class="transcript_line"> No, Jonathan was too passive.</div><div id="00:17:30.600" class="transcript_line"> And he said he should be more like me.</div></div></p>
