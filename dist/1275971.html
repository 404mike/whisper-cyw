    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In our continuing examination of the race riots in Wales in 1919, this chapter relates</div><div id="00:00:11.320" class="transcript_line"> to the race riots in Barry in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:15.680" class="transcript_line"> First of all there is a need to be clear. The race riots were direct attacks by hundreds</div><div id="00:00:21.200" class="transcript_line"> of white men, mainly men, on black people. They attacked them in the street, chasing</div><div id="00:00:26.840" class="transcript_line"> and pursuing, then beating them if they could, and they burnt down and ransacked their homes</div><div id="00:00:32.520" class="transcript_line"> and lodging houses. In Cardiff white women living with black men were stripped and beaten</div><div id="00:00:38.280" class="transcript_line"> by the mob. The first of the race riots actually broke out in Newport on 6th June when it was</div><div id="00:00:44.440" class="transcript_line"> alleged that a black man had made an insulting remark to a white woman. A white soldier then</div><div id="00:00:50.080" class="transcript_line"> attacked him. Violence quickly flared as an angry mob of white people began attacking at</div><div id="00:00:56.200" class="transcript_line"> random or perceived non-white people, who then began responding in kind with whatever</div><div id="00:01:02.880" class="transcript_line"> they had to hand, including sticks, posters, pokers, razors, knives and in some cases revolvers.</div><div id="00:01:10.800" class="transcript_line"> The Nottingham Evening Post, 12th June 1919. Fatal Afray in Barry. A soldier named Henry</div><div id="00:01:18.640" class="transcript_line"> Longman, aged 30, was fatally stabbed in the street in Barrylast. A negro is detained in</div><div id="00:01:25.340" class="transcript_line"> connection with the soldier&#039;s death. Crowds of white men and women surrounded the police</div><div id="00:01:30.940" class="transcript_line"> station. They were dispersed, but disturbance followed in various many streets where men</div><div id="00:01:37.580" class="transcript_line"> of colour were known to reside. Windows were smashed and property damaged.</div><div id="00:01:43.420" class="transcript_line"> Western Mail, 12th June 1919. Barry riots started because, quote, the black way laid</div><div id="00:01:52.540" class="transcript_line"> him, Fred Longman, seized him by the throat, pinned him against the wall and stabbed him</div><div id="00:01:59.180" class="transcript_line"> under the heart. According to court records, a witness, Louisa Richards, coloured woman</div><div id="00:02:05.780" class="transcript_line"> married to a coloured man now at sea who lived at 17 Beverley Street but now lives at Harvey</div><div id="00:02:13.260" class="transcript_line"> Street, said Longman was standing in his doorway when prisoner Charles Emmanuel and another</div><div id="00:02:20.820" class="transcript_line"> coloured man entered the street. Prisoners spoke to the witness and the other man walked</div><div id="00:02:26.340" class="transcript_line"> on. Longman came up and asked, Emmanuel, can&#039;t you find a street of your own to walk in?</div><div id="00:02:34.460" class="transcript_line"> Emmanuel replied that he was not doing any harm, whereupon Longman struck him. A struggle</div><div id="00:02:40.420" class="transcript_line"> ensued and Longman was pinned up against a wall. Two men came across and one man struck</div><div id="00:02:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Emmanuel with his fist. The other man got a poker and Emmanuel, who relaxed his hold</div><div id="00:02:52.300" class="transcript_line"> of Longman, pulled out a knife. Louisa Richards saw Longman make another dart at the prisoner</div><div id="00:03:00.140" class="transcript_line"> and Longman then staggered and fell bleeding. Although she was only a few miles away, she</div><div id="00:03:06.340" class="transcript_line"> said she did not see Emmanuel actually stab Longman. This was a time when violence and</div><div id="00:03:13.340" class="transcript_line"> crime were entirely normal parts of people&#039;s lives, especially in docks towns. Frederick</div><div id="00:03:20.500" class="transcript_line"> Longman was a convicted thief and had also been arrested for assaulting a police officer.</div><div id="00:03:27.120" class="transcript_line"> This continued during his service in the army, during which time he was charged with various</div><div id="00:03:32.580" class="transcript_line"> offences by the army. He had served as a driver in World War I but had been discharged in</div><div id="00:03:39.220" class="transcript_line"> February 1919 after suffering from dysentery. Although the papers described him as a soldier,</div><div id="00:03:46.900" class="transcript_line"> all that actually meant was that he was in the discharge period when he would have been</div><div id="00:03:52.100" class="transcript_line"> receiving insurance payments after leaving the army. He was not in fact a serving soldier</div><div id="00:03:58.940" class="transcript_line"> and his pension would have run out on October 19. He was a resident of Fairford Street,</div><div id="00:04:05.020" class="transcript_line"> Haddockston for at least 10 years and he left a wife and three young children. Charles</div><div id="00:04:11.140" class="transcript_line"> Emmanuel was a fireman, a merchant seamen working below decks and as he operated from</div><div id="00:04:16.780" class="transcript_line"> Barry Docks he would also have been directly involved in World War I. We cannot now say</div><div id="00:04:23.140" class="transcript_line"> who started the fight between Emmanuel and Longman and others, but we know that 36-year-old</div><div id="00:04:29.260" class="transcript_line"> Frederick Longman was killed and Emmanuel was arrested. At Swansea Town Hall of Sizes,</div><div id="00:04:36.260" class="transcript_line"> 45-year-old French Caribbean seamen Charles Emmanuel was charged on the 22nd of July 1919</div><div id="00:04:43.980" class="transcript_line"> that he did quote, willfully and of malice of Thorford kill and murder one Frederick</div><div id="00:04:50.380" class="transcript_line"> Henry Longman, unquote. However, murder was not proven and Emmanuel received a sentence</div><div id="00:04:57.500" class="transcript_line"> of manslaughter with a prison term of five years.</div><div id="00:05:02.020" class="transcript_line"> Western Mail 13th June 1919. Scenes at Barry. Houses damaged, but no personal violence.</div><div id="00:05:10.620" class="transcript_line"> There was a slight renewal of outbreaks at Barry on Thursday, the paper says. Excited</div><div id="00:05:16.860" class="transcript_line"> crowds settled in the streets of Haddockston and the home of many of the coloured seamen</div><div id="00:05:22.260" class="transcript_line"> were visited. Damage was done to the houses by the smashing of windows, etc. But fortunately</div><div id="00:05:28.580" class="transcript_line"> the strong form of police available, together with the heavy rains which fell, damped the</div><div id="00:05:34.060" class="transcript_line"> ardour of the crowd and eventually prevented anything like a serious disturbance. And but</div><div id="00:05:40.940" class="transcript_line"> little personal violence was indulged in. What might have developed into an ugly incident</div><div id="00:05:46.580" class="transcript_line"> was prevented by the prompt action of the police. It appears that about 50 workmen early</div><div id="00:05:53.220" class="transcript_line"> in the afternoon went to a fish and chip shop in Holton Road which is kept by a woman whose</div><div id="00:05:58.480" class="transcript_line"> husband is a negro. A large crowd gathered on the scene but the police had been sent</div><div id="00:06:04.260" class="transcript_line"> and formed a cordon. They prevented the workmen from entering the premises and carry out their</div><div id="00:06:09.960" class="transcript_line"> threats of molesting the coloured men. Murder charge. Further arrests. Three coloured men</div><div id="00:06:16.180" class="transcript_line"> were arrested at Haddockston on Thursday for having small arms and other dangerous</div><div id="00:06:20.700" class="transcript_line"> weapons of offence in their possession and they will also come up for trial today. The</div><div id="00:06:26.820" class="transcript_line"> violence against black seamen was to continue for a few more days during which Tyrone Ernest</div><div id="00:06:32.540" class="transcript_line"> Jackman was chased from his home in Beverley Street by a mob. Jackman had served through</div><div id="00:06:40.540" class="transcript_line"> the war in France with the Queen&#039;s rifle. He was arrested by the police on the 11th</div><div id="00:06:46.540" class="transcript_line"> of June and sent to court and found guilty of wounding John Goldsworthy. He was fined</div><div id="00:06:53.060" class="transcript_line"> Â£10 and told to be of good behaviour for 12 months. As tensions rose some of the wives</div><div id="00:06:59.240" class="transcript_line"> of black seamen took their children and went to stay with family and friends in the Rhondda</div><div id="00:07:03.380" class="transcript_line"> Valley until their husbands returned from sea and things calmed down. As with other</div><div id="00:07:09.160" class="transcript_line"> areas the local authorities and government tried to persuade black seamen to accept repatriation,</div><div id="00:07:15.080" class="transcript_line"> a free boat ride home, a one way journey. This was not accepted in Barry, especially</div><div id="00:07:21.840" class="transcript_line"> as many men had families and this may be the point at which they actually decided to become</div><div id="00:07:27.520" class="transcript_line"> British, choosing family over land of their birth. In fact a number of them, like Leonard</div><div id="00:07:33.480" class="transcript_line"> Hines, chose to leave the sea and become miners. The events of June 1919 in Barry are</div><div id="00:07:40.200" class="transcript_line"> not common knowledge locally and little has been written about them in the 100 years since.</div><div id="00:07:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Only recently has this secret history been publicised but it is still not the topic of</div><div id="00:07:52.040" class="transcript_line"> school work which is a shame for many reasons, not least because the grandchildren and great</div><div id="00:07:59.020" class="transcript_line"> grandchildren of that generation do not know that the black seamen and soldiers and white</div><div id="00:08:05.020" class="transcript_line"> wives clearly made a decision to remain in Barry and Wales which is the reason those</div><div id="00:08:11.780" class="transcript_line"> young relatives are citizens of Wales.</div></div></p>
