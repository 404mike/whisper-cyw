id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We are fiancees.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I know we will have covered this in the previous interview but could you just remind people who might be listening to this how long you&#039;ve been engaged and how long you&#039;ve been together?</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been together about four years now in February and we got engaged last year.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re on next Wednesday?</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So how have you both found the last seven months?</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The first couple of months we didn&#039;t ever see each other, did we Richard?</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No we didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We were able to keep in contact through Skype and video calling and things and phone of course.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So why didn&#039;t you, was it just the lockdown?</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, we were locked down, I think we were confused what we could see and don&#039;t think we were allowed to see outside.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> A little tickler time.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But then when it got a bit easier we were going out for walks.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Every day.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> A source of this to meet us.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when we were there we were able to go and stay in your house when we went.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when the bubble started.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So you bubbled with each other did you?</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And how did you find that after a few months away from each other, what was it like seeing each other in person for the first time?</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Relief.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was pure joy.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Joy.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And what did you miss about being apart when you couldn&#039;t see each other?</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the company really wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think company mostly.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Attempting not to kill each other but if you know what I mean Paul.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I know what you mean, I&#039;m married.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Watching the same programmes, laughing at things, I think we mostly missed as well.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And talking to each other.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Forgive me if you don&#039;t want to answer this but when you stayed at each others homes did you stay in the same bedroom, in the same bed?</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, didn&#039;t we Ed?</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there any aspect of that that you missed in the months that you weren&#039;t together?</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When I say no it&#039;s the snoring part of it Paul.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re a snorer Richard.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Rather than that I did miss it about the snoring.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We did miss each other apart from the snoring part.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And you say companionship, is it different do you think than just talking to each other over the internet?</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me in what way it&#039;s different for you?</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like when you can see someone on screen you can&#039;t always, how can I put this, it&#039;s the physicality of not having somebody near to you or next to you.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I agree with that.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Where do you both live at the moment?</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> At the moment we&#039;re apart.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I live on my own.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I live with my parents.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Richard, do you live on your own completely or do you have any support coming in?</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I do have support but not from my parents. My father missed them, I live across the road from me to the few doors up.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re there if I ever need them and they&#039;ve been absolutely fantastic.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So when the first lockdown happened in March Richard, did you stay on your own?</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I did, yeah, we were talking on the doorsteps and short distances.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And how did you find that apart from obviously missing Helen, how did you find just being on your own for that amount of time?</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Up and down.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I felt OK most of the time because I knew they were only a phone call away order, I could talk on the doorstep to them.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But when things got easier then we were able to meet outside, I was able to go and see them in the garden.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was OK and that was good.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there anything you enjoyed about not being able to go anywhere or do anything?</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a tricky one.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t answer that I&#039;m afraid Paul.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s fine and Helen you live with your parents?</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you find being around them?</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t mind because I felt it brought us a bit closer because sometimes I don&#039;t see them all the time.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s wrong because I just stay with them once a week before lockdown.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But it seemed to have brought us closer because I&#039;ve seen them all day now.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> When I even worked at home I wasn&#039;t living with them.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So if I was stuck on bits of work, they were always there.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Mam can you let me with this or Dad?</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know what I would cope with if I was living on my own mind.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It would probably be a bit different.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose if I was all living on my own I would have to move back in because I don&#039;t think I would cope living on my own like Richard.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever both consider moving in with each other for the lockdown?</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Because not long beginning to lockdown my father went back into hospital so I thought it wasn&#039;t a risk.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know that he wasn&#039;t as, I suppose it was serious but he didn&#039;t have a heart attack.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was his heart that was at.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But if I wanted to go and see him it was really high risk of the Covid going back to him when he came out of hospital.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was that way of dodgy.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and he was risky so we wouldn&#039;t take the risk.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> No that&#039;s fair enough.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So on top of everything else, Helen you had your father being a bit under the weather.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you find all of that?</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t visit him in hospital or anything?</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> No I couldn&#039;t. My mother and my sister took him in.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Luckily we got good doctors, really good doctors.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went to an appointment on a Monday, he was in on a Tuesday.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they took him over, I wasn&#039;t with them, but they took him through the door and they weren&#039;t allowed to go through the hospital.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They were only allowed to go into a certain type of ward I think.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And left him there for about two weeks.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were only watching what we were doing now on Skype or FaceTime etc.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we did every day.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But a totally odd and totally easy way of visiting.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you find that? How did you find that emotionally having your father in for two weeks and not being able to see him?</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Hard.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially now, I say now I&#039;ve grown up.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never really left him in hospital.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Since he was 71, so since he&#039;s 70 he&#039;s bad.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a hard problem.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And the only time I&#039;ve left him for longer is when he had a two day pass.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see him.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was told by my father, do not come and see me, it won&#039;t be well.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But as long as seeing him not being with me in the house was already emotionally difficult.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when he was in having his pacemaker removed and the right witred, when I left him I got in the lift and cried.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes you did.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;d never have left him in hospital.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And did Richard, you and Helen talk about that when it was happening?</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did, we spoke a lot didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And with friends as well.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We liked friends.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they&#039;ve had a difficult moment and they would support me.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is good actually.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So thinking about your friends, have you managed to stay in touch with them?</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very much.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Mostly every day.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Either text or the semen for example, we are doing the Skype.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d say two or three months in a bit and we&#039;d start doing quizzes.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes we did, we started doing quizzes now and it&#039;s been really enjoyable.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It keeps your brain in gear.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I do the quizzes really, I don&#039;t take part, I just do the quiz.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Helen&#039;s quiz master.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we met through lockdown now with another friend called Richard.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Which we did, well you&#039;ve met him before haven&#039;t you Rich?</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but you haven&#039;t actually met him in the fresh sort have you?</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but at the moment to me that&#039;s his meeting.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We met new friend called David through Richard and other friend.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve had a bigger group meeting, Skype-ing which is very good fun.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that thing you&#039;ve got tonight, who are those friends?</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Where did you meet them? Obviously before lockdown I presume.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well one is very much before lockdown.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Kerry our friend we&#039;ve met in primary school.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And even though it isn&#039;t particularly a miniature story really,</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;d had a huge gap of not meeting Kerry because he had moved on to a different school</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was in primary and I went on to a different school in the camp.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was about the same time, how many years was that Rich?</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I think about the same time as we were, about 12, 13 years gap not meeting each other.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Even though we didn&#039;t get to meet each other in the street at the time,</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t like this.</div><div id="00:12:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I met Alby through Richard.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were the same.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But Kerry was from primary school.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And so what kind of things did you do with them before lockdown?</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go out didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We had plans to go and see the Mrs Brown&#039;s boys in June.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah that was pushed back to next year.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully, fingers crossed.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, let&#039;s hope so.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re big fans of it.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And this new friend David, where did you meet him?</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> He was through Alby wasn&#039;t he Rich?</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I met him through Alby a few years back.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We lost touch for a while but then he started joining us on Skype for chats and we&#039;ve got friendly again.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s he from?</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Penderyn.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so still near you.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m thinking, are you members of any groups at all before all of this?</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in a choir called Martinash Coal Society.</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And has that choir continued to meet online?</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about 90 odd of us.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I doubt we will be on a choir and get on the Skype.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we had a conference last week, there were 400-500 people on it.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So we suppose we could.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But most of them are not very much technically minded I suppose.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve had emails from the chairwoman, asking how everybody was and all that.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anyone from choir that you miss seeing regularly?</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m awesome. We all have a very good friendship with all of them.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the choir members was my school teacher in Llanwell.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re really making great friends now.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We miss him a lot.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;re missing all, we call it a family I suppose.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like choir family.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we just miss genuinely socialising with them during the choir and then after the choir.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We miss the social part of it.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Not so much the singing then?</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we do miss that as well.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We miss singing, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But we like to drink a pot after it.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Finally.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You need a good drink after a good singing.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It oils the cords, you know, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It keeps your voice in good nick.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, are they just going to say next year?</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I think as well, removing premises, well I guess, as a worker.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But I wouldn&#039;t gather removing premises to guarantee if we go social distance.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But not as to not yet saying the answer anyway.</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> At the moment.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any other groups that you&#039;re part of like separate from each other?</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I joined, I think it was two years ago, a Nithynata group.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is actually when I look at it I&#039;m the youngest.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is lovely.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But we haven&#039;t still gone back.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we are doing it in the new library.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they call it Community Hub.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Or what do they call it now?</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all, it was nice when you put them in, elderly then.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They were all over the, I suppose, eighties, nineties, I think some of them.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s all like age limited stuff I think.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think about it, with the groups I think we&#039;re in.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s not a lot of experience with the other members of using Skype or Teams or?</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they do Facebook but we don&#039;t do Skype or anything.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> As I said, they know very much I suppose, technically, I think of Skype and more.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And through Facebook.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And Richard, are there any groups that you go on your own to without Helen?</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there isn&#039;t actually.</div><div id="00:17:49.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So thinking about the last seven months, how has it affected your wellbeing, your mood and how you feel about things?</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes when you&#039;ve been on your own quite a bit.</div><div id="00:18:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got my parents across the road if I need them.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes when you just feel down in the dumps sometimes.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything we take for granted these days, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So things, you know, being able to go out whenever you feel like it, see anybody you wish to see.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know it&#039;s all been taken away.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It makes you appreciate life in a more way, you know.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And it really is how much you take for granted these days.</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because especially I feel a bit down in the dumps when we get to see friends on Skype.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because normally, say, on a Saturday, how it means, what we do on a Saturday is actually meeting up with our friend Albie.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> In his house.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I tend to go and get our friend Kerry.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he lives, I think, supposedly down by you, Paul, in the sub-oath.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So I go down and pick him up.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Come up to as far as Richard, so Richard gets on the bus to go out, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So I do miss that bit, just picking him up and having our own chat.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> With Kerry.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I know it sounds bad to say, well, Richard being there.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But he keeps saying to me, I&#039;m like his sister, and he&#039;s like my brother, and we miss all that connection.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Really, it makes me, I don&#039;t know, appreciate things now.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> If I didn&#039;t do it before, I&#039;d just be on.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I should have missed the things.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re supposed to take for granted, really.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So when things return to as normal as they can be, do you think you&#039;ll have changed?</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You have changed your life.</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you&#039;re looking forward to that you haven&#039;t been able to do since March that you can&#039;t wait to do again?</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m so sorry.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a few shows planned hopefully next year, if they will go ahead.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Which one are you looking forward to the most?</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a tricky question.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Two I&#039;m really looking forward to, of all.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Sleen Dioan yn April.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And lucky enough, in June I think, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That I bought tickets for me and Richard to go see The Queen with Adam Lambert.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And where will that be?</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Both of them in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully everything will look okay between.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, let&#039;s hope so.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise here we&#039;ll have to move it around again I suppose.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got, hmm?</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, go on.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got a rolling keeping in January if that goes ahead, but I&#039;m not sure that will definitely go ahead yet.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to Birmingham, how will you get there?</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Train.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll just go together, is it?</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then will you come back the same day or will you stay overnight?</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll stay overnight.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Stay overnight.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Stay overnight.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> For both of them.</div><div id="00:21:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve done that before, has it?</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ve done that before, yeah.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done, well this year actually, before actual lockdown, a week before we went up to Craffs, didn&#039;t we, right?</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> With my mother actually.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sorry to interrupt that.</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We were just lucky I suppose to get back in time for lockdown to go in.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And just before lockdown as well, we went to see a megaball in Afibau in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and that was really good too.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of what was going on when you went to see him then?</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We were aware that the coronavirus was around and there was hand sanitizer everywhere during the Craffs, so you could always keep your hands clean and all that.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned going to Birmingham with your parents.</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Have your parents both supported you to keep in touch with each other and, you know, have you just seen all the struggling and things like that?</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because the first thing most people say is, how&#039;s it going?</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> How&#039;s me?</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been, how&#039;s Richard? Is Richard coping?</div><div id="00:22:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know whether if he wasn&#039;t coping or what they would do about it, but it was, how is he coping? Is he doing well?</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, okay, mam, yeah, he&#039;s doing fine.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and there was always, and her parents.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And friends.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And friends, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when we started working, I would go out for me and my mother and if I see someone they say, well, how&#039;s Richard?</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I feel like they were worried about me then, because there was nothing to do with me, it was always Richard.</div><div id="00:23:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Richard, when you bubbled, did you ever go to Helen&#039;s house?</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t actually. Helen always came to me.</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did you do that, do you think?</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It was because you&#039;re at your own place, I suppose.</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If it wasn&#039;t for a reason, I would have come over, because you always, you saw, I&#039;ll come over and I think, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll go on my own, home on my own.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But I always went to Richard&#039;s and I.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose at Richard&#039;s, you know, obviously you&#039;ve got some privacy there, you&#039;re not, there&#039;s no one else.</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Thinking about, like, the restrictions that have been in place, obviously for a while now, have you both, do you remember the first time you went to a shop after lockdown?</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I was at a shop after lockdown.</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I was at a shop after lockdown, so I wear a mask.</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, how did you find being in that environment now with all those new rules?</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t mind it as long as other people did it.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because sometimes when you go to tests, of course, people are getting quite close to you when you&#039;re going through the aisles and they felt quite, you know, weird and it made you feel a bit apprehensive.</div><div id="00:25:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you both, have you gone to, like, restaurants or pubs with the new rules and shops or have you just.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been to a few restaurants, like Pepper&#039;s in Aberdeen.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did go there a couple of times, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, twice.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But they always did a track and trace, which I felt was safe.</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, hand sanitiser when you go in.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They made sure, you know, as you hand sanitiser, use it, take it to the table.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:45.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel before you went? Was it, like, were you nervous or were you okay about it?</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was okay about it.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit apprehensive, but I had to go on a bus and all that.</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the first time in a long time I&#039;d been on a bus, so I was a bit nervous.</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was a water mask, and I started getting better and then the cases started going up again, so.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you both concerned about catching the virus?</div><div id="00:26:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose, yes.</div><div id="00:26:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yes.</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, you mentioned face masks, and obviously you have to wear one going fast.</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about face masks now and to wear them?</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like them, but they do when they drop, so you&#039;ve got to.</div><div id="00:26:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind wearing it, but the only problem is it steams my glasses up and I can&#039;t see through them.</div><div id="00:26:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, on a Saturday with my father now, I go to church and we&#039;ve got to wear them for a whole mass.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So that doesn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> First time we did it, oh, I did it, I was driving me nuts, and I couldn&#039;t wait to get out to take it off.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I do on my own is my sister who uses it for a whole time she&#039;s in work.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s been eight hours wearing masks, so I don&#039;t mind that because it only takes half an hour wearing them as it drives me nuts.</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And how do you feel seeing other people wearing a mask?</div><div id="00:27:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, suppose some people may find it difficult to communicate with other people or read that person&#039;s facial expressions.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel talking to someone wearing a mask?</div><div id="00:27:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not too bad.</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose this is the new normal from now on, so we have to get used to it.</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We can normally understand them pretty well, so it&#039;s not too bad.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So obviously the Welsh Government have just announced that we&#039;re going to have another two-week fire break.</div><div id="00:28:09.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel when that was announced?</div><div id="00:28:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we sort of knew it was coming.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t shocked.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t surprised.</div><div id="00:28:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t feel you would go again, but I suppose it could be a lot worse in England, who&#039;s not doing very much really.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve done a way to do a lot better than England, that&#039;s for sure.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you think you&#039;re going to see each other in person again before Christmas?</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I suppose. Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Hold on to hope anyway, hold on, go for it.</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you have done for Christmas if there were all these restrictions?</div><div id="00:28:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose my house, normally on Christmas time we are grandparents down, and I don&#039;t think we are none down now.</div><div id="00:29:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And Richard, you would be there as well?</div><div id="00:29:13.000" class="transcript_line"> On Christmas day, no, because I&#039;d be with my own family on Christmas day.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Normally before Christmas day and normally after Christmas day we&#039;d see each other then, because normally we have my Gran down for Christmas, but unfortunately she lives in Exeter, so it doesn&#039;t matter if she&#039;s coming down this year.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:29:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the moment.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been engaged for about a year, you said earlier?</div><div id="00:29:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Has all of this changed any plans you may have to get married?</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> No. We haven&#039;t really planned anything really.</div><div id="00:29:45.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We talked.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was nothing, not anything set in stone.</div><div id="00:29:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that something you&#039;re going to be thinking about in the future, do you think?</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Wait until the rules have changed so people can go to it, is it?</div><div id="00:30:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose a lot more people can, I don&#039;t want it to be a small wedding, really.</div><div id="00:30:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:30:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t mean to wait a long time, you&#039;ll have to wait a long time.</div><div id="00:30:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you think, having spent months apart from each other and then being able to see each other again, do you think moving to cards now?</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully once.</div><div id="00:30:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In the future, yes, but at the moment with Richard being in Jobcentre, if I move in now, I think it will upset everything of his benefits,</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it would affect the benefits.</div><div id="00:30:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I am actively looking for work as best I can, but I&#039;m his employee as well, so hopefully I&#039;ll get something soon when the lockdown eases and all that,</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and then hopefully when I do get eventually into work, we&#039;ll talk about that and see what we can do.</div><div id="00:31:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So obviously now we&#039;re living under a lot of different rules at the moment.</div><div id="00:31:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you always understood them?</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them, yes, but…</div><div id="00:31:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them we&#039;ve understood, yeah, some of them we find a bit confusing and all that, but mostly we&#039;ve understood them.</div><div id="00:31:28.000" class="transcript_line"> What rules have you found confusing?</div><div id="00:31:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What rules have you found confusing?</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes a bubbling part of it, like the one now that they said you can go one to one.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> People who live on the rock and roll.</div><div id="00:31:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so yes, Richard, Helen, you are allowed to go and visit Richard still?</div><div id="00:31:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, until Friday I think, but I still say after, but because Richard is doing himself well,</div><div id="00:32:04.000" class="transcript_line"> even his father, that&#039;s for the bit, my mother was saying, no you can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:32:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Richard was saying to me, yes I can do it, so I was in between.</div><div id="00:32:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, it was a bit confusing.</div><div id="00:32:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to go with my mother was saying, because I&#039;m living with her.</div><div id="00:32:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, but your father not seeing his father.</div><div id="00:32:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I kept saying, no, you see your father.</div><div id="00:32:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ll be decided on that.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand now, of course, Richard you mentioned you&#039;re going to be seeing your parents.</div><div id="00:32:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand that you can meet, if you live on your own Richard, you can form a bubble with one of the households.</div><div id="00:32:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you&#039;ve chosen to be a parent, right?</div><div id="00:32:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so that makes sense then.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because I told him too, because after the year I&#039;ve had my father, I said, you only got one father?</div><div id="00:33:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially when I only lost nine, I feel it&#039;s better to keep this.</div><div id="00:33:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You never know what&#039;s around the corner, do you sir?</div><div id="00:33:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because as I said, I only lost my father, 20 yard, and he had sepsis as well, a year or over a year ago.</div><div id="00:33:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I only lost him due to that.</div><div id="00:33:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, seeing your father is more important than seeing me.</div><div id="00:33:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think other people are following the rules?</div><div id="00:33:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Some that, yes, but I think mostly youngsters as well.</div><div id="00:33:55.000" class="transcript_line"> As I say, I&#039;ve seen Richard, I walk home and the amount of youngsters are out.</div><div id="00:34:02.000" class="transcript_line"> As if it was no Covid.</div><div id="00:34:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s people out there trying their best to follow the rules, and there&#039;s people breaking them on purpose, and it makes you quite angry.</div><div id="00:34:15.000" class="transcript_line"> People aren&#039;t following the rules and all that, and people are trying to follow them as best they can.</div><div id="00:34:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that might be it.</div><div id="00:34:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that you think we should mention or talk about, or is there something that maybe you thought you were going to say but I interrupted you or something?</div><div id="00:34:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:34:42.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:34:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:34:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you very much. I&#039;m now going to stop the recording.</div><div id="00:34:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed, Paul.</div><div id="00:34:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:34:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
