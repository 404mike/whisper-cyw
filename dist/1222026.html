And I never thought I&#039;d be involved with children.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> How does yoga work with autism?</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great. With autism you have to have the maths the same every week.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to do some of the same things every week, so they&#039;ve got their routine.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They like the routine and it&#039;s just really good for them. And it improves their concentration.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They just really enjoy it. We&#039;re talking about older children here.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We did have mixed, to start with, younger ones, but that didn&#039;t work out.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> These seem to be all about, I don&#039;t know, 12 onwards, 12 to about 16.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s one young man who&#039;s 25, but mentally his age is a bit different.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re a bit more focused about age then, I guess.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think so. But even the younger ones who come in, it worked for a while,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> but they didn&#039;t leave because they didn&#039;t like it. They left for other reasons.</div></div></p>
