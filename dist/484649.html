    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Katherine McShane interviewing for the Swicker Carnival project, Cardiff Carnival&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:10.160" class="transcript_line"> 25th anniversary heritage project and I&#039;m here with Bud Harper on the 16th of October 2014</div><div id="00:00:20.720" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re and the time is 25 past 10 in the evening and we&#039;re in Peniland Cardiff. Bud,</div><div id="00:00:28.720" class="transcript_line"> could you spell your name for us? Oh right okay yeah Bud and then my surname H-A-R-P-E-R.</div><div id="00:00:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant. So obviously this is a carnival project, how did you get involved in the</div><div id="00:00:42.240" class="transcript_line"> carnival? Ah my older brother, I had an older brother and yeah it must be one summer he just said</div><div id="00:00:50.720" class="transcript_line"> come and get involved come come to this place come to Tays Community Centre.</div><div id="00:00:55.600" class="transcript_line"> Um don&#039;t yeah I don&#039;t really reckon that I just remember being taken along there.</div><div id="00:01:00.240" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember whether I really knew anybody else there. I just went along with him and quickly.</div><div id="00:01:08.640" class="transcript_line"> How old were you then? So if it was 94, I think is the first one that I did, I would have been 19.</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes I actually that surprises me because I felt I&#039;ve looking back I felt like I was really young.</div><div id="00:01:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah but it must be 94. So I started because it was yeah it was definitely Tays. I was quite shy.</div><div id="00:01:34.640" class="transcript_line"> I remember there was lots of you know it was for Tays you know it was just people making costumes</div><div id="00:01:43.840" class="transcript_line"> every day and that you know you&#039;d come in there was food. I don&#039;t know whether I remember going</div><div id="00:01:49.840" class="transcript_line"> to you know the opening night because I do remember from that period that opening night was quite</div><div id="00:01:55.440" class="transcript_line"> special that you know that was definitely the following year is that you&#039;d make sure that you</div><div id="00:02:01.120" class="transcript_line"> were down there for the opening night. There was always lots of nice food, it was a good kind of</div><div id="00:02:05.520" class="transcript_line"> party atmosphere. And so what do you remember about that first carnival then you were involved in?</div><div id="00:02:11.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all the characters and yeah just lots and lots of different people and just you know it was</div><div id="00:02:19.200" class="transcript_line"> very big it was always seem very busy. It was a real hive of activity and I suppose at that age</div><div id="00:02:29.120" class="transcript_line"> where you know I was really it was a real introduction to kind of the adult world it felt like and</div><div id="00:02:37.120" class="transcript_line"> to quite a creative world so there were lots of musicians, lots of percussion,</div><div id="00:02:42.880" class="transcript_line"> lots of people making things you know it felt very creative and a bit anarchic.</div><div id="00:02:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah certainly you know you might come in on a Saturday and there&#039;d just be people everywhere</div><div id="00:02:59.040" class="transcript_line"> in all different ages you know there were definitely some people. I suppose it was always</div><div id="00:03:03.760" class="transcript_line"> quite interesting most people felt older than me but there were other young people there and you</div><div id="00:03:13.680" class="transcript_line"> would kind of check each other out. I was quite shy at that age.</div><div id="00:03:22.480" class="transcript_line"> Okay but you carried on going year after year? Yeah and it was the same you know certainly for</div><div id="00:03:28.560" class="transcript_line"> the first couple years that you know you&#039;d go back the next year and you&#039;d see people that you&#039;d</div><div id="00:03:34.560" class="transcript_line"> seen the year before and over the years you&#039;d make more of an effort I think to build you know</div><div id="00:03:43.040" class="transcript_line"> after three years you&#039;d even if you hadn&#039;t talked to some of those people that the next year you&#039;d</div><div id="00:03:48.240" class="transcript_line"> come back you&#039;d they were like people you did know even though if you hadn&#039;t spoken to them</div><div id="00:03:54.960" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;d make a bit more you know nice to see you again.</div><div id="00:03:59.200" class="transcript_line"> But yeah just characters you know obviously there was Steve was always at the forefront.</div><div id="00:04:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Of course. Yeah you know it was interesting even when I was quite young</div><div id="00:04:12.640" class="transcript_line"> you know you could work you know you became aware of who was working there. It was you know like a</div><div id="00:04:19.600" class="transcript_line"> little hierarchy you know and but which people were always there even if they were volunteers</div><div id="00:04:24.800" class="transcript_line"> you know there were some yeah people who were just like star warts of I don&#039;t know even</div><div id="00:04:31.120" class="transcript_line"> necessarily know their names but just people you would recognize you might see them other</div><div id="00:04:38.560" class="transcript_line"> places I suppose during the year as well. Is there anyone you do remember particularly?</div><div id="00:04:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I think when I first started going down at Tom and Ali were quite big characters</div><div id="00:04:53.360" class="transcript_line"> because I was musical when I started so I was always keen to get involved in the music side</div><div id="00:04:59.440" class="transcript_line"> stuff and you know I was learning instruments myself but actually that whole thing of collective</div><div id="00:05:07.600" class="transcript_line"> drumming was really interesting and new and it was I suppose it was around the time as well of</div><div id="00:05:14.640" class="transcript_line"> you know kind of rave and stuff so kind of percussion and drumming and</div><div id="00:05:19.360" class="transcript_line"> that kind of tribal stuff and yeah a couple of years we I can&#039;t remember if we played along to</div><div id="00:05:26.320" class="transcript_line"> other stuff but we were all quite into our younger age group you know we&#039;re very kind of affected by</div><div id="00:05:33.440" class="transcript_line"> that kind of rave culture and I think we brought on actually we brought along quite a youthful</div><div id="00:05:39.600" class="transcript_line"> exuberance to some of the older ones you know I think we did bring something to the party at</div><div id="00:05:45.440" class="transcript_line"> the time it felt like we were quite you know up for doing you know yeah brought a lot of enthusiasm</div><div id="00:05:52.720" class="transcript_line"> but yeah the two things I suppose that you remember was one was you know every year getting</div><div id="00:05:57.280" class="transcript_line"> involved in the drumming and you know it was different every year you&#039;d have a different</div><div id="00:06:01.920" class="transcript_line"> thing going on different people organizing it different kind of themes as such so yeah some</div><div id="00:06:10.480" class="transcript_line"> years it we did more strict kind of samba-y stuff that I know I particularly remember the one year</div><div id="00:06:16.880" class="transcript_line"> with Tom where it was just all rusty bits of metal and that was really and we had some ridiculous</div><div id="00:06:24.400" class="transcript_line"> float you know that was it was like a gosh yeah I remember people welding you know we</div><div id="00:06:30.720" class="transcript_line"> they built like a big metal construction was it the car yeah and when I see these people are John</div><div id="00:06:39.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know I can&#039;t even remember his name punk John who used to go out with Anne for years</div><div id="00:06:48.480" class="transcript_line"> for years he was in he was always in Newport punk bands I can&#039;t remember</div><div id="00:06:55.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah I know him for you know it&#039;s funny that having known him for years later that was the</div><div id="00:07:00.560" class="transcript_line"> first time I ever met him it&#039;s funny to think gosh yeah I forgot that they did carnival</div><div id="00:07:06.800" class="transcript_line"> but that was yeah brilliant that was really anarchic I think I drummed</div><div id="00:07:11.120" class="transcript_line"> my drum that year was an exhaust exhaust off something and I just made a horrible noise</div><div id="00:07:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and I just beat it incessantly but yeah so the other thing then was the costumes that you made</div><div id="00:07:24.400" class="transcript_line"> and I think obviously looking back at the early my early days of doing carnival that it&#039;s quite</div><div id="00:07:32.400" class="transcript_line"> easy to remember those as being the best the best ones but I think actually what was what I really</div><div id="00:07:40.880" class="transcript_line"> did like about those in in relation to making costumes it was it was a bit more freedom to make</div><div id="00:07:50.640" class="transcript_line"> what you what you liked so you were you know you had to make your own costume which I think in</div><div id="00:07:58.880" class="transcript_line"> later years it became a little bit more synchronized and you had people making costumes for you and you</div><div id="00:08:05.440" class="transcript_line"> could kind of I was definitely in later years I was someone due to commitments that I could turn</div><div id="00:08:12.320" class="transcript_line"> up quite late into carnival you know a couple of days beforehand and pick up a drum and and</div><div id="00:08:17.760" class="transcript_line"> somebody would have made a costume for me and I think you miss out a little bit I mean I think</div><div id="00:08:23.920" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what you need a bit for everybody isn&#039;t it and some people that&#039;s all they can commit to</div><div id="00:08:29.040" class="transcript_line"> but yeah the first couple of years like we just used to make the most ridiculous costumes as well</div><div id="00:08:33.440" class="transcript_line"> what kind of what sort of things did you dress up as then well you couldn&#039;t really call them</div><div id="00:08:38.160" class="transcript_line"> anything the the one I dressed up it was it I mean there wasn&#039;t a theme so you could just dress up</div><div id="00:08:43.920" class="transcript_line"> there was just a load of materials and things but you could do what you like um the one year</div><div id="00:08:50.960" class="transcript_line"> there was loads of foam I don&#039;t know where it came from or what it was being used for</div><div id="00:08:57.360" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t think it was specifically to be how a costume made and I</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I was always rubbish at making costumes I was I was quite well known for my poor costumes</div><div id="00:09:12.560" class="transcript_line"> oh that was the stuff the thing was I was never I was never very good at making things and</div><div id="00:09:17.280" class="transcript_line"> I always my abiding memory of early years of costumes was with the willow you know not</div><div id="00:09:26.080" class="transcript_line"> curly willow but that wicker kind of bendy withy yeah thin bits of wood and that everybody had to</div><div id="00:09:34.160" class="transcript_line"> make stuff you know that was what you made you know I understand that you make all the frames</div><div id="00:09:38.080" class="transcript_line"> out of that stuff but that was and I never got on with that stuff so I didn&#039;t make I didn&#039;t want to</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> make stuff it was a real hive of activity and I suppose at that age where you know I was</div><div id="00:09:58.640" class="transcript_line"> really it was a real introduction to kind of the adult world it felt like and and to quite a creative</div><div id="00:10:05.360" class="transcript_line"> world so there were lots of musicians lots of percussion lots of people making things</div><div id="00:10:12.240" class="transcript_line"> you know it felt very creative and a bit anarchic</div><div id="00:10:18.960" class="transcript_line"> yeah certainly you know you might come in on a saturday and there&#039;d just be people everywhere</div><div id="00:10:26.080" class="transcript_line"> in all different ages you know there were definitely some people I suppose it was always</div><div id="00:10:30.880" class="transcript_line"> quite interesting most people felt older than me but there were other young

class="transcript_line"> okay but you carried on going oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and it was the same you know certainly</div><div id="00:10:55.520" class="transcript_line"> for the first couple years that you know you&#039;d go back the next year and you&#039;d see people that</div><div id="00:11:01.360" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve seen the year before and over the years you&#039;d make more of a an effort I think to</div><div id="00:11:08.160" class="transcript_line"> to build you know after three years you even if you hadn&#039;t talked to some of those people that</div><div id="00:11:14.320" class="transcript_line"> the next year you&#039;d come back you&#039;d they were like people you did know even though if you hadn&#039;t</div><div id="00:11:20.480" class="transcript_line"> spoken to them so you&#039;d make a bit more you know nice to see you again but yeah just characters</div><div id="00:11:27.360" class="transcript_line"> you know obviously there was Steve was always at the forefront of course and just yeah you know it</div><div id="00:11:35.360" class="transcript_line"> was it was interesting even when I was quite young you know you you

class="transcript_line"> but which people were always there even if they were volunteers you know there were some</div><div id="00:11:54.400" class="transcript_line"> yeah people who were just like

id="00:17:13.440" class="transcript_line"> stuff so what did you make from it so yeah they were these really large chunks of foam it was</div><div id="00:17:22.880" class="transcript_line"> like they&#039;d been ripped out of like a seating or something I just uh I can&#039;t even I&#039;ve got a pair</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> of scissors maybe just hollowed out a great big cube of stuff and just stuck it on my head</div><div id="00:17:39.040" class="transcript_line"> it was just like the most misshapen it wasn&#039;t anything in particular it just seemed kind of</div><div id="00:17:46.400" class="transcript_line"> I thought it I didn&#039;t even think it was funny I just thought I&#039;d be cool so I had a bit I suppose</div><div id="00:17:50.960" class="transcript_line"> a little bit look a bit like spongebob just this great big yeah yeah just a huge bit of foam and I</div><div id="00:17:58.560" class="transcript_line"> think it was a bit of an odd shape it maybe looked a bit like an anvil and I just hollowed</div><div id="00:18:05.760" class="transcript_line"> out a bit so I could see out of it and breathe yeah I vaguely remember it used to yeah it rubbed</div><div id="00:18:12.800" class="transcript_line"> I you know you perspire on it it wasn&#039;t me foam risen yeah yeah and that I think</div><div id="00:18:19.520"
