    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Andrew Podnor aka Podinton Norr. I started going to gigs when I was 15 in 85, 86.</div><div id="00:00:16.960" class="transcript_line"> I sing or shout or attempt to get a message over whilst playing with an amazing band called Bosch.</div><div id="00:00:28.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been around for 20 years. My relationship with the music scene in Newport is well, I mean it&#039;s a little odd.</div><div id="00:00:37.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never really felt like that I was necessarily connected to any of it.</div><div id="00:00:42.720" class="transcript_line"> I always looked too old for my age, you know. I was quite a tall teenager and I looked old for my age.</div><div id="00:00:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Something that benefited me when I was younger but doesn&#039;t pay many dividends as one gets older.</div><div id="00:00:59.120" class="transcript_line"> However, you know, it meant that I could go and see gigs a lot sooner than most people were allowed to.</div><div id="00:01:05.120" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t even ask for ID back then and the first venue I frequented was TJ&#039;s.</div><div id="00:01:11.120" class="transcript_line"> I think the first gig I went to see was the Membranes and I think the Abs were supporting and that was a particularly good night.</div><div id="00:01:18.120" class="transcript_line"> During the period when TJ&#039;s was open from say 85, 86 till 97, 98, I frequently went to TJ&#039;s to see the bands</div><div id="00:01:31.120" class="transcript_line"> because like you know Simon had the cheap, sweaty, fun sort of events and he had an astonishing taste for new and interesting</div><div id="00:01:40.120" class="transcript_line"> like some alt rock and punk music flooding in from America and Europe and it was a real education.</div><div id="00:01:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Then like you know things got a bit like sort of homogenized and Simon fell out with Johnny Sicolo over something or other.</div><div id="00:01:59.120" class="transcript_line"> The other promoters weren&#039;t quite as imaginative as Simon was and I started spending less time going to gigs</div><div id="00:02:09.120" class="transcript_line"> and more time thinking about generating or being involved in a band that would create gigs.</div><div id="00:02:15.120" class="transcript_line"> So that was a catalyst.</div><div id="00:02:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Seeing Swans was particularly amazing.</div><div id="00:02:22.120" class="transcript_line"> They were so loud and they were so beautifully bleak in their soundscapes</div><div id="00:02:30.120" class="transcript_line"> and they generated such an immensely emotive pull with their audience that you were just flabbergasted that a band could be that powerful.</div><div id="00:02:42.120" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a mosh pit.</div><div id="00:02:44.120" class="transcript_line"> People tended to sway and whilst they were swaying we noticed that there was a patina of foam appearing on the dance floor at our feet</div><div id="00:02:55.120" class="transcript_line"> and then we looked up and we found out that like the noise was so loud that it was dismantling the foam cave facade of TJ&#039;s.</div><div id="00:03:08.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was a fascinating gig.</div><div id="00:03:10.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the one that really sticks in my mind.</div><div id="00:03:13.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you what though, it did highlight the fact that like you know the whole thing was kind of principally an illusion</div><div id="00:03:21.120" class="transcript_line"> right down to the Gothic majesty of Swans music and it made me start to think along the lines of music being a formula to control the audience.</div><div id="00:03:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Well there were a lot of middle aged men which was odd because I was in my early 20s at the time and I thought wow you know.</div><div id="00:03:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Naturally you were shocked that something this magnificent could attract so many different age groups.</div><div id="00:03:55.120" class="transcript_line"> But as I got older I started to realize that like you know it was only through acquiring a knowledge of music and then dismantling that knowledge and wanting more</div><div id="00:04:07.120" class="transcript_line"> that you have these amazing moments with a band.</div><div id="00:04:11.120" class="transcript_line"> A band that like you know might not necessarily attract young audiences.</div><div id="00:04:17.120" class="transcript_line"> The Swans are notorious for their misanthropy and their negativity.</div><div id="00:04:23.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to admit being a 50 year old middle aged man has led me to believe that like you know the 50 year old middle aged men that were watching Swans</div><div id="00:04:32.120" class="transcript_line"> were really getting something quite special out of that experience.</div><div id="00:04:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Like an attempt to deconstruct the residual and gradual trauma of their lives with sound.</div><div id="00:04:46.120" class="transcript_line"> It was a psychically eventful evening it was beautiful.</div><div id="00:04:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes it was crammed. It was crammed.</div><div id="00:04:52.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think John was particularly happy though because like you know the band did almost sonically destroy his venue.</div><div id="00:05:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Which was hilarious.</div><div id="00:05:03.120" class="transcript_line"> That was probably 1987, 88 maybe.</div><div id="00:05:12.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s difficult to tell because all of those gigs that I went to see they kind of blur into one and I&#039;ve never been that interested in calendar dates and unlocking down on specific experiences</div><div id="00:05:27.120" class="transcript_line"> and remembering them in that fashion because I can&#039;t remember the day that it kind of happened or the night it happened.</div><div id="00:05:35.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still fresh in my mind almost as if I&#039;m still there you know.</div><div id="00:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember who supported them.</div><div id="00:05:43.120" class="transcript_line"> I cannot remember to this day who supported the Swans because I think I missed the support act because we tended to traditionally go to the</div><div id="00:05:53.120" class="transcript_line"> the riverside tavern and have a few pints there and of course like a few pints back then when you were below drinking age but looked older was a hell of a draw.</div><div id="00:06:08.120" class="transcript_line"> It was an act of rebellion to drink in that manner.</div><div id="00:06:13.120" class="transcript_line"> So my friend Austin and I would go over there and get tanked up and then pop over and check out the main act generally.</div><div id="00:06:20.120" class="transcript_line"> So I think we might have missed who supported Swans on that apocryphal night but they were amazing.</div></div></p>
