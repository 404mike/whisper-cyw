    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The year is 1933, the 10th of March. It is six weeks since the Nazis seized power in</div><div id="00:00:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Germany. Dr Michael Siegel, a Jewish lawyer in Munich and father of B Siegel, is going</div><div id="00:00:20.400" class="transcript_line"> about his business.</div><div id="00:00:23.200" class="transcript_line"> My father went to the police headquarters, I suppose, in order to lay a complaint on</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> behalf of one of his clients who had been arrested. When he got to the police headquarters,</div><div id="00:00:40.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody said to him, Dr Siegel, you&#039;re wanted in room number so and so, which happened to</div><div id="00:00:45.880" class="transcript_line"> be in the basement, and my father said, fine, I&#039;m in good time, I&#039;ll go there first. And</div><div id="00:00:50.080" class="transcript_line"> he got there, he saw that it was full of brown shirt thugs who proceeded to beat him up.</div><div id="00:00:58.160" class="transcript_line"> They knocked his teeth in and bust his eardrums. They then cut off his trouser legs and took</div><div id="00:01:05.720" class="transcript_line"> off his shoes and socks and hung a placard round his neck with the legend, I&#039;m a Jew</div><div id="00:01:14.040" class="transcript_line"> and I will never again complain to the police.</div><div id="00:01:22.920" class="transcript_line"> March 1938, Germany annexes Austria. A young Evelyn Kaye remembers the moment.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think what I remember most is that I&#039;ve hated the crowd ever since and I don&#039;t go near</div><div id="00:01:37.320" class="transcript_line"> the crowd and the marching of boots. It&#039;s everyone here marching now, still get uptight.</div><div id="00:01:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Between 1933 and 1939, 90,000 Jews fled from Central Europe to Britain. Men, women and children</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> targeted by the Nazis as racially inferior, forced to abandon their homes in Germany, Austria and</div><div id="00:02:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Czechoslovakia to seek refuge in the UK. Many of them found sanctuary in Wales, some briefly,</div><div id="00:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> others for the rest of their lives. In this podcast, we look at the connections between</div><div id="00:02:14.520" class="transcript_line"> the Holocaust and Wales. We listen to the stories of those who fled from Nazi tyranny</div><div id="00:02:20.200" class="transcript_line"> to build better lives for themselves and their families in Wales. We learn about their</div><div id="00:02:25.080" class="transcript_line"> contributions to Welsh life, culturally, economically and politically. And we hear</div><div id="00:02:31.080" class="transcript_line"> the testimony of Welsh people who bore witness to the barbarism of the Nazi regime.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The Holocaust can seem like a distant event that happened a long time ago in another place,</div><div id="00:02:42.920" class="transcript_line"> but it is a part of all of our history. It&#039;s a history that is more relevant now than ever,</div><div id="00:02:48.840" class="transcript_line"> with the rise of the far-right, anti-Semitism, racism and attacks on human rights becoming</div><div id="00:02:54.280" class="transcript_line"> more common in many countries. I&#039;m Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.</div><div id="00:03:02.280" class="transcript_line"> The podcast has been created as part of Holocaust Resources Wales, a project between the Centre for</div><div id="00:03:07.720" class="transcript_line"> the Movement of People at Aberystwyth University and the Jewish History Association of South Wales</div><div id="00:03:13.320" class="transcript_line"> and sponsored by the Association of Jewish Refugees. The voices you will hear are those</div><div id="00:03:19.320" class="transcript_line"> of survivors or their children, recorded as part of oral history interviews taken by the Centre</div><div id="00:03:25.080" class="transcript_line"> for the Movement of People, the Jewish History Association of South Wales and Imperial War Museums.</div><div id="00:03:31.320" class="transcript_line"> In this first episode, we look at Jewish life in Central Europe before the Second World War.</div><div id="00:03:37.400" class="transcript_line"> The stories we will hear are those of refugees who fled to Wales in the 1930s.</div><div id="00:03:43.240" class="transcript_line"> What were their lives like before they left? How did this change over the course of the decade?</div><div id="00:03:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And what was the spark, the writing on the wall, that prompted them to flee?</div><div id="00:03:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s start with the story of a young German Jewish boy. As a teenager, he will live in a</div><div id="00:04:03.240" class="transcript_line"> castle in North Wales. His name is Herman Rothman. Yes, I was born on the 2nd of September 1924</div><div id="00:04:12.760" class="transcript_line"> and I was born in Berlin. They sent me to a Jewish school and I had quite a distance to travel. I</div><div id="00:04:19.960" class="transcript_line"> traveled by train for about half an hour. It was what they call a Volksschule and it was a Jewish</div><div id="00:04:30.360" class="transcript_line"> one and we had a Hebrew education. I had a Hebrew education early date. I went to also to a sports</div><div id="00:04:37.800" class="transcript_line"> club called the Bakochpa. The Bakochpa was, apart from doing gymnastics in winter and in summer,</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> we did athletics. I liked it very much indeed because when you&#039;re good at something,</div><div id="00:04:53.640" class="transcript_line"> you like it more than anything else. Evelyn Kaye will attend boarding school in Belf Wells in</div><div id="00:05:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Poys. Her grandparents in Vienna ran a small theater. And the nursery put on the play</div><div id="00:05:09.480" class="transcript_line"> and I was a lily which had, my mother made me the dress and it had these leaves made out of</div><div id="00:05:14.840" class="transcript_line"> clay paper and it was quite sweet. It was a bit twee. There was the winter fairy and she had a</div><div id="00:05:21.640" class="transcript_line"> long tail and all the flowers were hidden under the tail and then she walked off stage. Each flower</div><div id="00:05:27.240" class="transcript_line"> got up and had a little yarn to say and unfortunately my, an anchored one who was much</div><div id="00:05:35.240" class="transcript_line"> older than I was, told me some naughty words to say and I couldn&#039;t remember the proper words.</div><div id="00:05:43.240" class="transcript_line"> So my grandfather wrote down the curtain rather quickly.</div><div id="00:05:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Renata Collins, whose name when she was born in 1933 in Prague was Renata Cress,</div><div id="00:05:55.080" class="transcript_line"> had parents from both Germany and Czechoslovakia.</div><div id="00:05:59.160" class="transcript_line"> She was later fostered by a couple in Porth in South Wales. Well of course my parents</div><div id="00:06:07.160" class="transcript_line"> weren&#039;t born in Czechoslovakia. My father was born in Germany because his father came to Prague</div><div id="00:06:15.320" class="transcript_line"> to work in the bank and my father followed in his footsteps and then my mother was born in Bohemia</div><div id="00:06:23.080" class="transcript_line"> and she has pictures which everybody asks me was she an actress but no because that&#039;s how they</div><div id="00:06:30.200" class="transcript_line"> dressed in Bohemia and I suppose now we look at people and they&#039;re dressed way out and we think</div><div id="00:06:35.640" class="transcript_line"> oh they&#039;re a bit Bohemian and so she was a theatre sister in the Prague Hospital Infirmary whatever</div><div id="00:06:44.440" class="transcript_line"> they called it. Des Goulton moved to Treforest near Ponta Pryd with his family in 1939.</div><div id="00:06:52.200" class="transcript_line"> He used to attend Jewish services with his grandparents in Zelina which is now part of</div><div id="00:06:57.640" class="transcript_line"> Slovakia. My grandfather and my maternal and my paternal grandparents were reasonably religious,</div><div id="00:07:06.360" class="transcript_line"> not all were religious but reasonably and they went every Saturday to the service and they took me</div><div id="00:07:15.960" class="transcript_line"> so I went there also and many of my friends, my school friends, my school colleagues</div><div id="00:07:25.480" class="transcript_line"> came also to the service. Others like Evelyn Kaye remember a secular non-religious Jewish life.</div><div id="00:07:35.400" class="transcript_line"> I lived in the Prater, the lower Paltstaff which was a Jewish district. My parents weren&#039;t</div><div id="00:07:41.720" class="transcript_line"> tably Jewish, they went kosher, they never went to synagogue and we didn&#039;t keep any of the festivals.</div><div id="00:07:48.200" class="transcript_line"> And funny enough that my father&#039;s sisters were very religious and one of them got a bit</div><div id="00:07:56.040" class="transcript_line"> apprehensive because I was being caught up in this very godless way.</div><div id="00:08:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Soon however these children became targeted because of their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis</div><div id="00:08:08.120" class="transcript_line"> seized power in Germany in 1933, open anti-Semitism became a state-sponsored policy.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s hear Bea Siegel who became Bea Green again. I think it was in my second year at</div><div id="00:08:24.200" class="transcript_line"> primary school, at the state primary school, that unlike the first year we had a teacher</div><div id="00:08:30.280" class="transcript_line"> whom I still remember she was called Freula and Felna and she was anti-Semitic. I didn&#039;t know what</div><div id="00:08:36.200" class="transcript_line"> it meant of course at the time but she said when I asked for, I think it was an exercise book,</div><div id="00:08:42.360" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t you Jew kids get your own exercise books? And I thought yes, I&#039;m sure we could. And I went</div><div id="00:08:48.280" class="transcript_line"> home to my mum and I said Freula and Felna thinks that we Jew kids could or should get our own</div><div id="00:08:54.360" class="transcript_line"> exercise books and it was only then when I noticed that my mother was angry that I thought well maybe</div><div id="00:09:01.240" class="transcript_line"> she shouldn&#039;t have said that. Bea was later evacuated twice to Wales during the war.</div><div id="00:09:08.280" class="transcript_line"> Laura Confino was also evacuated to Wales but lived in Frankfurt in Germany during the Nazi rise to</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> power. As far as I remember I enjoyed going to school and I had friends and it was all very nice</div><div id="00:09:24.200" class="transcript_line"> and at that time my mother was still alive and she and my form teacher were very good friends</div><div id="00:09:34.120" class="transcript_line"> because they were both very interested in books and so on and so it was a very nice atmosphere</div><div id="00:09:42.920" class="transcript_line"> but then as Hitler came into power things started to change and that is that the</div><div id="00:09:51.320" class="transcript_line"> teacher whose name was Herr Knauf I remember sort of absent it himself. He didn&#039;t gradually,</div><div id="00:10:00.760" class="transcript_line"> he didn&#039;t want to know my mother or my father anymore and at school itself every morning when</div><div id="00:10:09.320" class="transcript_line"> we turned up in class there was the picture of Hitler on the wall above the pulpit and we had</div><div id="00:10:16.760" class="transcript_line"> to stand there with outstretched arms and say hi Hitler and the atmosphere changed completely</div><div id="00:10:24.840" class="transcript_line"> and friends I had been sort of going to their houses and we were always together playing</div><div id="00:10:34.680" class="transcript_line"> and suddenly they didn&#039;t want to know me anymore and so obviously you found it very hard to</div><div id="00:10:42.920" class="transcript_line"> understand why should it happen that one day we were good friends and the next day they didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:10:49.720" class="transcript_line"> want to know anymore. The Nazis began arresting their political opponents and Jews and sending</div><div id="00:10:57.800" class="transcript_line"> them to detention centers known as concentration camps. These camps were outside the German legal</div><div id="00:11:04.360" class="transcript_line"> system meaning detainees could be held indefinitely. Hermann Rothman remembers his first encounter</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> with them after a family friend was arrested. We had friends who were of German extraction</div><div id="00:11:19.400" class="transcript_line"> but Jewish and they were very friendly. He was an architect and that on one occasion</div><div id="00:11:28.200" class="transcript_line"> the door opened and the woman came in and she cried and my parents asked her in and so on,</div><div id="00:11:37.800" class="transcript_line"> give her a drink and so on and what happened and she said they arrested her husband and they took</div><div id="00:11:45.560" class="transcript_line"> him to concentration camp. Now my parents consoled her and said well perhaps after a time they would</div><div id="00:11:57.160" class="transcript_line"> release them and everything will be all right and she left and then shortly afterwards then</div><div id="00:12:03.640" class="transcript_line"> it was another knock in the door and she was in absolute tears and she showed them a letter which</div><div id="00:12:10.520" class="transcript_line"> said if you from person in charge of the concentration camp saying it be informed you hereby that your</div><div id="00:12:16.600" class="transcript_line"> husband has had a heart attack and he died would you send us eight marks so that we can bury him</div><div id="00:12:23.080" class="transcript_line"> or commit him. That&#039;s the letter which she showed us and of course she was in tears and so there I</div><div id="00:12:32.040" class="transcript_line"> felt the first effect of death by the Nazis. The Nazis soon had designs beyond the German borders.</div><div id="00:12:41.720" class="transcript_line"> In 1938 they invaded Austria and proclaimed it a part of Germany. This was the Anschluss. Hans</div><div id="00:12:49.080" class="transcript_line"> Albrecht who later lived in Llandudno remembers soldiers walking past his house in Linz. Yeah I</div><div id="00:12:56.520" class="transcript_line"> passed past my house and I remember the wine list and women people raising their heads,</div><div id="00:13:02.840" class="transcript_line"> lifting their hands and throwing lots of flowers to the Nazis. And Mrs. Wine Lister,</div><div id="00:13:08.920" class="transcript_line"> a Nazi, she told that the lady who came to Walshcross, she said don&#039;t Walshcross with</div><div id="00:13:13.640" class="transcript_line"> dirty swine, the Jews. I remember that as well. In November 1938 the situation for German and</div><div id="00:13:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Austrian Jews worsened dramatically. A Polish Jew living in Paris, Herschel Grinspan,</div><div id="00:13:28.200" class="transcript_line"> assassinated a German official. In response a wave of violence was unleashed against the Reich&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:34.440" class="transcript_line"> Jewish population. Shops were smashed, synagogues burned down and 30,000 Jews were rounded up and</div><div id="00:13:42.440" class="transcript_line"> sent to concentration camps. The night of the 9th and 10th November became known as Kristallnacht,</div><div id="00:13:50.280" class="transcript_line"> the night of broken glass. Laura Confino. And then for me personally the climax came at Kristallnacht</div><div id="00:14:01.160" class="transcript_line"> which was the 10th of November 1938 when they came to us with long iron bars and my father stood at</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> the front door and he had pinned his iron crosses and his decorations on his lapel</div><div id="00:14:19.480" class="transcript_line"> and he thought that would show them that he had fought in the war and they would leave us alone.</div><div id="00:14:25.960" class="transcript_line"> But they pushed my grandparents and my father and myself, my brother had left by then to France,</div><div id="00:14:34.920" class="transcript_line"> into the kitchen and they started smashing up our home and obviously there was a lot of noise and</div><div id="00:14:44.600" class="transcript_line"> we were all frightened and my grandmother thought we were all going to be killed.</div><div id="00:14:49.960" class="transcript_line"> And then after they&#039;d finished what they wanted to do they left and suddenly it was all quiet</div><div id="00:14:58.920" class="transcript_line"> and we sort of came out of the kitchen and when I saw what our home looked like and it was all</div><div id="00:15:07.080" class="transcript_line"> cluttered up and smashed up and it looked awful and I remember I looked around and I said to my</div><div id="00:15:16.360" class="transcript_line"> father I&#039;m not going to stay here and I walked out and they tried to keep me back because they</div><div id="00:15:25.320" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t know what was going on in the street and so on but I just felt I can&#039;t stay here.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The pogrom took place all over the German Reich including Austria. Evelyn Kay and Hans Albrecht</div><div id="00:15:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Well I remember the boots again we lived on a second floor flat and the knocking on the door</div><div id="00:15:49.320" class="transcript_line"> and they took my father and then they marched up in the block of flats and they took other people</div><div id="00:15:55.480" class="transcript_line"> who never came back. Well I remember the Nazis came to my house to arrest my father</div><div id="00:16:02.680" class="transcript_line"> and when they came to my house I said to my mother are the wicked people here again</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and they took all the jewelry out of her house. Julius Weill who later moved to Merthyr Tidful</div><div id="00:16:14.120" class="transcript_line"> had celebrated his Bar Mitzvah to synagogue in Cologne just two weeks earlier. It was the last</div><div id="00:16:20.440" class="transcript_line"> Bar Mitzvah to take place at the synagogue before it was destroyed. Well I wasn&#039;t out and about when</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> it happened but all the sort of Jewish businesses in Cologne were smashed up, windows broken,</div><div id="00:16:40.760" class="transcript_line"> more or less closed down. My synagogue, well all the synagogues were trashed, burned and smashed up.</div><div id="00:16:55.320" class="transcript_line"> The school I went to which was sort of attached to one of the synagogues was also completely destroyed.</div><div id="00:17:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Herman Rothman&#039;s family had been hiding with a relative on the outskirts of Berlin on the night of the pogrom.</div><div id="00:17:14.040" class="transcript_line"> We came back and we went we traveled to Berlin and we saw the havoc which was made of Jewish</div><div id="00:17:22.120" class="transcript_line"> properties. We saw the shops being the glass destroyed, everything looted from these from</div><div id="00:17:30.520" class="transcript_line"> the shops and so on. It was a dreadful sight for a child, I was a child really, to see all this</div><div id="00:17:38.440" class="transcript_line"> and to observe it. In a bid to humiliate them further the Nazis made Jews clean up the mess.</div><div id="00:17:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Evelyn Kay. My mother who never learned any sense, the Nazis got rid of the Jews you know when they</div><div id="00:17:56.600" class="transcript_line"> were scrubbing the streets with toothbrushes and tried to pull her away and she wouldn&#039;t come</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> so they got her out of her to scrub and all these people were then deported to a concentration camp.</div><div id="00:18:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Terrified Jews began fleeing the German Reich. Kristallnacht was the clearest indication yet</div><div id="00:18:19.160" class="transcript_line"> that Jews were no longer safe in Germany or Austria. Soon Jews in Czechoslovakia were also</div><div id="00:18:26.360" class="transcript_line"> under threat. The Munich Agreement in September 1938 had handed the Sudetenland in the northwest</div><div id="00:18:33.400" class="transcript_line"> of the country over to Germany. In March 1939 the Wehrmacht marched into Prague.</div><div id="00:18:41.080" class="transcript_line"> The Nazis now controlled the whole of Czechoslovakia.</div><div id="00:18:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Des Goulton.</div><div id="00:18:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Few days later the Germans actually marched in and I could see the columns of the Germans</div><div id="00:18:56.360" class="transcript_line"> marching into Prague and there was where we are living a boarding on a wall and there were various</div><div id="00:19:07.720" class="transcript_line"> posters placed there and the Germans used to use it to write posters and I remember that they</div><div id="00:19:19.720" class="transcript_line"> used the Czech language but it was particularly badly written so I think they went out of the way</div><div id="00:19:29.320" class="transcript_line"> to humiliate the Czech people by writing Czech notices in a bad language because there was no</div><div id="00:19:38.600" class="transcript_line"> shortage of people who could have written it in a perfect Czech. Less than six months after the</div><div id="00:19:45.720" class="transcript_line"> invasion of Prague, Europe was in flames. Once the Second World War began, escape from the German</div><div id="00:19:53.080" class="transcript_line"> Reich became almost impossible. Jewish communities were trapped with little hope of rescue.</div><div id="00:20:01.240" class="transcript_line"> The voices you have heard in this episode were able to flee to Britain and to Wales before this</div><div id="00:20:07.240" class="transcript_line"> happened. In the next episode we discover how these refugees managed to get out of Nazi-occupied</div><div id="00:20:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Europe and what their journey was like.</div><div id="00:20:21.080" class="transcript_line"> Until next time, thanks for listening.</div></div></p>
