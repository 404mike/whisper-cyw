My date of birth is 1st of August 1956.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Bilkis Akhtar Chauhan and I was born on 1st of August 1956.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your first memory of you growing up?</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> In Pakistan we were five brothers and three sisters.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> My main memory is the place we lived, the village. There was no running water.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to the river. It was one of the five rivers by our house.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to the river to fetch water.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you?</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We were five, six, seven. We used to go in the evening because ladies were not allowed to go during the day.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to go with our mothers in the evening.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> What are the types of games you remember playing or enjoyed?</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to play with a ball. It was a game called Shatapu.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what you call it in English.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was our neighbor&#039;s house. They had a big garden there. So we used to play there.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It goes off every Monday at this time because it&#039;s their routine.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to play in the streets.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you play different types of games?</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Not that much because the girls...</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Again?</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell us about the type of things you would do when you were playing in the streets.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I remember. We used to have a PE in school.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> School wasn&#039;t very far from our house.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I liked going to school. Maths was my favorite subject.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We played with the cousins mostly because we were all in the street or relatives used to live.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So we played with the cousins.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What celebrations or traditions do you remember sharing with families and your cousins and everyone that was around you?</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We have two Eids in a year. So Eid was a special time.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Men used to go to read Eid Namaz in the mosque.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Ladies stayed at home. We cooked in the morning. My mom did.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> My nanny, my grandmother used to come and help.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> When our dad comes back from Eid Namaz, he used to bring balloons.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He gave us money for Eid.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we used to go to a sort of Eid Mela.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Over there there were swings and stalls, different types of stalls and swings.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to enjoy that.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The second Eid is the Qurbani, when they sacrifice a lamb.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was a good time as well.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is it important to still have these traditions and celebrations?</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we&#039;re Muslims and that Qurbani is one of the...</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> In religion, we fast for a month, then we celebrate with the Eid.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So all the family gets together and we have a celebration then.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, growing up, what would you say is your favorite memory?</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Going to school or going to my khalas&#039; house and play with my cousins.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to have a swing on the big tree and we used to swing on that.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Play there.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So then just to flip it on the other side, what do you think about the childhood here in the UK versus Pakistan?</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What the childhood for my children.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You can look at your children as an example.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s totally different, because over there we didn&#039;t have that many toys, didn&#039;t have that many facilities.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s more here. In a way it was better, communication wise it was better there.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But over here, financially you are better off and you have more toys and more things to play with.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then traveling to the UK, what made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t decide to come.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married. My father passed away.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And in Muslims we do get married without cousins.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got married to my cousin.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They came to this country in 1966.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt and my husband, they went back when my father passed away.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So they asked for my marriage and then we got married.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I came after a year then.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So then you came in 1967.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> 1960. No, no. My husband&#039;s family was here from 1966.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And my dad passed away in 1973.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So what were your expectations of the UK or life in the UK?</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was too young to know what I want or what&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married and came down.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was my family then.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my uncle and auntie and their children.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I came as a doctor-in-law.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So over there when you get married and you go into the family,</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> so the daughter-in-law&#039;s responsibilities are to look after the house,</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> the cooking, the cleaning.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you?</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I found very... I was 18 when I came.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I came in June and I was 18 in August.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry, what were you about to say which you found very...</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It was difficult, very, very difficult at the time.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Leaving your family there.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And you don&#039;t know many people apart from my cousins,</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> but they were over here since 1965.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I only seen them when I was about six or seven.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was very, very difficult.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> What can you say is the most important thing that you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And how did you feel about it?</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The family, leaving behind the family.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, family mostly.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And culture, over here there was no...</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Like nowadays there&#039;s television, there&#039;s more communication.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But back then it was only half an hour program on the telly, weekly.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Which we used to watch and used to look forward to that program in the morning.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Or there was a mosque there and we used to go to mosque to read Jumma Namaz.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from that I was in the house most of the time.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you get to the UK or how did you travel to the UK?</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I came by myself because I got married in 1973.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had my visa in 1974.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I travelled by myself.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> By plane?</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> By plane, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> What could you say was the best or the worst thing about that journey?</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Best thing was I was excited to come here as well.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> As you know I was upset to leave my family.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was excited to come because my husband did go once again.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Like when I got married he went there.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after that about seven, eight months he went back again.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t have the visa at the time so I couldn&#039;t come back with him.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So I came back about three, four months later.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was excited to come here.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because England was England.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So when did you arrive in Newport?</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I lived in London for ten years because my in-laws are in London.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I came to my in-laws house.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed there for ten years.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t stay with my mother in their family house.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Back then, I don&#039;t know if you can do it now or not,</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> back then you used to apply for council flats.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of us applied for council flats.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Which we got after about two years, year and a half.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So we moved there.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed there about three years.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we bought our own house.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And we moved there.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And by then I had a daughter.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So is this in Newport then?</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it&#039;s still in London.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So then yeah, when did you?</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> 1986 I moved to Wales.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I came in 1974 to London.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved here in 1986.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you recall about the first few days and few months that you were in Newport?</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It was nice because we wanted to buy a business.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband had a leather factory, making leather garments in London.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband and his dad and brothers, they were all in partners.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But the business went down so we were looking for a business.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We went up north first.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> On the way back, my husband&#039;s friend was living in Newport.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So we came to see him.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And my husband liked the place and said we&#039;ll move here.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So we bought a house here first and then we found a business.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> What other challenges can you say that you face to really establish yourself in Newport?</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Mostly with my children because we moved to Cleon.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Moved in Cleon.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> My daughter was 11 and the younger daughter was three and a half.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The younger daughter settled in okay, but the eldest one, she had problems in school.</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Racism.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was only three children in the whole of the school at that time.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So she didn&#039;t settle properly here.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t like it much.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But the younger one settled okay.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Used to bring them to mosque for religious reading.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Did any of your friends or family join you in the UK?</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I came to my in-laws house.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> None of my family came here.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Even after, even when you...</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They came when my daughter got married recently.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that like as well and how do you feel about your children coming to mosque with you and learning about the traditions?</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important to know your roots and your religion.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to take them to mosque to read Quran and to read Namaz.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Culture wise I missed a lot here because in London there was a bit more than in Newport.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> When we were in the Asian area, so there was more things done in cultural wise.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But in Newport at that time it wasn&#039;t that much.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then again we bought the business and busy as well.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you love the most about your culture?</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Most is getting together.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Getting together on occasions.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So then you spoke about this a little bit.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What parts of the culture have you made to make sure that, to preserve and to keep?</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether that be the traditions or the customs or the language, food or the festivals.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I think both religious wise I have taken my daughters to mosques to read the Quran.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Culturally we dress up in our traditional dresses whenever we go to see our own families.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially on Eid we get together and have our own food.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> If you say special food on Eid.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you studied here as well?</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> What about work and jobs?</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> In London I helped. I knew sewing a bit when I was in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> In school we learned sewing.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> At home we used to do embroidery and I learned it from my mom.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came here my husband and their family was in leather business.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a sewing machine at home.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I made the lining of the jackets.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I started sewing.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I made lining for our own factory.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I worked for other factories but still at home.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Working from home.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Made skirts, blouses, bright made dresses.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve done sewing for at least 10 years.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re still doing it.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, still doing it now.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe how you became a part of or involved in Age of Life?</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Age of Life. We had a shop as I said.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We were looking for a business that&#039;s why we moved here.</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a convenience store.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We had it for 7 years.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we had a break for 2 years.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we were hoping to sell it but couldn&#039;t sell it at the time.</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had that business back and we went in for another 8 years.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> After that my health wasn&#039;t that great.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And my husband had a bypass as well.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So we decided to sell the business.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So we sold the business.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> As I said my health wasn&#039;t that great so I couldn&#039;t work for anybody else.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d done voluntary work for a couple of years.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And by then I met a few people along the way.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I came to Age of Life.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Age of Life has given me a lot in a way.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I
