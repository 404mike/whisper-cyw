    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel before you popped the question?</div><div id="00:00:03.500" class="transcript_line"> Very nervous.</div><div id="00:00:04.500" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:00:05.500" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I just did.</div><div id="00:00:07.500" class="transcript_line"> Just, it&#039;s not something you do every day, is it?</div><div id="00:00:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Were you frightened and were saying no and then you&#039;re destroying the friendship?</div><div id="00:00:17.500" class="transcript_line"> Um, well I was worried because I thought, well how would you both feel if she was to</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> say no?</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;re living in the same place?</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re all, yeah as you say, we&#039;re all together sort of thing and you&#039;d always be</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> thinking, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But as things happened, I didn&#039;t have to worry about that for long.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s only after that was when you had to marry me.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel when you hear them say the word?</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was shocked, I was.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I, I, I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d ever be in that situation again.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Never.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I hoped, but like I say, I was happy, it was sort of like a happy sad because as I said</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t think we&#039;d ever actually get there.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, the proposal came, but then you&#039;re thinking how are we going to get around all</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> the red tape that comes with it?</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you leave him waiting?</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think I did, did I?</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I keep having more of a little bit of heartburn than I was.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, it was only two or three minutes, but when you&#039;re waiting for an answer, two</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> or three minutes seems a long time.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the kitchen staff came in with the dessert in there and they crept round the</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> door because they knew he was reposing, they all kept knocking and they looked at Steve</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> and they said, well did she say yes?</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He said yes and then Chris from the kitchen came in and he brought in a bottle of champagne</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and popped that so that would rub it in.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got pictures of that as well, the way the table was done, really nice.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about this red tape.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just the meetings and the meetings and the meetings and would you be better off</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> in the community and we didn&#039;t ever think that we would get two rooms like we&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> now and then that went on for what, three years?</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it almost got to a stage where all we seemed to be doing was repeating ourselves</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> each time we went, nothing really was moving.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing was resolved, it was like come to this meeting and you&#039;ll get an answer today</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> but we didn&#039;t get an answer, we didn&#039;t get a concrete answer, not ever.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So was it just insurance purposes or something else?</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know, we&#039;ll never know that.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not 100% sure really.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you move in together after you were married or before you were married?</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well we moved in together only just a few weeks just before because obviously it would have been</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> more awkward afterwards.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved in here in the June and then we got married in the October but that was only because</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> we took the biggest gamble of our lives and we said right okay we&#039;re just going to do it regardless.</div></div></p>
