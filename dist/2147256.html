    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Castellano is from South America. I come from South America.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a Latina.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Ok, so who is it I&#039;m asking? Just for the introduction, if you&#039;re happy to say your name, your date of birth and where you were born, if you can say that in English and also in Castaneda?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but you say Spanish if you want to.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Castellano. I know there&#039;s a lot of people.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I say Castellano sounds much easier than Spanish.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Castellano. We say Castellano because you pronounce the double L.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Ok, Liano.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Liano. Because here they pronounce the double L as one and they say Castellano.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But because Castellano is another word, so we say Castellano. The pronunciation is important.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you can change the meaning, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly. It&#039;s the same as, I cannot pronounce, like the sheep and the sheep, which is the big boat and the little animal.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to, I had to get it. You know. I mean Spanish is easier because you say Oveja y el barco.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Ok, so ship and the sheep.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And the sheep, the sheep and the sheep. And then they say, oh I don&#039;t know, you know the big, big sheep.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Big sheep, big whatever.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what. Ok, so please, can you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you want to have my name as the married name or the single name?</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s entirely up to you. It&#039;s entirely up to you.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah? Well, it&#039;s now because I&#039;m married, so I will say that&#039;s Victoria Salas Senese.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born on the 26th of August 1947 in a place called Villazon, which is in Bolivia, South America.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, do you want me to say in Spanish?</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Sure.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So we can just talk about you growing up in Bolivia, of course. Do you remember the area that you grew up in?</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. It&#039;s called Villazon.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in the 25th of May, that was the street where I lived. I was very close to my school, where we used to walk to school.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember very much. I do go at least every year I go back to my country because I miss it.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I miss my people. Yes.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was that experience like being able to grow up there and walk to school as well?</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Very happy. I grew up in a very happy home, a very loving home. My mother was a workaholic and she brought up five children.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She worked very hard for all of us. All my sisters became professionals and all.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I married to Jan. So I was 17 when I arrived to this country. And I came in 1965 when I arrived here.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I remember my childhood very, very happy. Completely happy. I have no regrets. And I miss it all. My family. We were very united family and friends.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do miss it. It&#039;s a saying that I have and I said, but I left Bolivia. But Bolivia hasn&#039;t left me. So I&#039;m always coming back to it.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there a particular memory or memory you can share with us on growing up?</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up in the memory, the happiest is playing with my friends in the street. And I always remember that.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They were allowed, but in the quiet when parents were busy, we used to sneak out and just the neighborhood, the children.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to be a place, they used to be a San Juan they call. They used to burn wood outside in the streets.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to go and jump all the fires with the children. We used to be, and this was the most memorable. I was really very happy.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And was there other kind of games that you can remember as well?</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the scotch, what they call it, jumping on there. We used to flatten the tops of lemonade and all the little ones.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to take up to the station and we used to put them on the line. So when they&#039;re drinking, we used to flatten them.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to make holes in it and then we used to make it for playing. And like a band, we had our own little band of things like that we used to make.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s incredible. That&#039;s quite clever as well actually, knowing that the train had gone through and then innovating and making it.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to put them and say, how can you flatten this up? It takes ages with a hammer.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said to them, what does it take them to the left? Because the train used to pass halfway because we live in the front there with Argentina.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So the train used to pass and it had to stop. So of course we used to run and then put it all of a sudden underneath it.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Loads of them. When the train started, we used to watch, you know, they don&#039;t jump out. But because the train starts slowly, slowly, slowly.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So when the time it passes, they were all flattened. So we used to make the holes and put the strings in and play with it.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Always to put it in our face and pretend that we were Indians and then we used to dance. They were really brilliant as my childhood.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if it&#039;s about dancing, is there a certain event as well that you remember going as a family or as a group of friends?</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did. When I was in school, I used to pick a lot. I was being represented in a lot of things.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was very clever in my school that when it came to the end of the year, they used to put a big table at the entrance of the school.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to put all my work there for the parents to see. Because I was very careful in writing.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to do drawing and all. And they used to put as an example of what we&#039;d done. And they did that.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from, because we started from school, we have over there six years, school six years, college before you can pick to go to university.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like here, inside the college, university. Over there you had to do the school, college, and then you pick for university.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So six years. So I would say, I mean, but now at my age, I could say, yes, I was clever because I jumped from the fifth of the school.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I jumped into college. I didn&#039;t do the sixth. I just jumped straight in. Like some, they have to repeat the class. I jumped.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, that was very, I can tell now, I am very observant and very attentive. I am very eager to learn. I love learning.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that comes from when I was little because my mom said that when I was three years old, I used to read the newspaper.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, I do many things. I said, God maybe hasn&#039;t given me that intelligence to be a professor or have a degree or masters, but he has given me a lot of talent in my hands.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You name it, I do it. There is, my husband would be in the cabinet, I learned from him. I painted and decorated when I came to live here. That was my official, painted and decorated.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I done curtains. I do anything. Do you want me to do it? I do it. I paint pictures. You know, and then over there when I was small, I used to, they used to call me the princess of the poetry.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And every Thursdays I used to be on the radio doing my poetry. And I was having a show off the way I used to do my poetry. I like to put everything into it.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I used to go to the frontier, there is a bridge like that, to go from Bolivia to Argentina. The gendarmes, which are in Argentina, they recognize me. And they used to say, here comes the princess of the poetry.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And was there also like traditional, was there also traditional events?</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I played football for college over there. I have played football. We went to different colleges to play and we used to win.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did have a lot of photographs, but because I moved so much in here when I arrived, that I lost some of them.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But then when I was 14 over there, I was elected beauty queen of my country. And that was the first, the year. And then I done it for two years. They had it one year after the other.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I went to Argentina then, I passed to Argentina in Buenos Aires. I went to study there.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And also there, they asked me if I could represent, there was the river plate, the club river plate in Argentina to represent them. So I had to go again.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to be a nun. I love God so much. I wanted to be a nun. But my parents won&#039;t. So they accepted the first time when they went to my house to ask him, ask him to say, because they elect you.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t go and say, oh I want to represent, I want to be, no, they elect you. They look at you and they elect you.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And they went and asked my parents if I can take part in this event, which they accepted. I didn&#039;t want to because when I had to put on my costume I was walking like this.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t want to. But then after that I thought, oh well, I competed with my teacher and I won.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She was older than me. I mean she had the body of a woman. But at that time I looked older. And yes, I won. And I passed them all.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So lucky. And then the next year they asked me again. And then as I said, when I went to Argentina, they asked me, they asked me directly, they didn&#039;t ask my parents, they asked me directly if I would like to represent the river plate, the club river plate.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I got photographs, you know, I got photo stuff there to show that I was. And they put me in this big car, things that we had to, they drove all the way to the stadium.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So you have to go, you know, wave in and all that. Then you got the people who elected. They don&#039;t elect you. At the door you have to buy a ticket, a number.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And you say, I want to, you said I want to for Victoria. And then the people that come in, that&#039;s what they do. So at the end of the day, you go to the night to go to the dance.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And in there then you all sit down because nobody knows anything. And then they started taking how many tickets they sold for how many. And I won.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I won again. So I had the walls with my dad. It was lovely. That&#039;s memorable things.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then as I said, when I went to Buenos Aires and River Plate and we went to do this thing around and everything, they did the same.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they started, they all sit down. They called the name in third place and so and so and second place and so and so. And then Cammy says in the first place say Victoria Salas.</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m, oh, again. But this time I was just, you know.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Comforting, right?</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> More comforting. And I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I had all that. And then I&#039;ve been elected and so many things. And here, when we arrived here, I&#039;ve been on television, salsa dancing.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been a teacher of salsa dancing in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And you said you came here 17.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was 17. It was 1965 when I came here.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah. And because I married to an officer of a ship.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a first officer of a ship in Buenos Aires.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I married him. Came here straight to Newport.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I arrived on a plane. I came on a plane after.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And we lived in Malpass Road for a while.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But our relationship, it wasn&#039;t as good as.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t get on.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We were black and white. You know, there was no gray.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing in between to compromise or to try to get together.</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> No. It&#039;s either this or it&#039;s either that.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And me, coming from a happy home, you know, I&#039;m a very happy person.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very positive. And I was thinking, you know, this is not for me.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t. So I sit down and said, look, this is not working.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And bear in mind, I had two children.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was married at 17. I got at 18, 19, 20.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> At 22, I had my second child.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And at 22, about 23, 24, 25, 26, I was divorced.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I couldn&#039;t take my children because they had no family here to take them.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Or nothing.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to live on my own.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Find a place to live.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I started working.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And learning and working.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I came okay.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I did okay. I had my ups and downs.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always think of God.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I think He has given me the two sides of the coin.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I came from a good home.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Which we had maids.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We had nothing to do.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I arrived here, which I had to do it.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, because, and it&#039;s like saying, once you become a mother, you stop being a woman.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to dedicate to my children.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, everything for my children.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to go to work.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We stopped working in the evenings.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t need to, but I had to do something.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;m not a person to sit.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to do something.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after I had to leave my children with him.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Until I got to, we went to court.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well I want my children.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They won&#039;t have them because I had nowhere to take them.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to rent a room in Mendy.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I just dedicated to work.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> As I&#039;m a hairdresser as well.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> A professional hairdresser.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my diploma because I learned that over there.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I told you, I&#039;m a woman of many, many talents.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had that.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I started working in the day as a hairdresser.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> In Mendy.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I used to work in the night club as a barmaid.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I started working when night clubs up here.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to work there as well.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In the evenings I used to go out and work.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So I just worked and then I needed to learn.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I started learning more.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I never went to school to learn English.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I learned on my own.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But just asking people, please could you correct me.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m not sure if I am saying okay.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, if anybody would say anything to me.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh don&#039;t offend.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m not getting offended.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m grateful that you corrected me.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> As long as you correct me the right way, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I came out.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I met my second husband now, Italian.</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re 42 years married now.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have one child.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know he&#039;s 40 now.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He lives next door to me.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he said, mommy says I love you so much.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He said I&#039;ll marry you and I&#039;ll never leave you.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to him, I know because I said you didn&#039;t want to.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t marry me.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> He said you didn&#039;t love me because he lives next door.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He lives next door to me.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, life has been good.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Near port, Wales have treated me with respect.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And maybe in a way it&#039;s because I talk to anybody.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband said you talk even to the birds.</div><div id="00:16:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean when I&#039;m passing by as in pigeons.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I said excuse me ladies.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband said you talk to anybody.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I said I don&#039;t want to talk to you because you&#039;re going to be okay.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said yeah, I said I have to.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I didn&#039;t have no guidance of anybody.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I have nobody to tell me I&#039;m doing right.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So I lived my life if you like.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The best I could.</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when the pandemic came and we had to be locked.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I started reading the Bible.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And it changed me.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it changed me.</div><div id="00:17:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Made me understood a lot of things that I wanted to know.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t question God because he knows what he&#039;s doing.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But I needed to know because I think God, you have given me a talent.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But you haven&#039;t given me the place to try to work it out.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know?</div><div id="00:17:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Where my life has to be.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, it has changed.</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a good life.</div><div id="00:17:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean I&#039;m a decent person.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I am not one of those.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I never smoke or drink, go to night clubs.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Never got the attention to be anything like that.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the way we&#039;ve been brought up.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m a mother.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to respect myself.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t want anybody to see my children.</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh your mother, this is why your mother that.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I brought my children.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m proud to say my children are good children too.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m happy that you said it about learning.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Like wanting to learn.</div><div id="00:18:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And how all of your experiences were giving you.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Giving you like these moments to be able to learn something.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then apply it if you wanted to as well.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you have to take time to grow in the way that you needed to.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And even, you mentioned earlier on about,</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask whether it&#039;s from your mother in being at work.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Knowing that you need to work and regardless.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And how you ended up putting that for yourself.</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Ready for the children as well.</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like they say, and what I learned from my mother is.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You cannot teach your children.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Your children would learn by seeing you.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We are the example to our children.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So what I saw my mother.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She was a great colleague she was.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And she done everything to keep us good.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean I couldn&#039;t really say.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t have wished my mother was with me.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And do things together with it.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> When she didn&#039;t work she dedicated her time to us.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to be a wonderful cook and making cakes and all that.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I learned everything from her.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Which idols, idols I usually like.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I bake.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I do cakes.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I sell.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandchildren won&#039;t have from anywhere else cakes.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to make them.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Life has been good to me.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is that important as well.</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> To just be an example.</div><div id="00:19:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And you just said a little bit about the children and the next generation just learn.</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But why do you think that&#039;s very important.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And why we should be carrying that on in terms of tradition.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So young people can learn.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I think it&#039;s important to have a good example.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s what I learned from my mother.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s what I learned from my mother.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s what I learned from my mother.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s what I learned from my mother.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s what I learned from my mother.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But my understanding is because to be a better person.</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> To be a good person.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I teach them to respect.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Regardless the gender, color, religion, whatever.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Regardless the gender, color, religion, whatever.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I always teach my children to respect.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You want to be respected.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to respect.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know you cannot buy respect.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Respect has to be how you treat people.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Respect has to be how you treat people.</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always say to them they have to work.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always say to them they have to work.</div><div id="00:20:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They have to be good people.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to help.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Who needs help?</div><div id="00:20:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know you have to because this is me.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I cannot see anybody.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to be there.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You know and I think can I help you?</div><div id="00:20:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You want anything?</div><div id="00:20:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My neighbors they are ill.</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m there.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You want to be good shop?</div><div id="00:20:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You know it&#039;s always thinking this is what God wants us to do.</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I learned that and I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m not doing it for me.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not doing it really for them because that&#039;s what he wants.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s like you say you&#039;re doing this to this person.</div><div id="00:20:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re doing it to me.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m hurting Jesus.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I cannot do that.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You know it&#039;s not in my hands.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes and I teach my children.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thank God that they are very good.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> My kids they haven&#039;t been involved in anything.</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Police or drugs or anything like that.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I know they don&#039;t drink excessively.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t smoke any of them.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s because what they see at home.</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:21:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to read this here as an example.</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And speak about example as well.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have an expectation of what Newport was going to be like?</div><div id="00:21:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Before you moved here?</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well when I arrived it broke my heart to leave my family and my country.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was excited because I was young and it was an adventure for me.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Something different.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Something new.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When I arrived in London they picked me up and they brought me.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they took me.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband was living in Lamberne.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And they took me there.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t realize how narrow the things had to go.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the car was going I was like this.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was still laughing.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He was going and I was like oh he&#039;s going to go through that tree and all.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when we arrived to the house I realized how little the doors are.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Because back home we have double doors.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Wherever we have.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You go to the light room and you have double doors.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And my bedroom was massive back home.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I had my bed.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I had all my stuff that I used to make.</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I come in here and I thought this is doll&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And people live in doll&#039;s houses in here.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And the snow was up there when I arrived.</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was expecting my first child.</div><div id="00:22:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was expecting when I arrived like that.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But I arrived in October and in November the 9th my child was born.</div><div id="00:22:52.000" class="transcript_line"> In Lydia Baynon.</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was called.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what they are now.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not hospital Lydia Baynon in Ask.</div><div id="00:23:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah he was born there.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And because the snow was so far.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they put me into this room and I see the snow in there.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just started crying.</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I had never seen snow before.</div><div id="00:23:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought she was so beautiful.</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then all the squirrels were coming down.</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt like Alice in Wonderland.</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought so beautiful.</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think how so different countries.</div><div id="00:23:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They have so many different things.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when I started getting deeper into learning more about things.</div><div id="00:23:32.000" class="transcript_line"> About the Vikings.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> How the Dachshund has come to be.</div><div id="00:23:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is English people which they are not pure.</div><div id="00:23:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they come in from what they call the Anglo-Saxons.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And things like that.</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I started getting into history.</div><div id="00:23:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I love it.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I love it.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to my husband when I watch it tell you.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;m not watching to entertain me.</div><div id="00:23:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m watching to learn.</div><div id="00:23:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you gather friends as well actually.</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> In your experiences.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it was wanting to learn or the things that you watch.</div><div id="00:24:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The places that you go.</div><div id="00:24:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you able to start building friends.</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes I have.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I came in a new port.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was learning only Latin.</div><div id="00:24:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because nobody here speaks Spanish or anything like that.</div><div id="00:24:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I said I couldn&#039;t speak much English myself.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I had to learn.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes I met one girl.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody told me that it was a Colombian girl.</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I met her.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And we embraced and we cried.</div><div id="00:24:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she also thought she was the only one.</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So she lived in Malpas.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were not far away from each other.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes we got together.</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from then on.</div><div id="00:24:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Then she started doing other things.</div><div id="00:24:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When she met other Latins.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When she introduced me to them.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I met more Latins.</div><div id="00:24:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I introduced them.</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the end we had.</div><div id="00:24:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We had what you call it.</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Isla Latina.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you ever hear it.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What is the other place where they all go.</div><div id="00:25:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Eaton Road.</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to Eaton Road.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a place there.</div><div id="00:25:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to do parties.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to gather there together.</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes and the council.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to give us.</div><div id="00:25:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Pay for us all the stuff that we used to do it.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes that&#039;s where we came to be.</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we started learning from each other&#039;s cultures.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> With Colombia.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Argentina.</div><div id="00:25:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It was only Bolivia but it were El Salvador.</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There were different countries.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we used to gather together.</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And say each of you can we take a plate of your own country.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to put everybody will take something and put at the table.</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Also then we used to eat.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes it was really nice.</div><div id="00:25:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes and that&#039;s like that&#039;s that culture and like preservation as well.</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good way fantastic way to share culture and to carry it moving.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there other ways that you were able to do that as well.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely for your children or other communities.</div><div id="00:26:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes when I came when I came when I didn&#039;t brought anything with me.</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only late when I started going back to my country.</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I started bringing little ornaments of my country.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know I got ornaments.</div><div id="00:26:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes I do have some and I introduced it to them.</div><div id="00:26:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Even ornaments from Argentina because we lived near frontier.</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes I brought it.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They call it a caucho.</div><div id="00:26:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like the Americans they have the cowboys.</div><div id="00:26:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The Argentinians have the cauchos.</div><div id="00:26:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Which they get the cows you know in the countryside.</div><div id="00:26:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s such a site is beautiful site that is.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The way they dressed and everything.</div><div id="00:26:46.000"

And I talked to my children about my culture my country.</div><div id="00:26:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You know about the Incas.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You know because that&#039;s what it comes from the Incas.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said my mother used to speak Quechua.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to speak Aymara.</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Which the Aymara is there actually before of the Incas.</div><div id="00:27:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the Incas came there was the Quechua introduced.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is the original as Welsh will have the Welsh language.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother used to speak French, Spanish, Quechua.</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So she was quite clever as well.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s you know learned from her.</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes that&#039;s what I do to my kids.</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Incredible.</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They have to know they have to know your roots.</div><div id="00:27:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always said to my husband I&#039;m not going to die in this country.</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to go back. I want to go back.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But now that I went back last February.</div><div id="00:27:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I was disappointed because everything has changed.</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s so much. Everything has been closed.</div><div id="00:27:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Families and friends they passed.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like to say they died because we don&#039;t really die.</div><div id="00:27:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We transcend it. We go to another level.</div><div id="00:27:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always said we you know they all gone.</div><div id="00:28:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the same anymore.</div><div id="00:28:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And this year I didn&#039;t because I should have been there now.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I should have been there for a month, month, two months ago.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But I should have been there.</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But then my poor husband I leave it always on his own for a long time.</div><div id="00:28:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I said I promised him not to go.</div><div id="00:28:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said you say that every year.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no. Every year I said I will not go next year.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I never promised.</div><div id="00:28:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said you know my promises. I never break them.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said I promise.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if I&#039;m itching to go.</div><div id="00:28:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think I should be there.</div><div id="00:28:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said no I promise.</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not going.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But I do get contacted with friends through the internet.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know through Facebook.</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we see through the camera each other.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it&#039;s a marvelous invention.</div><div id="00:28:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Truly.</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I still get contacted with them.</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And my family and my friends.</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to the last time I went I told one of my friends I found her.</div><div id="00:28:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said I was coming over.</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said when you arrive in.</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told her.</div><div id="00:29:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said come over.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said I will wait for you.</div><div id="00:29:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did. And I didn&#039;t know that she passed on.</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were quite a few.</div><div id="00:29:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We started from kinder to school to college.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They were there.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> All grown up.</div><div id="00:29:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We all embraced and cried.</div><div id="00:29:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And no you don&#039;t remember this and remember that.</div><div id="00:29:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It was also a little brilliant.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant brilliant.</div><div id="00:29:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know I got such a good memories.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Happy memories.</div><div id="00:29:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something that you&#039;re not there.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not going to repeat it.</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s all here.</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all there.</div><div id="00:29:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then goes into your heart.</div><div id="00:29:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And so loving and thinking you know how lucky I have been really.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> To have such a good friends.</div><div id="00:29:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And my family.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that experience and how important it is to just have gratitude.</div><div id="00:29:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And to have them.</div><div id="00:30:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And to be able to share it with others that have had experience and bring it together.</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I wanted to just speak about Age Alive.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that here?</div><div id="00:30:09.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you end up coming in contact with Age Alive?</div><div id="00:30:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only just now that I&#039;m beginning to try to get into them.</div><div id="00:30:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s not very long that I joined them.</div><div id="00:30:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I said I am a person that I don&#039;t like.</div><div id="00:30:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like discrimination.</div><div id="00:30:30.000" class="transcript_line"> As I said to you that regardless of whatever respect has to be.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> As I said you could be a master in whatever.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You had your diplomas and you had this and you got that.</div><div id="00:30:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re ignorant in respect.</div><div id="00:30:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You know you could be yes I can do this and I can solve this and solve that.</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But what is your everyday life?</div><div id="00:30:56.000" class="transcript_line"> How you treat people?</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Just because you are going to be a master or you go to thousands or whatever.</div><div id="00:31:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Or you live in a castle or whatever.</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That does not give you the right to look down to anybody.</div><div id="00:31:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in the eyes of the Lord we are all equal.</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The Queen didn&#039;t bleed blue.</div><div id="00:31:13.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t bleed black.</div><div id="00:31:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t bleed any brown thing.</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I have blood that is red to everybody.</div><div id="00:31:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And therefore we have feelings.</div><div id="00:31:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Same feelings that you have I have.</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You can cry I cry.</div><div id="00:31:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I laugh I laugh.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So therefore I said where is the discrimination and why?</div><div id="00:31:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It has no right anybody to discriminate anybody.</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And that gets me.</div><div id="00:31:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m thinking please Lord do something about it.</div><div id="00:31:43.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing that you cannot do.</div><div id="00:31:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Why all these things happen?</div><div id="00:31:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I happen to be there and hear somebody say I have to step in.</div><div id="00:31:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I say how on a minute who the hell do you think you are?</div><div id="00:31:55.000" class="transcript_line"> To talk at this person that way.</div><div id="00:31:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Look in the mirror yourself first.</div><div id="00:31:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I always give him something for him to think about it.</div><div id="00:32:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to them you want to be respected.</div><div id="00:32:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Learn to respect first.</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t know what respect is, it&#039;s an addictionary.</div><div id="00:32:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I recommend you to have a good study of it.</div><div id="00:32:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes.</div><div id="00:32:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I was coming out of the church one day.</div><div id="00:32:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And this lady was going up.</div><div id="00:32:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if she was Indian or whatever.</div><div id="00:32:24.000" class="transcript_line"> From India or something.</div><div id="00:32:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was coming up with a bag.</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said to me hello.</div><div id="00:32:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I said hiya.</div><div id="00:32:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said are you coming up from there?</div><div id="00:32:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I said I just come from the church.</div><div id="00:32:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He said would you like to join in?</div><div id="00:32:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He says come in.</div><div id="00:32:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She says we bring food and we bring this.</div><div id="00:32:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh that&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:32:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He said I&#039;m taking samosas.</div><div id="00:32:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I looked at her and yes she done a lot.</div><div id="00:32:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He says have one.</div><div id="00:32:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought oh lovely I took one.</div><div id="00:32:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And he says samosas.</div><div id="00:32:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:32:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And he says samosas.</div><div id="00:33:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s driving me so that I can&#039;t go there.</div><div id="00:33:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to her well I cannot make it today.</div><div id="00:33:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said well I will come one day.</div><div id="00:33:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But it passed weeks.</div><div id="00:33:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s I don&#039;t know if you believe it like when you hear something telling you.</div><div id="00:33:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:33:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very spiritual as well.</div><div id="00:33:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I can tell you that.</div><div id="00:33:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s always the ghost belief that I guess somebody&#039;s telling me that I should go there.</div><div id="00:33:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:33:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to my husband you know what I said Wednesdays.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I said the lady I&#039;m sure she said Wednesdays.</div><div id="00:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;ll come because I go to mass.</div><div id="00:33:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when they end the mass I can see the people going.</div><div id="00:33:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was outside you know thinking should I go in.</div><div id="00:33:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do I say.</div><div id="00:33:39.000" class="transcript_line"> What are they going to say.</div><div id="00:33:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know and all that.</div><div id="00:33:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I look and then I think well there&#039;s a lot of black ladies we go in.</div><div id="00:33:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The way Indians with the way they dress that they will go in.</div><div id="00:33:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said well I can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:33:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They will say me what happened.</div><div id="00:33:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought oh well never mind.</div><div id="00:34:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Victoria.</div><div id="00:34:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought I&#039;d come in.</div><div id="00:34:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I opened the door.</div><div id="00:34:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Good morning everybody.</div><div id="00:34:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Troy called me.</div><div id="00:34:11.000" class="transcript_line"> He went.</div><div id="00:34:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went in and introduced him.</div><div id="00:34:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said well I cannot remember who invited me here.</div><div id="00:34:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said you know I.</div><div id="00:34:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they all welcomed me.</div><div id="00:34:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I they made me at ease.</div><div id="00:34:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I thought oh I like this.</div><div id="00:34:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So they from them and then I started going.</div><div id="00:34:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know to them.</div><div id="00:34:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t say anything.</div><div id="00:34:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t express any opinion.</div><div id="00:34:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I just sit back and listen.</div><div id="00:34:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m learning.</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I study people&#039;s you know who your personalities and all that.</div><div id="00:34:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:34:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:34:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to me you have to say it and you can&#039;t this and that because you&#039;re one of us.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think okay thank you very much.</div><div id="00:34:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But I still in the background.</div><div id="00:34:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:35:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Because if I might say something somebody else they don&#039;t agree.</div><div id="00:35:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think you know I better shut up and then see what everybody&#039;s doing what&#039;s happening.</div><div id="00:35:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only when sometimes they say do you agree.</div><div id="00:35:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you say OK.</div><div id="00:35:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t agree.</div><div id="00:35:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes OK.</div><div id="00:35:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So what does it mean to you as well.</div><div id="00:35:19.000" class="transcript_line"> What does it mean to you.</div><div id="00:35:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They do a lot of hard work.</div><div id="00:35:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think they are on.</div><div id="00:35:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there in my page.</div><div id="00:35:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know they are on my page because what are they trying to do is what I believe that she should be done.</div><div id="00:35:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And maybe because I haven&#039;t got the knowledge to for me to go forward and do what they do it.</div><div id="00:35:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I said I&#039;m learning.</div><div id="00:35:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I said it&#039;s respected and is trying to help the people that they need.</div><div id="00:35:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know whatever I get on.</div><div id="00:35:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think anyway I don&#039;t know whether they agree or not.</div><div id="00:35:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think I get on with them.</div><div id="00:36:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like my husband said who could not get on with you.</div><div id="00:36:02.000" class="transcript_line"> She said you know I mean the way you are.</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You always talk.</div><div id="00:36:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I go on a plane.</div><div id="00:36:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I talk to the people who they go in.</div><div id="00:36:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we go into laughs by the time we arrive there.</div><div id="00:36:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like that.</div><div id="00:36:13.000" class="transcript_line"> If I&#039;m waiting at the bus or something and I&#039;m always talking to the next one.</div><div id="00:36:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:36:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s cold isn&#039;t it.</div><div id="00:36:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You start with something and then we laugh.</div><div id="00:36:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s life.</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You only hear one&#039;s wife doing it.</div><div id="00:36:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:36:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think if everybody would think that.</div><div id="00:36:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We only have one chance.</div><div id="00:36:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Any problems you have in life it can be solved.</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Except death.</div><div id="00:36:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That is one thing that you cannot solve.</div><div id="00:36:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go on holidays for a month or two.</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But you know you&#039;re coming back.</div><div id="00:36:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The one who died is not coming back.</div><div id="00:36:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:36:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Said so.</div><div id="00:36:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise he takes his breath away and that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:36:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I always say to them why.</div><div id="00:36:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Why not being happy.</div><div id="00:36:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Why not being positive.</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> At the end of the day you&#039;re not doing it for the person.</div><div id="00:36:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re doing it for yourself.</div><div id="00:37:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:37:02.000" class="transcript_line"> If you have love in your heart.</div><div id="00:37:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You won&#039;t have nothing else to give.</div><div id="00:37:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You won&#039;t have anything else to give.</div><div id="00:37:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:10.000" class="transcript_line"> If you are nasty and you&#039;re always with some negative stuff like that.</div><div id="00:37:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I said that&#039;s what you give.</div><div id="00:37:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That when people I see people like that.</div><div id="00:37:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think of course she&#039;s got a very sad heart.</div><div id="00:37:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:37:22.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking.</div><div id="00:37:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish we could change her.</div><div id="00:37:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m quite spiritual.</div><div id="00:37:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I talk to God.</div><div id="00:37:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Every night.</div><div id="00:37:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I talk to my angels.</div><div id="00:37:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you one thing why I believe so much in the miracle.</div><div id="00:37:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In my house.</div><div id="00:37:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You know the steps to go upstairs.</div><div id="00:37:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on the fifth cleaning.</div><div id="00:37:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And you got the cord got stuck.</div><div id="00:37:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Now bear in mind I was cleaning standing like this.</div><div id="00:37:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it got stuck.</div><div id="00:37:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went like this and pull it.</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And the cord pulled me back.</div><div id="00:37:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went diving like that.</div><div id="00:38:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now when I did this.</div><div id="00:38:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the radiator here.</div><div id="00:38:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the front door there.</div><div id="00:38:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And the space from there to there.</div><div id="00:38:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The houses that we have.</div><div id="00:38:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now with the way I landed there.</div><div id="00:38:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I should have banged exactly.</div><div id="00:38:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But I promise you.</div><div id="00:38:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Someone was holding my head like this.</div><div id="00:38:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt my head was like this.</div><div id="00:38:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when you back.</div><div id="00:38:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What it goes is your head first.</div><div id="00:38:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Your head you got.</div><div id="00:38:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s your head.</div><div id="00:38:33.000" class="transcript_line"> When I landed I landed it.</div><div id="00:38:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt a hand because my head was like this.</div><div id="00:38:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought.</div><div id="00:38:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you God.</div><div id="00:38:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because otherwise if I would have been completely cold there.</div><div id="00:38:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When my husband came back from work.</div><div id="00:38:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He would have had to push the front door.</div><div id="00:38:50.000" class="transcript_line"> To get me out of the way.</div><div id="00:38:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was early in the morning.</div><div id="00:38:54.000" class="transcript_line"> In Spain I had my car.</div><div id="00:38:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I went around the corner.</div><div id="00:38:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whatever happened.</div><div id="00:39:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt an explosion.</div><div id="00:39:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I thought oh.</div><div id="00:39:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I could feel the car going and I break and all like that.</div><div id="00:39:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And suddenly I could see people running and all that.</div><div id="00:39:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I opened the door to go.</div><div id="00:39:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody said are you okay?</div><div id="00:39:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I said yeah I&#039;m fine.</div><div id="00:39:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Your neck?</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No I&#039;m fine.</div><div id="00:39:18.000" class="transcript_line"> When I look at my car.</div><div id="00:39:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It was completely gone.</div><div id="00:39:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The tires exploded.</div><div id="00:39:24.000" class="transcript_line"> All the chairs where I was seated.</div><div id="00:39:26.000" class="transcript_line"> All it was open completely.</div><div id="00:39:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was open.</div><div id="00:39:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how.</div><div id="00:39:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And everything from there was high in.</div><div id="00:39:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They had to call the.</div><div id="00:39:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you call it?</div><div id="00:39:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They took my car and they took away.</div><div id="00:39:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the scratches.</div><div id="00:39:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was thinking thank God.</div><div id="00:39:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I always thank God because I think he&#039;s the one who looks after me.</div><div id="00:39:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And here at the hospital when I went to have x-rays.</div><div id="00:39:51.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband says Vicky the way you fall and all that he said.</div><div id="00:39:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was 60 when that happened.</div><div id="00:39:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s our bones at that age.</div><div id="00:39:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It started getting just a bit.</div><div id="00:40:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got to try this.</div><div id="00:40:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Which makes it even worse.</div><div id="00:40:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I went in there I had my x-rays and everything.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They can&#039;t see no one&#039;s scratch.</div><div id="00:40:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me somebody&#039;s looking after you.</div><div id="00:40:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He says at your age you should have at least something broken.</div><div id="00:40:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Or something.</div><div id="00:40:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing.</div><div id="00:40:18.000" class="transcript_line"> On the x-rays.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing.</div><div id="00:40:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s me praying when I go there.</div><div id="00:40:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I just pray and pray.</div><div id="00:40:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first thing I always say thank you Lord.</div><div id="00:40:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for this.</div><div id="00:40:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:40:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:40:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for sharing.</div><div id="00:40:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And for expressing this.</div><div id="00:40:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I have never really talked to anybody so much about it.</div><div id="00:40:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t think many people are interested in somebody&#039;s life.</div><div id="00:40:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it is interesting really to find out.</div><div id="00:40:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why when I go to these people.</div><div id="00:40:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They age alive.</div><div id="00:40:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I ask them little questions about their cultures.</div><div id="00:40:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know how do you feel about it.</div><div id="00:41:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And all this.</div><div id="00:41:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And quite a few of them have come when they were young.</div><div id="00:41:04.000" class="transcript_line"> They all think the same.</div><div id="00:41:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They like to go back.</div><div id="00:41:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:41:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I always say to my husband I don&#039;t want to die in this country.</div><div id="00:41:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t want to die here.</div><div id="00:41:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to go home.</div><div id="00:41:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to go home.</div><div id="00:41:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I said that is my home.</div><div id="00:41:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to go home.</div><div id="00:41:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I thought come on Victoria think about it.</div><div id="00:41:24.000" class="transcript_line"> My home is here now.</div><div id="00:41:26.000" class="transcript_line"> For 58 years that I&#039;ve been here.</div><div id="00:41:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking it is my home here.</div><div id="00:41:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I have my children here.</div><div id="00:41:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandchildren.</div><div id="00:41:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought maybe you had a reason to bring me here.</div><div id="00:41:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a very strong believer in things happen for a reason.</div><div id="00:41:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It always happens for a reason.</div><div id="00:41:45.000" class="transcript_line"> A friend of mine is supposed to go away.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> His wife decided to do something.</div><div id="00:41:51.000" class="transcript_line"> She went back.</div><div id="00:41:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And they missed the coach.</div><div id="00:41:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He was mad.</div><div id="00:41:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said yeah but I can help it.</div><div id="00:42:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Halfway there.</div><div id="00:42:02.000" class="transcript_line"> This is a time years ago.</div><div id="00:42:04.000" class="transcript_line"> The coach had an accident.</div><div id="00:42:06.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no survivors.</div><div id="00:42:08.000" class="transcript_line"> See.</div><div id="00:42:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a reason why they bring you back.</div><div id="00:42:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always say to my husband if you want to do something.</div><div id="00:42:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But suddenly something happened.</div><div id="00:42:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I said don&#039;t hurry for anything.</div><div id="00:42:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I said there is a reason why it&#039;s happening.</div><div id="00:42:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I said listen.</div><div id="00:42:26.000" class="transcript_line"> What God says your eyes look your ears listen.</div><div id="00:42:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I said they telling you.</div><div id="00:42:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know they wake me up at 3 o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:42:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I never understood why I wake up every morning.</div><div id="00:42:35.000" class="transcript_line"> At 3 o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:42:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I realized now and they said the God wakes you up.</div><div id="00:42:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m spiritual.</div><div id="00:42:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe.</div><div id="00:42:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think now I understand.</div><div id="00:42:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So what I do I get up and pray.</div><div id="00:42:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You know pray for the world.</div><div id="00:42:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Pray for the people.</div><div id="00:42:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Pray for everybody who is vagus.</div><div id="00:42:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to them give him strength and carry on.</div><div id="00:42:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I talked to them.</div><div id="00:43:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of them I said.</div><div id="00:43:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Why are you in this business.</div><div id="00:43:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said but why are you in this street.</div><div id="00:43:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And these stories they tell you.</div><div id="00:43:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so hard.</div><div id="00:43:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s you know you can cry.</div><div id="00:43:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of people they said oh because they have drugs and because they drink it.</div><div id="00:43:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said before you judge anybody.</div><div id="00:43:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Find out why they drink.</div><div id="00:43:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Why in drugs.</div><div id="00:43:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is he I said in the cold.</div><div id="00:43:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said and he has to feel the cold.</div><div id="00:43:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said if he drinks.</div><div id="00:43:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And he passes.</div><div id="00:43:30.000" class="transcript_line"> He will feel the cold.</div><div id="00:43:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said look and when I talk to the people that&#039;s what they tell me.</div><div id="00:43:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said I don&#039;t want to.</div><div id="00:43:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like it if I have a place where to stay.</div><div id="00:43:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But he said with this I fall asleep.</div><div id="00:43:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And don&#039;t feel nothing until I wake up the next day.</div><div id="00:43:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s so sad.</div><div id="00:43:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That shouldn&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:43:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It shouldn&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:43:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re never going to know unless you have those conversations and ask them.</div><div id="00:43:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like you mentioned earlier on about that.</div><div id="00:43:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The respect as well.</div><div id="00:44:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:44:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was the same.</div><div id="00:44:04.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a what do you call it.</div><div id="00:44:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Selling magazines.</div><div id="00:44:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was only I think he was 18 19.</div><div id="00:44:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I started talking to him and I gave him clothes of my sons.</div><div id="00:44:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they were more or less the same and all.</div><div id="00:44:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And my son he had to buy something that he don&#039;t want it and all that.</div><div id="00:44:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to get the clothes
