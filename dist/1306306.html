    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 20 in our series in relation to race riots and relates the Red Summer of 1919.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Race riots, brutality, the deaths of black people under attack by white mobs across the United States in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a brutal swathe of racial violence leading to hundreds of black people being shot, lynched and burned to death.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The story is told here by The History Guy, which is a superb American YouTube site that you should subscribe to.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> If we must die, let it not be like hogs hunted and pinned in this inglorious spot,</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> while round us bark the mad and angry dogs making their mock of our accursed lot.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Like men we will face the murderous cowardly pack pressed to the wall, dying.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But fighting back.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Claude McKay wrote the poem If We Must Die after a series of attacks against black Americans in the United States in the summer of 1919.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Author James Weldon Johnson coined the term Red Summer to describe those events.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> A century ago, hundreds of black Americans were killed in attacks all across the country, and yet the nation has built few memorials to those dead.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The Red Summer of 1919 deserves to be remembered.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> 1919 was somewhat of a turning point for the United States.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The First World War ended in November 1918. Veterans returned to America, that was rapidly changing.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Women would soon gain the right to vote, and Prohibition would begin an experiment in banning alcohol.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The Army during the First World War was segregated, and some black regiments were put under French command</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> because white American officers were not comfortable commanding black troops.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Many white Americans blamed the coming tragedy on the French for treating black soldiers as equals and planting ideas in their heads.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Called Soldiers of Democracy, black veterans came back to the United States ready to demand civil rights.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> W.E.B. DuBois wrote We Return, We Return from Fighting, We Return Fighting.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> For black Americans, 1919 marked 300 years since the first African slaves were brought to the American colonies, and they had begun to start calling for change.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> 1919 was a time of anxiety in the United States and the world.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The First World War had ended, but other social movements and economic conditions contributed to an anxious time.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Inflation was rising, labor strikes were common. In Russia, the Bolsheviks had overthrown the Tsar.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Americans feared Bolshevik agitation might come to their shores.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Anarchist bombings were common. The economy was in flux, and in northern cities, white residents were afraid of the new black migrants bringing economic competition.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The Great Migration would eventually send millions of black Americans to the industrial north and midwest, fleeing violence, segregation, and lack of economic opportunity in the south.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, they were sometimes greeted with the same in places where they relocated.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> While they were at first unconcerned, southern employers eventually worried about the loss of cheap labor or to stem the tide of the exodus.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> From spring into fall of 1919, these tensions exploded into a series of violent episodes that killed hundreds of black Americans.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It served as a wake-up call, but it also spurred a movement in which blacks in America fought back, sometimes for the first time.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> An early episode of violence occurred in Jenkins County, Georgia, in April.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> A black church party was interrupted when two white officers arrested a black man named Edmund Scott for possession of a pistol.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> A wealthy black farmer named Joe Ruffin offered to pay his fine, but the officers demanded cash instead of a check.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When Ruffin tried to pull Scott to the car, an officer struck Ruffin with his pistol, which discharged, knocking Ruffin unconscious.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Ruffin&#039;s son, an Army veteran thinking his father was dead, shot and killed one of the officers in retaliation.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In the ensuing gunfight, the second officer was wounded and then beaten to death.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> As news spread, what was described as hundreds of white men rushed to the town, bent on revenge.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Joe surrendered to the local sheriff, who protected him from a mob bent on lynching.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But the mob caught and lynched two of his sons, as well as another black man who had been in the area.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They also burned the church and six other black churches, as well as three black Masonic lodges in the area.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Ruffin was led to another county by the sheriff and put in jail there.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Repeated attempts to try him for murder or manslaughter finally failed, but he was left impoverished from his legal expenses.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He moved to South Carolinas, who would not have been safe in Georgia.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No charges were ever filed against any of the men who killed Ruffin&#039;s sons or destroyed property.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> On July 19th, in Washington, D.C., a white woman was jostled on the street by two black men.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the men was questioned by police and released, but a rumor started among some white Army veterans that the man had committed rape.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> A white mob started a four-day riot, attacking and beating hundreds of black individuals and damaging businesses.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> When the city&#039;s police refused to intervene, black Americans fought back and defended their neighborhoods with firearms.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> There were shootings and attacks from both sides, as President Woodrow Wilson finally sent 200 Army troops to intervene,</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> although heavy summer rains may have done more to quell the riot than the troops.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> When it finally ended July 25th, as many as 40 people had died from gunshot wounds or in street fights.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> At least 150 were injured.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> In Chicago, Illinois, a week-long riot was set off on July 27th when a black teenager named Eugene Williams,</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> hanging onto a makeshift raft, unknowingly floated into the white part of an unofficially segregated Southside Beach on Lake Michigan.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> A white man threw rocks at Williams and other black swimmers to drive them away.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Williams was hit in the forehead, knocking him into the water, where he drowned.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When black witnesses tried to get the man who threw the rock arrested, the police did nothing.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the bystanders complained, a fight broke out between white and black mobs, and spread into five days of general rioting.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> While there was violence on both sides, the vast majority of the acts of murder, arson, and property damage were perpetrated by white gangs against black residents on Chicago&#039;s Southside.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Police did little to protect the black neighborhoods, and the state&#039;s attorney accused the police of arresting African-American rioters</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> while refusing to arrest white rioters. Illinois was forced to call in the militia to restore order.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Twenty-three black and fifteen white residents were killed in the rioting. Five hundred more were injured.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> More than a thousand black families were left homeless due to arson.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The black men who fought back in D.C. and Chicago were often returning veterans of the First World War.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They had military training, were ready to defend themselves and their families.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It marked a difference from riots of previous years when blacks were attacked and mostly could not or did not defend themselves.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The violence made one veteran, Harry Haywood, say he realized,</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I had been fighting the wrong war. The Germans weren&#039;t the enemy. The enemy was right here at home.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Economic tensions also impacted events at a riot in Omaha, Nebraska at the end of September.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Two years previous to the riot, a local meatpacking plant had brought in black workers as strikebreakers,</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and that had caused tension between them and white working class people of the town.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> When a black man was accused of raping a white woman, a mob of as many as ten thousand descended on the courthouse,</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> demanding the police turn over the man. The mob set fire to the courthouse and captured and tried to hang the mayor.</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They also destroyed private property, attacking black neighborhoods and stores.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Eventually the police, surrounded in the burning building, had no choice but to hand the man, named Will Brown, to the mob,</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> who lynched him and burned his body. A young Henry Fonda witnessed the lynching and said it had a profound effect on him.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Federal troops finally quelled the riot. 120 people were arrested for their involvement,</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> but most were never successfully prosecuted and all were eventually released without serving prison sentences.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The deadliest episode in the Red Summer started September 30th in Elaine, Arkansas.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> A union of black sharecroppers was meeting with farmers to discuss how to obtain fairer settlements from white landowners,</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> who they argued had been exploiting the farmers.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The planters did not want to pay higher wages and rumors insinuated that communists were behind the unrest,</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> reflecting larger tensions in the United States as many Americans feared the Russian Revolution was coming to their shores.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> When two armed white deputies showed up at the meeting, they clashed with armed union guards.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s never been determined who shot first, but a white deputy was killed.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The local sheriff called for a posse to arrest those responsible for the killing.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Spurred by rumors and sensational headlines about a planned insurrection,</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> a mob of over a thousand white men descended on the county, indiscriminately killing black men, women, and children.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Estimates vary, but between 100 to more than 500 black people were murdered by the mob.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The governor called in federal troops, who disarmed both sides, but arrested and held 285 black residents.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The governor established a committee of prominent white residents who,</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> without interviewing any of the sharecroppers, concluded that the riot was caused by socialist agitators.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Despite the widespread murders of black residents, an all-white grand jury indicted no white people</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and instead indicted 122 black men in connection with the riot.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Arkansas had used poll taxes to disenfranchise most black voters,</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> thus removing them from the jury pool, and the black men were tried by all-white juries,</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> often accused with evidence from witnesses who were coerced.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> In trials where armed white mobs were outside, and sometimes even inside, the courtroom.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Twelve men, called the Arkansas Twelve, were convicted of murder, sentenced to death.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated six of those convictions on the grounds that the mob atmosphere</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and coerced testimony denied the men due process.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The other six were given indefinite furloughs by outgoing Governor Thomas McCray</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and taken out of state to prevent their execution.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Most modern researchers discount the assertion that there was a planned insurrection</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> or any plan to target white planters for murder,</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> but a conference held in 2000 to review the facts of the event</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> found that the claim appears to be still widely believed.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> While these represent a few of the more violent events of the Red Summer,</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> they are just a few of the more than 25 riots, massacres, and lynchings</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> that occurred across the United States in the late spring into the fall of 1919.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> In the aftermath of the Red Summer, Dr. George Haynes, a sociologist employed by the Wilson Administration,</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> published a report in the New York Times and other newspapers.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a call to action about the epidemic of lynchings.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The report concluded that from 1889 to 1918,</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> more than 3,000 black people had been lynched in the United States.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The report highlighted that states rarely prosecuted the perpetrators of the lynchings</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and showed little motivation to address the problem of lynchings.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He warned that unchecked mob violence creates hatred and intolerance,</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> making impossible, free, and dispassionate discussion not only of race problems,</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> but questions on which races and sections differ.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> In such a state of mind, Dr. Haynes wrote,</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> a trivial incident can precipitate a riot.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Haynes&#039; report largely fell on deaf ears.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The government and news media largely attempted to frame black resistance</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> to the violence of the Red Summer as derived from socialist agitators.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The government provided evidence to the media to support his assertion</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> that political organizations were urging blacks to embrace communism.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They said that unions were spreading propaganda to breed racial hatred</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and accused W.E.B. Dubois of editorializing about socialism.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Others, including future FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> blamed black radicals while ignoring white perpetrators of violence.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Black newspapers like the Chicago Defender told a different story.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Journalists like Ida B. Wells investigated the attacks</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and got the story out that blacks were sometimes justified in fighting.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There was some progress.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The Supreme Court decision in Moore v. Dempsey,</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> which effectively freed the Arkansas 12,</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> represented a significant shift in policy towards a wider use</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> of federal writs of habeas corpus to oversee state court convictions</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and represented stricter scrutiny by the Supreme Court</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> of state criminal trials in terms of their compliance with the Bill of Rights.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But the largest effect of the violence of the Red Summer was on the black community.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Throughout the Red Summer, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> had been contacting government officials to raise the alarm,</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> but they were mostly met with indifference, sometimes outright hostility.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The NAACP had been formed after the 1908 Springfield, Illinois race riot.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> In those days, it was led by prominent white supporters of black civil rights.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> After the Red Summer, black Americans emerged as the leaders of the NAACP</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and began directing the legal and political advocacy</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> that would lead to success in the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> By the early 1920s, membership had increased to 100,000 from just 9,000 before the First World War.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> A hundred years later, the nation is still trying to come to grips with the events of the Red Summer.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The violence is largely forgotten even in communities where it occurred.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> People have been afraid to bring it up for fear that it would raise new tensions,</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> or maybe just because they didn&#039;t want to face the past.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Chicago is hosting a number of historical events this summer</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> to help the city remember this nearly forgotten chapter in its history.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And for the first time, a hundred years later, a memorial is being built</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> to the victims of the Elaine Arkansas massacre, though not in Elaine, in nearby West Helena.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> In April, a willow tree was planted in Elaine to memorialize those victims.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And in August, in the night, someone came and chopped it down,</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> a sign that not everybody wants to remember the past.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> There are very few historical markers to the violence of the Red Summer in the United States.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> To most Americans, it is just forgotten history, even though it was the beginning of an awakening.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Visit us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and check out our merchandise on teespring.com.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you&#039;d like more episodes on forgotten history, all you need to do is subscribe.</div></div></p>
