His father</div><div id="00:00:08.640" class="transcript_line"> was a forester from the forester&#039;s dean. So he&#039;d served a long apprenticeship as a woodsman.</div><div id="00:00:17.620" class="transcript_line"> So he knew how to chop trees down and fashion things out of them. And he moved because the</div><div id="00:00:25.320" class="transcript_line"> work was there and the pay was better. He moved, I think, in the 30s over here from the forester&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:32.800" class="transcript_line"> dean. And he got a job making pit props in the Navvy. Now, the pit props were made from pine tree</div><div id="00:00:44.400" class="transcript_line"> trunks. The miners liked those pit props as opposed to the steel ones because it would warn</div><div id="00:00:52.440" class="transcript_line"> them of a fall. So if the ground above that they were supporting it become unstable, it was unstable</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> slowly and the pit props would start to squeak and squeal. So they heard them start to squeak</div><div id="00:01:06.920" class="transcript_line"> and squeal. They got out quickly. That apparently saved many lives over the life of the pit. There</div><div id="00:01:13.760" class="transcript_line"> were quite a number killed, but it saved many lives in addition.</div></div></p>
