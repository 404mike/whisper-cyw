    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay Deepak Dab, we want to ask you about, little bit about your involvement in Durga</div><div id="00:00:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Puja in Cardiff and the Durga Puja festival.</div><div id="00:00:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Can you give us a short summary how and when you got involved and how you got involved</div><div id="00:00:20.840" class="transcript_line"> and what was the Puja like at that time?</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, I came to Cardiff in 1978 on actually Shabtami day.</div><div id="00:00:34.120" class="transcript_line"> So I finished my work on that day and in the evening I was looking through the yellow pages</div><div id="00:00:38.880" class="transcript_line"> to find out, I can find any Bengali names.</div><div id="00:00:42.840" class="transcript_line"> So I found to, the first person I rang is Mr. Mishso without knowing whether he was</div><div id="00:00:48.800" class="transcript_line"> a Bengali or not, not Bengali.</div><div id="00:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So luckily he was found to be Bengali and he said there is a Puja.</div><div id="00:00:57.040" class="transcript_line"> So I was so delighted.</div><div id="00:00:58.720" class="transcript_line"> So he came down to my hotel, picked me up and took me to the parade.</div><div id="00:01:06.200" class="transcript_line"> The Puja was being held at the parade at that time.</div><div id="00:01:09.460" class="transcript_line"> So I was so delighted to see that few families are involved in that Puja.</div><div id="00:01:14.320" class="transcript_line"> And first thing I thought, I took my shoes off from outside of the door and I said, can</div><div id="00:01:20.800" class="transcript_line"> I be of any help?</div><div id="00:01:21.800" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind doing something for here.</div><div id="00:01:25.640" class="transcript_line"> And somebody said, yes, you can do this and that.</div><div id="00:01:28.120" class="transcript_line"> So I got involved on the first day.</div><div id="00:01:30.640" class="transcript_line"> I went to the Puja organized by Bengali Association Wales and I think it was a delightful experience</div><div id="00:01:42.440" class="transcript_line"> on the first day and I never could detach myself from the Puja yet.</div><div id="00:01:49.480" class="transcript_line"> How do you think it has developed over the years?</div><div id="00:01:51.880" class="transcript_line"> You have been associated with the Puja for a long time.</div><div id="00:01:56.840" class="transcript_line"> I think the initial few years I got a feeling that we had a difference of opinion between</div><div id="00:02:07.120" class="transcript_line"> some of the members within the group.</div><div id="00:02:09.680" class="transcript_line"> But we resolved the issues, whatever we had, and then formed different groups and started</div><div id="00:02:16.080" class="transcript_line"> the Puja with the new name WPC.</div><div id="00:02:25.960" class="transcript_line"> That was 1982 and 1983.</div><div id="00:02:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Am I right, Kanti?</div><div id="00:02:31.960" class="transcript_line"> 1982 and 1983.</div><div id="00:02:35.960" class="transcript_line"> WPC was formed.</div><div id="00:02:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And can you remember some of the fond memories of Puja or the festival itself?</div><div id="00:02:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Of course I can.</div><div id="00:03:01.320" class="transcript_line"> During the early part of the 80s, I think everybody was very enthusiastic to celebrate</div><div id="00:03:11.320" class="transcript_line"> the Puja in here rather than something else.</div><div id="00:03:16.200" class="transcript_line"> But I think over the years, we not only wanted to celebrate, but we had to spread the idea</div><div id="00:03:25.080" class="transcript_line"> of Durga Puja and the meaningful things related to Durga Puja among our children.</div><div id="00:03:35.280" class="transcript_line"> So the angle slightly changed.</div><div id="00:03:38.600" class="transcript_line"> We tried to get them involved as well when the children were very, very young.</div><div id="00:03:42.600" class="transcript_line"> So they came and watched the Puja and the mingling of people between themselves so that</div><div id="00:03:55.120" class="transcript_line"> they can enjoy the union of these people coming to the Puja and trying to relate to</div><div id="00:04:02.720" class="transcript_line"> people like us, our age group, trying to relate back home.</div><div id="00:04:10.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s kind of reminiscing the past in that way.</div><div id="00:04:15.720" class="transcript_line"> And we were hoping at that time that our children would learn from our mingling with other people</div><div id="00:04:22.720" class="transcript_line"> during the Puja.</div><div id="00:04:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So once in the whole year, we get together after a few months, a gap of 12 months, 11</div><div id="00:04:31.720" class="transcript_line"> months, whatever.</div><div id="00:04:32.720" class="transcript_line"> That was the joy of it.</div><div id="00:04:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So we enjoyed that occasion very much.</div><div id="00:04:38.720" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think has managed to bring the group together and keep it together over</div><div id="00:04:46.720" class="transcript_line"> so many years?</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I think the majority of the thing is related to the feelings about Durga Puja and the values</div><div id="00:04:56.720" class="transcript_line"> in our cultural life.</div><div id="00:04:58.720" class="transcript_line"> I think people slowly understood that the cultural aspects of Durga Puja is far more</div><div id="00:05:06.720" class="transcript_line"> important than just the religious part of it or celebrating the Puja and doing all sorts</div><div id="00:05:14.720" class="transcript_line"> of merrymaking.</div><div id="00:05:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I think at a later stage, I think we wanted to spread it around the local people as well</div><div id="00:05:22.720" class="transcript_line"> so that the other people can understand us better culturally.</div><div id="00:05:28.720" class="transcript_line"> And the cultural cohesion is a little bit enhanced.</div><div id="00:05:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So we tried slowly.</div><div id="00:05:36.720" class="transcript_line"> We moved our initial Durga Puja feelings to understanding people within the community</div><div id="00:05:47.720" class="transcript_line"> we live in.</div><div id="00:05:49.720" class="transcript_line"> So we invited other people to organize different events so that we can showcase our cultural</div><div id="00:05:59.720" class="transcript_line"> side of our community and the other people can understand us better.</div><div id="00:06:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:06:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, Deepak Dhar.</div><div id="00:06:09.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
