Not sure I do.</div><div id="00:03:15.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, here I am, 16 years later, carrying those buckets.</div><div id="00:03:22.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been doing it for so many years now that I&#039;ve really had enough.</div><div id="00:03:27.240" class="transcript_line"> My hands hurt. More than anything, my hands hurt.</div><div id="00:03:31.240" class="transcript_line"> My legs feel heavy.

No more complaining.</div><div id="00:03:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Just get on with it.</div><div id="00:03:52.240" class="transcript_line"> The locals watch Merarid come and go.</div><div id="00:03:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Every day she goes past here with her buckets.</div><div id="00:04:00.240" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Matt. I&#039;ve lived in Canterbury all my life.</div><div id="00:04:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Working in the fields.</div><div id="00:04:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Now and again, I like to pop down to my local Canterbury Railroad pub</div><div id="00:04:11.240" class="transcript_line"> for an occasional pint of Guinness. Just the odd one.</div><div id="00:04:15.240" class="transcript_line"> The odd one, did you say, Grandad?</div><div id="00:04:17.240" class="transcript_line"> I think it might be a few more than that.</div><div id="00:04:19.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, I reckon I deserve it, Siwan.</div><div id="00:04:22.240" class="transcript_line"> So I watch her go past every day with her buckets</div><div id="00:04:26.240" class="transcript_line"> and I think not much of a life is it for a young woman.</div><div id="00:04:29.240" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:04:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Just lately, I see her looking more and more fed up.</div><div id="00:04:34.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;ll be trouble there one day, Siwan. You mark my words.</div><div id="00:04:37.240" class="transcript_line"> She won&#039;t put up with it forever.</div><div id="00:04:40.240" class="transcript_line"> On a fine day, when I&#039;m in the park garden outside, you can hear her muttering.</div><div id="00:04:45.240" class="transcript_line"> Why must I do this? Is it even necessary?</div><div id="00:04:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Would anyone even notice if I just didn&#039;t?</div><div id="00:04:54.240" class="transcript_line"> What would happen?</div><div id="00:04:56.240" class="transcript_line"> What would be the consequences?</div><div id="00:04:59.240" class="transcript_line"> I hate lugging these horrible, heavy buckets around.</div><div id="00:05:04.240" class="transcript_line"> If I could stop doing it, I would.</div><div id="00:05:07.240" class="transcript_line"> I want to lose this heavy burden once and for all.</div><div id="00:05:11.240" class="transcript_line"> I want to be free.</div><div id="00:05:14.240" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s the curse.</div><div id="00:05:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, is there?</div><div id="00:05:19.240" class="transcript_line"> This spirit might not even be for real.</div><div id="00:05:22.240" class="transcript_line"> All this pain, all these aches, all this suffering be for nothing.</div><div id="00:05:28.240" class="transcript_line"> It could all be false.</div><div id="00:05:31.240" class="transcript_line"> One day, a prince called Rodri makes a royal visit to Mereid&#039;s father,</div><div id="00:05:35.240" class="transcript_line"> and Princess Mereid comes up with what she thinks is a wonderful plan.</div><div id="00:05:39.240" class="transcript_line"> That night, at a great feast held in honor of Rodri,</div><div id="00:05:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Princess Mereid has a secret, whispered conversation with him.</div><div id="00:05:47.240" class="transcript_line"> What a wonderful feast this is, isn&#039;t it, Prince Rodri?</div><div id="00:05:51.240" class="transcript_line"> And all in your honor.</div><div id="00:05:53.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, thank you. The best I&#039;ve ever attended.</div><div id="00:05:57.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s such a shame it might be the last one we ever have.</div><div id="00:06:01.240" class="transcript_line"> The last? Why?</div><div id="00:06:03.240" class="transcript_line"> Surely a kingdom like this has many more feasts in its future.</div><div id="00:06:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I thought you already knew. Sorry, excuse me, I shouldn&#039;t have said anything.</div><div id="00:06:11.240" class="transcript_line"> My father will be home.</div><div id="00:06:13.240" class="transcript_line"> No, don&#039;t leave. I won&#039;t tell him. What&#039;s going on?</div><div id="00:06:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, I really shouldn&#039;t tell you.</div><div id="00:06:21.240" class="transcript_line"> You could trust me.</div><div id="00:06:23.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just...Centra Gwelod is in trouble.</div><div id="00:06:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Our fields seem to be producing less and less these days.</div><div id="00:06:31.240" class="transcript_line"> We had to sacrifice our servants&#039; food for two days to be able to provide this feast.</div><div id="00:06:37.240" class="transcript_line"> And our army&#039;s getting weaker and weaker.</div><div id="00:06:40.240" class="transcript_line"> We have so few men left.</div><div id="00:06:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Really? I had no idea.</div><div id="00:06:46.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just so worried that soon someone might invade us.</div><div id="00:06:50.240" class="transcript_line"> And whoever it was, I suppose I&#039;d have to marry them.</div><div id="00:06:54.240" class="transcript_line"> What if it&#039;s a monster of a man?</div><div id="00:06:57.240" class="transcript_line"> That would be awful. Is there any way I can help?</div><div id="00:07:01.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, I did wonder. No, you wouldn&#039;t do that. Ignore me.</div><div id="00:07:07.240" class="transcript_line"> No, tell me. I want to help.</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s just, if you were to invade, you&#039;d surely succeed, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:07:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And I wouldn&#039;t mind marrying you.</div><div id="00:07:20.240" class="transcript_line"> I know you&#039;d care for our people, put us back on track.</div><div id="00:07:24.240" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t do that. Your father trusts me.</div><div id="00:07:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, you might be saving us from worse.</div><div id="00:07:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Well...</div><div id="00:07:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, please, please save our kingdom.</div><div id="00:07:36.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well. If it&#039;s to save the kingdom, then...</div><div id="00:07:40.240" class="transcript_line"> All right, let&#039;s meet later to plan things in detail.</div><div id="00:07:44.240" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d better go now and drink some wine with the King before he gets suspicious.</div><div id="00:07:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes! Well, that was easy.</div><div id="00:07:55.240" class="transcript_line"> And once I&#039;m married to Rodri, I can live in his kingdom.</div><div id="00:07:59.240" class="transcript_line"> And get away from the stupid well.</div><div id="00:08:02.240" class="transcript_line"> It won&#039;t matter if the curse falls here.</div><div id="00:08:05.240" class="transcript_line"> So, Merarid gets Rodri on site, then everything goes wrong with the plan.</div><div id="00:08:11.240" class="transcript_line"> Mabon again. And all I want is a quiet pint after a hard day&#039;s work.</div><div id="00:08:16.240" class="transcript_line"> But oh, no, not in Cantra Greylord. I&#039;m just sitting down with my Pints of Guinness.</div><div id="00:08:21.240" class="transcript_line"> And the next thing I know, I hear these drums.</div><div id="00:08:24.240" class="transcript_line"> And they get closer and closer. I&#039;m watching the vibrations of them in my pint.</div><div id="00:08:29.240" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s a silence. And I&#039;m just about to take a drink.</div><div id="00:08:33.240" class="transcript_line"> When the next minute a window breaks and a man hurls through it.</div><div id="00:08:38.240" class="transcript_line"> And then a whole horde of men come clashing in, fighting over falling in the pub soldiers.</div><div id="00:08:46.240" class="transcript_line"> Grandad! Grandad! Are you in there?</div><div id="00:08:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Come on, you need to leave. There&#039;s a battle going on.</div><div id="00:08:52.240" class="transcript_line"> I grab my pint and I try dodging all the fists to make it to Sion at the back door.</div><div id="00:09:00.240" class="transcript_line"> Next thing, a white goat comes running through the door.</div><div id="00:09:05.240" class="transcript_line"> And knocks me off my feet, leaving me and my pint on the floor.</div><div id="00:09:11.240" class="transcript_line"> So I help him up. Grandad, not the goat.</div><div id="00:09:15.240" class="transcript_line"> Suddenly we&#039;re stuck in the middle of a battle. I&#039;m lucky to make it home alive.</div><div id="00:09:20.240" class="transcript_line"> What a night. All I wanted was a quiet pint.</div><div id="00:09:24.240" class="transcript_line"> In the battle, it is Rodri&#039;s invading army that is defeated, not the army of Cantigualod.</div><div id="00:09:30.240" class="transcript_line"> So Mereyd&#039;s plan fails. Prince Rodri has taken prisoner. He is furious.</div><div id="00:09:36.240" class="transcript_line"> That wretch Mereyd. She lied. This country isn&#039;t weak at all.</div><div id="00:09:41.240" class="transcript_line"> How dare she whisper poison in my ears. Make me risk my men. All my people.</div><div id="00:09:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Why did I fall for such a pretty face and pretty allies?</div><div id="00:09:51.240" class="transcript_line"> I wish I could go back in time and cover my ears. Protect them from the poison that slowly seeped into them.</div><div id="00:09:57.240" class="transcript_line"> I was such an idiot. Now, here in this prison, these thoughts, these regrets.</div><div id="00:10:06.240" class="transcript_line"> They won&#039;t leave me alone. I can&#039;t take it anymore.</div><div id="00:10:10.240" class="transcript_line"> I need to escape. I need to escape this endless silence.</div><div id="00:10:15.240" class="transcript_line"> Shall I tell the king who betrayed him? Tell him it was his own daughter.</div><div id="00:10:20.240" class="transcript_line"> I know he wants to know. Maybe. Maybe I could use it as a bargaining chip.</div><div id="00:10:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Maybe he&#039;ll let me go free if I tell him.</div><div id="00:10:29.240" class="transcript_line"> While Rodri schemes, Mereyd knows her life hangs in the balance.</div><div id="00:10:33.240" class="transcript_line"> So now it&#039;s all over. My plan has failed. I don&#039;t know what to do. My father&#039;s going to find out what I&#039;ve done.</div><div id="00:10:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Rodri will tell him. Will he show me mercy? Does he even know how?</div><div id="00:10:47.240" class="transcript_line"> I wish I never tried to escape from my life.</div><div id="00:10:51.240" class="transcript_line"> I just felt so trapped, so burdened by duty. But there must have been a better way.</div><div id="00:10:58.240" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t feel like there was. What about free will? Where was my free will?</div><div id="00:11:06.240" class="transcript_line"> I need to fix this. How can I? How can I keep my father from finding out what I&#039;ve done?</div><div id="00:11:15.240" class="transcript_line"> What if? What if I didn&#039;t do my duty at the well today?</div><div id="00:11:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Just to see what the spirit will do. If the curse will really fall.</div><div id="00:11:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Maybe if the curse falls, whatever it is, in all the confusion, Rodri won&#039;t tell my father about me.</div><div id="00:11:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Or maybe Rodri will die. Or my father will die. Or will I die? After all, I&#039;ve nothing to lose.</div><div id="00:11:44.240" class="transcript_line"> That night, Rodri tells the King about Mereyd&#039;s treachery. It doesn&#039;t help him. The King just sends him back to prison.</div><div id="00:11:57.240" class="transcript_line"> And then he thinks about his daughter.</div><div id="00:12:00.240" class="transcript_line"> Hmm. What a sly little thing you&#039;ve turned out to be. I guess I should have seen it coming. You&#039;ve always resented me.</div><div id="00:12:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Carrying your buckets again this evening, are you? They must be heavier than ever today. Do you feel your back begin to break?</div><div id="00:12:16.240" class="transcript_line"> The weight of all that guilt? The tears and pain you&#039;ve brought to my people?</div><div id="00:12:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, you forced my hand.
