    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Stephen Cruz, a Cultural Heritage Volunteer for the Ellen Lynx Project. I&#039;m here at the Royal</div><div id="00:00:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Welsh Show today on the 24th of July 2023 and I&#039;m talking to... Mike James. Mike, I overheard you</div><div id="00:00:13.280" class="transcript_line"> talking to Cath about where you used to live. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?</div><div id="00:00:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I lived in Ryder. I grew up in Ryder from 1973. I think I was there for about 13 or 14 years.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember Ryder?</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The fact, I think, that the people were very welcoming. In those days it was a smaller community than it is now.</div><div id="00:00:45.040" class="transcript_line"> As a family we got involved in the local organizations, the Male Voice Choir for example.</div><div id="00:00:53.920" class="transcript_line"> My dad was a conductor there for a while.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big change for me. I was 12 or 13 when we moved there. I spent the formative years in London.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite a big shock, big change. But I still come back. Every year I come back to Ryder.</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> You have to. I need my fix regularly.</div><div id="00:01:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go to school in Ryder?</div><div id="00:01:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Initially I went to school at Llandrindah. After a year or so my brother and I went away to school across the border in Herefordshire.</div><div id="00:01:35.280" class="transcript_line"> What sort of activities did you get up to as a young boy?</div><div id="00:01:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Swimming in the river, fishing. I did do a bit of fishing but it was never very successful.</div><div id="00:01:45.520" class="transcript_line"> All sorts. Cycling, you know. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:01:55.520" class="transcript_line"> What about the actual building that you grew up in? That&#039;s a bit special.</div><div id="00:02:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Mum and Dad moved up to Ryder and they bought the Ellen Hotel on West Street.</div><div id="00:02:09.760" class="transcript_line"> I had an aunt who was living in Ryder at the time. Her husband was a pharmacist in Ryder.</div><div id="00:02:17.760" class="transcript_line"> His name was Ron Davis. She was Dillis Davis.</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d heard that the hotel was for sale. Mum and Dad were looking around at the time.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on in 1973 we moved up here.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It was full on hard work for them for the next 13 years running the hotel.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What other shops in Ryder do you remember?</div><div id="00:02:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Now they&#039;ve changed a lot. Let&#039;s have a think.</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> There was the butchers on the corner, collards.</div><div id="00:03:02.240" class="transcript_line"> There was, which isn&#039;t there any longer, part of the castle now was a fresh fish shop on North Street.</div><div id="00:03:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Before the electrical shop was in North Street there was the Kimberley which was a cafe.</div><div id="00:03:18.480" class="transcript_line"> There was the shoe shop which was on West Street.</div><div id="00:03:24.480" class="transcript_line"> There was the outfitters. There was a big post office then also on West Street.</div><div id="00:03:32.480" class="transcript_line"> A lot more pubs then than there were now. I think there were 13 pubs in Ryder at the time.</div><div id="00:03:38.480" class="transcript_line"> That number has gone down quite a lot since then.</div><div id="00:03:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any of your contemporaries from your time?</div><div id="00:03:46.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, still keep in touch with some of them.</div><div id="00:03:50.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been up here for the last week and I&#039;ve caught up with a few.</div><div id="00:03:54.720" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll walk about town now, this many years later and people still recognise me.</div><div id="00:04:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Which is surprising.</div><div id="00:04:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Well as you said at the beginning, Ryder has a real community feel to it doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Very much so.</div><div id="00:04:10.960" class="transcript_line"> I just love coming up here, I love going up the Ellum Valley.</div><div id="00:04:16.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s somewhere I have to go when I&#039;m up here.</div><div id="00:04:20.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been up this last week and two or three times I&#039;ve been up cycling up there and driving around.</div><div id="00:04:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Have you noticed many changes up there?</div><div id="00:04:30.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s certainly not as busy as it used to be.</div><div id="00:04:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there are a lot more people cycling up there and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:04:41.200" class="transcript_line"> Back in the 70s people used to go up there sightseeing and there used to be coach loads of tourists going around.</div><div id="00:04:51.200" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them used to stop at the Ellum Hotel for teas and coffees.</div><div id="00:04:57.200" class="transcript_line"> But I think coach holidays are not as popular now as they used to be.</div><div id="00:05:03.440" class="transcript_line"> But that brought a lot of business into the town.</div><div id="00:05:13.440" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say, I was talking to the guy who used to own the Metropole who&#039;s now died.</div><div id="00:05:19.440" class="transcript_line"> And he said that a year after Margaret Thatcher came in, the whole tourist trade died.</div><div id="00:05:25.440" class="transcript_line"> So you used to get tail backs from Crossgate into Ryder of cars going to go up the valley.</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And he said, with the advent of that brand of conservatism, a lot of the heavy industries in the Midlands closed.</div><div id="00:05:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And people couldn&#039;t afford the holidays and they didn&#039;t come over.</div><div id="00:05:43.680" class="transcript_line"> And he said it was really sudden and they just bought the hotel at Devil&#039;s Bridge when the trade stopped.</div><div id="00:05:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Catherine.</div><div id="00:05:51.680" class="transcript_line"> So is there anything else that you&#039;d like to mention about Ryder?</div><div id="00:05:55.920" class="transcript_line"> Not off the top of my head, other than I&#039;ll always be back.</div><div id="00:06:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Good. That&#039;s wonderful. Thanks very much for your time today.</div></div></p>
