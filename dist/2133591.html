    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Thursday the 8th of June, present are Mike Nicholson, Sue Nicholson and today we are</div><div id="00:00:10.600" class="transcript_line"> interviewing Kelly Young. Hello Kelly, how are you?</div><div id="00:00:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Fine. Okay, so Kelly you&#039;re a member of Chepster Mencap.</div><div id="00:00:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You&#039;ve been coming here for many years.</div><div id="00:00:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Would you like to tell us a little bit about</div><div id="00:00:25.960" class="transcript_line"> yourself to begin with? I just like coming here to see you all of</div><div id="00:00:29.840" class="transcript_line"> all the people that you&#039;ve got. Is that at Chepster Mencap?</div><div id="00:00:32.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Okay, so do you know roughly how long you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:00:35.240" class="transcript_line"> been coming to Chepster Mencap? I&#039;m not sure because it was at the old centre.</div><div id="00:00:40.320" class="transcript_line"> I think my mum found out from Wendy Perry I think or somebody and I got there and I</div><div id="00:00:48.720" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t know where I was and I was a bit nervous but now I&#039;m used to it now. So I like to go</div><div id="00:00:53.800" class="transcript_line"> on trips and go places and go for a walk and stuff.</div><div id="00:00:57.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve worked with you for over 10 years so you&#039;ve got to be there, 10 at least.</div><div id="00:01:03.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I think you&#039;ve been there at least probably</div><div id="00:01:06.600" class="transcript_line"> 20 I&#039;d imagine but we can find that out. Yeah, something like that, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:01:11.800" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do before you came to the board school?</div><div id="00:01:14.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d just been around the shops and see my friend. I&#039;ve got a mate who lives just around</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> the old Sunbridge Club, my mate Barry, I go and see my mate Barry and I&#039;ve got another</div><div id="00:01:27.040" class="transcript_line"> friend called Gwyn and I go and see him, go shopping and then go and see his mum sometimes.</div><div id="00:01:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so what did life look like for you before Chepster Mencap?</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> I just got really bored because I had nothing else to do. I just wanted to be with friends</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> and meet like you and your mum and Sarah and all that.</div><div id="00:01:51.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s nice. So it gave you some purpose to fill your days with.</div><div id="00:01:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Because I like to go out on the buses like we did last time with John Lewis and Alan</div><div id="00:02:01.760" class="transcript_line"> and I like to go out on the Monday night group but we don&#039;t do that anymore.</div><div id="00:02:07.560" class="transcript_line"> No, we do most of our evening works on a Thursday night.</div><div id="00:02:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and I like to work with you making cakes.</div><div id="00:02:14.360" class="transcript_line"> You have done that a couple of times with me haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:02:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. What did we bake last time?</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember. I think it was cookies we did last time.</div><div id="00:02:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think it was cookies and I like to make something with you one day Mike again.</div><div id="00:02:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, if you enjoyed that we can do another cooking session.</div><div id="00:02:29.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> So you said, going back, before you joined Chepster Mencap you said you were quite bored,</div><div id="00:02:35.520" class="transcript_line"> you were just hanging around the shops type thing you said, occasionally going to the</div><div id="00:02:39.320" class="transcript_line"> pub.</div><div id="00:02:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So Chepster Mencap has been a positive thing for you then.</div><div id="00:02:43.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to discuss some things that you like doing with them?</div><div id="00:02:48.360" class="transcript_line"> I just like to go out in places and like with you lot and going out to a garden centre with</div><div id="00:02:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Richard.</div><div id="00:02:54.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Like we did last time, went out for a drink at the garden centre and I bought Richard</div><div id="00:03:00.520" class="transcript_line"> a drink.</div><div id="00:03:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:03:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:03.520" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very generous aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I bought him a drink.</div><div id="00:03:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Nice.</div><div id="00:03:06.520" class="transcript_line"> So thinking back over the years, what have been some of your favourite memories with Chepster</div><div id="00:03:11.480" class="transcript_line"> Mencap?</div><div id="00:03:12.480" class="transcript_line"> I like to be with the old staff and you lots well.</div><div id="00:03:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I used to see him and Marsh and John Lewis and all them lot.</div><div id="00:03:21.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sadly they don&#039;t work here anymore.</div><div id="00:03:23.480" class="transcript_line"> No, but I do see John Lewis sometimes and he waves at me.</div><div id="00:03:28.200" class="transcript_line"> You still see him out and about?</div><div id="00:03:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:30.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:03:31.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:32.200" class="transcript_line"> And I used to wind him up like, I used to say John I got you tomorrow.</div><div id="00:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s like, oh not you.</div><div id="00:03:37.440" class="transcript_line"> And he used to say it to me on the bus, get off my bus and walk home.</div><div id="00:03:41.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m like John shut up.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to say get off my bus, you can walk home.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to wind me up and Richard.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had good banter with him didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Nice.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you go anywhere else apart from Ken to the board store?</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Monday, sometimes I go to my dad&#039;s to look after my dad&#039;s dog.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad&#039;s got a police dog, a big sensation called Skye.</div><div id="00:04:09.200" class="transcript_line"> But my mum&#039;s a bit worried me going in there in case she attacks me or bites me.</div><div id="00:04:14.200" class="transcript_line"> But she never does that, she loves me to pieces.</div><div id="00:04:17.200" class="transcript_line"> So I go and see her and I go call her and she comes up and she sniffes me and then she</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> makes this, she runs around me like I know what.</div><div id="00:04:28.200" class="transcript_line"> So I go and see her and then go and have her some nights, not overnight but have her in</div><div id="00:04:35.200" class="transcript_line"> the day.</div><div id="00:04:36.400" class="transcript_line"> And then I go and see my dad and obviously my friends and whatever.</div><div id="00:04:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Do you actually work at Pile Shop?</div><div id="00:04:43.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, only on a Tuesday at one o&#039;clock, police at 3.30.</div><div id="00:04:47.400" class="transcript_line"> And how do you feel about working at the shop?</div><div id="00:04:50.400" class="transcript_line"> I like it, I like being there all day helping Elaine because Elaine makes me laugh.</div><div id="00:04:56.400" class="transcript_line"> Where she trips over and falls over and I do the chills and everything and then Sat</div><div id="00:05:03.600" class="transcript_line"> starts beating her up.</div><div id="00:05:05.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh does he?</div><div id="00:05:06.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, playing.</div><div id="00:05:07.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s her son isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:10.600" class="transcript_line"> So it is only playing.</div><div id="00:05:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, playing he does.</div><div id="00:05:12.600" class="transcript_line"> So what do you do at the shop?</div><div id="00:05:14.600" class="transcript_line"> I do steaming, tagging, pricing and serving.</div><div id="00:05:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Do you like the serving?</div><div id="00:05:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:21.600" class="transcript_line"> What does that do for you?</div><div id="00:05:23.600" class="transcript_line"> I help Elaine and then she tells me how much it is or I look at the price and work it out.</div><div id="00:05:30.800" class="transcript_line"> And I put it in and sometimes I make a mistake putting the wrong one and Elaine has to sort</div><div id="00:05:37.800" class="transcript_line"> it all out and get it back to right.</div><div id="00:05:40.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good then.</div><div id="00:05:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Do you like the customers?</div><div id="00:05:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:45.800" class="transcript_line"> What other things do you do with Chepstam Incap?</div><div id="00:05:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Tuesday I come in here, up here with Annie.</div><div id="00:05:53.800" class="transcript_line"> I was here this Tuesday making teas and cakes for everybody.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel like you can come in and sit down and I like doing that because it&#039;s fun and I like</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> making a cup of teas and there&#039;s some people in there who know me and they&#039;re like, I can&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> love you and I know some of them, I do, not all of them.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I go home and do whatever and then sometimes on a Wednesday, like this Wednesday,</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked at the community centre with Annie making teas and cakes and doing soups and</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> giving it out to them.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So the two things on a Tuesday is the pop-up cafe?</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then Wednesday at the community centre.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The community centre and that is, where&#039;s that to?</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In Bulwark.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> In Bulwark, yeah?</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, by the two, by the Bound Barn.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s actually where you live, it&#039;s Bulwark, so you&#039;re meeting people from your area aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So you seem to have got quite a few jobs, you&#039;re basically working then whilst you&#039;re</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> at Chepstow Men&#039;s Cup?</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Serving in the shops, serving teas and coffees, baking cakes, cooking lunch for people.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever have a job before Chepstow Men&#039;s Cup?</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever try to get one?</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I did work in Tesco&#039;s, it was only for the tree, but I used to like helping, packing</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> people&#039;s bags and everything.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to work in the other child&#039;s shop in town, but I didn&#039;t like it because it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> fun, it was just like, do you know what I mean, it wasn&#039;t that.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why I like working with you a lot, because you make me laugh and giggle and...</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We do have good fun don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So we work hard, but play hard as well.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so what do you get from working?</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> How does it make you feel when you&#039;ve finished a day&#039;s work?</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I go home and I tell my mum every day what I do and she&#039;s like, have you been out today</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> or what you&#039;ve been doing?</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll say I&#039;ve been out with Mike or cooking with Mike or going shopping or doing whatever</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> and mum&#039;s really happy.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Mummy likes it, mummy likes me being here.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So mum&#039;s proud of you?</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel proud of yourself?</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Mummy likes me proud in here to be with you a lot.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s a great thing because it gives you the social aspects, you&#039;re seeing your</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> friends and you&#039;re meeting the community.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But also you&#039;re doing a rewarding job.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I make a cup of teas and offer everybody as well.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very kind, you always offer me a drink every time I see you.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but you always say no.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m not a tea drinker, am I?</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I drink too many of these.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Too many fizzy drinks unfortunately.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So okay, so we spoke about how you do a lot of working with Chepstom NCAP.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the social side of things?</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So what do you get from seeing your friends here?</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean?</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t get what you mean.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So working, you&#039;re obviously doing lots of tasks and you&#039;re working to help these functions</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> happen.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But when you&#039;re not working, you&#039;re normally doing something fun.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you do with us that isn&#039;t working?</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t get what it means, mum.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I know, I&#039;m trying to articulate.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So today for instance, when we walked into this room, you were saying that you&#039;ve had</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> a lovely morning.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And what were you doing today?</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Me, I was drawing some pictures.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You were drawing some pictures?</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I drew a picture of me and Keely, our withers.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And what is the picture going to be used for?</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure, it&#039;s in the envelope, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Mike&#039;s put it in an envelope, I don&#039;t know what it is.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I explained it, but I&#039;ll explain it again.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the Chepstow Festival of Arts.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So each year, Chepstow gets together and artists from all over Chepstow make different pieces</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> to be displayed in the town.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So what we were doing, we were doing self-portraits, weren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So you drew yourself and they&#039;re going to be displayed on the church railings.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;ll be an art installation of hundreds, hopefully, if enough people do it, hundreds</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> of self-portraits going all the way down the alley.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;ll be beautiful when it&#039;s finished.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you enjoy doing stuff like that?</div><div id="00:10:15.000"

making stuff and going out and doing stuff,</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> helping each other.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Like earlier, I had to help Tasha because she can&#039;t get the jelly on the spoon because</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s shaky and she drops it on the floor or drops it everywhere, so I fed her this</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> morning earlier with the jelly.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very helpful, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially to the

them.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I like to wish I could push Tasha because I know I&#039;m not allowed to push wheelchairs,</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> but I wish I could.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re always eager to help, but that&#039;s just...</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I like helping.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when we went out the other day and I think I pushed her out from here to the</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> end of the road.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And then somebody took her over to the other side, it was Keely, and said, you want...</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And Keely couldn&#039;t remember my name, so she went, do you want Kelly to push you?</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> She went, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I pushed her to the castle and then I pushed her back to the main road and then Annemarie</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> pushed her across the road and I said, Annemarie, I&#039;ll take her.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you sure?</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I pushed her back in here then.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just a health and safety thing, mate.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just like to help.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You do.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I just like to push because that&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I like pushing.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what it is.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very tanky.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I just like pushing people.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I wish I could push Jordan, but I know I can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No, his is an electric wheelchair.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So it takes a little bit of practice and stuff.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But if Sarah said to me, do you want to have a little go and I can help you, that&#039;d be</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> all right.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I just wish I could do something.</div><div id="00:11:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you would, but unfortunately with our job, we&#039;ve got to risk assess things and</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> health and safety.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s one thing I wish I could do to push.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I know, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But if you&#039;re fine to push Tash in a wheelchair because she lets you...</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> If Sarah said to me, do you want to push Jordan around here or down the bottom or something,</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I would have a go with Sarah.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But I just wish I could, but I can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s certain things that...</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I like to help and push people and help people and wheelchairs and whatever.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I like helping.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You can.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you&#039;d be able to do it but unfortunately we&#039;ve just got to do certain things by procedure.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> by procedure that&#039;s all. I know. But no worries we&#039;re just grateful that you&#039;re so kind to everyone that you come and see.</div><div id="00:12:33.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I like helping. You do. And I don&#039;t know why, I just like helping people like Tasha earlier, I&#039;ve fed Tasha earlier</div><div id="00:12:42.500" class="transcript_line"> and I like helping and being helpful. Yeah. Making teas and doing whatever. You&#039;re a generous person aren&#039;t you? I know.</div><div id="00:12:51.500" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so we got up to, how many days a week do you come to make out? Thursdays, all day Thursdays. All day on a Thursday. Yeah. Nice.</div><div id="00:13:01.500" class="transcript_line"> So we did the art this morning. Yeah. Have you got anything else planned for the week? Yeah.

Oh wow, what are you doing at the moment?</div><div id="00:13:16.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m dancing with all of the different groups. But Keely&#039;s picking me and my niece up from my house about past eight I think.</div><div id="00:13:24.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Because she&#039;s got to drive from my house to wherever the coach is and then the coach will pick us all up and then drive us to where we&#039;ve got to go.</div><div id="00:13:33.500" class="transcript_line"> And then we do a few dance and then get back on the coach and then whatever. And then I&#039;m staying at my dad&#039;s Saturday night with my niece.</div><div id="00:13:40.500" class="transcript_line"> So what kind of dancing is that? It&#039;s like, it&#039;s widows with sticks and all and we do like the seven tunnel much one lock, garers, fairy, old town and everything.</div><div id="00:13:59.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So is that what you&#039;d call Morris dancing? Yeah. Am I right in saying that? Yeah. How long have you been doing that for?</div><div id="00:14:06.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure because I&#039;ll tell you the story of this, mate. I went into town one day, one day where I used to live somewhere, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:14:18.500" class="transcript_line"> And I walked down the road and I was like, right, left, right. I was like, what the hell is all this? Jingle, jingle, jingle.</div><div id="00:14:24.500" class="transcript_line"> I was like, what the hell is all this? They&#039;re all camping at the school, coming down the hill with all the jangles and raggles and stuff.</div><div id="00:14:32.500" class="transcript_line"> And I went in there with them and I went, hiya, my name is so and so and so. I don&#039;t know if Keely was there, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:14:41.500" class="transcript_line"> So and so and so. And I stayed with them and mum run me, you&#039;re not in the way, are you? I went, no, not in the way.</div><div id="00:14:49.500" class="transcript_line"> And they let me play the tambourine. They went, bloody hell, Kyle, you&#039;ve got the beat. I said, right, okay. So then she run me again.</div><div id="00:14:57.500" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m not in the way. And they took me to a, they was dancing at the Chepstow Castle up the steps.</div><div id="00:15:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I went up there and I said, can I come? Yeah, yeah, of course you can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:06.500" class="transcript_line"> So I went up there. But I didn&#039;t like coming down the steps because it&#039;s like that and I don&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:15:11.500" class="transcript_line"> Bit too steep. So yeah, so I had one of the widows still with my hand all the way down the bottom.</div><div id="00:15:16.500" class="transcript_line"> And I said to my mum, I&#039;m joining the widows. She went, no, you&#039;re not. I said, yes, I am.</div><div id="00:15:21.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m one of the widows guys. He&#039;s dead now. Right. He gave us a crawling tent, like a crawling tent.</div><div id="00:15:29.500" class="transcript_line"> And mum went, oh, what? We&#039;re in one of them. I said, yeah, yes, we&#039;re in one of them.</div><div id="00:15:34.500" class="transcript_line"> And we had the air bed. Do you know what the name of the air bed, Mike? Is this when you&#039;re camping with the widows?</div><div id="00:15:39.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time widows. You know the air bed she lie on? The bed went.</div><div id="00:15:43.500" class="transcript_line"> And mum said, that is it. We&#039;re not doing camping anymore. I said, yeah, we are.</div><div id="00:15:48.500" class="transcript_line"> So now she&#039;s got a camper van now so we can do all the widows and everything.</div><div id="00:15:53.500" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so you&#039;re camping in style now. Yeah, yeah. Lovely.</div><div id="00:15:56.500" class="transcript_line"> Because all the widows took the mick out of us because when we all had the tent, we had everything.</div><div id="00:16:01.500" class="transcript_line"> And they all took the mick out of us. Oh, look at them. And they took the mick out of us.</div><div id="00:16:07.500" class="transcript_line"> And they took the mick out of us. Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:09.500" class="transcript_line"> One of our widows, Fran&#039;s partner, Mike, like you, tall like you, he&#039;s not here anymore.</div><div id="00:16:16.500" class="transcript_line"> He passed away. Two of my widows have passed away. And he was drinking like you do, Mike.</div><div id="00:16:22.500" class="transcript_line"> And he got up to have a drink. We&#039;ll edit that bit actually.</div><div id="00:16:25.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. He got up to have a drink. And he fell over all over the tent.</div><div id="00:16:30.500" class="transcript_line"> Went flying over the tent to go to the toilet. We were all laughing at him.</div><div id="00:16:34.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve done that a few times at festivals. Those guy ropes are deadly.</div><div id="00:16:38.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and he fell over and we were like, what are you doing?</div><div id="00:16:41.500" class="transcript_line"> And one of my cousins, he&#039;s my cousin. I didn&#039;t know he was my cousin.</div><div id="00:16:45.500" class="transcript_line"> Reece, who&#039;s my cousin who lives in Caldecon. I didn&#039;t know he was my cousin.</div><div id="00:16:51.500" class="transcript_line"> And he scared the hell out of me. I was only crying because he&#039;s my cousin and I&#039;m like, like you would.</div><div id="00:16:57.500" class="transcript_line"> My other cousin, Terry, who takes the widows now.</div><div id="00:17:01.500" class="transcript_line"> We camped up like the river, like the river, you know these long rivers, what takes really too far down.</div><div id="00:17:08.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And my cousin went, oh, I know what to do. Yeah. I said, what are you doing, Terry?</div><div id="00:17:13.500" class="transcript_line"> He went to the river to wash all this black off. And my cousin fell straight in the river,</div><div id="00:17:18.500" class="transcript_line"> holding a tree trunk, going, help, help.</div><div id="00:17:23.500" class="transcript_line"> And I think there was about five guys or six sides to drag him out because he&#039;s a big lad.</div><div id="00:17:28.500" class="transcript_line"> There was a couple of guys dragging him out, trying to get him out the pool.</div><div id="00:17:31.500" class="transcript_line"> So it sounds like you have a lot of fun with the widows on your trips.</div><div id="00:17:35.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we have loads of fun with the widows and having a laugh.</div><div id="00:17:39.500" class="transcript_line"> And it all started by just asking if you could join in. Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:43.500" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re saying about he was at the river washing the black off his face.</div><div id="00:17:47.500" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s because you wear all black makeup over your face.</div><div id="00:17:50.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but we can&#039;t, we can&#039;t wear that anymore because it&#039;s races or sun ink. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:17:57.500" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re not allowed to put any widows through sometimes like Keely does,</div><div id="00:18:01.500" class="transcript_line"> but sometimes we get told off by my cousin Terry because Terry takes it now.</div><div id="00:18:05.500" class="transcript_line"> But make use to take it, but you don&#039;t take it anymore because we left some of the widows.</div><div id="00:18:10.500" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re black in and they all had the arguments and everything.</div><div id="00:18:14.500" class="transcript_line"> Keely will explain that to you, but I can&#039;t get the word out.</div><div id="00:18:18.500" class="transcript_line"> So some of the widows are left, but we&#039;ve got some new people in there.</div><div id="00:18:23.500" class="transcript_line"> And some people just put like swirls and dots and lines across.</div><div id="00:18:28.500" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t last time and I got told off by my cousin.</div><div id="00:18:32.500" class="transcript_line"> He was like, you&#039;re not allowed to do that.</div><div id="00:18:35.500" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to put purple or blue on your face.</div><div id="00:18:38.500" class="transcript_line"> Do you understand why they don&#039;t do that anymore?</div><div id="00:18:41.500" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s like a racist or something.</div><div id="00:18:45.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;re along the right lines. Yeah, something like that. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:18:49.500" class="transcript_line"> People of colour, people with black skin were often shown in films and stuff</div><div id="00:18:56.500" class="transcript_line"> as not in a very nice way.</div><div id="00:18:59.500" class="transcript_line"> White people used to put black makeup on to make themselves look like black people.</div><div id="00:19:04.500" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not very good taste and it can be seen as racist.</div><div id="00:19:09.500" class="transcript_line"> But I know the widows, that was never their intention.</div><div id="00:19:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Because I think you&#039;re meant to look ghostly and ghoulish, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:19:16.500" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re almost kind of scary.</div><div id="00:19:18.500" class="transcript_line"> And my nunty does it with me as well. My niece does it with me.</div><div id="00:19:22.500" class="transcript_line"> But she done it in Chepstow one day and all her mates took the piss out of her,</div><div id="00:19:26.500" class="transcript_line"> laughed at her and made her cry.</div><div id="00:19:29.500" class="transcript_line"> And she won&#039;t dance around here.
