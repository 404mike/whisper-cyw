    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Track 10. Ditch blocking. It is a fantastic story just by sending a little digger down</div><div id="00:00:08.400" class="transcript_line"> there. In the weird and wonderful world that we live in, it seems funny that today&#039;s farmers</div><div id="00:00:15.240" class="transcript_line"> are being paid to undo the work they did in the years after the Second World War. Here</div><div id="00:00:20.360" class="transcript_line"> at Glass Lynn on the Begallion Estate and elsewhere the Pimliman project is busy blocking</div><div id="00:00:26.180" class="transcript_line"> ditches and re-wetting areas of blanket bog. As Clive explains, our knowledge and needs</div><div id="00:00:33.580" class="transcript_line"> are different today. I guess you&#039;ve got to accept the fact that times change and what</div><div id="00:00:38.420" class="transcript_line"> society needs changes. What we&#039;d like to do is help the farmers to prevent floods and</div><div id="00:00:45.780" class="transcript_line"> to lock up the carbon, make sure the carbon is locked up in their hills in the landscape,</div><div id="00:00:51.420" class="transcript_line"> The peat is a result of the dying back of vegetation that grows on the blanket bog and</div><div id="00:00:59.100" class="transcript_line"> if this vegetation is healthy and growing then the peat gradually gets deeper and deeper.</div><div id="00:01:05.540" class="transcript_line"> That in itself helps to hold more carbon up here and a well-maintained peat bog also holds</div><div id="00:01:12.260" class="transcript_line"> an enormous amount of water. So how is a healthy bog maintained? Like many of the species found</div><div id="00:01:19.660" class="transcript_line"> here the work is subtle but no less important. What we&#039;re doing is we are coming up with</div><div id="00:01:25.020" class="transcript_line"> a three tonne digger and we&#039;re sending the digger down the ditches and they&#039;re scooping</div><div id="00:01:31.900" class="transcript_line"> out every now and again they&#039;ll scoop out a bit of the ditch and they&#039;ll use the peat</div><div id="00:01:35.660" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;ve scooped to make a pool and with the peat that they&#039;ve dug out of the pool</div><div id="00:01:40.860" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ll use to block the ditch and then they&#039;ll trundle on a bit and then they&#039;ll do the same</div><div id="00:01:46.020" class="transcript_line"> and of course the whole idea then is that instead of having a ditch which drains the</div><div id="00:01:50.580" class="transcript_line"> water out into the river causing the flood causing the peat to degrade suddenly you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:01:55.940" class="transcript_line"> got a flooded pool. Beautiful for the dragonflies, beautiful for the little passage birds. So</div><div id="00:02:03.620" class="transcript_line"> what you end up with is a string of little pools and little bunds where once there was</div><div id="00:02:09.100" class="transcript_line"> a ditch and every time it rains the water seeps from one pool to the next it doesn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:13.460" class="transcript_line"> gush it&#039;s held it&#039;s checked back and it stops that water gushing down into the streams into</div><div id="00:02:18.340" class="transcript_line"> the rivers and flooding our lowlands. So it&#039;s great you&#039;re making habitats for wildlife</div><div id="00:02:23.460" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re preventing flooding in the lowlands and you&#039;re locking away carbon preventing</div><div id="00:02:29.860" class="transcript_line"> the emissions of greenhouse gases. It&#039;s a fantastic story just by sending a little digger</div><div id="00:02:34.460" class="transcript_line"> down there creating a minimal impact. You wouldn&#039;t even notice it if you didn&#039;t look</div><div id="00:02:40.340" class="transcript_line"> hard and yet providing those three fabulous services. So next time you hear a new story</div><div id="00:02:46.980" class="transcript_line"> concerning climate change or flooding perhaps you will think about the work taking place here</div><div id="00:02:53.620" class="transcript_line"> return in a few years time and you may even be able to notice the subtle changes taking place.</div><div id="00:03:00.500" class="transcript_line"> We do hope you have enjoyed this audio trails production. Continue along the track for vehicles</div><div id="00:03:07.380" class="transcript_line"> bearing left at a fork and down to the cattle grid at the turn off to glass lane car park stop</div><div id="00:03:13.620" class="transcript_line"> four. Head past the point where you came in on Glyndwr&#039;s way and follow the very pothole track</div><div id="00:03:21.700" class="transcript_line"> all the way back to the mountain road crossing another cattle grid on the way and a final one</div><div id="00:03:27.060" class="transcript_line"> when you reach the road. You can of course retrace your steps past stops two and three</div><div id="00:03:33.460" class="transcript_line"> over Voilvadian if you want to but continuing on the main track is shorter and easier.</div><div id="00:03:40.020" class="transcript_line"> When you reach the road take care crossing over then turn left and follow it down to the memorial</div><div id="00:03:46.260" class="transcript_line"> that will be on your left. Please take great care walking along this road as it gets quite busy at</div><div id="00:03:52.660" class="transcript_line"> times. Have a safe journey back to the memorial and then home. Goodbye.</div></div></p>
