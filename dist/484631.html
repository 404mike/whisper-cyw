Interviewer, Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:06.880" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee, Sophia Kahn.</div><div id="00:00:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Location of interview, Swicker Office.</div><div id="00:00:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date is the 12th of October, 2015.</div><div id="00:00:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Sophia, before we start, would you be kind enough</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> for the record to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Steve.</div><div id="00:00:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Sophia S-O-P-H-I-A, Kahn, K-H-A-N.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:00:31.440" class="transcript_line"> So, when did you first, and how did you first</div><div id="00:00:35.240" class="transcript_line"> make contact with the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:38.300" class="transcript_line"> It was through my steel pan teacher at the time, Wadda.</div><div id="00:00:43.440" class="transcript_line"> I was 14 and I&#039;d been playing steel pans for him.</div><div id="00:00:48.920" class="transcript_line"> Actually, he&#039;d been teaching me in school,</div><div id="00:00:51.800" class="transcript_line"> and then he got me and my friend involved</div><div id="00:00:56.240" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff Carnival.</div><div id="00:00:57.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:00:58.160" class="transcript_line"> Were you at Fitzhallen High School</div><div id="00:01:00.160" class="transcript_line"> or were you?</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I was in Lamb Remney High.</div><div id="00:01:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:01:03.360" class="transcript_line"> In Lamb Remney.</div><div id="00:01:04.200" class="transcript_line"> And of course, for those who don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:01:06.440" class="transcript_line"> and for future posterity, Wadda, his official name,</div><div id="00:01:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Hubert Placide, is from the wonderful Caribbean island</div><div id="00:01:13.240" class="transcript_line"> of St. Lucia, and I had the pleasure of meeting him</div><div id="00:01:16.560" class="transcript_line"> for the first time in 1991 when Swicker was based</div><div id="00:01:21.840" class="transcript_line"> in Channelview Leicester Centre down in Grangetown</div><div id="00:01:25.520" class="transcript_line"> when I had a knock on the office door</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> and Mike Johnson, who ran the centre, said,</div><div id="00:01:30.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve just had somebody pop in from the Caribbean</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s wondering if there&#039;s any bar work,</div><div id="00:01:35.600" class="transcript_line"> but he plays steel pans.</div><div id="00:01:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And that was, he introduced me to Wadda,</div><div id="00:01:41.200" class="transcript_line"> and way back then we brought the first set of steel pans</div><div id="00:01:47.720" class="transcript_line"> and put him on wage, and that&#039;s when he began</div><div id="00:01:50.760" class="transcript_line"> teaching steel pan, primarily in schools, back in 1991.</div><div id="00:01:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And here we are in 2002, and he&#039;s introduced you</div><div id="00:01:58.760" class="transcript_line"> to Cardiff Carnival, you&#039;re playing pan regularly.</div><div id="00:02:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember a little bit about your record</div><div id="00:02:05.080" class="transcript_line"> as a panist, a pan man, woman in pan?</div><div id="00:02:08.920" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t decide pan player, we couldn&#039;t decide</div><div id="00:02:11.400" class="transcript_line"> what to call you in our preamble.</div><div id="00:02:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, take a-</div><div id="00:02:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Pan person.</div><div id="00:02:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Pan person, I like it.</div><div id="00:02:16.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, so the area of Cardiff, which I&#039;m from,</div><div id="00:02:22.760" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t know about Cardiff Carnival at all,</div><div id="00:02:26.680" class="transcript_line"> and it was a new thing to us.</div><div id="00:02:30.640" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, Wadda told my friends and I about it.</div><div id="00:02:36.800" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, he brought us down on the,</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a launch party,</div><div id="00:02:41.960" class="transcript_line"> so we could have a look around.</div><div id="00:02:42.800" class="transcript_line"> And this would be to the Butown Youth Pavilion?</div><div id="00:02:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Butown Youth Pavilion, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:45.640" class="transcript_line"> Excellent, down the docks.</div><div id="00:02:47.680" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, from there, my friend Nina Kiaga,</div><div id="00:02:52.520" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s been involved for a long time,</div><div id="00:02:55.400" class="transcript_line"> we both got involved at the age of 14.</div><div id="00:02:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, Wadda was a great mentor, he was a great teacher.</div><div id="00:03:03.760" class="transcript_line"> And he, oh, from that day, from that time,</div><div id="00:03:08.600" class="transcript_line"> we had gone on then to do street parades in Carmarthen,</div><div id="00:03:13.800" class="transcript_line"> and then we started doing Swansea Carnival as well.</div><div id="00:03:15.920" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:03:16.760" class="transcript_line"> So he kind of linked us in from there</div><div id="00:03:18.840" class="transcript_line"> to do other youth projects.</div><div id="00:03:22.280" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m right in thinking, Cardiff Carnival 2002,</div><div id="00:03:26.080" class="transcript_line"> the steel pan was performed not on the back of a lorry,</div><div id="00:03:29.600" class="transcript_line"> not walking with your pan set inside a float,</div><div id="00:03:33.720" class="transcript_line"> but it was actually a Caribbean format</div><div id="00:03:36.680" class="transcript_line"> called Pan Round the Neck.</div><div id="00:03:38.440" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the carnival team,</div><div id="00:03:41.040" class="transcript_line"> and certainly Wadda giving us instructions</div><div id="00:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> as to how to make the backpacks</div><div id="00:03:45.320" class="transcript_line"> to hang the steel pans off</div><div id="00:03:48.040" class="transcript_line"> so that they&#039;re in front of you and you&#039;re there playing.</div><div id="00:03:53.040" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned that Wadda gave you some very good advice</div><div id="00:03:56.040" class="transcript_line"> in the event that you were to drop your pan sticks</div><div id="00:03:59.440" class="transcript_line"> whilst on parade.</div><div id="00:04:00.800" class="transcript_line"> What was his advice to you?</div><div id="00:04:02.360" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, he said, if we drop our sticks,</div><div id="00:04:06.800" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no way we can pick them up again.</div><div id="00:04:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was nice because you&#039;d always have someone</div><div id="00:04:12.480" class="transcript_line"> running behind you, giving you water.</div><div id="00:04:14.240" class="transcript_line"> They would pick your sticks up.</div><div id="00:04:16.640" class="transcript_line"> But we had, well, other weeks leading up to carnival,</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> we could decorate our backpacks.</div><div id="00:04:25.360" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d use straps of material</div><div id="00:04:30.280" class="transcript_line"> to wind around the shoulders and the harness.</div><div id="00:04:35.800" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d kind of make pockets to put extra sticks in.</div><div id="00:04:40.040" class="transcript_line"> So we could just grip them out.</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Kind of like a drummer when they&#039;ve got spare sticks</div><div id="00:04:45.520" class="transcript_line"> in their back, like a little backpack.</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking of more of an archer actually</div><div id="00:04:50.640" class="transcript_line"> reaching for his bow and arrows behind him</div><div id="00:04:52.560" class="transcript_line"> when he did that.</div><div id="00:04:54.240" class="transcript_line"> It was like, next one, you know.</div><div id="00:04:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Bish bash bosh.</div><div id="00:04:58.240" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, you know, Wadda taught in a way</div><div id="00:05:02.760" class="transcript_line"> that everyone can play, even when people would say,</div><div id="00:05:07.840" class="transcript_line"> oh, you know, I&#039;m not musically minded at all</div><div id="00:05:11.560" class="transcript_line"> and I have no rhythm.</div><div id="00:05:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Wadda&#039;s got a gift that anyone, anyone of any background,</div><div id="00:05:20.640" class="transcript_line"> any walk of life, the kids, he, like, you could play pans.</div><div id="00:05:25.240" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d teach you in such a way that would liberate you</div><div id="00:05:30.280" class="transcript_line"> and make you feel that, you know, basically,</div><div id="00:05:33.520" class="transcript_line"> like when you&#039;re there on the pan, you were invincible.</div><div id="00:05:36.840" class="transcript_line"> But in a good way.</div><div id="00:05:37.680" class="transcript_line"> In a good way.</div><div id="00:05:38.520" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, you know, especially for, you know,</div><div id="00:05:42.360" class="transcript_line"> at the time I just lost my father and for a girl of 14,</div><div id="00:05:49.680" class="transcript_line"> that was the best therapy anyone could ever give to me.</div><div id="00:05:53.200" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and I always take my hat off to Wadda</div><div id="00:05:55.600" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;ll always hold a dear place in my heart</div><div id="00:05:58.440" class="transcript_line"> because, yeah, he opened up a door to me</div><div id="00:06:02.640" class="transcript_line"> that I never knew existed.</div><div id="00:06:05.040" class="transcript_line"> And did you start off on bass pans,</div><div id="00:06:07.280" class="transcript_line"> which of course are six full oil drums on the floor?</div><div id="00:06:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:12.120" class="transcript_line"> One person playing six drums has always,</div><div id="00:06:14.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always thought that person is just like,</div><div id="00:06:16.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah, the way they swivel around.</div><div id="00:06:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when I started playing, it was eight drums.</div><div id="00:06:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:06:22.560" class="transcript_line"> With you in the centre.</div><div id="00:06:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sometimes it&#039;s eight, sometimes it&#039;s six.</div><div id="00:06:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:27.960" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I started playing bass, bass drum.</div><div id="00:06:30.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where I was.</div><div id="00:06:32.080" class="transcript_line"> And then I moved on to,</div><div id="00:06:33.760" class="transcript_line"> but when I played in Carnival, I started on guitar.</div><div id="00:06:36.120" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:06:37.920" class="transcript_line"> So when you&#039;re walking with a pan, they get condensed down.</div><div id="00:06:41.920" class="transcript_line"> So guitars usually two pans,</div><div id="00:06:44.720" class="transcript_line"> but when you&#039;re walking, it turns into one.</div><div id="00:06:46.520" class="transcript_line"> A pan round the neck, it&#039;s gotta be one.</div><div id="00:06:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:48.760" class="transcript_line"> And then as time went on,</div><div id="00:06:53.280" class="transcript_line"> I moved on to tenor,</div><div id="00:06:54.920" class="transcript_line"> which is kind of like the vocals of the band.</div><div id="00:06:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Which was amazing.</div><div id="00:06:59.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s perfect.</div><div id="00:07:00.800" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:07:01.640" class="transcript_line"> It was nice to be able to play,</div><div id="00:07:03.720" class="transcript_line"> you know, a few different parts in the pan orchestra.</div><div id="00:07:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:07.680" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:07:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:09.360" class="transcript_line"> When Wada was leading the pan round the neck group on Parade,</div><div id="00:07:13.720" class="transcript_line"> would he be playing pan or would he be on a cowbell</div><div id="00:07:16.560" class="transcript_line"> with a whistle at the front, giving you the basic rhythm?</div><div id="00:07:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, he&#039;s facing you, isn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:07:21.520" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s facing, like Samba Galeas,</div><div id="00:07:23.520" class="transcript_line"> their musical director faces the players,</div><div id="00:07:25.680" class="transcript_line"> as his back to the audience.</div><div id="00:07:27.160" class="transcript_line"> So at times he&#039;d either be on a snare.</div><div id="00:07:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:07:30.160" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d be playing snare.</div><div id="00:07:31.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Or he&#039;d be on a whistle with a cowbell.</div><div id="00:07:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:36.920" class="transcript_line"> But Wada would be getting involved.</div><div id="00:07:39.200" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d always have a set of sticks on him.</div><div id="00:07:41.120" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d just like jump in and you&#039;d be playing pan.</div><div id="00:07:43.880" class="transcript_line"> On your pan?</div><div id="00:07:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:07:45.560" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d play like, you know, an extra few notes.</div><div id="00:07:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And it was nice because he would get involved.</div><div id="00:07:49.440" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t just like, okay, I&#039;m the, you know,</div><div id="00:07:52.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m beating this.</div><div id="00:07:54.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:55.800" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d really get involved.</div><div id="00:07:56.920" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d always pick the parts.</div><div id="00:07:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Like the icing on the cake.</div><div id="00:07:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Even when the years, it would rain so much.</div><div id="00:08:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:08:02.600" class="transcript_line"> It would be really hard to play your pan.</div><div id="00:08:03.720" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have to keep tipping it out.</div><div id="00:08:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s talk about, yeah, so you literally had to,</div><div id="00:08:08.480" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when, you know,</div><div id="00:08:09.600" class="transcript_line"> when we knew that the forecast was bad,</div><div id="00:08:11.600" class="transcript_line"> that amongst our shopping lists for the day would be</div><div id="00:08:14.720" class="transcript_line"> huge amounts of, the most absorbent kitchen roll</div><div id="00:08:18.440" class="transcript_line"> we could think of.</div><div id="00:08:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Because for a nanosecond, we could wipe the pans</div><div id="00:08:23.160" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d be back to where you started.</div><div id="00:08:25.360" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, so you came on, what can be called</div><div id="00:08:28.600" class="transcript_line"> a few of the deluge years.</div><div id="00:08:29.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think the worst year was when</div><div id="00:08:32.360" class="transcript_line"> we first got put on a float.</div><div id="00:08:34.360" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Did it have a roof on it or not?</div><div id="00:08:38.280" class="transcript_line"> No, it didn&#039;t have it.</div><div id="00:08:39.920" class="transcript_line"> We learned to put roofs on them eventually.</div><div id="00:08:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:42.640" class="transcript_line"> And it was the year that we were down the oval basin.</div><div id="00:08:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:48.160" class="transcript_line"> And they had all the decking.</div><div id="00:08:50.280" class="transcript_line"> So the bag got really, really slippery.</div><div id="00:08:53.080" class="transcript_line"> All the Samba girls had to take their heels off</div><div id="00:08:54.960" class="transcript_line"> because they couldn&#039;t dance on it at all.</div><div id="00:08:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:59.160" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it was literally,</div><div id="00:09:00.400" class="transcript_line"> it was really hard to play any songs.</div><div id="00:09:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Why do I care if our spirits are up?</div><div id="00:09:04.400" class="transcript_line"> Our face painted, washed away.</div><div id="00:09:07.760" class="transcript_line"> We kind of looked like drowned rats.</div><div id="00:09:10.360" class="transcript_line"> But happy carnival drowned rats.</div><div id="00:09:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was happy.</div><div id="00:09:13.360" class="transcript_line"> And I just remember every two minutes</div><div id="00:09:15.480" class="transcript_line"> having to empty my pan of water and gather up the rest.</div><div id="00:09:19.080" class="transcript_line"> This is steel panning Wales, folks.</div><div id="00:09:20.720" class="transcript_line"> You know, the truth behind the...</div><div id="00:09:23.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was fun.</div><div id="00:09:24.840" class="transcript_line"> It was fun.</div><div id="00:09:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the audience&#039;s reaction</div><div id="00:09:27.400" class="transcript_line"> because we don&#039;t hear as much steel panning Wales</div><div id="00:09:29.640" class="transcript_line"> as perhaps we ought to do, you know,</div><div id="00:09:30.920" class="transcript_line"> so that when there is a chance to hear it in a public...</div><div id="00:09:34.360" class="transcript_line"> For me, I can always tell where the pan band was</div><div id="00:09:37.240" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s something about that music</div><div id="00:09:39.480" class="transcript_line"> that seems to touch everybody.</div><div id="00:09:41.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, that really, you could tell.</div><div id="00:09:42.360" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;ll be smiles and cheers</div><div id="00:09:43.640" class="transcript_line"> and you just know where the pan band was passing</div><div id="00:09:45.720" class="transcript_line"> at that point.</div><div id="00:09:46.800" class="transcript_line"> I never saw people turn...</div><div id="00:09:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it seems to me that steel pan has a universality</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and an uplifting...</div><div id="00:09:54.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s something about it that brings out the best</div><div id="00:09:56.120" class="transcript_line"> in the audience as well.</div><div id="00:09:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Steel pan has got the ability.</div><div id="00:10:01.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, every instrument has got the ability.</div><div id="00:10:05.480" class="transcript_line"> When it&#039;s played and played right,</div><div id="00:10:07.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, it can touch everyone.</div><div id="00:10:09.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, it does.</div><div id="00:10:11.320" class="transcript_line"> It touches your soul.</div><div id="00:10:12.960" class="transcript_line"> But steel pan has got the ability</div><div id="00:10:16.880" class="transcript_line"> for someone who thinks they can&#039;t play an instrument</div><div id="00:10:21.400" class="transcript_line"> to be able to play it and feel like a virtuoso.</div><div id="00:10:26.720" class="transcript_line"> And I think...</div><div id="00:10:28.360" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s really accessible, basically.</div><div id="00:10:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it&#039;s got such a life to it.</div><div id="00:10:34.040" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s, you know, at the end of the day, it&#039;s an oil drum.</div><div id="00:10:37.120" class="transcript_line"> A guitar is made in a way it is crafted.</div><div id="00:10:39.520" class="transcript_line"> And even though a pan is made,</div><div id="00:10:43.520" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s...</div><div id="00:10:45.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s kind of...</div><div id="00:10:47.560" class="transcript_line"> It has.</div><div id="00:10:48.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s made the same way as guitars,</div><div id="00:10:49.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s got all the love and, you know,</div><div id="00:10:51.240" class="transcript_line"> all the devotion in it.</div><div id="00:10:52.960" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s a drum at the end of the day.</div><div id="00:10:56.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an oil drum.</div><div id="00:10:57.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an oil drum.</div><div id="00:10:58.400" class="transcript_line"> It was used and then it&#039;s been recycled into something</div><div id="00:11:02.200" class="transcript_line"> that makes the most beautiful sound</div><div id="00:11:04.160" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;d never think would come out of an oil drum.</div><div id="00:11:08.080" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, as soon as you play</div><div id="00:11:10.200" class="transcript_line"> and you see the reaction of the people,</div><div id="00:11:17.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah, it just makes you want to play more.</div><div id="00:11:19.560" class="transcript_line"> And it takes you to a place.</div><div id="00:11:21.760" class="transcript_line"> And especially as a child, you know,</div><div id="00:11:24.600" class="transcript_line"> it takes you to a place which you don&#039;t even know exists</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and it lets your imagination free.</div><div id="00:11:30.840" class="transcript_line"> So your carnival history began as a pan player, a panist.</div><div id="00:11:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Other members of your family were also involved</div><div id="00:11:40.920" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff Carnival in different respects.</div><div id="00:11:43.320" class="transcript_line"> As musicians, as dance tutors,</div><div id="00:11:45.720" class="transcript_line"> and I suppose everyone gets involved in the making.</div><div id="00:11:49.520" class="transcript_line"> So after several years with Wadda and the Steel Pan Group,</div><div id="00:11:53.960" class="transcript_line"> playing pan around the neck,</div><div id="00:11:55.440" class="transcript_line"> we get to as late as Cardiff Carnival, 2011, Magic.</div><div id="00:12:02.080" class="transcript_line"> And there was a very, very popular, in fact, yes,</div><div id="00:12:07.240" class="transcript_line"> I think it started off relatively small,</div><div id="00:12:09.560" class="transcript_line"> the American Indian section.</div><div id="00:12:11.440" class="transcript_line"> And you ended up making your first ever</div><div id="00:12:16.360" class="transcript_line"> queen costume on a backpack.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t wear the backpack, but-</div><div id="00:12:23.520" class="transcript_line"> You designed it, you made it?</div><div id="00:12:24.960" class="transcript_line"> I had-</div><div id="00:12:26.720" class="transcript_line"> You plucked those chickens?</div><div id="00:12:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well-</div><div id="00:12:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Little balled chickens in China is all I can say.</div><div id="00:12:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Adrian gave me an unlimited supply of feathers.</div><div id="00:12:36.440" class="transcript_line"> And wire.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I made my first headdress, big headdress.</div><div id="00:12:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Was there any glue gunning involved?</div><div id="00:12:48.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I always associate the smell of burning human flesh</div><div id="00:12:51.320" class="transcript_line"> with the carnival camp.</div><div id="00:12:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a lot of burning flesh.</div><div id="00:12:54.400" class="transcript_line"> It was a lot of glue gunning.</div><div id="00:12:55.240" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:12:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Pastor Bernie&#039;s, that&#039;s a-</div><div id="00:12:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it was, yeah, it was brilliant.</div><div id="00:13:01.120" class="transcript_line"> It was the first year that I got involved dancing.</div><div id="00:13:07.120" class="transcript_line"> And I would have done pans if Wazza had been involved.</div><div id="00:13:12.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite, yeah, it was quite hard for me</div><div id="00:13:14.600" class="transcript_line"> because I wasn&#039;t gonna get involved in the first place.</div><div id="00:13:18.240" class="transcript_line"> Because, yeah, my heart lied with the pans.</div><div id="00:13:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:13:26.160" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, so it was only because of my sister</div><div id="00:13:30.800" class="transcript_line"> that I got back and, well, I came back to carnival.</div><div id="00:13:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:13:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I had a really good time.</div><div id="00:13:39.240" class="transcript_line"> It was, yeah, it was really good being able to dance</div><div id="00:13:42.760" class="transcript_line"> and not play pans.</div><div id="00:13:43.960" class="transcript_line"> And the carnival camp would have been</div><div id="00:13:45.680" class="transcript_line"> at Channel View Leisure Center then.</div><div id="00:13:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, I remember on the one hand,</div><div id="00:13:50.800" class="transcript_line"> we were lucky to secure a big space</div><div id="00:13:52.520" class="transcript_line"> because we need lots of room.</div><div id="00:13:54.520" class="transcript_line"> But did the lack of natural daylight in there</div><div id="00:13:57.400" class="transcript_line"> ever do your head in?</div><div id="00:13:58.480" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit like going into sodium-lit hell</div><div id="00:14:01.040" class="transcript_line"> after a while, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was quite hard.</div><div id="00:14:04.440" class="transcript_line"> But at the same time, I was used to working backstage</div><div id="00:14:07.760" class="transcript_line"> in theater so you don&#039;t have-</div><div id="00:14:10.240" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t need natural daylight or fresh air</div><div id="00:14:12.360" class="transcript_line"> or any of those vitamins or whatever.</div><div id="00:14:16.160" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re for whips.</div><div id="00:14:17.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was quite a change.</div><div id="00:14:20.720" class="transcript_line"> I think in the pavilion, there was more of an atmosphere.</div><div id="00:14:25.480" class="transcript_line"> Like that.</div><div id="00:14:26.800" class="transcript_line"> It had been more than five.</div><div id="00:14:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And certainly we had to park outside</div><div id="00:14:29.320" class="transcript_line"> when the weather was good.</div><div id="00:14:30.160" class="transcript_line"> We could take work outside.</div><div id="00:14:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Which was really nice.</div><div id="00:14:33.160" class="transcript_line"> So Channel View was quite restricted in a way.</div><div id="00:14:37.160" class="transcript_line"> And I think a lot of the public felt that as well.</div><div id="00:14:40.360" class="transcript_line"> So I think maybe that&#039;s why you didn&#039;t get</div><div id="00:14:43.280" class="transcript_line"> as many participators as you normally would.</div><div id="00:14:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Like that.</div><div id="00:14:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Just because Carnival is built on vibe,</div><div id="00:14:50.480" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s built on feeling, it&#039;s built on emotions.</div><div id="00:14:53.160" class="transcript_line"> And workshop is exactly the same.</div><div id="00:14:55.800" class="transcript_line"> So if there&#039;s something lacking in that,</div><div id="00:14:59.560" class="transcript_line"> then people go off feelings, they go off their vibe.</div><div id="00:15:02.160" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I think that&#039;s why maybe-</div><div id="00:15:03.920" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I can see, respect that.</div><div id="00:15:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, maybe it hadn&#039;t hit the numbers</div><div id="00:15:08.520" class="transcript_line"> that everyone thought it was.</div><div id="00:15:11.080" class="transcript_line"> But it was great.</div><div id="00:15:11.920" class="transcript_line"> I had a good time and enjoyed everything.</div><div id="00:15:14.240" class="transcript_line"> So if you decided to make the giant backpack</div><div id="00:15:18.640" class="transcript_line"> with unlimited feathers, I love that idea.</div><div id="00:15:20.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good name.</div><div id="00:15:21.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good name for a carnival company, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:15:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Unlimited feathers.</div><div id="00:15:24.480" class="transcript_line"> We might use that in the future.</div><div id="00:15:27.520" class="transcript_line"> Were you in the American Indian section</div><div id="00:15:30.360" class="transcript_line"> when you were dancing on the parade or not?</div><div id="00:15:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Because you said you didn&#039;t play it.</div><div id="00:15:32.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:33.480" class="transcript_line"> So you were around it and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:15:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And would your sister, Sakina Khan,</div><div id="00:15:37.680" class="transcript_line"> would she have dared to give you dance steps</div><div id="00:15:40.560" class="transcript_line"> or were you autonomous as a group?</div><div id="00:15:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:15:43.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she gave us a really good choreography</div><div id="00:15:47.720" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m not a dancer at all.</div><div id="00:15:49.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t claim to be a dancer.</div><div id="00:15:51.600" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it went well with the music.</div><div id="00:15:57.040" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I think there was 40-</div><div id="00:16:01.200" class="transcript_line"> It grew and grew and grew.</div><div id="00:16:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it grew.</div><div id="00:16:02.880" class="transcript_line"> It was a very popular section.</div><div id="00:16:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So I think at times, she made it well.</div><div id="00:16:08.360" class="transcript_line"> So the more it grew, the dance wasn&#039;t too complicated.</div><div id="00:16:14.760" class="transcript_line"> It would still look good though.</div><div id="00:16:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:16:16.960" class="transcript_line"> She still pulled it off.</div><div id="00:16:19.920" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I had fun doing it.</div><div id="00:16:23.080" class="transcript_line"> It was good.</div><div id="00:16:23.960" class="transcript_line"> It was a good experience.</div><div id="00:16:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:16:26.080" class="transcript_line"> And the following year, of course,</div><div id="00:16:29.520" class="transcript_line"> your brother was involved.</div><div id="00:16:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Take us through that year.</div><div id="00:16:32.880" class="transcript_line"> How did you get involved in the Blue Warriors, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:35.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember.</div><div id="00:16:37.120" class="transcript_line"> I had a break from the tour I was on.</div><div id="00:16:40.320" class="transcript_line"> So I came back to the UK</div><div id="00:16:42.760" class="transcript_line"> and I just popped down to say hello to everyone.</div><div id="00:16:46.920" class="transcript_line"> And it was the only time I was gonna get to see-</div><div id="00:16:48.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like being press gang, this bit, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, before-</div><div id="00:16:51.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like, well, you learned from that lesson, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:16:54.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then I saw Asia in</div><div id="00:16:58.560" class="transcript_line"> and then Kath, the seamstress at the time.</div><div id="00:17:01.440" class="transcript_line"> And they were like, oh, you should stay and help out.</div><div id="00:17:04.680" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, oh, okay.</div><div id="00:17:06.240" class="transcript_line"> So I was like, well, I&#039;ve got a few weeks off from work.</div><div id="00:17:09.560" class="transcript_line"> And then Misha and Naomi were there</div><div id="00:17:11.240" class="transcript_line"> and I hadn&#039;t seen them in a long time.</div><div id="00:17:13.280" class="transcript_line"> And I just ended up getting involved</div><div id="00:17:16.600" class="transcript_line"> and I wasn&#039;t gonna do it.</div><div id="00:17:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, oh, I wanted to break.</div><div id="00:17:20.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like my time off from work.</div><div id="00:17:23.120" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I did.</div><div id="00:17:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I had lots of fun with that.</div><div id="00:17:27.240" class="transcript_line"> And it was a nice difference.</div><div id="00:17:31.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a nice contrast from the previous year</div><div id="00:17:34.840" class="transcript_line"> with my sister.</div><div id="00:17:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so we were blue warriors there</div><div id="00:17:42.640" class="transcript_line"> and it was comfortable.</div><div id="00:17:45.480" class="transcript_line"> The costumes were so comfortable.</div><div id="00:17:47.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, they were daisy cutters, big baggy trousers.</div><div id="00:17:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I could see the royal blue, royal blue color.</div><div id="00:17:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Really beautiful, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:54.520" class="transcript_line"> And the royal blue and silver,</div><div id="00:17:56.800" class="transcript_line"> they really stood out.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They were really, really vibrant.</div><div id="00:17:59.360" class="transcript_line"> The head pieces again were more,</div><div id="00:18:01.680" class="transcript_line"> I would just say that the masculine version.</div><div id="00:18:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So you really could throw yourself around</div><div id="00:18:06.400" class="transcript_line"> if you weren&#039;t worried about something.</div><div id="00:18:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, and it was nice.</div><div id="00:18:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And Imran designed them in a way.</div><div id="00:18:11.120" class="transcript_line"> So even though he didn&#039;t use feathers,</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> the material he used, when it rained,</div><div id="00:18:20.440" class="transcript_line"> it didn&#039;t damage the headdress at all.</div><div id="00:18:23.320" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:24.160" class="transcript_line"> And it was really light on your head, really, really secure.</div><div id="00:18:28.360" class="transcript_line"> To be honest, it was the first time in Carnival</div><div id="00:18:32.360" class="transcript_line"> that I&#039;d worn a headdress, even when I was playing pans</div><div id="00:18:34.800" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d have to wear head pieces.</div><div id="00:18:38.120" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t feel like you were wearing anything.</div><div id="00:18:40.280" class="transcript_line"> So you could throw your head about,</div><div id="00:18:41.600" class="transcript_line"> you could do big jumps in the air, big kicks,</div><div id="00:18:43.680" class="transcript_line"> and it stayed on your head.</div><div id="00:18:45.960" class="transcript_line"> And it rained really bad that year.</div><div id="00:18:48.560" class="transcript_line"> It did, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:49.400" class="transcript_line"> It rained really bad.</div><div id="00:18:50.240" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s perfect because it was like plastic.</div><div id="00:18:52.360" class="transcript_line"> So it didn&#039;t even get wet.</div><div id="00:18:53.800" class="transcript_line"> Your head didn&#039;t even get wet.</div><div id="00:18:55.120" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like wearing an umbrella.</div><div id="00:18:57.040" class="transcript_line"> The perfect carnival headpiece in many ways.</div><div id="00:19:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Before we go on to your most, so we&#039;ve had Pam Blair,</div><div id="00:19:06.120" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve had Designing and Making, we&#039;ve had Dancing.</div><div id="00:19:09.400" class="transcript_line"> You really are a true carnivalist, I would say.</div><div id="00:19:13.520" class="transcript_line"> And then before we get into, or perhaps your final role,</div><div id="00:19:17.600" class="transcript_line"> which was this summer in 2015, well, let&#039;s go there</div><div id="00:19:19.920" class="transcript_line"> and explain a little bit about what you&#039;ve been doing</div><div id="00:19:22.760" class="transcript_line"> in the rest of your career, et cetera,</div><div id="00:19:25.200" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s a point of contact, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:19:27.400" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s obviously, carnival is about pressure.</div><div id="00:19:31.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about making whatever the resources,</div><div id="00:19:35.760" class="transcript_line"> we try to make them go twice as far.</div><div id="00:19:37.440" class="transcript_line"> We work in a mythical seventh gear.</div><div id="00:19:40.600" class="transcript_line"> The whole project starts with a deadline,</div><div id="00:19:43.400" class="transcript_line"> before the clock&#039;s ticking from day one.</div><div id="00:19:46.880" class="transcript_line"> And at the heart of that, we have the designer,</div><div id="00:19:49.080" class="transcript_line"> but their right-hand person is the seamstress,</div><div id="00:19:53.640" class="transcript_line"> the person who is overlooking the physical creation,</div><div id="00:19:57.440" class="transcript_line"> the interpretation of all these designs, who&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:20:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And you were the seamstress for Carder Carnival 2015.</div><div id="00:20:05.840" class="transcript_line"> How emotionally ascarred are you, Sophia, by that?</div><div id="00:20:09.760" class="transcript_line"> That was a joke.</div><div id="00:20:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Very emotionally ascarred.</div><div id="00:20:12.200" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:20:14.080" class="transcript_line"> She seems to be well.</div><div id="00:20:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, my job as a seamstress anyway,</div><div id="00:20:19.720" class="transcript_line"> and working in theater, and you know,</div><div id="00:20:22.720" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got deadlines on you constantly.</div><div id="00:20:24.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was, so yeah, you live on a deadline.</div><div id="00:20:29.520" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I was, to be honest, I was quite fine with that.</div><div id="00:20:35.800" class="transcript_line"> You look very much in your element.</div><div id="00:20:37.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:38.320" class="transcript_line"> And you had the right accessible, but authority as well,</div><div id="00:20:42.040" class="transcript_line"> which is, I&#039;m dealing with this person,</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> so wait patiently, and you will have my attention.</div><div id="00:20:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And it seemed like a formula that everybody,</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> by and large, understood, you know.</div><div id="00:20:53.360" class="transcript_line"> I think that could show that it came from your background.</div><div id="00:20:55.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;m thinking you&#039;ve worked,</div><div id="00:20:58.240" class="transcript_line"> oh, that&#039;s a name drop.</div><div id="00:21:00.360" class="transcript_line"> You worked on cruise ships,</div><div id="00:21:01.240" class="transcript_line"> but you also have worked as part of DreamWorks.</div><div id="00:21:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Was that a year-long tour of Madagascar?</div><div id="00:21:08.880" class="transcript_line"> I was impressed.</div><div id="00:21:09.840" class="transcript_line"> It was, yeah, so it was a year with DreamWorks.</div><div id="00:21:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, actually, I worked with DreamWorks longer than a year</div><div id="00:21:15.720" class="transcript_line"> because I did Ice Age on Ice with them.</div><div id="00:21:17.800" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:21:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Which was a cast of 44 people, 44 performers,</div><div id="00:21:23.360" class="transcript_line"> and the same amount. Touring UK or internationally?</div><div id="00:21:26.840" class="transcript_line"> We did some parts in the UK,</div><div id="00:21:29.360" class="transcript_line"> and that was the whole setup and rehearsal dates.</div><div id="00:21:34.320" class="transcript_line"> And then we went on to do a Germany tour,</div><div id="00:21:38.080" class="transcript_line"> and then once the Germany tour was finished,</div><div id="00:21:40.520" class="transcript_line"> I went on to set up Madagascar,</div><div id="00:21:43.640" class="transcript_line"> and then I toured with Madagascar.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We did a UK tour, which was amazing,</div><div id="00:21:49.440" class="transcript_line"> and then we went on to do a Latin American tour,</div><div id="00:21:51.960" class="transcript_line"> which lasted almost a year in Latin America.</div><div id="00:21:54.720" class="transcript_line"> Wow, hell of a life experience.</div><div id="00:21:56.400" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, it was a long time on the road.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You know where the bodies are buried, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You should see the smile on her face at this point.</div><div id="00:22:01.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all coming back.</div><div id="00:22:03.320" class="transcript_line"> So you took all that experience,</div><div id="00:22:06.240" class="transcript_line"> and you brought that to Cardiff Carnival in 2015.</div><div id="00:22:11.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, tell us more.</div><div id="00:22:12.280" class="transcript_line"> I mean, yeah, I mean, it was a...</div><div id="00:22:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Before that, I&#039;d been working.</div><div id="00:22:15.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been doing a lot more with artists and dancers,</div><div id="00:22:19.240" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;d been working with various singers, pop stars.</div><div id="00:22:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Care to drop a few names?</div><div id="00:22:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Probably shouldn&#039;t, but yeah,</div><div id="00:22:30.080" class="transcript_line"> I was doing local crew wardrobe for a long time.</div><div id="00:22:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Local crew meaning I traveled up and down the country</div><div id="00:22:35.400" class="transcript_line"> with it as well.</div><div id="00:22:36.240" class="transcript_line"> Local to the UK.</div><div id="00:22:37.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I did, well, I started off,</div><div id="00:22:43.280" class="transcript_line"> I think the first big person that I&#039;d worked for</div><div id="00:22:46.080" class="transcript_line"> was Lady Gaga.</div><div id="00:22:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And I know I shouldn&#039;t be, I didn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:22:51.280" class="transcript_line"> My jaw just dropped.</div><div id="00:22:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m not, I wasn&#039;t really a fan of her music at all.</div><div id="00:22:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m still not really.</div><div id="00:22:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Not even Wadis&#039; version of Poker Face on steel pan.</div><div id="00:22:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Wadis&#039; version, Poker Face was one</div><div id="00:23:01.680" class="transcript_line"> of my favorite songs to play.</div><div id="00:23:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:23:04.200" class="transcript_line"> It was one of my favorite songs to play.</div><div id="00:23:05.040" class="transcript_line"> I always thought that was,</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> when he played me that the first time,</div><div id="00:23:08.200" class="transcript_line"> I was just like, wow.</div><div id="00:23:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but Wadis could play,</div><div id="00:23:10.520" class="transcript_line"> literally he could make any tune.</div><div id="00:23:12.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, even like country and western songs,</div><div id="00:23:15.200" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d like,</div><div id="00:23:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard.</div><div id="00:23:16.880" class="transcript_line"> Convert those into a pan</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d make them sound better than the original.</div><div id="00:23:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and like I&#039;ve done like people like from like</div><div id="00:23:25.560" class="transcript_line"> smaller like UK acts like Westlife and Alton John,</div><div id="00:23:32.120" class="transcript_line"> see how George Michael.</div><div id="00:23:33.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Peter Andre was probably the last person I&#039;d worked with</div><div id="00:23:38.880" class="transcript_line"> before I went on and did.</div><div id="00:23:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:23:41.240" class="transcript_line"> I made a career movie tomorrow.</div><div id="00:23:42.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:42.920" class="transcript_line"> Music theater.</div><div id="00:23:43.760" class="transcript_line"> And I went into theater.</div><div id="00:23:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Got it, got it.</div><div id="00:23:45.440" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I mean, I&#039;ve been,</div><div id="00:23:47.720" class="transcript_line"> yeah, I&#039;ve been doing wardrobe</div><div id="00:23:48.960" class="transcript_line"> and seamstress work for quite a while.</div><div id="00:23:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Got it, got it.</div><div id="00:23:54.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:57.240" class="transcript_line"> In terms of challenges this summer</div><div id="00:23:59.400" class="transcript_line"> at the 26th Cardiff Carnival,</div><div id="00:24:02.440" class="transcript_line"> was there anything when you were up against it,</div><div id="00:24:04.240" class="transcript_line"> was it time or whatever,</div><div id="00:24:05.560" class="transcript_line"> or was it all smooth?</div><div id="00:24:07.200" class="transcript_line"> There was anything good, bad or ugly,</div><div id="00:24:08.360" class="transcript_line"> what sort of comes to mind?</div><div id="00:24:09.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sort of like,</div><div id="00:24:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I do occasionally have to say,</div><div id="00:24:11.200" class="transcript_line"> look, that&#039;s not going to work.</div><div id="00:24:13.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:14.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, because you&#039;re very much part</div><div id="00:24:16.440" class="transcript_line"> of the design process.</div><div id="00:24:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And I think the thing is,</div><div id="00:24:19.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, we all have these images in our mind</div><div id="00:24:22.280" class="transcript_line"> that we want,</div><div id="00:24:23.120" class="transcript_line"> that you know, we want this to happen</div><div id="00:24:24.920" class="transcript_line"> and we want this to happen.</div><div id="00:24:25.960" class="transcript_line"> And when you&#039;ve just got one person making,</div><div id="00:24:30.880" class="transcript_line"> making,</div><div id="00:24:32.120" class="transcript_line"> because really I&#039;m there to make all the base costumes</div><div id="00:24:34.880" class="transcript_line"> then they get embellished.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But at times there&#039;s more work that I have to do</div><div id="00:24:40.880" class="transcript_line"> that the public can&#039;t do.</div><div id="00:24:42.880" class="transcript_line"> So I have to do part of the embellishment.</div><div id="00:24:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I mean, there was at times,</div><div id="00:24:50.280" class="transcript_line"> there was challenges.</div><div id="00:24:52.360" class="transcript_line"> I think there were challenges for everyone really.</div><div id="00:24:55.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very pressurized situation.</div><div id="00:24:56.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an art form that sort of invites that.</div><div id="00:25:00.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:00.880" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to try really hard now to do something.</div><div id="00:25:02.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:03.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think, I think because of like,</div><div id="00:25:04.600" class="transcript_line"> because of my background and having to work quite,</div><div id="00:25:08.720" class="transcript_line"> quite quickly,</div><div id="00:25:10.600" class="transcript_line"> it was just kind of like a normal pace for me.</div><div id="00:25:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:13.640" class="transcript_line"> And to be honest, some, some days I was like, oh,</div><div id="00:25:16.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m working quite slow today.</div><div id="00:25:20.680" class="transcript_line"> But I just-</div><div id="00:25:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Not that we would have noticed.</div><div id="00:25:22.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you just seem to, you know.</div><div id="00:25:24.040" class="transcript_line"> But I just think-</div><div id="00:25:25.480" class="transcript_line"> You seem to be so in your element.</div><div id="00:25:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Every time I pass you, you just like-</div><div id="00:25:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m quite, I&#039;m like, you know,</div><div id="00:25:30.040" class="transcript_line"> when I&#039;ve got my project at hand-</div><div id="00:25:31.200" class="transcript_line"> Sophia, sorted, Sophia, sorted.</div><div id="00:25:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Just walk past her.</div><div id="00:25:33.600" class="transcript_line"> I like her.</div><div id="00:25:34.440" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s clearly, yeah, this is a woman who&#039;s not,</div><div id="00:25:36.680" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s, you know, she&#039;s not waving and drowning.</div><div id="00:25:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:39.640" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s waving, you know.</div><div id="00:25:40.480" class="transcript_line"> I think, you know, the day, like the day,</div><div id="00:25:41.320" class="transcript_line"> the day I went in and Adrian and Jallian were like, right,</div><div id="00:25:44.440" class="transcript_line"> so there&#039;s machines, there&#039;s the material,</div><div id="00:25:49.120" class="transcript_line"> and this is your area.</div><div id="00:25:50.240" class="transcript_line"> So just set it up how you, like, how you want it.</div><div id="00:25:52.880" class="transcript_line"> So I did.</div><div id="00:25:53.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:54.920" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t know whether it was set up the right way</div><div id="00:25:57.320" class="transcript_line"> or how the seamstress did it the year before.</div><div id="00:25:59.760" class="transcript_line"> There was no, there was no pass-over or handbook.</div><div id="00:26:01.440" class="transcript_line"> No, no, you&#039;re free to do what&#039;s-</div><div id="00:26:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Which, which, you know, at first I was just like,</div><div id="00:26:05.560" class="transcript_line"> oh, okay, so that&#039;s why I kept asking questions.</div><div id="00:26:08.480" class="transcript_line"> Like, okay, how, like, how do you guys do it?</div><div id="00:26:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, when I go into a job,</div><div id="00:26:14.080" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s like kind of, there&#039;s kind of like nonwritten rules</div><div id="00:26:19.480" class="transcript_line"> or kind of like a pass, like a pass-over book.</div><div id="00:26:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Like, this is how, you know, guidelines.</div><div id="00:26:25.880" class="transcript_line"> And then you just basically do what you want to do.</div><div id="00:26:28.600" class="transcript_line"> But this was basically a free-for-all.</div><div id="00:26:30.880" class="transcript_line"> So you just go in and just do what you do.</div><div id="00:26:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Which in the end worked, worked well.</div><div id="00:26:36.640" class="transcript_line"> And I think if I was to do it again,</div><div id="00:26:38.360" class="transcript_line"> then, you know, I definitely,</div><div id="00:26:40.760" class="transcript_line"> I know where to start from.</div><div id="00:26:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And I know for a fact, if I was to do it again,</div><div id="00:26:46.120" class="transcript_line"> then I could probably make a lot more costumes</div><div id="00:26:50.000" class="transcript_line"> in the time that I had.</div><div id="00:26:51.440" class="transcript_line"> And, and I know, you know,</div><div id="00:26:56.080" class="transcript_line"> I know how to organise my time a bit better.</div><div id="00:26:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And I think as a, you know, it is a community project.</div><div id="00:27:05.040" class="transcript_line"> And, and yeah, it was, it was, it was fun being,</div><div id="00:27:10.960" class="transcript_line"> it was nice being able to have the freedom</div><div id="00:27:13.640" class="transcript_line"> to get in and design, you know.</div><div id="00:27:16.400" class="transcript_line"> And, and, and as well, like work, work with the,</div><div id="00:27:19.280" class="transcript_line"> with the community.</div><div id="00:27:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:21.080" class="transcript_line"> It was, yeah, it was quite a fulfilling job.</div><div id="00:27:23.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite, it&#039;s quite a fulfilling role.</div><div id="00:27:26.160" class="transcript_line"> And then, and then at times being able to just sit down</div><div id="00:27:28.840" class="transcript_line"> and have my cup of tea.</div><div id="00:27:32.760" class="transcript_line"> So Sophia, I mean, it seems to me that you</div><div id="00:27:34.880" class="transcript_line"> and other members of your family,</div><div id="00:27:36.360" class="transcript_line"> have had an extraordinary history</div><div id="00:27:39.800" class="transcript_line"> in terms of Cardiff Carnival.</div><div id="00:27:41.880" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s nice is the way that you&#039;ve come in</div><div id="00:27:44.000" class="transcript_line"> from so many different angles</div><div id="00:27:45.800" class="transcript_line"> and contributed so much over such a long period of time,</div><div id="00:27:48.600" class="transcript_line"> since you were 14.</div><div id="00:27:50.800" class="transcript_line"> So starting as a steel pan player</div><div id="00:27:53.200" class="transcript_line"> and the very wonderful Wadda,</div><div id="00:27:56.240" class="transcript_line"> moving on to design a huge backpack</div><div id="00:27:59.600" class="transcript_line"> and help with other costume construction.</div><div id="00:28:02.240" class="transcript_line"> And then dancing
