    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, massively. I mean, certainly the mackerel, used to hand line for mackerel,</div><div id="00:00:04.160" class="transcript_line"> and that has changed massively. That was in the late 70s, early 80s. And we go out,</div><div id="00:00:12.320" class="transcript_line"> three men on a boat, hand lining, and it&#039;d be nothing for us to catch, you know, maybe a</div><div id="00:00:21.200" class="transcript_line"> hundred dozen per man on the boat that morning, and go in and, you know, land by eight, nine o&#039;clock</div><div id="00:00:30.160" class="transcript_line"> in the morning. Literally the deck, it&#039;d be quite, it&#039;s quite amazing. We&#039;d block the scuppers with</div><div id="00:00:38.400" class="transcript_line"> little slides, we&#039;d slip bits of timber into the scuppers to block so they didn&#039;t all</div><div id="00:00:42.800" class="transcript_line"> pour out the scuppers. And you&#039;d literally have to shuffle around deck through all the fish,</div><div id="00:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> otherwise you&#039;d be treading on them. And the deck would just be covered in a sea of,</div><div id="00:00:51.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, that deep, full of mackerel, and then you&#039;d box them,</div><div id="00:00:54.800" class="transcript_line"> counting them. So it was, I think it was 10 dozen boxes, I remember. And you&#039;d land them,</div><div id="00:01:00.640" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d land them ashore, and they&#039;d go then to the carriers. The carriers would all be there,</div><div id="00:01:04.480" class="transcript_line"> and then Morris House and Vans, or the Maxis, or whatever. Maxis were ideal, because you just</div><div id="00:01:09.120" class="transcript_line"> fit, fish boxes would fit perfectly in the back of an Austin Maxi. Go off driving around,</div><div id="00:01:13.520" class="transcript_line"> on their rounds, selling them. So that was, that has been, that has absolutely been transformed,</div><div id="00:01:23.440" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s one transformation I&#039;ve seen very, very much so.</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s not like that now.</div><div id="00:01:31.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, nothing like, nothing like. And that&#039;s been devastating, not by hand lining for mackerel,</div><div id="00:01:35.840" class="transcript_line"> but by huge factory ships off Scotland, who literally can, you know, they can,</div><div id="00:01:43.200" class="transcript_line"> they can sort of fill the boat in one haul, they can scoop up, you know,</div><div id="00:01:50.240" class="transcript_line"> tons and thousands of tons of mackerel in one go. So that fish has been devastating.</div></div></p>
