    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Things change at the edges, someone said on the bus. I think that farther inland there is something, some nothing.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not necessarily good, it&#039;s edge, even the universe must have one.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Someone wants maps to show only the coast, where the real edges are, the real meetings.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The unexpected closeness of underway travellers, three foot passengers, two port staff.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It feels like we know each other, the echo fluorescent waiting space.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> At the start, I learned that ferries and spaceships vibrate at the frequency of autistic peace.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That cutlery shudders in canteen drawers, like the sound of a Lego Millennium Falcon&#039;s downfall.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re here.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> If you arrive by sea in the dark, you must wait for the town to assemble itself, piece by piece with the sunrise.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Hatching from little street light eggs into silent houses that themselves will hatch into people, like the start of under milkwood.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Like being caught in the enchanted tree at switching time.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I arrive by sea in the dark.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> In the sweet, wet, almost touchable smell of old trees, the town is silent, deserted apart from rumbling trucks, my shipmates.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from two people screaming at each other somewhere nearby.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I will find things here that I miss from home.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Like conkers, nettles, nettle stings, blackberries, holly, colonial decay, slows, which my father, who has Irish names for some things, but doesn&#039;t know that he&#039;s speaking Irish, calls hearths.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Clover, those neatly terraced seaside houses with bay windows.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> A particular kind of path.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Brambles, train tracks, double yellow lines, pillar post boxes painted red instead of green, but the same.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Magpies, a particular kind of hill, a particular kind of mud, a particular kind of wall, a particular kind of military fort.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we did this before you, then painted it green, tore up rail tracks, tried to let the footprints of empire fade in the sand, let the footprints of empire into the water.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I know these bittersweet silhouettes.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I know these bricks, these windows, these buildings, these walls.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I know how to sneak into their bones.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They are not as long dead here, but dead all the same.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Near my home are three forts exactly like this.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> In one, children play with cannons, another is ruined, another a museum.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We make films in them, we make money from them.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not sure about them, but the views are magnificent.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We like to rename them.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes on the map, the roads don&#039;t even show up.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> A family lives in the tower on top of which is the only gun that fired on the German fighters.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> All of this means more than it did when I started, now that we are naming gunpowder again.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> An old man screams at his runaway dogs still genteel, and I approach the port from the beach, but the gates are closed.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I approach the port from the hill, the ornate main entrance between the ruined gatehouse and the pristine one.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I approach the turns I might not be meant to take, the beaten path, the low chain fence, the wasteland,</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> the paths behind ruined buildings and pristine ones, the long straight road with the high wire gate,</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> the sign saying M.O.D. keep out, my accent, my mouth sealed shut with wet sand,</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> the signs, Max Trenchwith, home of interclamp, I love you Kelly, I love you M.O.D.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Beware, marine security searches.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Two men in a shed at the very back where paths end in piles of old cars and brambles.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the pickling pond over there, they tell me. This is as close as I get. I can&#039;t see if it&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They filled it in, the men say. I&#039;m not sure if the grey hill I see in the distance is what they mean.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I am trying all the turns, I am finding all the gates, I am exploring like a gas, touching all the space that I can.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I am retracing my steps in the crystal sun, the sand in my mouth is turning to airy dust.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I am feeling my way up a path slippery with leaves, I am deciding to take the left fork, I am deciding to take the right fork.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I am stumbling out of the undergrowth to find a fire engine in a lane, I am tiptoeing under the motorway bridge to the water&#039;s edge.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I am teetering on the edge of the last step before dropping onto the gravel beach.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I am falling hard on my hip on smooth wet rocks and daring and unknown tide.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I am saying hello in as unaccented a way as I can. I am huffing across the golf course.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I am meeting the same small roundabout too many times. I am tracing each road in the grid of town.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I am passing another church, I am passing another closed shop.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I am hiding my newsagent sandwich from seagulls&#039; mouths.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I am accidentally in the back of an industrial estate.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I am on purpose in the wasteland behind the train station.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I am high up behind the houses. I am jumping into the road from a small hill.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I am finding the port at the start and end of all roads.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The haunted scaffold red brick monstrous in the dark is more like Thomas the Tank Engine&#039;s house in daylight.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I am leaving and Brexit will not cut my phone off much longer.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Was this that mythical island, the one you made up?</div></div></p>
