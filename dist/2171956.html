    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Returning. A daytime flight returned us to the island. The temperature rose some 10 degrees</div><div id="00:00:07.560" class="transcript_line"> from the Sussex we&#039;d left behind and was in the pleasant high 20s. After collecting</div><div id="00:00:14.360" class="transcript_line"> the hire car at the airport we drove east on the new National Road, commenting on the</div><div id="00:00:18.800" class="transcript_line"> flowering shrubs lining the road and the very green looking olive groves. In the distance</div><div id="00:00:23.840" class="transcript_line"> there was still a little snow on the mountain tops but roadside vendors were selling large</div><div id="00:00:28.700" class="transcript_line"> bags of potatoes and bunches of small bananas. Time away allowed one to forget what a country</div><div id="00:00:35.900" class="transcript_line"> of contrasts Crete was. Within an hour we were parking in the hill village where we</div><div id="00:00:41.100" class="transcript_line"> borrowed the completed house from the architect, none packing more luggage than normal because</div><div id="00:00:46.460" class="transcript_line"> of our camping ambition. We were met by the estate agent delivering cleaning for us. After</div><div id="00:00:53.460" class="transcript_line"> exchanging greetings and news we arranged to go to the office to catch up with Manos.</div><div id="00:00:58.900" class="transcript_line"> He was seeing another client but said he would meet us in 20 minutes time at the restaurant</div><div id="00:01:03.200" class="transcript_line"> up the road. It was one of our favourites with views over the marina and the bay from</div><div id="00:01:08.300" class="transcript_line"> an airy terrace sheltered under a canopy and screened by trees. We caught up with family</div><div id="00:01:14.140" class="transcript_line"> news with the owners who were combining catering and social duties with after school childcare</div><div id="00:01:19.460" class="transcript_line"> for their energetic children. Manos arrived in good spirits and joined us for something</div><div id="00:01:24.780" class="transcript_line"> to eat and drink. He said the project&#039;s work was still busy for the business but</div><div id="00:01:29.860" class="transcript_line"> the estate agency had quietened down over the winter. He then presented us with a key</div><div id="00:01:35.300" class="transcript_line"> to the house. It was fixed with a glossy red key holder with a little white light. It was</div><div id="00:01:41.180" class="transcript_line"> good to see him again and we couldn&#039;t wait to see the progress on the house. Before setting</div><div id="00:01:46.300" class="transcript_line"> off to the village and our house we collected the bags of clothes that had been in the architectural</div><div id="00:01:50.880" class="transcript_line"> store room through the winter. Theoretically this was arranged so that we travelled lighter</div><div id="00:01:56.840" class="transcript_line"> but we seemed to be accumulating larger and larger wardrobes in Crete. Half an hour later</div><div id="00:02:02.120" class="transcript_line"> we were walking through the village down to our house with eager anticipation to see first</div><div id="00:02:07.120" class="transcript_line"> hand the work we&#039;d been following so keenly on the internet through the winter and the</div><div id="00:02:11.600" class="transcript_line"> earlier part of the year. We were not disappointed. The newly cleaned stone walls were beautiful</div><div id="00:02:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and the grey painted shutters and door blended well with the old stones. After opening the</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> front door with the flash new door key we saw the tiled floor and the new wall and the</div><div id="00:02:29.240" class="transcript_line"> door to create the bathroom. We opened the shutters on the new window downstairs to let</div><div id="00:02:34.960" class="transcript_line"> more light in. It was hard to work out what features we&#039;d seen before and which ones</div><div id="00:02:39.920" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d committed to memory from the photos Manos had been posting. We were shown around</div><div id="00:02:45.960" class="transcript_line"> the tiling. We&#039;d seen the pictures and had made a request for a gaudy-esque effect but</div><div id="00:02:54.960" class="transcript_line"> in real life any doubts we had soon went away. Yes they were striking, which was exactly</div><div id="00:03:00.560" class="transcript_line"> the phrase I&#039;d first used to him. After seeing the photos at the time he&#039;d said,</div><div id="00:03:05.620" class="transcript_line"> Ah you don&#039;t like the tiling. Once again we assured him and realised that three of</div><div id="00:03:10.800" class="transcript_line"> to stand in the bathroom that we were all worried about the size. It can&#039;t be too small,</div><div id="00:03:16.440" class="transcript_line"> we are all in it, though as Manos pointed out the WC in the sink hadn&#039;t been installed</div><div id="00:03:21.600" class="transcript_line"> yet. The architect&#039;s creativity was still in full flight. I have been thinking that</div><div id="00:03:27.960" class="transcript_line"> there is a small space at the side of the stairs that would lend themselves to a frosted</div><div id="00:03:32.160" class="transcript_line"> glass panel that would let some light into the bathroom void area. It would create a</div><div id="00:03:37.440" class="transcript_line"> small light well with light from the glass roof hatch. What do you think? We liked the</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> idea and readily agreed. There were also some glass plates to put on the backs of some of</div><div id="00:03:50.320" class="transcript_line"> the stairs for the same reason. We felt confident this would be an interesting bathroom but</div><div id="00:03:56.080" class="transcript_line"> the main question was when will it be functional? Going through the rest of the house there</div><div id="00:04:01.560" class="transcript_line"> was a lot of new work to examine. We got used to this process following a familiar pattern</div><div id="00:04:06.960" class="transcript_line"> with Manos both on site and over the phone. We would say how delighted we were with some</div><div id="00:04:12.880" class="transcript_line"> new addition or piece of building work and he would modestly say it was simple or that</div><div id="00:04:18.040" class="transcript_line"> the work could have been improved with more room or better craftsmen or by manufacturing</div><div id="00:04:23.400" class="transcript_line"> Athens or Italy. Any hesitation on our part was met defensively. You don&#039;t like it, we</div><div id="00:04:29.760" class="transcript_line"> must change it, it is your house, what colour, size, pattern etc etc. We looked at the show</div><div id="00:04:36.920" class="transcript_line"> Chinese used fuse box so different from the jumble of boxes at home under the stairs in</div><div id="00:04:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Sussex. It&#039;s uniform lines and neat little fuses, some red or green little lights twinkling</div><div id="00:04:48.280" class="transcript_line"> behind the neat perspex door fitted into a small niche just outside the house. You don&#039;t</div><div id="00:04:54.920" class="transcript_line"> like it, you would prefer a grey door to match the woodwork, I&#039;ll get it changed. We both</div><div id="00:04:59.880" class="transcript_line"> were tested, it&#039;s fine, really, you should see our fuse is back home, antiquated. You</div><div id="00:05:06.760" class="transcript_line"> want the box to be hidden, the carpenter could make a small wooden cupboard to disguise it,</div><div id="00:05:11.240" class="transcript_line"> would you prefer that? No, no, it&#039;s lovely, really, we love it, really modern and functional.</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Does it work? Ah, the electrician will connect it all tomorrow, the lighting is not on yet,</div><div id="00:05:24.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s working darkly, don&#039;t touch any loose wires. Downstairs was a little congested with</div><div id="00:05:31.760" class="transcript_line"> the three of us in an already small space that doubled as a resting place with builders&#039;</div><div id="00:05:37.280" class="transcript_line"> tools, tile cutters, toolbox, unused wiring materials, tiles and plumbing materials as</div><div id="00:05:44.200" class="transcript_line"> well as some of the old shutters and some new metal plates as well as a rubbish dump</div><div id="00:05:49.280" class="transcript_line"> for packing and discarding materials. I was very careful not to touch any loose wires.</div><div id="00:05:56.200" class="transcript_line"> Because of his evidence of activity, which we were anxious not to inhibit, it was difficult</div><div id="00:06:00.960" class="transcript_line"> to see the new tiles on the ground floor. We liked what we could see, large book-sized</div><div id="00:06:06.240" class="transcript_line"> light-coloured stone plates, slightly irregular with a textured surface. The floor was also</div><div id="00:06:13.240" class="transcript_line"> punctuated with some large holes, some with metal plates over, partially tiled, some more</div><div id="00:06:19.460" class="transcript_line"> alarmingly open. Another next to the new staircase looked dark and deep. That&#039;s to the septic</div><div id="00:06:25.720" class="transcript_line"> tank, it&#039;s deep, said Manos, let&#039;s go upstairs. We needed no second bidding but already knew</div><div id="00:06:32.880" class="transcript_line"> from the view downstairs through the steel framework to the ceiling upstairs that the</div><div id="00:06:37.560" class="transcript_line"> first floor was somewhat conceptual at this stage. In fact, upstairs was more dangerous</div><div id="00:06:42.720" class="transcript_line"> than the ground floor. The staircase looked good with stone treads over the metal framework,</div><div id="00:06:48.040" class="transcript_line"> it also felt solid, but progress ended quickly as we all three gathered at the top of the</div><div id="00:06:53.080" class="transcript_line"> stairs looking across the first floor room. The metalwork frame was still without floorboards</div><div id="00:06:59.320" class="transcript_line"> and as a result needed circus skills to negotiate it in full. I restricted myself to walking</div><div id="00:07:05.760" class="transcript_line"> across a scaffolding plank to the sparrows staircase leading up to the roof terrace.</div><div id="00:07:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Manos quickly followed, don&#039;t go on the terrace, another coat of insulation was placed there</div><div id="00:07:16.760" class="transcript_line"> this morning and you shouldn&#039;t walk on it yet. Sure enough the terrace has now a glossy</div><div id="00:07:22.480" class="transcript_line"> grey coat looking like a bumper layer of putty. Empty it was possible to imagine a table and</div><div id="00:07:28.800" class="transcript_line"> a seating for six of us dining under the stars one day. Back in the real world Manos showed</div><div id="00:07:35.080" class="transcript_line"> me where the terrace walling had been raised and all repointed in white mortar. Reluctantly</div><div id="00:07:40.680" class="transcript_line"> he waved at the opening to the terrace where we were standing at the top of the spiral</div><div id="00:07:44.480" class="transcript_line"> stairs. This has been a nightmare he groaned. The metal man has not seen eye to eye with</div><div id="00:07:50.440" class="transcript_line"> me. It is essential that he is made weather tight. Much into himself it was clear that</div><div id="00:07:56.120" class="transcript_line"> this was not a suitable discussion for our first meeting. So I changed the subject and</div><div id="00:08:01.360" class="transcript_line"> admired the new narrow long set of windows onto the terrace designed to bring light in</div><div id="00:08:06.880" class="transcript_line"> and across the first floor ceiling. For a change he agreed. Yes these have worked out</div><div id="00:08:12.560" class="transcript_line"> well and allowed some nice diffused light. Unqualified approval. Unusual. Manos described</div><div id="00:08:21.720" class="transcript_line"> the remaining works and his plans. A couple of additions were talked over. The building</div><div id="00:08:26.760" class="transcript_line"> permit included a small balcony on the first floor outside the pair of small glass doors.</div><div id="00:08:32.860" class="transcript_line"> We had removed it from the first building phase on cost grounds but Manos suggested</div><div id="00:08:37.500" class="transcript_line"> completing it while the carpenter was still working at the house. We gave a quick agreement</div><div id="00:08:42.540" class="transcript_line"> as we felt it with further opening up the first floor room and allow a sea view without</div><div id="00:08:47.260" class="transcript_line"> climbing up to the roof terrace. We were also beginning to think about furniture or at least</div><div id="00:08:52.820" class="transcript_line"> storage and fittings. It was agreed that the new cavity created outside the bathroom wall</div><div id="00:08:58.780" class="transcript_line"> would house the fridge freezer but there was extra room that could be a store cupboard.</div><div id="00:09:03.980" class="transcript_line"> The other thing we noticed was the drop down of stairwell from where the first floor would</div><div id="00:09:08.020" class="transcript_line"> be. We began to think that some screen or storage unit might be a practical safety feature.</div><div id="00:09:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Talking about this was delayed until after the floor was installed. Of the planning works</div><div id="00:09:20.780" class="transcript_line"> the electrician would be coming the next day to finish the fuse panel. The plumber would</div><div id="00:09:25.360" class="transcript_line"> connect the bathroom fittings once we had chosen these. This could be done the next</div><div id="00:09:29.840" class="transcript_line"> day. The carpenter would put in the first floor as soon as the messy work for the terrace</div><div id="00:09:34.560" class="transcript_line"> coating and the roof hatch was complete. It was still all being held up by the hatch.</div><div id="00:09:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Additionally, there was all the cleaning, repainting and minor finishing jobs, in some</div><div id="00:09:46.040" class="transcript_line"> cases repairing the damage done in the course of completion. This was probably the inevitable</div><div id="00:09:52.080" class="transcript_line"> penalty of a cramped workspace. Looking around at everything to be done and the multiple</div><div id="00:09:58.080" class="transcript_line"> work in progress areas in the house, camping seemed optimistic but hey this was only day</div><div id="00:10:03.840" class="transcript_line"> one and we had another two weeks here yet. Back at the house in the hills we unpacked</div><div id="00:10:09.720" class="transcript_line"> and renewed our acquaintances with the neighbours as well as the clothes stored last year. A</div><div id="00:10:15.120" class="transcript_line"> walk through the village and an early by Greek standards supper in a village restaurant under</div><div id="00:10:20.280" class="transcript_line"> the stars. Plenty of fresh cooked local recipes, a jug of cold wine. Perfect. The next day</div><div id="00:10:29.560" class="transcript_line"> we were joined on the terrace for our breakfast by the ginger cat we befriended on earlier</div><div id="00:10:34.280" class="transcript_line"> stays. This time she was alone. Last year she brought two young cats with her. After</div><div id="00:10:40.440" class="transcript_line"> breakfast we drove to town to meet with the architect to choose bathroom fittings. We</div><div id="00:10:45.520" class="transcript_line"> had a look around the town as the arranged meeting was later in the morning. It was bustling</div><div id="00:10:50.240" class="transcript_line"> as usual. The Marina car park near the office had introduced yet another revolutionary ticketing</div><div id="00:10:56.080" class="transcript_line"> system but the cost remained at three euros for the whole day. We strolled through town,</div><div id="00:11:02.360" class="transcript_line"> said hello to a few people we recognised including the architect&#039;s mum in her shop. I put credit</div><div id="00:11:10.080" class="transcript_line"> on our Greek phone, browsed the bookshop and generally tried to get ourselves into a Cretan</div><div id="00:11:15.400" class="transcript_line"> frame of mind for the drive with Manos to the bathroom emporium. In the office it was</div><div id="00:11:22.080" class="transcript_line"> the usual mix of good taste, smart furniture, glossy magazines and individual objects. Manos</div><div id="00:11:28.840" class="transcript_line"> only had one new challenge for us. He selected some low energy down lighters to be fitted</div><div id="00:11:34.800" class="transcript_line"> in the niches but showing one to us he pointed out that the light also came out sideways</div><div id="00:11:40.680" class="transcript_line"> and this was not sufficient for them. We need to locate ones that only light downwards and</div><div id="00:11:46.320" class="transcript_line"> remains voltage. Let me know the stockist or obtain a sample here on the island or back</div><div id="00:11:53.320" class="transcript_line"> in the UK. It appeared this was now our responsibility. Still perhaps this would leave him free to</div><div id="00:11:59.960" class="transcript_line"> resolve the hatch dilemma. A new lady computer aided designer was introduced to us and Manos&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:07.840" class="transcript_line"> dog made her usual low key fuss with her friendly but doleful eyes. Cold drinks were offered</div><div id="00:12:14.200" class="transcript_line"> but the usual clamour for Manos&#039;s attention from people both residents and visitors plus</div><div id="00:12:20.480" class="transcript_line"> the phones meant that he was keen to abandon the office. We followed as did his dog out</div><div id="00:12:27.480" class="transcript_line"> into the heat again and negotiated our way out of the town traffic to the bathroom store.</div><div id="00:12:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Manos saw the sunroof and several windows were open and the minivan was left in the</div><div id="00:12:37.840" class="transcript_line"> canine custody of the dog. We had visited this builder&#039;s merchants before. It was on</div><div id="00:12:44.480" class="transcript_line"> the outskirts of town in a large building the front of which was a glass fronted showroom</div><div id="00:12:49.200" class="transcript_line"> housing swish bathroom fittings most of which were far too large for our purposes. There</div><div id="00:12:55.440" class="transcript_line"> was also an impressive range of wall and floor tiles some in glass like jewels. Manos pleased</div><div id="00:13:02.440" class="transcript_line"> in and seemed to be known to the man behind one of the desks who waved before a younger</div><div id="00:13:07.480" class="transcript_line"> woman engaged him in a machine gun speak Greek conversation. It transpired she was to show</div><div id="00:13:14.240" class="transcript_line"> us the small wash basin and taps that she had selected for our wet room. We were led</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> upstairs to view these. This part of the visit was quite straightforward but it was soon</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> to degenerate into typical Manos inspired chaos. As far as we could tell there was some</div><div id="00:13:30.220" class="transcript_line"> inquiry from Manos about an order for a WC and whether they had papers which described</div><div id="00:13:35.660" class="transcript_line"> the dimensions. The conversation became more heated with the woman employing elaborate</div><div id="00:13:40.900" class="transcript_line"> hand gestures towards the WCs on display. After more low key Greek shouting the three</div><div id="00:13:47.900" class="transcript_line"> of us were led back downstairs to the office where a close examination of the paper filing</div><div id="00:13:52.660" class="transcript_line"> system as well as the scrutiny of the PC monitor took place. This must have been quite stressful</div><div id="00:13:59.180" class="transcript_line"> as the guy came in from the outside desk to help although his help seemed restricted</div><div id="00:14:03.740" class="transcript_line"> to accepting the offer of one of Manos&#039; strong Greek architectural cigarettes which they</div><div id="00:14:09.020" class="transcript_line"> both smoked while reviewing some of the paper upside down. Gathering up two steel tape measures</div><div id="00:14:15.380" class="transcript_line"> we all reassembled upstairs and started measuring the WCs. The distance out from the wall seemed</div><div id="00:14:21.920" class="transcript_line"> to be the key measurement. Unfortunately some of these measurements needed to be compared</div><div id="00:14:26.820" class="transcript_line"> with the paper records still downstairs. Fortunately the building was air conditioned.</div><div id="00:14:32.820" class="transcript_line"> When we trailed once more upstairs we were led through another door to be confronted</div><div id="00:14:36.540" class="transcript_line"> by a version of the closing sequence to the first Indiana Jones film, the scene where</div><div id="00:14:41.300" class="transcript_line"> the crated arc is stored away in a vast warehouse of other crates. I exaggerate but only slightly.</div><div id="00:14:48.900" class="transcript_line"> The space is about ten times larger than the showroom and full of crates and large cardboard</div><div id="00:14:54.100" class="transcript_line"> boxes. Manos and the woman scuttled down the aisles examining the Greek writing in numbers</div><div id="00:14:59.940" class="transcript_line"> in some quest to locate a particular item. We hung around as confused bystanders until</div><div id="00:15:06.460" class="transcript_line"> some consensus had arrived over whether they had found what they were looking for. We reconvened</div><div id="00:15:12.720" class="transcript_line"> downstairs in the office relieved to see the smoking hadn&#039;t allowed the paperwork to</div><div id="00:15:17.140" class="transcript_line"> combust. After a brief conversation Manos announced it was time to go and the WC had</div><div id="00:15:22.780" class="transcript_line"> been selected. Did we want to try it? Sitting in my shorts on a WC in a mercifully quiet</div><div id="00:15:29.580" class="transcript_line"> showroom certainly didn&#039;t figure as one of my least embarrassing experiences. Still we&#039;d</div><div id="00:15:35.820" class="transcript_line"> apparently saved some 150 euros over a previously identified compact one. We were a bit mystified</div><div id="00:15:42.820" class="transcript_line"> but reassured by Manos who stated that the plumber could now proceed. Later the same</div><div id="00:15:49.540" class="transcript_line"> day two events occurred. We were able to switch on the lights in the house for the</div><div id="00:15:53.580" class="transcript_line"> first time and Greek TV announced the country&#039;s first case of Mexican swine flu. The events</div><div id="00:15:59.900" class="transcript_line"> were unconnected as far as we were aware. Wednesday found us up early shopping near</div><div id="00:16:05.700" class="transcript_line"> the harbour at the weekly market. It wasn&#039;t long before I had to restrain Stephanie. Stop</div><div id="00:16:11.300" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I can carry any more. How much did we spend? Apparently less than ten euros</div><div id="00:16:17.460" class="transcript_line"> and that included a four euro jar of honey. We had a large bag of mixed sweet peppers,</div><div id="00:16:23.100" class="transcript_line"> artichokes, aubergines, big beef tomatoes, a big bag of beautiful yellow potatoes and</div><div id="00:16:29.740" class="transcript_line"> plenty of other things. After dropping the supplies back at the village house we drove</div><div id="00:16:35.140" class="transcript_line"> over to review building progress. Manos was already there talking to the back of the plumber</div><div id="00:16:41.020" class="transcript_line"> who was working on the pumps in the cavities under the ground floor. Most of this system</div><div id="00:16:46.100" class="transcript_line"> seemed quite mysterious to me but it seemed to be one of those areas you just had to trust</div><div id="00:16:50.860" class="transcript_line"> the experts. The plumbing was most effective in the loan house so evidence appeared to</div><div id="00:16:56.700" class="transcript_line"> be supportive of this action. The plumber broke off to shake hands and lead us into</div><div id="00:17:02.060" class="transcript_line"> the tiny bathroom where amazingly the WC was plumbed in. This was the one that was the</div><div id="00:17:08.060" class="transcript_line"> subject of so much discussion only yesterday. We agreed the positions of the basin and the</div><div id="00:17:13.580" class="transcript_line"> shower and diplomatically withdrew to let him get on with it. Later that day whilst</div><div id="00:17:19.740" class="transcript_line"> trying to drive to a local viewpoint we came across an abandoned village and I couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:25.100" class="transcript_line"> help noticing that most of the houses resembled the house during the last visit. Walls are</div><div id="00:17:30.220" class="transcript_line"> bare stone, no roofs, gaping holes instead of shutters. There had been progress on the</div><div id="00:17:35.900" class="transcript_line"> project, slow progress but progress nevertheless. That evening we arranged a visit to the south</div><div id="00:17:42.540" class="transcript_line"> of the island for later in the week to meet up with an old friend who is now the proud</div><div id="00:17:47.020" class="transcript_line"> owner of a building plot full of stones with spectacular views. At least it would allow</div><div id="00:17:52.780" class="transcript_line"> the architectonists and the builders to make progress or conduct convoluted discussions</div><div id="00:17:58.380" class="transcript_line"> with local builders merchants without our assistance.</div></div></p>
