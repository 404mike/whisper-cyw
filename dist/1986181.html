    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Autotranscribe writes an ode to Pembroke Dock. This is a collage poem that I made out of some of the mistakes made by my autotranscribing software when I was transcribing the interviews for this project.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And again, yeah, that&#039;s okay, and that&#039;s right. It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t intend to, you can let me know. Don&#039;t worry if that&#039;s, don&#039;t worry if I ask a question. It&#039;s really simple. It&#039;s this bar, this bizarre, okay, and like, you know it probably was.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I mean, at least, you know, I don&#039;t. It&#039;s a fine. And the other thing about the way we are talking, stop me whenever you like, if you&#039;re like, no, this isn&#039;t, this isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t want to talk. I&#039;m mostly not perfect. Don&#039;t feel.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the final thing about that is let me know, vacuums. Oh, so you do understand. No, I&#039;ve literally just as you can. All over town since I left, like that street over there, for the light of Polly looked really strange. Don&#039;t worry about it. I always am. Like obviously I do. Yeah. I wanted to ask, would you mind talking about the journey? Kind of like living in the dark.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m picnic here and right now the fairies, I see him as well from my street when I&#039;m kind of walking sometimes. It&#039;s not somewhere. It&#039;s quite a lot. You can see from the dark and the first is the sensible barracks. The song goes into the modern day, but it&#039;s more, it&#039;s more of a place.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of people don&#039;t realize and you want to walk to a point which are probably fearless parts away from each other. Draw like a boundary. Water followed old country, gunpowder, just like natural.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Walking through the site in what Justice says that a minute, as long as you can see me, I&#039;m going to try. But then if I go there, it&#039;s like, do not mean you left. Yes, I just stranded a bit. It&#039;s such a lot. Yeah, okay. To reach out there. So they&#039;re there. What day? Oh, it&#039;s very fresh. I find sometimes. Sorry.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We had, I just thought myself. I don&#039;t know. I came over. I think I told you the last hour empty as well. Oh my God. No, I have don&#039;t like and it&#039;s all about like what? What do you want about? Why do you want? Okay.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So they put down the day and I had to apply. I&#039;ve arrived at the location. That&#039;s where you end out by Angle Bay. I think a lot of people realize they&#039;re not going to be around forever. Do you stop walking though? No, no, no, no, I don&#039;t mind. Then it went to be, you know, caught up.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s all like, I cannot understand. I see exactly why people wake up beside me. I think islands. I&#039;ve been interested to see what you think. How kind of far islands. And oh yeah, kind of. But like much fear though. But I, I still think it&#039;s probably very much. I mean, I&#039;ve only ever been once.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But we, one of them were like, are we on the scraps of the moment? Yeah, it did me when I don&#039;t believe you. And I thought, oh, you really, I just want to show you. It&#039;s like then one of the old times actually kind of a history of hemorrhage. Like these towers, which obviously exist.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the best place to be. It&#039;s actually kind of a small town we&#039;ve got just from memory. What I&#039;ll miss when I&#039;m sure the oldest. I never heard of community. I&#039;m showing you now the tower again and behind an old tickling pond. Yeah, well, what is now?</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone&#039;s trying to do something little to wherever it may be. The parts of other kind of mix up before the clarity existed and my moment. I used to take that and that wasn&#039;t that long ago. Conversations actually with people. Tall high feelings. And even if you, even if I, it&#039;s just a shame. It&#039;s kind of a small town.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Paradox Pembroke dock permit not and you know Columbus fell over then. This is East on the risk of as well halfway down the darkness stock. Can you hear me?</div></div></p>
