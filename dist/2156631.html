    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hi this is Mick Plaskin at Elan Valley Link and I&#039;m here with Brett Creed and</div><div id="00:00:08.040" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re going to have a discussion about your reasons for being here etc. So</div><div id="00:00:14.320" class="transcript_line"> where have you come from? Petworth in West Sussex. Okay and when did you</div><div id="00:00:19.240" class="transcript_line"> actually arrive? Yesterday. Okay what have you seen so far? Anything of interest?</div><div id="00:00:25.740" class="transcript_line"> Well lots of things, lots of beautiful countryside. Okay. We&#039;ve driven up from</div><div id="00:00:34.460" class="transcript_line"> Sussex, we came across and then went up into Monmouthshire and then from</div><div id="00:00:39.260" class="transcript_line"> Monmouthshire across to the Glenuska State and near Crickhowell and then from</div><div id="00:00:47.100" class="transcript_line"> there up to Raida. Okay. We camped last night at Woodhouse Farm in Raida and</div><div id="00:00:55.500" class="transcript_line"> someone at the campsite mentioned that we&#039;re now off towards Aberystwyth or</div><div id="00:01:00.060" class="transcript_line"> towards the west coast so someone said oh you need to take the mountain road to</div><div id="00:01:05.060" class="transcript_line"> Aberystwyth and then we saw the dam signs so we thought we&#039;d come up this</div><div id="00:01:10.380" class="transcript_line"> way as well. Excellent choice. So we didn&#039;t know this was here but we expected in all</div><div id="00:01:14.380" class="transcript_line"> this spectacular scenery to see spectacular things and this definitely is</div><div id="00:01:18.580" class="transcript_line"> a spectacular spot. Okay so for what you&#039;ve just said did you do any research before you came here?</div><div id="00:01:23.380" class="transcript_line"> No, only with campsites. We sort of you know wanted to head to the middle of</div><div id="00:01:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Wales rather than just go straight to the coast. Okay. Check out the sites and</div><div id="00:01:33.460" class="transcript_line"> the valleys and whatever and that&#039;s what we&#039;ve done. Okay. On what limited things</div><div id="00:01:38.420" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve seen so far can you see any room for improvement? No, not at all. Not at all.</div><div id="00:01:44.820" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so. I mean how can you improve upon this really? The one thing</div><div id="00:01:51.920" class="transcript_line"> my colleague said was well it would be great if there was a footpath across the</div><div id="00:01:55.660" class="transcript_line"> top of the dam or somehow you could walk across the top of the dam and get a real</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> view of it but apart from that apart from having a Lancaster fly over every</div><div id="00:02:03.080" class="transcript_line"> day I can&#039;t see how it can be improved. We have a few. We have quite a few around here. Oh wow fantastic.</div><div id="00:02:09.400" class="transcript_line"> So what are you going to plan to see next? We&#039;re going to see the sea next. Right.</div><div id="00:02:15.600" class="transcript_line"> In Aberystwyth? Yeah well no probably south New Quay. Okay. We&#039;re going over that way.</div><div id="00:02:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Have you been to the visitor centre at all? No I haven&#039;t. Okay. So who have you</div><div id="00:02:28.760" class="transcript_line"> actually come with? Just friends. Friends? Yeah. Okay. Would you consider coming here</div><div id="00:02:35.520" class="transcript_line"> again? Oh very much so. Yeah. Would that be in the near future? Possibly next year.</div><div id="00:02:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah. It&#039;s always nice to see. Indeed. Do you think that coming here</div><div id="00:02:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Monday to Friday is any different to weekends? I would say that we&#039;re the sort</div><div id="00:02:53.840" class="transcript_line"> of people that like to, would love it or like it, prefer it when we feel like</div><div id="00:02:59.440" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re the only people in the world as it were. So I would definitely say that</div><div id="00:03:04.160" class="transcript_line"> midweek is a better and probably less busy time to visit such sites. Okay. And</div><div id="00:03:10.040" class="transcript_line"> how are you finding the roads around here? Fine. Yeah absolutely fine. Good. Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:15.080" class="transcript_line"> Okay well thank you very much for that. No it&#039;s all right. It&#039;s a pleasure. Thank you.</div><div id="00:03:19.160" class="transcript_line"> We were going to carry on, sorry, we were going to carry on. Interview terminated.</div><div id="00:03:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Thank you. Or even ended.</div></div></p>
