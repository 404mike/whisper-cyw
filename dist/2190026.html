We know he was based down there and</div><div id="00:01:24.720" class="transcript_line"> he was based at one stage with two other people and my mother kept flat for them so they could</div><div id="00:01:36.960" class="transcript_line"> when they weren&#039;t on duty they could go and relax there. So he had a very distinguished career</div><div id="00:01:43.360" class="transcript_line"> because he became a squadron leader having gone in as was he a pilot? Yes he was so he&#039;d like to fly</div><div id="00:01:50.400" class="transcript_line"> and and rose quite up the ranks so talking about the problems on his kidney it was something that</div><div id="00:01:58.240" class="transcript_line"> happened at Dunkirk which was that he drank? Well I&#039;m assuming as the story goes that he drank</div><div id="00:02:09.200" class="transcript_line"> water from sea water or infected water and he was very lucky to get on a boat to come home.</div><div id="00:02:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And to be operated on the kitchen table was something else too? It was a big wooden one.</div><div id="00:02:22.800" class="transcript_line"> Was it? A good table.</div><div id="00:02:27.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know quite how they sorted it out that&#039;s where the story goes anyway.</div><div id="00:02:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Sue very much that was lovely thank you thanks very much.</div></div></p>
