    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Truck 7, The Ravine. Hard conditions require hard men.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re on a plateau here, more or less, about 500 meters high. In the ice age this would have all been covered by an ice sheet.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When the ice started to melt, the ice sheet retreated, you got little lakes forming at the edge of the ice.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Glass Lin is a remnant of one of those lakes, really. Just a little glacial pond left behind in a little dip.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a huge amount of water released when the ice melted, and that poured over the edge of the escarpment</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and carved out deep ravines like the one we&#039;ve got just to the right of the reserve,</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> which now only has a small stream in it, but it would have had hundreds of thousands of gallons of water</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> pouring down there at the end of the ice age, cutting it deeply down in through the gravel.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of this surface is gravel and stone left from the ice sheet melting.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Beneath the glacial gravel, mudstones and shales, hundreds of millions of years old, form the underlying geology.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> These were affected by volcanic activity further north, and contain veins of valuable minerals,</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> mostly lead and zinc with some silver. Hence the large-scale lead mining activity at the Livet on the Mountain Road.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> This road, from which you gained access to the Winford-Born Thomas Memorial, is the only significant visual legacy of this mining.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Life for the men that worked there was very hard, and mining would not be their only employment,</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> as Yeston discovered when reading a miner&#039;s diary.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d say you&#039;d get up at five in the morning, go and do something like a 14-hour shift in the mine,</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> then go and help out with the shearing, then go home and do some work on his own farm,</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> then go to bed and then get up the next morning and do that six days a week.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And you just think, how on earth, you know, the strength of these men to do that day in, day out, all year round,</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, it just beggars belief, and people complain they&#039;ve got a hard life nowadays,</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and they think, yeah right, you don&#039;t know how lucky we are, honestly, we really don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You read some of these stories and you think they were hard, hard men.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The birds around here are a bit feisty too.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> From ground nesters such as the red grouse and skylark, to the more predatory hen harrier and merlin,</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> each raise its young in the often wild conditions.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The peregrine falcon, the world&#039;s most widespread bird of prey,</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> can also be found nesting on the steep crags of the ravine.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> However, you are more likely to hear its screeching call than catch a glimpse.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> In mid-dive, it can reach speeds of 200 miles an hour, making it the fastest animal in the world.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Two further birds of prey commonly spotted here are buzzards and their fork-tailed cousins, the red kite.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I always think buzzards are a bit more Lancaster bomber-like in their shape, they&#039;re a bit heftier,</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> particularly when next to a red kite.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Red kite is the long, lanky looking bird, whereas the buzzard is a bit sort of stocky and heavily built,</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and a bit more oomph to it more or less.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Just a reminder to retrace your steps back to stop 6.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Turn right and follow the shoreline of the lake.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Listen to track 8 after crossing the small wooden boardwalk bridge and passing through the wooden kissing gate.</div></div></p>
