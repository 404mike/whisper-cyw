    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I play traditional folk music. Got a lot of friends who do that and I set up, I was the chairman of</div><div id="00:00:06.960" class="transcript_line"> the Fishguard Folk Music Club for many years, 20 years, and part of that was setting up a folk</div><div id="00:00:14.320" class="transcript_line"> music festival which we&#039;ve had in Fishguard usually the last weekend of May and that folk music</div><div id="00:00:20.800" class="transcript_line"> festival attracts a lot of people, a lot of Irish people, because lots of the music in this area is</div><div id="00:00:28.080" class="transcript_line"> or sounds very Irish. If you look at the telephone directory in Fishguard you&#039;ll find an</div><div id="00:00:33.280" class="transcript_line"> awful lot of Irish names, so there&#039;s been a big interchange with people back and forth. Long before</div><div id="00:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> the ferry was here, because this was one of the old medieval routes across to Ireland, Fishguard is</div><div id="00:00:43.600" class="transcript_line"> one of the few places where you get a safe anchorage on the north coast of Pembrokeshire. It&#039;s a good</div><div id="00:00:48.960" class="transcript_line"> place to land a boat because the way that the bay is configured means that you can hide a boat in</div><div id="00:00:54.640" class="transcript_line"> there and the weather doesn&#039;t get you. There&#039;s only Fishguard and Newport that you can say</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> that there&#039;s an all-weather anchorage and Newport has difficulties with the tide. It&#039;s not possible</div><div id="00:01:07.920" class="transcript_line"> to get into Newport Harbour or up the river into Newport when the tide is low, so Fishguard is</div><div id="00:01:13.040" class="transcript_line"> always a good bet. If you came around St David&#039;s Head anyone coming into Wales from the south</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> west would probably hit Fishguard first. So it made its money from being a port that you get to</div><div id="00:01:26.320" class="transcript_line"> quite easily off the main trade routes. That&#039;s why it was quite affluent. You&#039;ve got a lot of</div><div id="00:01:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Georgian houses, you&#039;ve got a lot of what looked like affluent houses for their time. Not so affluent</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> these days. But the fact was certainly back in Georgian times it was an affluent place.</div></div></p>
