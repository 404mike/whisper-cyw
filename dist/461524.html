    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m proud to say that my grandfather, who marched in the general strike and the mining strike in 1926, also marched with me in 1985 when we marched back to work.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll never forget that day. I was outside Mardie Hall and Mardie Church was next door and the bells were pealing. There were cameras from all over the world.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a lot of people there in preparation to walk back up the road to the colliery, united in arms. Obviously there were the miners, everybody else working in Mardie colliery.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Lots of the wives, lots of the children, everybody was united. That is still shown on TV today.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Although my father passed away, because he worked in the colliery as well, my father was 57, 58 when we went back to work.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> My father passed away in 1991. There was a programme on the other day and I actually taped it and there was my father.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was great, that was. But I can also tell you that when we go back to work, because there&#039;d be no work for a 12 month, there were problems underground and there was no calling for the first 3 to 4 weeks,</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> my take on pay in March in 1985, my first take on pay was £77 the next week, it was £77 and the following week it was £78.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was a surface worker and of course you earn less money and because there was no coal being produced you didn&#039;t earn any bonus.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But having said that, even though when we were doing the bonus, because on the surface we were doing 40% of what a coal face worker, which we likely saw, we were doing like 100%, we were lucky to take home over £110.</div></div></p>
