Yarn.</div><div id="00:00:05.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m talking to Dennis Pointon and he&#039;s going to tell me about his uncle Harold.</div><div id="00:00:12.840" class="transcript_line"> So I shall pass over to him.</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> So what can you remember?</div><div id="00:00:15.900" class="transcript_line"> Did he have special memories, your uncle?</div><div id="00:00:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Can you name him first?</div><div id="00:00:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t said his surname.</div><div id="00:00:22.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Leslie.</div><div id="00:00:24.040" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:25.240" class="transcript_line"> I only met him a couple of times.</div><div id="00:00:30.120" class="transcript_line"> He was very distant to the family when he came from the war.</div><div id="00:00:39.240" class="transcript_line"> Things changed a lot for him.</div><div id="00:00:43.200" class="transcript_line"> He married Auntie well before the war and he had three children.</div><div id="00:00:56.640" class="transcript_line"> And apparently he had a love child later on after the war.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t know anything about it until he died.</div><div id="00:01:10.040" class="transcript_line"> And did he know just before he died?</div><div id="00:01:13.040" class="transcript_line"> No, after he died.</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t know?</div><div id="00:01:17.040" class="transcript_line"> He did, but his children didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:01:21.040" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t know he had another daughter.</div><div id="00:01:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:01:27.040" class="transcript_line"> But that wasn&#039;t during the war.</div><div id="00:01:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Where was he during the war then?</div><div id="00:01:31.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> He was with Monty.</div><div id="00:01:35.080" class="transcript_line"> And how he got to the GC, I was told often that he was a pillar box</div><div id="00:01:48.080" class="transcript_line"> holding a lot of people down, firing at them.</div><div id="00:01:52.080" class="transcript_line"> And he managed to get round and under the pillar box</div><div id="00:01:57.080" class="transcript_line"> and took his knees in and killed them all off.</div><div id="00:02:02.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:02:04.120" class="transcript_line"> So he is Harold Erdly, BC.</div><div id="00:02:07.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, for Congleton Cheshire.</div><div id="00:02:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:02:12.120" class="transcript_line"> That is just amazing.</div><div id="00:02:14.120" class="transcript_line"> And he came home from the war and had another love child.</div><div id="00:02:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Did he share his memories about his VC or was he quite quiet about it?</div><div id="00:02:24.120" class="transcript_line"> He was very quiet about it.</div><div id="00:02:26.160" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know his VC meant for quite so many years after the war.</div><div id="00:02:36.160" class="transcript_line"> I was born just after the war as well.</div><div id="00:02:42.160" class="transcript_line"> So I was talking to sons a lot</div><div id="00:02:49.160" class="transcript_line"> and they corresponded with their dad</div><div id="00:02:53.200" class="transcript_line"> because he decided not to live with them anymore.</div><div id="00:02:59.200" class="transcript_line"> He got divorced but never married again.</div><div id="00:03:03.200" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t live with the mother of his love child?</div><div id="00:03:09.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know one, that one.</div><div id="00:03:11.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure one.</div><div id="00:03:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s not ask difficult questions.</div><div id="00:03:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Sorry about that.</div><div id="00:03:17.200" class="transcript_line"> In Congleton, is there a statue of him?</div><div id="00:03:20.240" class="transcript_line"> There is a statue of him with a rifle</div><div id="00:03:26.240" class="transcript_line"> and a more...</div><div id="00:03:28.240" class="transcript_line"> my demoral stand in Congleton, centre of Congleton.</div><div id="00:03:34.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s well worth visiting.</div><div id="00:03:39.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:40.240" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:03:42.240" class="transcript_line"> So has it been written anywhere else about his bravery?</div><div id="00:03:46.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:03:48.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:50.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if he was with...</div><div id="00:04:03.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it is some sort of thing</div><div id="00:04:08.280" class="transcript_line"> other than the one in Congleton.</div><div id="00:04:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, OK.</div><div id="00:04:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:04:18.320" class="transcript_line"> So he must have been phenomenally brave</div><div id="00:04:20.320" class="transcript_line"> and he came home, got divorced</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> and then what did he do?</div><div id="00:04:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Did he take up some other employment after the war?</div><div id="00:04:28.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think he did.</div><div id="00:04:31.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:04:36.320" class="transcript_line"> When he came back a bit,</div><div id="00:04:39.320" class="transcript_line"> when he came to Congleton after the war</div><div id="00:04:43.360" class="transcript_line"> he was a big parade in the town</div><div id="00:04:47.360" class="transcript_line"> and he was on top of standing up on a jeep</div><div id="00:04:52.360" class="transcript_line"> and everybody was waving and buntings out</div><div id="00:04:58.360" class="transcript_line"> and everything, welcoming back.</div><div id="00:05:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And it seems so.</div><div id="00:05:07.360" class="transcript_line"> He died a death with who he was.</div><div id="00:05:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Nobody.</div><div id="00:05:14.400" class="transcript_line"> You talk to him about it.</div><div id="00:05:16.400" class="transcript_line"> No idea.</div><div id="00:05:18.400" class="transcript_line"> If you mention Harold Durdby, VC man,</div><div id="00:05:22.400" class="transcript_line"> they wouldn&#039;t have a clue.</div><div id="00:05:24.400" class="transcript_line"> No, things have got lost, I think, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:05:27.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:29.400" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask you something about his son.</div><div id="00:05:33.400" class="transcript_line"> So can I ask you whether you know where the VC itself is,</div><div id="00:05:37.400" class="transcript_line"> where the medal is?</div><div id="00:05:39.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was with his son Roy</div><div id="00:05:45.440" class="transcript_line"> in Crestarton.</div><div id="00:05:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, he&#039;s died now</div><div id="00:05:52.440" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know where these VC medals come.</div><div id="00:05:57.440" class="transcript_line"> Whether his wife still got it, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:02.440" class="transcript_line"> Well, let&#039;s hope it&#039;s being looked after.</div><div id="00:06:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for sharing that memory</div><div id="00:06:06.440" class="transcript_line"> about Harold Eardley, VC.</div><div id="00:06:08.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s good to know
