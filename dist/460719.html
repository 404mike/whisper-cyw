    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We had an extra neighbour who was an invalid, wheelchair bound, and he was the first one,</div><div id="00:00:08.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure in the whole village, who had a television.</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And he just happened to live next door.</div><div id="00:00:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So my dad and I used to pop in there several evenings a week to watch it.</div><div id="00:00:24.080" class="transcript_line"> A little 15 inch Phillips in the corner, black and white of course.</div><div id="00:00:31.520" class="transcript_line"> But, and everything was exciting wasn&#039;t it, you know, whatever was on.</div><div id="00:00:36.480" class="transcript_line"> The programs were only on in the evening, no daytime television in those days.</div><div id="00:00:45.920" class="transcript_line"> If you ask me what stands out, I can&#039;t remember, because I would have been about</div><div id="00:00:53.520" class="transcript_line"> you know, seven, up to about 15, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t get over the excitement of actually watching things.</div><div id="00:01:09.680" class="transcript_line"> One of the things, I remember one of the programs that I still remember today,</div><div id="00:01:14.640" class="transcript_line"> there was a program about the end of the war, and a news bulletin or a news reel</div><div id="00:01:22.320" class="transcript_line"> on the concentration camps.</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And I remember my dad standing in front of the screen so that I couldn&#039;t see the horrors.</div><div id="00:01:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And that sticks with me today.</div><div id="00:01:39.600" class="transcript_line"> If you ask me what else was on, I couldn&#039;t tell you.</div><div id="00:01:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no, even then I was really keen on sport.</div><div id="00:01:46.160" class="transcript_line"> But I can&#039;t remember any sport being on.</div><div id="00:01:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps the FA Cup final, but that was about it, you know.</div><div id="00:01:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh I do remember, yeah, what I do remember was children&#039;s programs.</div><div id="00:02:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Andy Pandy, Muffin the Mew, a bit later on, Sucky, you know.</div><div id="00:02:09.440" class="transcript_line"> Those, but perhaps those were the only things that were on I suppose.</div><div id="00:02:13.040" class="transcript_line"> And the other thing I remember was the, there was always, there was the intermission.</div><div id="00:02:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Unless the screen was there.</div><div id="00:02:20.480" class="transcript_line"> And you just sit there watching that, thinking what, you know, there&#039;s a picture across there,</div><div id="00:02:26.320" class="transcript_line"> there was nothing happening on it.</div><div id="00:02:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was the one thing.</div><div id="00:02:33.920" class="transcript_line"> And then I also remember, my dad sang in the Trio O&#039;Kimena West Choir.</div><div id="00:02:43.040" class="transcript_line"> And in those days, they used to do BBC, used to do it, only BBC of course.</div><div id="00:02:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Used to do an outside broadcast, Kamu is called, out and about or something.</div><div id="00:02:55.280" class="transcript_line"> And the choir had gone to Trichnum to watch wheels play in England.</div><div id="00:03:01.680" class="transcript_line"> And the TV had covered their trip.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And after the match, it was live, I only remember it was live,</div><div id="00:03:12.320" class="transcript_line"> them interviewing some members of the choir about the game.</div><div id="00:03:15.440" class="transcript_line"> And there was my dad.</div><div id="00:03:18.880" class="transcript_line"> And they said to him, can you tell us anything?</div><div id="00:03:23.920" class="transcript_line"> And my dad said, well you got so excited, he said, well Wales scored.</div><div id="00:03:29.360" class="transcript_line"> I bought a new cap to go to the match.</div><div id="00:03:33.360" class="transcript_line"> And I threw it up in the air, he said.</div><div id="00:03:37.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, like everybody did in those days.</div><div id="00:03:40.080" class="transcript_line"> I lost it.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember him telling the TV interviewer,</div><div id="00:03:45.520" class="transcript_line"> I get in big trouble when I get home from my wife.</div><div id="00:03:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Because she only bought me that cap to go away.</div><div id="00:03:53.760" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:03:55.440" class="transcript_line"> And that would have been in the 1950s?</div><div id="00:03:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that would have been the late 50s.</div><div id="00:04:02.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Around about, no, perhaps mid 50s probably.</div><div id="00:04:07.920" class="transcript_line"> 50, 54, 55 perhaps.</div></div></p>
