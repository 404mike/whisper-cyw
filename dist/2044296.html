    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your full name?</div><div id="00:00:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Susan Elizabeth Cleary.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Do we have permission to record this interview?</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes we do.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Where and when were you born?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Cardiff, October 25th 1952.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you meet Father Paul Zottori?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Met him when he was serving as a priest in the parish in Harford West.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your earliest memory or memories of Father Zottori?</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Earliest memories? Probably because my husband was living in a flat in Harford West,</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> the first time away from home, he had as always gone to the Catholic Church to make himself known.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Our first memories of him were welcoming us into the parish and knowing that he liked to go out for a drink,</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> he would go out for a drink sometimes with the boys, and seeing him riding around Harford West on his motorbike</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and thinking my goodness me this is more than a priest, this is a real bloke, you know one of the lads.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the first meeting with him and getting to know him was as newcomers to the parish really.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When did you move to Harford West?</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Well Rory was there in 1974, that was when he first moved there, and I joined him a bit later after we got married in 75.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So he really struck you as being what, unconventional for a priest?</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very unconventional as a priest and someone who liked to mix with the young people, he was young himself really,</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> someone who liked to mix with the young people, liked to get to know the young people,</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and unconventional in as much as the things that he would say during Mass led you to believe that he was so much more than just a priest,</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean that sounds silly, he was a human being first and foremost with his faults and his admissions to his faults,</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and I remember one occasion during a service he had berated the congregation because we had another priest there,</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> a parish priest who was older and not as interesting and people would put their heads around the door,</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and if they saw it was the older priest they would go away and come back when Father Sartori was saying Mass,</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and on one Sunday, oh my goodness me, he let rip, he said to us all, you do not come to church for the priest,</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> he said you come to worship God, and we were all quaking in our seats, but we didn&#039;t take any notice of him,</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> we still only went to listen to him preach, you know, because he was a good preacher.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And another occasion during a service, which was one of the reasons why I felt that he was so much so human,</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> was it was during the consecration and he was literally holding the host up, and he stopped,</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and he looked at us and he said, how many of you actually believe this is the body of Christ?</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, this is the priest asking us, because he said, sometimes I don&#039;t believe it, I doubt,</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said I have to work really hard at reminding myself of why I&#039;m here and the importance of this moment in the service,</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and it really hit home to me that here was a man who was, not just a man, he was a priest who was able to say,</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not plain sailing, we all have doubts, and it&#039;s okay, and that as a young adult made me feel,</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> this is okay, this is good, this is what the church should be about, you know, and that was one of his strengths,</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> was bringing religion into your everyday life and making you feel that it was okay to have doubts,</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and maybe some days you didn&#039;t think it was right, and it was fine, it was okay, and that helped me a lot with my faith,</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> as a young adult we all struggle with, you know, is this the right thing to do, do we really want this anymore,</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and he really kept me in the church for a long time because of his philosophy and his way of reaching out to people</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and making them feel that the mass was for them, the church was for them, it wasn&#039;t just for priests and holy people and saints,</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> it was for everybody, you know, so that was my experience of him in Haverford West.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on, I think I told you, he married us, and Rory and I were married in 1975 in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> which was where we were both from originally, and our parish priest at the time agreed that Father Paul could actually come to Cardiff and marry us,</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and now before the wedding traditionally Rory had a stag night to which Father Paul went,</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and on the day itself, June the 19th, 1975, July the 19th, I arrived at the church in the car,</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was told by the usher, could you go round the block, and I thought, oh, crumbs, the groom hasn&#039;t arrived, you know, this is it,</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> so off I go, round the block, come back, could you go round again, the priest hasn&#039;t turned up, oh no, what are we going to do,</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s driving up from Haverford West, so I went round a third time, and when I got there, there he was, bright as a ray of sunshine,</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> hi, everything alright, yes, Father, come on then, and he was all robed up, and into the church we went, lovely service,</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> we got to the sermon, and he said to the congregation, just sit down and talk among yourselves, what I&#039;ve got to say is only for Rory and Sue,</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> so we sat there with our backs to the congregation, and you know, I can&#039;t for the life of me remember what he said,</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> but all I know is he had us in fits of laughter, and the congregation could just see our shoulders going up and down, up and down,</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> laughing at whatever it was that he said to us, but he didn&#039;t want to share it with the congregation, just for us,</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> which that was a nice little personal touch, you know, so that was my, those are my main memories about Father Paul,</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> later on when he became sick, Rory had been moved to Swansea, and he went to visit him in the hospital,</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> and of course because of his illness, he was lying face down, it was very difficult to sort of converse with him,</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> very tragic, very sad, a great loss, taken far too soon, but I think in the short time that he was there,</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> he touched the hearts of so many people, and you&#039;ll know yourselves that that legend is still alive with all the Paul Sartori Foundation and all the charity shops,</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and we were actually down in Temby last Easter, and we said we&#039;ll go and have a little ride into Nayland and Halford West,</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> have a look around, and we were in Nayland, and there was a Paul Sartori charity shop, and I said we&#039;ve got to go in,</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve got to buy something, I don&#039;t care what it is, we&#039;ve just got to go in, and the lady in there, we told her that we knew him,</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and she said well she didn&#039;t know him, she was too young to know him, but she said the number of people who go into the shop,</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> just because they remember him, and they just want to keep his memory alive, keep that foundation going, keep giving as he did, giving all the time,</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> a wonderful man, absolutely wonderful.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> How would you describe him as a person?</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Fun, a little outrageous perhaps, and kind.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the kindness and the willingness to get to know people, to take the time to talk to them, whether it was in the pub or after mass or whatever,</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> he always had time for people, and I think the fun thing is the one thing I remember most, he liked to laugh, he liked a joke, he liked a bit of fun,</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and he always, he was always smiling, he was always a happy chappy, that&#039;s how I would describe him.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. I think you&#039;ve probably anticipated this to some extent, but do you have any other favourite stories about Father Paul?</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think the two most, my two favourite were the wedding and the occasion at mass, I think those are my absolute favourites.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. And we always ask the interviewees, did Father Paul impact your life in some way? Well obviously he married you and your husband, so that&#039;s quite a fundamental influence.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you think of any other impact he might have had?</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I think, as I said in the beginning, he kept me in the church, he kept my faith going for a long time, to a time when perhaps a lot of young people would be leaving the church, early twenties,</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and yes, so that was an impact, and I will never forget the things that he said, and now, I did leave the church for a while, I&#039;m back, and I often think about what he used to say,</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and I think that&#039;s the biggest impact he&#039;s had on my life, is my religion, really.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thank you. And I know this is a difficult question, but if you could sum up Father Paul in three words, what would they be?</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Fun, as I said, and conventional, which was a word you used, and sincere.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. And is there anything, finally, else you&#039;d like to mention?</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so, I think I&#039;ve said everything that I need to.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you, thank you so much Sue, it&#039;s been really, really useful having you share your memories of Father Paul with us.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And very, very grateful, and good to see you across the Irish Sea.</div></div></p>
