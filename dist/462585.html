    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In the 1950s, television was only on in short bursts.</div><div id="00:00:05.840" class="transcript_line"> You literally got a children&#039;s hour at five o&#039;clock, followed by the news,</div><div id="00:00:15.680" class="transcript_line"> and then television service resumed again. It must have closed down at half past six,</div><div id="00:00:27.120" class="transcript_line"> and then resumed again around about eight o&#039;clock and went through till ten,</div><div id="00:00:37.440" class="transcript_line"> or perhaps eleven, because I can remember the epilogue man, known among school friends as the</div><div id="00:00:43.920" class="transcript_line"> epilogue man, who was at one stage was one of the, it was, they had a list of people who did it,</div><div id="00:00:59.600" class="transcript_line"> and we would watch the Padre and then we&#039;d compare the Padre with the Methodi Mound and</div><div id="00:01:08.880" class="transcript_line"> the Anglican Priest and so on.</div><div id="00:01:18.400" class="transcript_line"> When we moved, when my family moved out of London, which was in 1956,</div><div id="00:01:27.840" class="transcript_line"> so, and then we moved up to North Wales, actually higher up the mountain than here,</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> up in Gwynfyn village. We didn&#039;t have television for about two years,</div><div id="00:01:53.840" class="transcript_line"> and then I can remember going to a friend&#039;s home to watch, of all things, the Beverly Sisters,</div><div id="00:02:00.880" class="transcript_line"> and then, and somebody else had television, and they were rather keen on Sergeant Bilko,</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> which I didn&#039;t really understand. When we got television in our home again,</div><div id="00:02:20.560" class="transcript_line"> when we got television in our home again, I remember sitting with my grandma,</div><div id="00:02:28.400" class="transcript_line"> who was over on a visit from Leeds, and we watched a production of Bernard Shaw, Major Barbara,</div><div id="00:02:39.680" class="transcript_line"> and the young woman heroine was Judi Dench, and my grandma said, she&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:02:47.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll watch her, we&#039;ll watch out for her, and I still do.</div><div id="00:02:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Grandma always also liked come dancing. Victor Sylvester.</div><div id="00:03:08.880" class="transcript_line"> What did I watch? By then I was sort of at the leaving school age,</div><div id="00:03:15.360" class="transcript_line"> school in Wrexham. It was differently orientated from my London school. My London school was</div><div id="00:03:26.400" class="transcript_line"> turning us out to be career women, and we were being told, assessed, helping our decisions for</div><div id="00:03:38.800" class="transcript_line"> which way we were going. Up here in Wrexham, we were much more being turned out to be good wives</div><div id="00:03:46.400" class="transcript_line"> and mothers, good housekeepers. So somehow the intellectual side of life wasn&#039;t brought forward</div><div id="00:03:57.840" class="transcript_line"> so much. Much better to be able to make a good Christmas cake or to be able to make a good</div><div id="00:04:07.360" class="transcript_line"> cake or to cut and sew your own clothes. And then when I left school,</div><div id="00:04:21.600" class="transcript_line"> I was busy with a young life and we didn&#039;t watch TV. Not to make a thing about it.</div><div id="00:04:33.280" class="transcript_line"> But in later years, after I was married and had a family, I watched TV. Ah!</div><div id="00:04:50.160" class="transcript_line"> My daughter fell into a category for the birthday trust, and when she was assessed at three and a</div><div id="00:04:59.120" class="transcript_line"> half, the lady doing the questionnaire asked me how much television my daughter watched.</div><div id="00:05:08.800" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, children don&#039;t watch a lot. And I told her what was watched. And she spent</div><div id="00:05:19.920" class="transcript_line"> three-quarters of an hour trying to trip my daughter up to find out if she watched more</div><div id="00:05:24.560" class="transcript_line"> television than that. Because she didn&#039;t believe you could just watch play school</div><div id="00:05:29.520" class="transcript_line"> and just watch part of the children&#039;s hour program. So I was always very selective.</div><div id="00:05:39.520" class="transcript_line"> I also got indignant with the mothers who told me they were seeing the same Andy Pandy programs</div><div id="00:05:44.880" class="transcript_line"> over again with the third child. Because I&#039;d watched those programs with my younger sister</div><div id="00:05:51.440" class="transcript_line"> in the 1950s. And I&#039;m not quite sure how they coloured the film</div><div id="00:06:02.160" class="transcript_line"> for the later things. So yes, I&#039;ve always been quite selective.</div><div id="00:06:09.840" class="transcript_line"> And just at the moment, I don&#039;t actually have a television. Because about four years ago,</div><div id="00:06:22.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d settled myself down on the sofa to watch Gardener&#039;s World and gone to sleep.</div><div id="00:06:28.480" class="transcript_line"> And as that was one of the programs at Instagram, I was very, very, very, very,</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> very, very, very, very excited. So then programs that instigated my husband and I getting a colour</div><div id="00:06:45.680" class="transcript_line"> television, I thought the programs had rather gone off. And so my licence was due within a few weeks.</div><div id="00:06:58.480" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t having a television, I wasn&#039;t renewing my licence.</div><div id="00:07:02.640" class="transcript_line"> And I haven&#039;t really missed it.</div><div id="00:07:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Radio Times does a good job in keeping up with what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="00:07:11.480" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any experience of watching television with a lot of other people or in a public place?</div><div id="00:07:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:24.480" class="transcript_line"> These days I&#039;m not without television altogether because I go to the gym and upstairs where the machines are, particularly the running machines, there&#039;s TV and you decide which one you want.</div><div id="00:07:39.480" class="transcript_line"> So I look for a rugby match.</div><div id="00:07:44.480" class="transcript_line"> Although the soccer and the cricket is quite good because you get to see the pictures and enjoy the game without the overpowering commentary.</div><div id="00:07:56.480" class="transcript_line"> Of all the things you&#039;ve seen on television, what&#039;s had the greatest impression on you?</div><div id="00:08:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Ooh.</div><div id="00:08:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Obviously what we started with, the funeral of George VI, Michael Burke&#039;s Ethiopia,</div><div id="00:08:32.480" class="transcript_line"> and possibly some of the natural dramas, volcanic tsunami.</div><div id="00:08:57.480" class="transcript_line"> The power of what can happen that we as the human race have no control over.</div></div></p>
