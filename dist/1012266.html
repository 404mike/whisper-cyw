    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Where were you born? Born in Liverpool, 1939, just before the war, on the January before the war.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Bootle? Yes, I mean that&#039;s one of the things that I suppose Thomas and I got on so well.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a Bootle lad and I was a Liverpool lad, although he was much more of a scouser than I was in a sense.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I grew up in the posh part of Liverpool, they would say, in Mosley Hill.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> My parents were doctors. My father was a GP in Mosley Hill and Allerton for maybe 30 years before he retired with ill health.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I came from a medical family. They were Glasgow graduates and came to Liverpool.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, Liverpool is my hometown. I did a degree in civil engineering at the university there.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And my first job was with Robert McAlpine. Met the personnel officer and he says, when do you want to start?</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh well, I&#039;ll be there in a holiday, September will be alright. Fine, he said.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he sent me off to Newport, South Wales, where they were part of a huge construction team building the Clanwerne Steelworks.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Richard Thomas and Baldwin, as it was in those days. It was a massive, massive thing.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I spent most of the time setting out the concrete bases for the huge steel rolling mills and the steelmaking plants.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And the whole lot was piled. They had to raise the level of the ground there by about six feet.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all marshlands. And there&#039;ll be lorries coming down from the Welsh valleys day and night with shale and gravel and stuff to raise the level to make it possible to put piling in.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said that you could run a road from Newport to London with the amount of stuff that they brought down from the valleys. Huge amount.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I was there in September and I left, I think that was in 1960 after I graduated.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in 1960. And then stayed there until, I think it was July-ish, 1962.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And the job was coming to the inclusion and I was transferred as part of my career development to go into the design office in Carpines having spent my first 18 months out on site, which is a wonderful experience for me.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I learnt a lot about the world and life and so on.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And being part of a team as well, I suppose.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes. The Chippies as we used to call them, the Labourers. We&#039;re all part of a team and I always thought we were all equally important.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t get on with my job until they did theirs and they couldn&#039;t get on with the job until I had done mine as the engineer.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I moved up to Cheshire, to Nutsford, to the Carpines base there with the nuclear power group and we were designing nuclear power stations.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> My first job was with the Dungeness A, as it&#039;s now called, down at Lyd in Kent.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we once flew a few of us down from Manchester to the Lyd airport to see how the construction was going.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Dungeness moved on to the old Beyond 7 one. That was the first of the advanced gas cool reactors, AGR, a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember designing a pump house for that.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I was based in Nutsford, but that was the very cold winds of 62, 63.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in Diggs in Nutsford with a little lady and another bloke.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was freezing cold. I used to wear my duffle coat in bed at night. No double glazer or anything like that, a little old cottage.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my home was still in Liverpool and I decided that having bought my little mini car in Newport, S69BAX, little white cream mini,</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and so I decided I would see if I could travel from Liverpool each day to Nutsford.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And soon I found there were two other fellows also travelling from Liverpool.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to meet up and take turns in driving from Liverpool to Nutsford each day.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> How long did that take?</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> About three quarters to an hour.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s not too bad.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The new bridge, well, it&#039;s now the old bridge, of course, was opened, you see. That was the arch bridge.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You know they&#039;ve opened a new bridge, the gateway, which is a suspension bridge.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, so you could do it and travelling through the countryside.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I lived at home again and that&#039;s why I think back of the church.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s all part of the story.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Going back to the first arriving in Newport, I was brought up in the Presbyterian Church of England Church in Liverpool</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> when I was baptised and grew up, confirmed and became a member.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, you know, church was at least twice a Sunday, church in the morning, Sunday school in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And in those days, being very Scottish in the family, from a young age I used to wear the kilt every Sunday.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my Sunday best.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And once I came to Newport, I thought I&#039;d look out for a Presbyterian Church.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And catching a bus from Newport town out to where we were living in the McAlpine area,</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> out to where we were living in the McAlpine&#039;s hostels at Pie Corner,</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> was a huge accommodation place for everybody there.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, sort of temporary accommodation hut after hut after hut.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Not huts, what do you call them, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, you had your own room and there were showers and the canteen and things like that.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You were fed and watered.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the road coming out of Newport to Pie Corner, along Corporation Road, I saw this sign,</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Welsh Presbyterian Church.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, well, it was English speaking, I think, which is important.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think probably the following Sunday or so, I must have got a lift or a bus in</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and went to the evening service on the Sunday.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit sort of non-plus because it was all ladies doing everything.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was a bit strange, never had ladies doing everything in the church before.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> See, you&#039;re going back a long time when ladies didn&#039;t do much in the church on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, they were very warm and welcoming and so I went again the following Sunday</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> and met Cyril Somers and that&#039;s where it all started.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And Brian says I did, or Valerie says I did quite a lot in the church,</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what else I did.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it was a choir or not, I used to be in the choir in the church in Liverpool,</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> so I always loved singing, still do.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So whether they had a choir, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But I wouldn&#039;t have had time to do much else, you see,</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> because I used to work five and a half days a week.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Saturday was a normal day and then there was overtime, Saturday afternoons and Sundays as well,</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> which is quite important because I was saving up for a car, you see.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And eventually I was able to, the bank manager, my father knew a bank manager,</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> took out an insurance policy and that was the security for getting a loan for a to-buy car.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so there we were and I had a very warm welcome.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Met the Selby family, the Martin family, all sorts of people.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a lovely community group, very family orientated, I think.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was when the old church was still standing?</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, this is 1960, 1961 to 1962.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So eventually I was moving away back up to Nubsford, you see,</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> said my farewells and I sort of must have kept in touch,</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Christmas cards or something with Syl and Dorothy, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Dorothy.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Dorothy, very bubbly character she was.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I can still hear her laugh or chuckle with it.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> She was lovely.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then things started to happen.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was in Nubsford and living back at home, joined up with the church again,</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I was invited to join the old FLY, the Fellish for Youth, the youth group,</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> which met on a Sunday night.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, when I went to, I should have said that, to Newport,</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose I did stand out because I went to my Sunday best.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I wore my kilt on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, not many Scotsmen wear a kilt in Newport, I&#039;ll tell you.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And maybe they thought, here&#039;s this funny Scotsman who comes to church</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re killed on a Sunday in a Welsh Presbyterian church.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So there you are.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps they thought me a bit different, obviously, but I&#039;m a tall fellow.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sort of six foot three in those days as well as I stood out.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was part of me.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, having joined up in the church in Liverpool again, in Alersan,</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I was asked one time to help out an Anglican church not far away,</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> leading their young people on a weekend conference.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> About four or five of us went along just to assist.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> At the end of this conference, we were asked,</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> will somebody give a testimony about their faith?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We all looked at each other and they looked at me and said,</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Angus, you can do it.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, well, help, having done it in my life before.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, not just what do you believe, why do you believe it, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I can&#039;t remember what I said, but I struggled through.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was, it must have been in October.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the October, the minister of the church, Hal Springbott,</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> gave the annual notice about the need for ministers to train at Westminster College.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And if anybody wants ever to think about it, have a talk with me.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was sitting in the choir stalls and a little voice seemed to say to me,</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> how about you, Angus?</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And that little thought wouldn&#039;t go away.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had a word with my minister and said, what&#039;s involved?</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether I want to do this or what&#039;s involved.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And he told me, and come November,</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> the youth group were taking the evening service and had to plan it</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and who&#039;s going to do the talk or the sermon?</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Who he looked at and I said, well, I&#039;ll have a go.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought as a test that if I could do this, then maybe that&#039;s not saying something to me.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because by this time I had sort of said, well, God, if my life is yours, what do you want me to do?</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I did it and the minister had looked at it beforehand, made one or two suggestions,</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and I got through it, giving my first sermon in my kilt, of course,</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> which I have done one since.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And it all happened.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So I felt, yeah, OK.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I, it was a step of faith.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> If God wants me to be a minister, then the doors will open.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> If he doesn&#039;t, the doors won&#039;t open, will they?</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what a step of faith is about.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to go for it and see what happens.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went for interviews and got past those, had to go to London, got past those.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And lo and behold, this was 1963 by now,</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I found myself doing an entrance exam in Westminster College, and a week later I found out I&#039;d passed.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, so that&#039;s when my training started in Cambridge for three years.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Meanwhile, back in Liverpool, having met up with a youth group, there was a young lady called Althea Jones,</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> whom I used to know in the Sunday school days when she&#039;d been about five or six,</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d be three years old, eight or nine, something like that.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> She had long black hair and pigtails.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I had two friends, Jean and Joan.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And eventually she invited me to join the FOI when I came back to Liverpool.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And within a year or so we sort of had met,</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and obviously been on a few outings with young people, and we fell in love.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the history.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a golden wedding maybe three years ago.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It is 53 years this year.</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Congratulations.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it was 1963.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I must have had some sort of letter from Cyril Somers saying,</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The problem was the church building, the tower was subsiding, I think it was.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The nations were giving way and it was going to have to be demolished.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were planning to have an international voluntary work camp to start a rebuild scheme,</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> but they needed to prepare stuff, the ground works for it.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Would I possibly be able to come and be work leader, if you like, with my engineering experience?</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, Well, if this is what God wants me to do, I&#039;ll have a go.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to the senior engineer working in Nutsford and Central.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it possible to be away for a month doing this project for a church in Newport where we used to work with McAlpine&#039;s then?</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, Yes, but it would be unpaid leave.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> No, you can&#039;t get paid for being away for a month.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re used up on your holiday.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I came down and I was fed and watered for a month.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I stayed in the cell, I think so.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> This time, Alfie and I were engaged and she came down one weekend and met Cyril and Dorothy and the family.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It was only just for a weekend.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We can&#039;t remember if we got any photographs because we didn&#039;t do many in those days.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a few of the steelworks I took, but they&#039;re all transparencies anyway.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, they&#039;ll be quite difficult to view.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Where they are now, I&#039;ve no idea.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so that&#039;s interesting because I got the impression that you were at the time working on the Flanwerne Steelworks.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I&#039;ve gone by them.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No, you&#039;ve not been up there at all.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Sir Robert McAlpine, yes.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re still doing very good firms.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they are.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, they&#039;re doing a big job in Cardiff for the new central hub, is it, for the assembly.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I looked up their website yesterday.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they did the Olympic Park.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Within budget and on time.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> They all did the arse on the Emirates Stadium.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a well-known firm.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was pleased.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When I left them, I gave my notice and I was going to train for college.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I asked the old manager, went, a nice sort of memo said,</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> we think we could have made you into a good engineer.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was interesting because when he realised what I was doing to train for the church,</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> she said, well, and he was a crusader leader.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there crusaders?</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Not really.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s work amongst young people.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s basic.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s not an Anglican group, but it&#039;s a very evangelical group working with young people.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how well it&#039;s going these days now, but it was quite a strong group in gospel when it was there.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So there we are.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We came down and worked for a month and it was amazing.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t really have a record of all the people who came from around the world.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, we have and we&#039;ve tried to contact them through various means.</div><div id="00:16:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The only people that we know...</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They were from the United States, India.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s a Hebrew girl from Israel.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> There was Swiss, Swedish, I think there was English and Welsh.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a Scots girl and incredible.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;d gather at eight o&#039;clock in the morning, prayers outdoors because there&#039;s nowhere to stay for that.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And they worked from eight o&#039;clock till about midday, have lunch somewhere,</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and then they have the afternoon off to go and visit and so on.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> At that time I was of going to retire and have to read in preparation for my entrance exam at Westminster College in Cambridge,</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> trying to read philosophy of religion.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t make head or tail of it.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I was an engineer, you know, this is all new to me, different language.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> At any point did you think, am I really doing the right thing or you didn&#039;t feel...</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No, you just had this faith that this is the right path for you.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if God wanted me to do it, he would open the doors.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I found out for the entrance exam, I had to do New Testament Greek.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That sort of... I mean, the minister helped me a lot.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And because I was an engineer, you do a lot of maths.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I knew the Greek alphabet from alpha to omega because it&#039;s all in substitution, isn&#039;t it, maths?</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> X, Y, Z, and alpha to omega.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d done that in school, so the grammar of New Testament Greek and Latin are very, very similar.</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t too hard to pick up, it&#039;s just the vocabulary and all the verbs and nouns.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I passed it somehow, but then I also had to do Hebrew at college, and that really was a struggle.</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You spend hours getting very little away.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And for the first year I sort of floundered because to move from a scientific engineering background</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> into a theological, philosophical, language-orientated and all that was really strange.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it took me a year to begin to fit things together, as well as a lot of Bible studies.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And history, I hadn&#039;t done history. I failed my history exam the first year</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> because I thought, history, we&#039;ll just read it and it&#039;ll all come back to you. No, it doesn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So my first summer holidays I had to work hard.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Meantime, my parents had moved up to Scotland, so I had no base in Liverpool.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And my Alfea parents took me in as a lodger.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I lived with my fiancé for two years in those days.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Very risky, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:19:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And while you were at college, you weren&#039;t permitted to get married, you see.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the rule at the time.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But by two years later, the General Assembly, the Presbyterian Church, changed the rules.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You get married while you&#039;re in study with the permission of your minister,</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> the principal of the college and the moderator of the General Assembly.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course you can, yes.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> The principal said, yes, Alan McLeod is a lovely Liverpool man.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And the moderator came to see me and interview me quite so seriously.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Do I really understand what you&#039;re doing?</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was 26 by this time.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So we got married in 1965 now.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I finished the course at Cambridge in 1966.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So, meantime, back in Newport, all these wonderful young people,</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t all plain sailing because, you know, there were group dynamics.</div><div id="00:20:36.000" class="transcript_line"> How many were on it? About 15, 20?</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Something like that. I&#039;ve got a list of them.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, something like that.</div><div id="00:20:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, jelling that together of all different backgrounds and cultures was quite something.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, hats off when you look back to Cyril and Dorothy for helping it happen the way it did.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And what I&#039;ll never, you know, the poor things had to be scraping the mortar off bricks, cleaning bricks.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That was our major job.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So dirty and hard.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was almost soul-destroying.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the weather for that month was quite good somehow looking back.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Not too bad. There were some lovely mornings.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But my sort of wonderful memory, which never left me and influenced my thinking,</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> that on the very last morning, Cyril arranged for a sharing of communion outside in the open air,</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> in the round, with all these young people.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all took part, as far as I can remember, the Roman Catholics and even this Israeli girl who was, you know,</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Hebrew, all took part in the sharing the bread and the wine.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, that image has never left me that this is how the church and the world should be,</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> sharing together in harmony and peace and in love for one another.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you can do it here, why can&#039;t they do it elsewhere?</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve always been so sort of disappointed in the way people look back at this is our tradition,</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and we can&#039;t possibly change this, do that.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And oh, so far from how I see what Jesus wanted things to be.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But that for me was an insight which has never left me all my life in church life, the ecumenical scene.</div></div></p>
