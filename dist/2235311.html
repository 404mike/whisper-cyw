    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is Fiona Liddell, one of the volunteers with Friends of Cardiff Reservoirs and I&#039;m</div><div id="00:00:05.880" class="transcript_line"> talking to Annie Smith and we are at the Lisvane and Stanisian Reservoirs. So Annie, thank</div><div id="00:00:12.800" class="transcript_line"> you for agreeing to take part in this project.</div><div id="00:00:15.760" class="transcript_line"> My pleasure.</div><div id="00:00:16.760" class="transcript_line"> So can you tell me when you were employed with Welsh Water, perhaps go back to 2020,</div><div id="00:00:25.920" class="transcript_line"> what was your role?</div><div id="00:00:29.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Annie Smith and my role with Lisvane and Stanisian was when I first started working</div><div id="00:00:35.320" class="transcript_line"> for Welsh Water as the Enroll Partnership Manager, which is the Enabling Natural Resources</div><div id="00:00:42.640" class="transcript_line"> and Wellbeing Partnership Manager. I saw the job advertised, which had an element of all</div><div id="00:00:53.200" class="transcript_line"> of the ecological side of protecting the site and also engaging with the community and</div><div id="00:00:59.320" class="transcript_line"> working with the community. It was quite a unique job description that you don&#039;t really</div><div id="00:01:05.400" class="transcript_line"> see come up every day and it caught my eye. I remember showing it to one of the lecturers</div><div id="00:01:10.920" class="transcript_line"> at the university and saying, what do you think about this job description? And he said,</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s written for somebody, nobody&#039;s got all of that. And I said, well, I have. I have,</div><div id="00:01:21.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got all the community side of things and the communication side of things, but</div><div id="00:01:25.680" class="transcript_line"> also background in environmental law management. So we won&#039;t apply for them. But don&#039;t be</div><div id="00:01:31.920" class="transcript_line"> surprised if it&#039;s written for somebody. Anyway, so I went for a job interview in August or</div><div id="00:01:40.560" class="transcript_line"> September in 2019. I was interviewed by Richard Cowie, who was chair of the Reservoir Action</div><div id="00:01:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Group, Nicola from Cardiff Council and Vicki Martin, who was the Head of Visitor Attractions</div><div id="00:01:54.880" class="transcript_line"> at Rush Water. And anyway, I got the job. And that&#039;s how I came to work for Rush Water</div><div id="00:02:04.160" class="transcript_line"> on a two-year contract to deliver the NREL grant, which is Rush Government Funded Grant,</div><div id="00:02:11.600" class="transcript_line"> to do what it says on the tin, enable natural resources and help you. You don&#039;t have to</div><div id="00:02:17.880" class="transcript_line"> prompt me now. What was the question?</div><div id="00:02:22.640" class="transcript_line"> If your role was an engagement officer, what did that mean? Who did you engage with and</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> for what purpose?</div><div id="00:02:31.600" class="transcript_line"> So Rush Water took over the site in 2016 after the campaign to save it had come to fruition.</div><div id="00:02:43.320" class="transcript_line"> And they were very keen to make sure that they kept the community involved in that journey</div><div id="00:02:49.880" class="transcript_line"> and any future plans that were taking place. So the intention was, it was proposed by the</div><div id="00:02:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Reservoir Action Group to set up a Friends of Group, the community wanted to set up Friends</div><div id="00:03:01.720" class="transcript_line"> of Group. And through the NREL grant, there was an opportunity to take that element of</div><div id="00:03:09.640" class="transcript_line"> the community engagement forward really. And it was a really good vehicle to kind of get</div><div id="00:03:15.760" class="transcript_line"> the community engaged with the future plans of the site and what we&#039;re going to do with</div><div id="00:03:20.160" class="transcript_line"> the future plans of the site.</div><div id="00:03:23.760" class="transcript_line"> So my role as partnership manager was to work with the community, work with both our Action</div><div id="00:03:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Group, work with the cloud of council, help set up the systems for a Friends of Group</div><div id="00:03:33.680" class="transcript_line"> and put into place certain elements that would enable the public to be able to come back</div><div id="00:03:44.400" class="transcript_line"> on site whilst protecting the ecology. So it&#039;s kind of that balancing act of getting that</div><div id="00:03:50.840" class="transcript_line"> message out to the community that we do want to open it up to the community, we do want</div><div id="00:03:57.280" class="transcript_line"> to open it up to the public, but we will only be able to do so if we do it in a way that</div><div id="00:04:01.920" class="transcript_line"> also protects the environment. Working with our regulators, Natural Resources Wales, working</div><div id="00:04:09.440" class="transcript_line"> colleagues such as Dam Safety to make sure that everything we were doing was safe and</div><div id="00:04:17.720" class="transcript_line"> in line with policies and regulations, while also being able to let the community have</div><div id="00:04:26.120" class="transcript_line"> an input and how they want to be able to use this site and save the site for future generations.</div><div id="00:04:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us what was Welsh Water&#039;s vision really for the way this place looks and feels</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and is used?</div><div id="00:04:43.920" class="transcript_line"> So Welsh Water already had existing visitor attraction sites. They had four open. They</div><div id="00:04:51.560" class="transcript_line"> got Llandegfair, Llysfron, went up in North Wales, Brenneg and went right in the middle</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> of Wyadah, Ellan Valley. So I think they already had sort of like an idea in their head that</div><div id="00:05:04.480" class="transcript_line"> they would like to develop this into a visitor attraction site. That helps enable people</div><div id="00:05:11.480" class="transcript_line"> to access the water for safer recreation use as well because obviously reservoirs are</div><div id="00:05:18.080" class="transcript_line"> quite dangerous if they&#039;re not in that safe environment. But they also needed to do it</div><div id="00:05:25.480" class="transcript_line"> in a way that engaged the local community. So I think out of all of the different sites,</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> this was the trickiest one because it&#039;s the only one that is in the middle of a city.</div><div id="00:05:39.160" class="transcript_line"> The immediate population surrounding it is about 30,000 people, whereas all of our other</div><div id="00:05:45.240" class="transcript_line"> sites people have to drive to that in quite rural locations. So I think it was constantly</div><div id="00:05:50.680" class="transcript_line"> that sort of like balancing act, but they knew that vision of bringing people in touch</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> with the outdoors, the water, the green infrastructure. That was always one of their main visions.</div><div id="00:06:06.600" class="transcript_line"> And the overall vision of the visitor attraction sites is to support the wellbeing.</div><div id="00:06:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. So can you describe for us what was the work that was undertaken in order</div><div id="00:06:20.640" class="transcript_line"> to develop what we see here today? So to create the Friends of group, Washed Water</div><div id="00:06:28.560" class="transcript_line"> hadn&#039;t done that before. So as you can imagine, Washed Water undertake lots of capital infrastructure</div><div id="00:06:35.560" class="transcript_line"> projects, a lot of it quite dangerous. We use a lot of contractors. So to use volunteers</div><div id="00:06:44.400" class="transcript_line"> on our lands delivering projects was a new concept to them. So that was one of my first</div><div id="00:06:50.760" class="transcript_line"> kind of, I suppose, tasks really to have a look at how we can make that happen, how we</div><div id="00:06:57.680" class="transcript_line"> can understand, how we can work with community as volunteers on our land and to take in some</div><div id="00:07:03.240" class="transcript_line"> of our projects. So in the background, I had to put together policies to make that happen,</div><div id="00:07:12.400" class="transcript_line"> work with Reservoir Action Group to understand how they wanted Friends of group formed. Reservoir</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Action Group, rightly so, had a campaign, it was a campaign group, it was to save the</div><div id="00:07:24.560" class="transcript_line"> reservoir, whereas the Friends of group was to work in partnership with Washed Water.</div><div id="00:07:29.400" class="transcript_line"> So we took that bill to work in partnership element of it. They wanted to be independent</div><div id="00:07:37.200" class="transcript_line"> of Washed Water, but to work with us. And that&#039;s kind of as the basis of forming the</div><div id="00:07:43.840" class="transcript_line"> policy, working with directors of health and safety, legal, just to make that happen. So</div><div id="00:07:53.400" class="transcript_line"> it was really the trigger of how Washed Water did that. And now the volunteering manager</div><div id="00:08:01.280" class="transcript_line"> has got that system set up across our sites across the whole of Wales. So it really was</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> not just what helped happen here on this site, but what&#039;s happening across Wales.</div><div id="00:08:12.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was one element. Once we got that set up, we were able then to actually do some</div><div id="00:08:18.200" class="transcript_line"> volunteering work in between a pandemic, which was a bit tricky. It was a bit stop and start.</div><div id="00:08:26.640" class="transcript_line"> But once we were able to get people out on the site, get people into woodlands, get people</div><div id="00:08:31.240" class="transcript_line"> on site, that was brilliant. The NREL grant also helped fund the pathways that we see,</div><div id="00:08:40.680" class="transcript_line"> which means that people were able to walk around the site, which is protected as a SSSI</div><div id="00:08:46.360" class="transcript_line"> for the grass and fungi. So again, adding to that wellbeing element. They also funded</div><div id="00:08:52.520" class="transcript_line"> things like the bird hides, a few activities, some equipment for the Friends of group. And</div><div id="00:09:00.200" class="transcript_line"> also one thing that was kind of a bit of a spur of the moment, but worked out really well is</div><div id="00:09:06.440" class="transcript_line"> creating the dry stone walls as well. I really enjoyed doing that project. The pilot one was</div><div id="00:09:15.240" class="transcript_line"> just the Dry Stone Wall Association, myself and the late chair of the Friends of group,</div><div id="00:09:23.400" class="transcript_line"> who came out on a very miserable December day and built the stone wall. But the idea of that,</div><div id="00:09:30.840" class="transcript_line"> it was utilising all of the stonework that had been left over from the restoration of the reservoir</div><div id="00:09:38.200" class="transcript_line"> and create something for nature. So it should hopefully outlast all of us. So that was quite</div><div id="00:09:46.520" class="transcript_line"> good. During the project, I realised there&#039;s potential in the woodlands as well.</div><div id="00:09:53.080" class="transcript_line"> That was something that I think the focus had been on the visitor attraction building, the site,</div><div id="00:09:59.800" class="transcript_line"> surrounding reservoirs and land, but also attached to the site are some ancient woodlands</div><div id="00:10:07.240" class="transcript_line"> and some recreation woodlands. And fortunately, at the time that the First Minister wanted to</div><div id="00:10:14.760" class="transcript_line"> create a national woodland, a forest for whales. And we were successful in getting one of the first</div><div id="00:10:22.760" class="transcript_line"> grants. And again, working with the Friends of group, we created nature trails, story trails.</div><div id="00:10:30.040" class="transcript_line"> We took out invasive species, we reclaimed ponds and all of that delivered all of that, really.</div><div id="00:10:37.880" class="transcript_line"> So what does it mean to you to see the place as it is today?</div><div id="00:10:46.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m proud. I&#039;m proud that when you speak to people and people say,</div><div id="00:10:50.600" class="transcript_line"> did you work on that reservoir? And I was like, yeah, I&#039;ve been there. It&#039;s amazing. It&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:10:55.080" class="transcript_line"> The staff are great. It makes you feel like you&#039;ve been a small part of a really big piece of history.</div><div id="00:11:04.280" class="transcript_line"> I think at the time, it felt a little bit like, oh my God, are we ever going to achieve this,</div><div id="00:11:13.400" class="transcript_line"> especially with COVID and the amount of work that needed to be done and how eager the community was</div><div id="00:11:21.240" class="transcript_line"> to get on site. And actually, the expectations of the community as well. It&#039;s a really important</div><div id="00:11:26.680" class="transcript_line"> site for people. I first knew about the site when probably when they drained the reservoir</div><div id="00:11:32.680" class="transcript_line"> and around that time, the campaign time, my husband and my in-laws live around the area. My</div><div id="00:11:38.600" class="transcript_line"> father-in-law has got an allotment next door. And I remember the expletives coming out of my husband&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:45.080" class="transcript_line"> mouse when the reservoir was drained, driving around the area, and I remember the people who</div><div id="00:11:52.280" class="transcript_line"> worked around the area. I knew about the site, but I grew up in Penaath, so it wasn&#039;t something that</div><div id="00:12:01.880" class="transcript_line"> formed part of my childhood or growing up in Cardiff. I&#039;ve had people who have worked around</div><div id="00:12:10.120" class="transcript_line"> the area, worked at Cardiff Met on Kingcoy campus and came to me, so where are these reservoirs?</div><div id="00:12:16.920" class="transcript_line"> Where are they? And I say, you&#039;ve probably driven past them most days of your working life. You</div><div id="00:12:23.720" class="transcript_line"> just don&#039;t see them. But I remember the first time coming onto the site, and it&#039;s so hidden,</div><div id="00:12:30.200" class="transcript_line"> it doesn&#039;t feel like you&#039;re in the middle of Cardiff. And I had that site to myself, which was</div><div id="00:12:35.160" class="transcript_line"> amazing. But it&#039;s really nice now that that&#039;s being able to be shared by lots of other people.</div><div id="00:12:42.520" class="transcript_line"> And hopefully, even though my kids roll their eyes and get bored of it, that maybe one day</div><div id="00:12:49.960" class="transcript_line"> when they&#039;re older, they&#039;ll be able to bring their kids here and say,</div><div id="00:12:53.800" class="transcript_line"> your grandmother did a bit of this. So yeah, be nice. It&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:12:58.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:59.400" class="transcript_line"> Ami, thank you very much for sharing your stories with us.</div></div></p>
