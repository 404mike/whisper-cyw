    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So, what should we talk about now? Because you were involved with the Burial Society.</div><div id="00:00:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my parents traditionally were, well, found members of it.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Going back many years ago and I think I just followed in their footsteps.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. The burials in Swansea were not just Swansea?</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No, they were from Nethley, Port Talbot, Neath, the valleys, West Brailums.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Swansea Cemetery was the only cemetery in this area.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So the members of your synagogue, as a member, they would have certain rights regarding burial?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Included in the, and there used to be a collector who would collect, go around the houses collecting,</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, whether it was six months a week or whatever.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> That would include, I&#039;d say, burial rights, the plot, in actual fact, the plot.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. And then was there some kind of financial arrangement with Nethley, any other places as well then, or was it done on an individual basis?</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t really say I wasn&#039;t that involved in that side of the municipal, the city.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you still get people who were ex-Nethley or Port Talbot wanting to come and be buried in Swansea now?</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, no.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> About two weeks ago, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but that wasn&#039;t Nethley.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was not far from Nethley.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Tumble, Upper Tumble.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> These are people that are not known to you that suddenly their family says...</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there&#039;s no one left in Nethley now.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The last one died. When did Charlie die?</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s got to be ten years, if not...</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> All my family had left Nethley.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But you do get people that are Jewish living in the valleys. They don&#039;t really want to be associated with the synagogues.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But when they die, they want to have a Jewish funeral.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We oblige as long as they can prove, or the family can prove, that they are in fact Jewish.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it took a while for us to realize that the Jewish funeral is a lot cheaper than the Christian, even non-denominational.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they make inquiries probably through Cardiff, and then they find out this one in Swansea. Ours is a lot cheaper.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That must be quite a delicate matter to deal with.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you have responsibilities, but at the same time, you have to look at it. You need income and everything else as well, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well, you know, we have to keep the cemeteries in good order.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I must admit, if you can say, it&#039;s a pleasure to look at. Maybe it would be the wrong wording, but the new cemetery really is very, very beautiful.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So there are two cemeteries in?</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Two cemeteries.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Both within your species of the same synagogue?</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. One going back to 1700-odd, and the other one, I think, that was... And that opened up by the time we were married.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. No. It lasted a long time after we got married.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So it would have been in the 60s?</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I would say later than that.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> For 70s?</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in fact, 70s, because your father is buried in the old cemetery.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I would even say it might have been the early 80s. My mother&#039;s buried up there, but she&#039;s not in the front row by any means. She&#039;s about three or four rows back, isn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she died in 1981. So I&#039;d say in the 70s it opened.</div></div></p>
