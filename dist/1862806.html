    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Welcome to Mouth Off, a podcast brought to you by Forget Me Not Productions.</div><div id="00:00:05.600" class="transcript_line"> My name is Clary Sadler and on today&#039;s episode I&#039;m going to be talking about the iPlusMatter project,</div><div id="00:00:13.520" class="transcript_line"> which is a heritage lottery funded project conceived by T. Gwynn Special School in Cardiff</div><div id="00:00:20.640" class="transcript_line"> and inclusive arts organisation Forget Me Not Productions.</div><div id="00:00:24.880" class="transcript_line"> iPlusMatter provided multiple opportunities for meaningful assistive technology experiences.</div><div id="00:00:33.040" class="transcript_line"> These were interwoven with the arts and music was used as a motivator to enable individuals</div><div id="00:00:40.080" class="transcript_line"> with the most complex physical and cognitive disabilities to share their own history and</div><div id="00:00:47.280" class="transcript_line"> celebrate their independent achievements. The project was launched in February 2020 and was</div><div id="00:00:54.080" class="transcript_line"> due to conclude in July of that year. We were going to have a training event called iPlusMatter</div><div id="00:01:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Festival and it was going to involve professionals in the field of special education and social and</div><div id="00:01:07.920" class="transcript_line"> health sectors. It was also going to be a celebration of the achievements of all involved.</div><div id="00:01:14.640" class="transcript_line"> The participants would use a range of assistive technology such as eye gaze, switches and touch</div><div id="00:01:21.680" class="transcript_line"> monitors in order to help them achieve and independently take part in music and arts sessions.</div><div id="00:01:30.880" class="transcript_line"> Due to Covid-19 the project was postponed and we had to adapt the sharing event and the training</div><div id="00:01:37.440" class="transcript_line"> event to fit a virtual platform. Pupils at five local special schools, adults from a local day</div><div id="00:01:44.240" class="transcript_line"> centre and three individuals all with complex needs took part in assistive technology and</div><div id="00:01:50.880" class="transcript_line"> inclusive art sessions called MusicCan. MusicCan is a protocol developed by ForgetMeNot production</div><div id="00:01:58.480" class="transcript_line"> and it uses music primarily as a motivator to engage individuals with the most complex needs</div><div id="00:02:05.760" class="transcript_line"> in assistive technology. T Gwynn School with the project lead and other partners included</div><div id="00:02:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Miceblu Special School, Trinity Fields Special School, Park Lane Special School, Gadliss Day</div><div id="00:02:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Centre and three private clients that had all worked with ForgetMeNot productions in the past.</div><div id="00:02:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Most of the face-to-face MusicCan sessions had resumed by the end of 2021 but sadly due to ongoing</div><div id="00:02:33.520" class="transcript_line"> Covid-19 restrictions Trinity Fields Special School had to pull out. Luckily a Skolhenvelen</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Special School stepped in and had the remaining sessions enabling us to wrap up the project.</div><div id="00:02:46.480" class="transcript_line"> So what exactly do we mean by assistive technology? Well for the purpose of this project we&#039;re using</div><div id="00:02:53.520" class="transcript_line"> the term assistive technology to include any specialist technology that enables access to a</div><div id="00:02:59.920" class="transcript_line"> computer. So things such as switches, touch monitors, eye gaze which is a computer that is</div><div id="00:03:07.680" class="transcript_line"> operated by eye movements and these are linked to specialist software for teaching cause and effect,</div><div id="00:03:14.480" class="transcript_line"> choice making and beyond, augmentative and alternative communication or AAC, specialist</div><div id="00:03:21.120" class="transcript_line"> controls for wheelchair driving and access to toys and play. So when eye gaze first became</div><div id="00:03:28.080" class="transcript_line"> commercially available it was really mostly suited for people who were already at a level of using</div><div id="00:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> AAC and perhaps using AAC with switches, switches being very effective but slow, slow and laborious.</div><div id="00:03:45.280" class="transcript_line"> Another focus of iPLASmata has been to provide staff members with the opportunities to be trained</div><div id="00:03:51.280" class="transcript_line"> in the implementation of assistive technology systems for those with the most complex disabilities.</div><div id="00:03:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Why do you think projects such as this iPLASmata funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund are so important</div><div id="00:04:04.720" class="transcript_line"> for the individuals that have been taking part from your school? Well it&#039;s the assistive technology</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> like we did have eye gaze and hearing machines here but they were and they&#039;ve become older,</div><div id="00:04:15.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve been broken and they&#039;re obsolete. So it&#039;s only now that we&#039;ve started to use the eye gaze</div><div id="00:04:20.320" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;ve already started your project at Brotson and we&#039;re using one pair of the second eye gaze in.</div><div id="00:04:27.520" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re trying to re-establish those and also we want to start training the staff</div><div id="00:04:32.560" class="transcript_line"> and really to see what opportunities we can use with the eye gaze. It&#039;s wonderful with your project</div><div id="00:04:39.600" class="transcript_line"> because you can see how well the children have responded to it and how much you really need that</div><div id="00:04:44.320" class="transcript_line"> in our school. What have been the main benefits that you&#039;ve seen from the individuals that have</div><div id="00:04:49.280" class="transcript_line"> taken part in the project? So to see how much they&#039;ve progressed in the two weeks has been amazing,</div><div id="00:04:54.720" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s fantastic. When they get to experience technology and staff get to see what they&#039;re</div><div id="00:05:00.400" class="transcript_line"> capable of by using that technology which gives us input as they&#039;re to move forward with purchasing</div><div id="00:05:06.720" class="transcript_line"> of our skills and developing those skills and pupils get to be able to be part of a project,</div><div id="00:05:13.360" class="transcript_line"> parents can share and see that project and see what the children are working on and I know the</div><div id="00:05:18.480" class="transcript_line"> way that our pupils have responded, they&#039;ve been focused and they&#039;ve really enjoyed it and I think</div><div id="00:05:23.920" class="transcript_line"> music is such a wonderful access around pupils anyway. So it&#039;s just a wonderful way for them to</div><div id="00:05:30.800" class="transcript_line"> be focused and to be able to get into that niche and they are there. What are the main barriers</div><div id="00:05:38.080" class="transcript_line"> for these individuals achieving independently within a school or daycare setting? The challenges</div><div id="00:05:45.120" class="transcript_line"> they need more like consistency constantly and you need more technology things to come in for</div><div id="00:05:52.240" class="transcript_line"> the children to help them progress higher than they already are. One of the main aims of the</div><div id="00:05:58.960" class="transcript_line"> project has been to empower individuals identified as experiencing profound and multiple learning</div><div id="00:06:05.440" class="transcript_line"> disabilities or individuals that have complex physical disabilities. These individuals use</div><div id="00:06:13.200" class="transcript_line"> assistive technology to experience independent achievement and throughout the project we use the</div><div id="00:06:18.960" class="transcript_line"> MusicCan framework to motivate engagement with this technology changing and shifting the focus</div><div id="00:06:26.480" class="transcript_line"> from disability to ability. When I started making music with Forget Me Not productions it changed</div><div id="00:06:34.560" class="transcript_line"> my life. Music transformed me. We hope to raise awareness also of the historical development of</div><div id="00:06:41.600" class="transcript_line"> assistive technologies and the potential impact for independent learning via new technologies</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and new techniques. We speak to Mel Sadler about the history of assistive technology.</div><div id="00:06:54.320" class="transcript_line"> But of course by far the biggest development for assistive technology particularly for those</div><div id="00:07:00.640" class="transcript_line"> individuals with the greatest cognitive impairments has been the development of eye gaze.</div><div id="00:07:07.120" class="transcript_line"> So eye gaze worked really well for that group of people straight away but it took some time for</div><div id="00:07:12.880" class="transcript_line"> eye gaze to be suited for software to come out and be made available for people with more</div><div id="00:07:18.720" class="transcript_line"> significant intellectual impairments as well as their physical disability. But once software such</div><div id="00:07:25.120" class="transcript_line"> as Look2Learn and Sensory Eye Effects and some you know some of the inclusive technology</div><div id="00:07:30.640" class="transcript_line"> softwares became available for eye gaze users it&#039;s really opened up a whole new world for that group</div><div id="00:07:37.520" class="transcript_line"> of learners which is just just amazing and you see people making choices using eye gaze</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> who I would have considered it being very difficult to teach them to make choices using</div><div id="00:07:51.040" class="transcript_line"> switches because using switches to make choices is a much higher cognitive load if that makes sense.</div><div id="00:07:57.920" class="transcript_line"> Yet they can do it with eye gaze. We also talk to assistive technology guru</div><div id="00:08:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Carol Thornett. Dr. Carol Thornett has been involved in the field of assistive technology</div><div id="00:08:12.320" class="transcript_line"> since 1986. She was a pioneer in exploring the use of assistive technology with individuals</div><div id="00:08:18.720" class="transcript_line"> experiencing profound and multiple learning disabilities. In fact it was Carol that developed</div><div id="00:08:24.160" class="transcript_line"> the Thirst Mobility Platform which was originally part of the Spastic Society Research Project</div><div id="00:08:29.920" class="transcript_line"> and had the aim of enabling children with cerebral palsy to explore mobility when their peers were</div><div id="00:08:36.240" class="transcript_line"> able to. With the mobility we&#039;re trying to get children mobile at the same age that their peers</div><div id="00:08:41.840" class="transcript_line"> would be mobile since they&#039;ve extrapolated those with learning difficulties and physical difficulty</div><div id="00:08:49.040" class="transcript_line"> obviously as well. But initially it was just a physical disability. That proved to be really</div><div id="00:08:56.080" class="transcript_line"> exciting and I think it&#039;s quite sad now that I&#039;ve seen so few with independent mobility.</div><div id="00:09:02.880" class="transcript_line"> They should be in their usual seating because that was always such a problem if they went to</div><div id="00:09:10.400" class="transcript_line"> a wheelchair service in that what seating would they use. So this was you know that&#039;s the reason</div><div id="00:09:18.160" class="transcript_line"> why it was a platform that you could attach the whole seating system so that you started by looking</div><div id="00:09:25.120" class="transcript_line"> at whether they could control it and what they would do and did they stop and stop as important</div><div id="00:09:32.720" class="transcript_line"> The historic Cragher Park School has also been our heritage partner throughout the I plus Matter</div><div id="00:09:38.560" class="transcript_line"> sessions. Cragher Park House is a country house in Pentirk, Cardiff. It was built in 1914 for a</div><div id="00:09:45.360" class="transcript_line"> colliery owner named Thomas Evans. Evans died in 1943 and Cragher Park then came into the possession</div><div id="00:09:53.200" class="transcript_line"> of the National Coal Board before being sold in 1954 to the Spastic Society. They opened a residential</div><div id="00:10:00.560" class="transcript_line"> school site in 1955 and the house still operates as a residential care facility today. It is also a</div><div id="00:10:08.080" class="transcript_line"> special school for young adults with learning disabilities which is operated by Salutum Healthcare.</div><div id="00:10:14.720" class="transcript_line"> The school I work in is catered for people with disabilities. Research the school you&#039;re going to</div><div id="00:10:21.360" class="transcript_line"> work in and the students you&#039;re going to work with and then it&#039;s just a case of getting to know your</div><div id="00:10:28.800" class="transcript_line"> colleagues and them getting to know you and that should make your job hopefully a lot easier.</div><div id="00:10:38.240" class="transcript_line"> That was one of the first things people used to look at and say. Last time probably a student</div><div id="00:10:49.040" class="transcript_line"> but that doesn&#039;t happen anymore because I&#039;m older and I grow beards and stuff like that so</div><div id="00:10:54.080" class="transcript_line"> that does not happen anymore. Well my powered wheelchair it can well the batteries last longer</div><div id="00:11:03.840" class="transcript_line"> which means I can stay out for longer I can socialize for longer and be in work for longer</div><div id="00:11:11.760" class="transcript_line"> and secondly my power chair then can also so as you can see the chair the chair I&#039;m sitting in</div><div id="00:11:21.600" class="transcript_line"> is actually rising which then also helps me in my job professionally when I&#039;m working with students</div><div id="00:11:29.520" class="transcript_line"> with standing frames who are in standing frame sorry and also helps me socially when there is</div><div id="00:11:37.520" class="transcript_line"> no seating available for other people I can then rise myself up to the level that the person is</div><div id="00:11:43.760" class="transcript_line"> standing to and then when I&#039;m when I&#039;m done you just go back down so it&#039;s basically far different</div><div id="00:11:52.080" class="transcript_line"> now to how it used to be there&#039;s no comparison because now I can turn lights on using my voice</div><div id="00:12:02.560" class="transcript_line"> whereas when I was younger I wasn&#039;t able well I wasn&#039;t able to read I wasn&#039;t able to really</div><div id="00:12:11.520" class="transcript_line"> reach the light switches due to them being on a different level. What would you say</div><div id="00:12:19.120" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re most proud of something you&#039;ve achieved maybe through your use of technology that&#039;s helped</div><div id="00:12:26.640" class="transcript_line"> you achieve that thing? It could be related to school or it could be games games</div><div id="00:12:34.720" class="transcript_line"> and remote control controls. So you&#039;re quite the expert when it comes to games and remote control.</div><div id="00:12:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes I need help trying out accessible instruments I need help accessing music tech and recording</div><div id="00:12:58.800" class="transcript_line"> studios. This is what we&#039;re doing through us really isn&#039;t it I guess remotely in the house</div><div id="00:13:04.400" class="transcript_line"> when I started making music with forget me not productions it changed my life music transformed</div><div id="00:13:11.200" class="transcript_line"> me I feel like I&#039;m finally using my brain properly join me next time when I interview</div><div id="00:13:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Yvonne Kanicki Yvonne is a programmer and curator specializing in black independent film</div></div></p>
