    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you Foo for agreeing to this interview, Denise. My name is Ewan and this is Bernard.</div><div id="00:00:08.800" class="transcript_line"> So when were you born? I was born on the 4th of January 1968. And Foo, what&#039;s that? In Exeter.</div><div id="00:00:20.320" class="transcript_line"> So I moved up here on my second birthday. So we moved into Goldfinch Coast on the 4th of January</div><div id="00:00:28.880" class="transcript_line"> 1970. And we moved up because my father was a mechanic working for somebody in Exeter,</div><div id="00:00:38.080" class="transcript_line"> but he had the opportunity to come up with his business partner at the time, Tony Rake Straw,</div><div id="00:00:45.040" class="transcript_line"> and they came up together to run the Palmeric Service Station. And Tony ran the petrol side</div><div id="00:00:53.920" class="transcript_line"> of it and the shop with his wife Margaret, and my dad ran the mechanic side of it.</div><div id="00:01:01.520" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what brought us up here on my birthday. I was two.</div><div id="00:01:07.280" class="transcript_line"> So obviously taking them into consideration that you were two,</div><div id="00:01:11.360" class="transcript_line"> what did you think of the area when you first arrived?</div><div id="00:01:15.840" class="transcript_line"> When I was little, I can&#039;t remember anything obviously from moving up, I can&#039;t remember when</div><div id="00:01:20.720" class="transcript_line"> I was two, but my very early days in this street, I remember playing out on that green</div><div id="00:01:28.800" class="transcript_line"> and with lots of children, lots of other children in the street.</div><div id="00:01:34.640" class="transcript_line"> So there are two greens in Goldfinch, there&#039;s one directly outside my house and there&#039;s one</div><div id="00:01:39.040" class="transcript_line"> a little bit further up. And the children from further up the road used to play on that green</div><div id="00:01:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and we used to play on this green. Occasionally we would get together. But my earliest memories</div><div id="00:01:50.160" class="transcript_line"> are of playing hide and seek and games like that and skipping and two balls and various things</div><div id="00:02:00.880" class="transcript_line"> like that out in the green and my mum calling me in because it was tea time and time to come in.</div><div id="00:02:09.520" class="transcript_line"> So obviously it&#039;s very different from Exeter.</div><div id="00:02:15.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to go down to Exeter a few times a year because all of my family were down there.</div><div id="00:02:22.960" class="transcript_line"> So my my gran, my auntie&#039;s, uncle&#039;s, cousins, everybody was down in Exeter and it was only</div><div id="00:02:31.120" class="transcript_line"> my close family that were up here. So I don&#039;t remember Exeter obviously from when I lived there</div><div id="00:02:39.120" class="transcript_line"> but I do remember those visits down to my gran and to visit my cousins and that.</div><div id="00:02:48.080" class="transcript_line"> Exeter is just a very busy city with lots of cars, lots of people but my memories of Exeter</div><div id="00:02:58.800" class="transcript_line"> really are going down to visit my family as opposed to the place.</div><div id="00:03:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me about your parents? You said that your dad was a mechanic.</div><div id="00:03:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my dad was a mechanic. My gran used to say that my dad was extremely bright and intelligent</div><div id="00:03:23.760" class="transcript_line"> and was top of the score or top of his year but I think she wanted him to go on to</div><div id="00:03:32.080" class="transcript_line"> do something other than being a mechanic but that was really what he wanted to do.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So my dad was a mechanic. My mum did work in a printing factory before she had all of us</div><div id="00:03:46.720" class="transcript_line"> and but then she left work when I think when she got married and then she had all of us.</div><div id="00:03:55.120" class="transcript_line"> So my dad did go into the army for two years to do his nationals and my mum had already had my</div><div id="00:04:04.960" class="transcript_line"> eldest sister then, Janet and then I think after he came out she had Andrew and then Sandra and then me.</div><div id="00:04:13.920" class="transcript_line"> So four of you? Yeah, four of us. There was a fifth but it was still born before me I think.</div><div id="00:04:28.240" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned the petrol station in Pwll Merig. There isn&#039;t a petrol station</div><div id="00:04:35.120" class="transcript_line"> there now is there? There is. The petrol station in the shop is still there but the mechanics part</div><div id="00:04:42.320" class="transcript_line"> of it the garage is is not there. So that is that the petrol station just outside Pwll Merig?</div><div id="00:04:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah if you&#039;re coming from Caldecourt you&#039;ve got the shop on the left hand side the garden centre</div><div id="00:04:57.600" class="transcript_line"> and then it&#039;s first right the garage first right and I think now where the garage was</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> where my dad had the pit that is now where there&#039;s like a car cleaning thing to clean your car</div><div id="00:05:16.240" class="transcript_line"> and that was where my dad&#039;s garage was. Did he continue with that business throughout his career?</div><div id="00:05:23.920" class="transcript_line"> He did for a long time. The garage was a jet garage by the way at the time with the yellow</div><div id="00:05:31.040" class="transcript_line"> sign. He did for a while but then I remember my younger days we had it just seemed like no</div><div id="00:05:42.640" class="transcript_line"> money worries because I had birthday parties and my dad had a nice light blue</div><div id="00:05:50.400" class="transcript_line"> jag which I remember yeah I had leather seats and some sort of cassette thing wasn&#039;t like</div><div id="00:05:57.440" class="transcript_line"> cassettes as we know it it was like an older thing with like solid cassette thing and all it was</div><div id="00:06:03.520" class="transcript_line"> and he used to play music on it when he used to take us to school but I remember those</div><div id="00:06:09.680" class="transcript_line"> those days fondly we used to have birthday parties and lots of presents and things and then all I</div><div id="00:06:16.240" class="transcript_line"> remember was later on perhaps when I was maybe nine ten eleven something like that and the birthday</div><div id="00:06:25.680" class="transcript_line"> parties stopped because my dad&#039;s garage didn&#039;t wasn&#039;t doing as well I remember my mum and dad</div><div id="00:06:34.160" class="transcript_line"> saying it was because people were made redundant from lambworn steelworks and it affected my dad&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:40.720" class="transcript_line"> business so my dad was out of work for a little while but then he worked for Red and White in</div><div id="00:06:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Chester yeah and he started at the bottom and he worked his way up and he became union leader</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> union rep I think.</div><div id="00:07:05.120" class="transcript_line"> How did you spend your evenings when you were growing up?</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> My younger days very much out on the green playing with my friends and we used to do</div><div id="00:07:17.600" class="transcript_line"> like I said I hide and seek and skipping and tag quite a lot of tag</div><div id="00:07:26.960" class="transcript_line"> and I remember we used to make mud pies and I think we got quite dirty</div><div id="00:07:36.080" class="transcript_line"> and then in my teens I used to spend a lot of time with my friends I can&#039;t really remember until</div><div id="00:07:49.360" class="transcript_line"> about 15 16 or maybe a bit older 16 17 when we used to go to the pub and they used to play a lot</div><div id="00:07:57.920" class="transcript_line"> of pool in my late teens.</div><div id="00:08:02.960" class="transcript_line"> So did you go to school in Cardacol? Yes went to West End School first infant school</div><div id="00:08:09.360" class="transcript_line"> which is down the bottom of the road and my earliest memories were</div><div id="00:08:17.120" class="transcript_line"> when I was younger starting school and playing in a Wendy house with Susan Burroughs</div><div id="00:08:27.920" class="transcript_line"> who is a black girl with beautiful long long hair and she took me into the Wendy house because I</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> was apparently unconsolable my mum told me that she could hear me all the way up the street</div><div id="00:08:45.760" class="transcript_line"> she was walking away I didn&#039;t want to go to school so that was West End School the only thing really</div><div id="00:08:51.440" class="transcript_line"> I remember about it apart from that was Mrs Miranda&#039;s who is still living and living in</div><div id="00:08:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Rockets I believe and my dad used to drive us in the Jag a group of children from the street</div><div id="00:09:07.360" class="transcript_line"> and we had to shut our eyes and tell dad where we were between here and West End</div><div id="00:09:14.800" class="transcript_line"> which really wasn&#039;t very far and he used to play Valdunigan</div><div id="00:09:23.920" class="transcript_line"> on these big cassette tape things in the car I remember that and that&#039;s about as much as I</div><div id="00:09:29.600" class="transcript_line"> remember from West End Infants and then I went to Church Road School</div><div id="00:09:36.400" class="transcript_line"> and my mum used to give me a little few pence for the bus to come home but I never caught the</div><div id="00:09:44.640" class="transcript_line"> bus on the way home I walked and I spent the money on a Tempe mix-up sweets. So the two schools</div><div id="00:09:54.720" class="transcript_line"> particularly one is infants and one is juniors West End is infants and Church Road is juniors</div><div id="00:10:01.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s still the case today yes only they&#039;ve got different well West End is no longer because</div><div id="00:10:05.680" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s been knocked down recently the school there&#039;s houses there now and Church Road is now called</div><div id="00:10:11.200" class="transcript_line"> something else and the other thing I remember from Church Road is my mum used to come because I was</div><div id="00:10:23.920" class="transcript_line"> very very close to my mum so in West End she used to I think on the way perhaps to the shops or</div><div id="00:10:30.800" class="transcript_line"> something she used to walk up the lane which was adjacent to the fence by the playground</div><div id="00:10:41.040" class="transcript_line"> and she used to give me little kisses in between the fence in playtime or lunchtime</div><div id="00:10:50.240" class="transcript_line"> so used to do that quite regularly and in Church Road Junior School I remember her</div><div id="00:10:57.920" class="transcript_line"> coming to meet me on a Friday because I always wanted her to meet me every day but she wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:11:02.640" class="transcript_line"> so she used to come up and meet me on a Friday and we used to go down to the village and she</div><div id="00:11:07.840" class="transcript_line"> used to get me a magazine called Twinkle this is a little girl&#039;s magazine at that time</div><div id="00:11:14.800" class="transcript_line"> and she used to get me some sweets and but I remember when I was very little</div><div id="00:11:21.520" class="transcript_line"> walking through the village with my mum and she used to stop and say hello to people and they</div><div id="00:11:28.480" class="transcript_line"> used to talk about the weather and I just remember distinctly remember tugging on her hand thinking</div><div id="00:11:34.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s so boring when she stops and talks to people about the weather but she seemed to know everybody</div><div id="00:11:39.520" class="transcript_line"> in Caldecott which was very annoying because I didn&#039;t like her talking to other people</div><div id="00:11:47.600" class="transcript_line"> so that was that. So for the listener can you explain</div><div id="00:11:56.640" class="transcript_line"> what Caldecott is now you refer to as a village yeah so a change from being a village to a town?</div><div id="00:12:06.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different now yeah it&#039;s so very completely different</div><div id="00:12:13.120" class="transcript_line"> for example when I was in my teens and we used to go up the pub usually the Measure, the Cross,</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> the White Hart which is obviously no longer there which is very sad</div><div id="00:12:24.560" class="transcript_line"> those three pubs were the the centre of everybody&#039;s every teenage person&#039;s life in</div><div id="00:12:31.280" class="transcript_line"> in the 80s and 90s and we used to go up those pubs and we knew everybody</div><div id="00:12:41.600" class="transcript_line"> so you go in the pub and virtually everybody in the pub you would know</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and if you go up the Cross now and there&#039;s a band on you&#039;d see many people and you wouldn&#039;t know them</div><div id="00:12:54.480" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s a lot busier as well cars wise and people&#039;s wise houses the streets in Caldecott</div><div id="00:13:03.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t even know now. So those days when you would know everybody there so was that from school that</div><div id="00:13:11.920" class="transcript_line"> you knew them?</div><div id="00:13:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Probably from school yeah probably from school yes</div><div id="00:13:26.800" class="transcript_line"> yeah probably the majority of them from school or friends of friends from maybe your year above or</div><div id="00:13:35.360" class="transcript_line"> the year above that yeah yeah so on so and it has changed so can you say what has caused that change</div><div id="00:13:45.840" class="transcript_line"> do you think? I think probably more people moving into the area in Caldecott</div><div id="00:13:56.800" class="transcript_line"> maybe because living in Bristol the houses the rates and everything else that you&#039;ve got to pay</div><div id="00:14:05.600" class="transcript_line"> all the bills you&#039;ve got to pay in Bristol so expensive people are coming over the bridge now</div><div id="00:14:10.960" class="transcript_line"> and moving in this area I remember when when I was younger</div><div id="00:14:19.280" class="transcript_line"> younger there was lots of lots more land around Caldecott as well whereas now it almost feels</div><div id="00:14:28.880" class="transcript_line"> like Caldecott, Broggett, Undy, Maga is almost all one place with many many more housing estates</div><div id="00:14:39.200" class="transcript_line"> new housing estates going up and I remember a lot of the housing estates being built in Caldecott</div><div id="00:14:48.320" class="transcript_line"> and now they&#039;ve been there for a very long time but for me they&#039;re sort of still new but</div><div id="00:14:55.280" class="transcript_line"> there are there are many streets and housing developments in Caldecott now that I don&#039;t even know</div><div id="00:15:04.240" class="transcript_line"> but it was a much much smaller place much quieter place and I think one of the biggest differences</div><div id="00:15:10.880" class="transcript_line"> is the downside of it all is there&#039;s such a huge increase in crime in this area which is</div><div id="00:15:21.280" class="transcript_line"> really really sad because when I was growing up we weren&#039;t bothered about locking doors and</div><div id="00:15:28.960" class="transcript_line"> certainly not when you were in the house as well but even you could leave your door unlocked</div><div id="00:15:34.320" class="transcript_line"> go up the village come back and there would be no problem</div><div id="00:15:40.720" class="transcript_line"> but nowadays on you know the thing that we&#039;ve got nowadays is Facebook those Facebook pages that</div><div id="00:15:49.200" class="transcript_line"> that kind of I know Ali is is involved in it she she posts or shares the the posts from the police</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> locally about local crime and there&#039;s almost something happening every every</div><div id="00:16:05.120" class="transcript_line"> every day and that&#039;s such a shame because Caldecott&#039;s always been a wonderful place to live in</div><div id="00:16:14.400" class="transcript_line"> when did you leave school and what did you do after that? I left school when I was 17</div><div id="00:16:22.160" class="transcript_line"> I did my O levels and then I went to Nash College which is now Colleague Gwent</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and I did a one-year Secretarial course and then I left college and got a job</div><div id="00:16:41.760" class="transcript_line"> and worked as a secretary variations of until I was 22 and then I went to run a campsite in France</div><div id="00:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> and then for six months and then I went to the University of Northumbria in Newcastle</div><div id="00:17:01.440" class="transcript_line"> for four years to do a BA in modern languages and political science political studies</div><div id="00:17:11.600" class="transcript_line"> so</div><div id="00:17:18.240" class="transcript_line"> one thing I remember going back to Church Road is a few things I remember it the teachers</div><div id="00:17:25.200" class="transcript_line"> specifically and when I was kind of preparing my thoughts for this interview I remember getting</div><div id="00:17:33.200" class="transcript_line"> a really bad mark in my maths test it was mental maths and I was always fairly rubbish at mental</div><div id="00:17:40.240" class="transcript_line"> maths and I and I always used to get sort of two or three or four and there&#039;s one particular</div><div id="00:17:46.240" class="transcript_line"> occasion I got zero and I burst into tears my teacher was Mr Wiltshire and and he tried to</div><div id="00:17:54.160" class="transcript_line"> console me and he sat me on his knee and it was perfectly innocent even with my memory is is very</div><div id="00:18:00.400" class="transcript_line"> clear of the moment because it was not very nice getting zero so it was perfectly innocent and he</div><div id="00:18:05.200" class="transcript_line"> was only consoling me and he sat me on his knee and I remember that now I think that wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:18:14.080" class="transcript_line"> happen these days and that was I don&#039;t know whether that was first or second year of the</div><div id="00:18:19.680" class="transcript_line"> juniors something like that yeah and then we had a lovely teacher called Mr Kirkwood that was in</div><div id="00:18:24.960" class="transcript_line"> the fourth year and we had another teacher called Mrs I think her name was Mrs Casals</div><div id="00:18:33.520" class="transcript_line"> but we used to call her Mrs Casals all the other way around but I wrote a poem in her class and</div><div id="00:18:43.760" class="transcript_line"> I won a prize for it and I wrote it about one of my friends Caroline Harris and I won a prize for</div><div id="00:18:51.680" class="transcript_line"> it it was a limerick poem that we had to write and we used to have dens in the field that is still</div><div id="00:18:59.680" class="transcript_line"> there behind church road school we used to have dens a couple of dens in the trees and I walked</div><div id="00:19:08.320" class="transcript_line"> around there back along and those trees are still there which is quite nice</div><div id="00:19:15.280" class="transcript_line"> you said you did modern languages politics what else was it it was modern languages with political</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> studies so I studied french post a level yeah and spanish ab initio and political studies it was</div><div id="00:19:31.200" class="transcript_line"> comparative politics yeah and so when you finished that what did you do after you finished that I</div><div id="00:19:40.800" class="transcript_line"> graduated in 1995 yeah and I met my husband that final year he was my conversation assistant in</div><div id="00:19:51.120" class="transcript_line"> university in my fourth year and he had to do the military service in France because he&#039;s french</div><div id="00:19:59.280" class="transcript_line"> so in 1990 1995 96 we went to France while he did his military service I was a bilingual secretary</div><div id="00:20:13.280" class="transcript_line"> in Paris and then we came back because my dad was poorly and we got married quite quickly we got</div><div id="00:20:20.800" class="transcript_line"> married in September 96 and then my son was born in September 97 so we stayed here then and I worked</div><div id="00:20:36.560" class="transcript_line"> after my son was born I worked for a computer company in Chepstow part-time</div><div id="00:20:41.120" class="transcript_line"> as a sales coordinator and then decided to to completely change my career and go into sales</div><div id="00:20:49.920" class="transcript_line"> so since 1998 I&#039;ve been in sales field sales and my first job was working for</div><div id="00:21:00.560" class="transcript_line"> ADT foreign security in Bristol but covering Bostrakshire</div><div id="00:21:08.880" class="transcript_line"> and in the meantime you were you are now living in Caldeco yes so can you say more about</div><div id="00:21:17.440" class="transcript_line"> about Caldeco you have mentioned the changes that have taken place</div><div id="00:21:24.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s grown bigger and things have changed and you&#039;ve seen those changes taking place</div><div id="00:21:35.360" class="transcript_line"> and what date would you or is there a date when you could say well I can just see it changing</div><div id="00:21:41.520" class="transcript_line"> from that date onwards about you know within five years or something like that</div><div id="00:21:52.400" class="transcript_line"> gosh that&#039;s a difficult question to pinpoint an exact date or even an approximate date really</div><div id="00:21:59.520" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s been a gradual change I feel yeah for me I would say</div><div id="00:22:14.960" class="transcript_line"> probably when I was</div><div id="00:22:21.360" class="transcript_line"> probably 20s</div><div id="00:22:23.600" class="transcript_line"> hmm so I would say 25 years ago but that&#039;s off the top of my head without preparing for that</div><div id="00:22:32.880" class="transcript_line"> question yeah I would say 20 to 25 years ago but I wouldn&#039;t say that all the changes happened at</div><div id="00:22:46.960" class="transcript_line"> that precise time but I recall the kind of the changes</div><div id="00:22:56.240" class="transcript_line"> I think in my 20s my early 20s perhaps yeah okay and the if we look to the town as it is now</div><div id="00:23:07.200" class="transcript_line"> the shopping area</div><div id="00:23:09.360" class="transcript_line"> um uh the changes have taken place in the shopping area</div><div id="00:23:15.280" class="transcript_line"> probably more recently I would I think um can you say something about those changes that you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:23:21.680" class="transcript_line"> seen and what you think might have caused them I remember there used to be a supermarket in where</div><div id="00:23:32.960" class="transcript_line"> the charity shop is I think it&#039;s st. David&#039;s um there used to be a supermarket in there</div><div id="00:23:41.680" class="transcript_line"> and I used to go in that supermarket with my mum I think was it I think it might have been</div><div id="00:23:47.840" class="transcript_line"> international or maybe international was where</div><div id="00:23:52.960" class="transcript_line"> was where Waitrose is now I can&#039;t recall which which one international was but there wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:23:58.480" class="transcript_line"> a supermarket in Colby Cot called international after that there was Gateway that&#039;s definitely</div><div id="00:24:04.960" class="transcript_line"> where the um where Waitrose is now I remember we had a quick save which is where the clothes shop</div><div id="00:24:13.680" class="transcript_line"> is now um and I remember there used to be a toy shop upstairs in is it NSS or the Henderson&#039;s</div><div id="00:24:26.880" class="transcript_line"> um there used to be a toy shop opposite the um uh the shop next to chapel&#039;s chemist there&#039;s been</div><div id="00:24:36.160" class="transcript_line"> there and my mum used to take me to that toy shop and my uncle and auntie used to come up my uncle</div><div id="00:24:42.640" class="transcript_line"> used to buy me puzzles in that toy shop um and what else do I remember I the a strong memory I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:24:53.840" class="transcript_line"> got is Adams&#039;s because we used to my mum used to take me in there to buy me my school uniform</div><div id="00:25:01.280" class="transcript_line"> and I quite clearly remember the the desk where the lady was and my mum going in and she used to</div><div id="00:25:08.880" class="transcript_line"> sell all sorts and my mum used to get the wool from there because my mum was brilliant at knitting</div><div id="00:25:13.920" class="transcript_line"> I used to knit all my school cardigans when I was little and we used to go in there and she used to</div><div id="00:25:19.520" class="transcript_line"> buy the wool and when it came to August I suppose she used to go in there and buy me my school</div><div id="00:25:25.920" class="transcript_line"> uniform I remember Adams&#039;s quite clearly and and that&#039;s all changed totally yes I think Adams&#039;s is</div><div id="00:25:36.640" class="transcript_line"> is is now a funeral place yeah I think that&#039;s where it was um and of course we&#039;ve got the</div><div id="00:25:44.800" class="transcript_line"> pedestrian area we&#039;ve got Asda which which which on the one hand is good because we needed</div><div id="00:25:52.960" class="transcript_line"> a cheaper supermarket but on the other hand it&#039;s so sad that we had to give up that wonderful big</div><div id="00:25:58.320" class="transcript_line"> school field in order to have a supermarket in Coldicott um that&#039;s a real shame because we don&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:04.880" class="transcript_line"> have that many green areas and you think the supermarkets have affected the um the smaller</div><div id="00:26:11.760" class="transcript_line"> traders definitely definitely because there are so many shops now that are empty and again that is</div><div id="00:26:21.520" class="transcript_line"> a real shame as well I remember when we were when I was little my mum used to take me to the fruit</div><div id="00:26:28.640" class="transcript_line"> shop and we used to buy fruit shop from the fruit shop and we used to buy the meat from the butchers</div><div id="00:26:35.760" class="transcript_line"> and um now everybody buys most people buy things from either Waitrose or Asda</div><div id="00:26:45.600" class="transcript_line"> and obviously that&#039;s going to have a knock-on effect um and Washburns going as well um was</div><div id="00:26:53.840" class="transcript_line"> was significant for Coldicott for the listener could you just describe Washburns and Washburns</div><div id="00:26:59.120" class="transcript_line"> was a really really great shop um especially my dad liked it um because it sold um diy stuff and</div><div id="00:27:08.160" class="transcript_line"> paint and and various other useful things um and it&#039;s just somewhere you could go if you if you</div><div id="00:27:16.320" class="transcript_line"> were doing something in your house and needed screws or screwdrivers or paint or wood or</div><div id="00:27:21.280" class="transcript_line"> whatever you needed to to do in your house you could pop up to Washburns and you&#039;d be able to</div><div id="00:27:25.760" class="transcript_line"> get it in there and it was a local family as well and it was a real shame yeah that was kind of a</div><div id="00:27:32.960" class="transcript_line"> lot of local people who&#039;ve been here a long time I think found that to be a shame that Washburns</div><div id="00:27:39.200" class="transcript_line"> went so coming back to you you had a career in sales yeah um and so how has that progressed</div><div id="00:27:47.680" class="transcript_line"> where are you now with that I got to the peak of my career in April 2016 yeah and I&#039;d worked for</div><div id="00:27:56.080" class="transcript_line"> a company for five years and in that company I progressed um up to international sales um</div><div id="00:28:06.240" class="transcript_line"> where it was for a fire alarm company and I was selling fire alarm panels and detectors and</div><div id="00:28:13.760" class="transcript_line"> peripheral in peripheral things um and I and I was doing a lot of traveling because it was</div><div id="00:28:20.800" class="transcript_line"> international and um I was um looking after Africa Eastern Europe and the Baltics Spain Portugal</div><div id="00:28:33.440" class="transcript_line"> various various territories and um in September 2005</div><div id="00:28:49.440" class="transcript_line"> was it six um we lost we well one of my colleagues we were a small team of about five or six</div><div id="00:28:57.520" class="transcript_line"> salespeople and um one of one of our colleagues got very seriously ill very very quickly</div><div id="00:29:04.800" class="transcript_line"> so can I just stop you on the date again yeah I&#039;m trying to think yeah so but how long ago was it</div><div id="00:29:10.640" class="transcript_line"> um I left the company in April this year yes and he and our colleague died in February 2017 so he</div><div id="00:29:24.880" class="transcript_line"> was taken ill in the September 2016 yeah and it was and he was um just such a lovely lovely person</div><div id="00:29:34.080" class="transcript_line"> very very funny person very popular and he was uh in the gym he worked uh he lived away but</div><div id="00:29:41.920" class="transcript_line"> he used to come for uh the regular the monthly sales meetings and the the company was based in</div><div id="00:29:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Cumbrian so he used to come and stay over and he stayed in the hotel parkway next to our</div><div id="00:29:56.720" class="transcript_line"> office and he was on the treadmill not feeling very well a couple of days after um anyway he</div><div id="00:30:02.800" class="transcript_line"> was diagnosed with with um sarcoma and he went downhill very quickly and we lost him in February</div><div id="00:30:10.880" class="transcript_line"> um 2017 um and during his illness and particularly January February is when I decided that life&#039;s too</div><div id="00:30:24.640" class="transcript_line"> short to work 60 hours plus and I wanted a complete change in my life so I resigned gave him two months</div><div id="00:30:32.320" class="transcript_line"> notice and left um in April 2017 and what are you doing now um at the moment I&#039;m I&#039;ve taken a few</div><div id="00:30:42.080" class="transcript_line"> months out to train um so I&#039;m now training and that&#039;s swimming gym and yoga um and I&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:30:53.280" class="transcript_line"> swimming for um since 2004 um but I&#039;m now um swimming a lot more</div><div id="00:31:02.720" class="transcript_line"> five sessions a week and I go to the gym twice a week and I do yoga and strength exercises to</div><div id="00:31:09.600" class="transcript_line"> get stronger as I&#039;m getting older um and um also in September um 2017 I started a level p</div><div id="00:31:24.800" class="transcript_line"> um to learn more in detail and understand about the effect of exercise on our body and mind</div><div id="00:31:31.760" class="transcript_line"> um so I go to cross keys college three days a week it&#039;s part time and I&#039;m absolutely loving it</div><div id="00:31:41.040" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;m now going to be looking for a part-time job um to bring in some money locally um</div><div id="00:31:50.800" class="transcript_line"> to be able to pay for my training because my training is quite expensive</div><div id="00:31:54.960" class="transcript_line"> um and just coming back to Cardacot um you know you mentioned um about um</div><div id="00:32:05.520" class="transcript_line"> the Cardacot web pages um Cardacot community can you just go through for us</div><div id="00:32:12.160" class="transcript_line"> the number of um web pages or Facebook pages that there are and what they are please</div><div id="00:32:18.560" class="transcript_line"> there are lots and it&#039;s I think it&#039;s a great thing um this is this is a positive um way of</div><div id="00:32:25.760" class="transcript_line"> bringing people together and sharing information and helping each other and I think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:30.400" class="transcript_line"> fantastic there&#039;s the Cardacot community page which has I believe about 7 000 members um there&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:40.560" class="transcript_line"> the Cardacot memory lane society page um which is all about sharing um history and sharing</div><div id="00:32:49.600" class="transcript_line"> knowledge and information pictures um and memories um and again I think there&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:58.720" class="transcript_line"> five six thousand members something like that on that page and then we have other smaller pages</div><div id="00:33:05.760" class="transcript_line"> as well things like um things to do around Cardacot um uh recommendations page I think</div><div id="00:33:14.240" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a page which someone has started fairly recently with less members but um it&#039;s for the</div><div id="00:33:22.080" class="transcript_line"> people of Cardacot that the were the original original people of Cardacot although anyone</div><div id="00:33:28.240" class="transcript_line"> can join it and so there are several pages there are also pages where people want to buy or sell</div><div id="00:33:34.320" class="transcript_line"> things but the main ones are the Cardacot community page and the memory lane society page</div><div id="00:33:42.400" class="transcript_line"> and I think it&#039;s brilliant because um very often every day pretty much people will post something</div><div id="00:33:51.440" class="transcript_line"> on the community page and ask for advice or information or help with things or even just</div><div id="00:33:58.160" class="transcript_line"> to give each other um sort of advice if if somebody&#039;s been burgled for example there seems</div><div id="00:34:04.320" class="transcript_line"> to be a lot of that recently they would post it on there and say be careful lock your doors</div><div id="00:34:10.800" class="transcript_line"> or if somebody wants to buy something or find something or find out about something um then</div><div id="00:34:17.280" class="transcript_line"> then it&#039;s on there all of the pubs have pages as well which is fantastic because I&#039;ve noticed</div><div id="00:34:23.760" class="transcript_line"> lately particularly that the pubs are making more an effort to put bands on karaoke quizzes</div><div id="00:34:31.440" class="transcript_line"> that sort of thing and they advertise on those pages and people actually go to those pubs pages</div><div id="00:34:38.400" class="transcript_line"> to find out have you got a band on this weekend what is it when is it and and I think that the</div><div id="00:34:45.520" class="transcript_line"> measure the cross and</div><div id="00:34:52.880" class="transcript_line"> I think the measure and the cross and the seller are the three most active in doing that</div><div id="00:34:58.160" class="transcript_line"> and when you go to those pubs now on a Friday and Saturday it does seem to be a little bit busier</div><div id="00:35:04.080" class="transcript_line"> because we did have obviously this is very sad the White Heart</div><div id="00:35:08.240" class="transcript_line"> um uh got knocked down and uh several years ago now and also we lost the Tiplin philosopher the</div><div id="00:35:17.440" class="transcript_line"> tip fondly known as the tip um and that&#039;s now being made into residential homes um</div><div id="00:35:26.640" class="transcript_line"> and and we went through a stage where the pubs you go out in the pub on the Friday or Saturday</div><div id="00:35:30.880" class="transcript_line"> is absolutely dead so it is nice that these Facebook pages local Facebook pages are they seem</div><div id="00:35:39.280" class="transcript_line"> to certainly on a Friday and Saturday with in conjunction with the pubs making an effort to</div><div id="00:35:46.160" class="transcript_line"> bring in bands and that sort of thing and and sort of um offering free curry on rugby nights and that</div><div id="00:35:52.080" class="transcript_line"> sort of thing um I think it&#039;s it&#039;s starting to work and get people out again which is nice</div><div id="00:35:57.840" class="transcript_line"> and getting the community together again which is nice</div><div id="00:36:02.240" class="transcript_line"> so is there anything else you want to say to me about um or are you happy with</div><div id="00:36:07.280" class="transcript_line"> everything you&#039;ve said so far I think um from my probably my teenage years upwards I would say</div><div id="00:36:18.240" class="transcript_line"> that the biggest change for me personally is the bridge the new bridge we call it we still call it</div><div id="00:36:24.800" class="transcript_line"> the new bridge um because at the back of my house we have the railway both lines the the lower line</div><div id="00:36:33.760" class="transcript_line"> which is seven tunnel junction to um to Bristol Tampines and the upper line which is Caldecott</div><div id="00:36:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Swansea if you like through to um uh Chepstow and beyond um but I I remember when I lived in</div><div id="00:36:52.080" class="transcript_line"> this house with my mum and dad and they started building the the approach road for the second</div><div id="00:37:00.000" class="transcript_line"> seven crossing and um my my little boy was very little when that was built and I remember</div><div id="00:37:10.880" class="transcript_line"> as they were building it we went over my husband and I went over with my son and we have a photo</div><div id="00:37:17.440" class="transcript_line"> of him on his little bike tiny little bike when he was very young um actually on that approach</div><div id="00:37:26.000" class="transcript_line"> road um and when when it was first built or even before it was built I remember people coming here</div><div id="00:37:33.920" class="transcript_line"> when my mum and dad were in this house and they asked um they were checking sound levels and all</div><div id="00:37:40.960" class="transcript_line"> rest of it and they get they offered the residents some money because of the potential noise that</div><div id="00:37:48.240" class="transcript_line"> they were going to expect um but now especially on a windy day if you open your windows you can</div><div id="00:37:55.680" class="transcript_line"> hear the noise it&#039;s like a constant drone of the cars because obviously there are so so many more</div><div id="00:38:01.440" class="transcript_line"> cars now than then when it was first built I think that that&#039;s one one thing going back a few years</div><div id="00:38:09.360" class="transcript_line"> that um that there&#039;s a big difference in college and obviously more recently very very recently is</div><div id="00:38:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the new school um which which is great in its progression and it&#039;s better and it&#039;s required</div><div id="00:38:24.800" class="transcript_line"> because the old school was so old and um and and so sort of um tumbling down if you like um been</div><div id="00:38:34.880" class="transcript_line"> another way it&#039;s really sad for people of our era and generation um because it holds so many</div><div id="00:38:42.800" class="transcript_line"> memories um and a bit like as they&#039;re coming along and taking our school field now they&#039;re taking</div><div id="00:38:49.600" class="transcript_line"> three significant buildings which have been the center of Caldecott really for so many so many</div><div id="00:38:58.400" class="transcript_line"> years um my eldest sister I think she just about made it into that school um when we moved up from</div><div id="00:39:09.440" class="transcript_line"> Exeter um but certainly my other sister and my brother went to that school as did I and my son</div><div id="00:39:16.080" class="transcript_line"> went to that school um but my my niece now is doing array levels and she&#039;s in the new school</div><div id="00:39:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and I asked her what it&#039;s like I said what what is the new school like because I haven&#039;t been in</div><div id="00:39:28.080" class="transcript_line"> there and she said it&#039;s quite open plan in the main bit and it&#039;s quite so it&#039;s quite noisy so she</div><div id="00:39:35.760" class="transcript_line"> I think she&#039;s taking a little while to get used to it but things have to progress and we needed a new</div><div id="00:39:43.280" class="transcript_line"> school um and all new facilities and to sort of keep up with the times so it&#039;s important to have it</div><div id="00:39:52.800" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s also um really sad to see the old one go</div><div id="00:39:59.120" class="transcript_line"> thank you very much Denise for the interview</div></div></p>
