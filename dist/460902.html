    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> 97 results, the pollution reference results, did you stay up to watch? Were you somewhere</div><div id="00:00:07.600" class="transcript_line"> else? No, I didn&#039;t stay up to watch. By the end, actually, I felt curiously detached from</div><div id="00:00:16.680" class="transcript_line"> it. And it was probably because I&#039;d been so intensely involved in drafting the settlements</div><div id="00:00:26.360" class="transcript_line"> that I was tired of it by then. I remember that very well. And up to my eyeballs in legislation</div><div id="00:00:36.680" class="transcript_line"> going through, especially about universities. So I didn&#039;t stay up and I didn&#039;t really appreciate</div><div id="00:00:48.960" class="transcript_line"> the drama of how close it was. I mean, I think I understood the importance of it as far as</div><div id="00:00:55.600" class="transcript_line"> the government was concerned. Because if we had have lost that vote, that would have been</div><div id="00:00:58.760" class="transcript_line"> a big early defeat. And whenever later I have criticised the Welsh Assembly, because I&#039;m</div><div id="00:01:11.960" class="transcript_line"> quite disappointed in it really. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s made us a better country. Significantly,</div><div id="00:01:21.840" class="transcript_line"> anyway. My wife, Ilyesola, says to me, just shut up, right? You had a chance to voice</div><div id="00:01:29.720" class="transcript_line"> your opposition to it and you didn&#039;t even have the balls to vote against it in the privacy</div><div id="00:01:35.400" class="transcript_line"> of a polling booth. She knows, does she? She says the same thing to Paul Murphy, but well.</div><div id="00:01:46.320" class="transcript_line"> When you woke up the next day, therefore, was it a surprise to you that it had been</div><div id="00:01:50.800" class="transcript_line"> carried? No, no, no. I thought we would win it. But I was surprised at how close it was.</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s true or not, but these stories about Ron Davis going home,</div><div id="00:02:04.800" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t he? And he started to drive home and ready to resign, presumably. Probably lost</div><div id="00:02:14.120" class="transcript_line"> the vote. We&#039;ll never find out. No, we will never find out. Finally. He worked down the</div><div id="00:02:23.200" class="transcript_line"> hard road, but he really did. He threw everything into it. It must have been a very scary time</div><div id="00:02:31.640" class="transcript_line"> for him, I&#039;d have thought.</div></div></p>
