was</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I had an English professor</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and he always admonished in the speech classes</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> he said don&#039;t ever ever start out your talk or your speech</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> based on an apology.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So to show you what a good student I was</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to apologize</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> by saying yesterday morning I woke up</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and I couldn&#039;t even speak and the only one of course</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> who was happy about that was probably my wife</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> laryngitis</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> so when I sing with the choir this afternoon</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m going to be the only one who can sing</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> two different parts at the same time.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The hard working committee who planned and scheduled</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> today&#039;s outstanding program have insisted that I keep</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> my remarks as brief and succinct as possible.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So after careful rewriting and editing</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I have cut it down to a bare minimum of</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> what did you time me at Michael?</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> 27 minutes.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re fortunate again for the third year</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> to have as our organist Kathy Youngers.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Kathy had been the organist at this church for several years</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> until her recent defection to another church</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> to which I will not give the satisfaction of naming.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> However our Welsh heritage rubbed off on Kathy</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> enough so that when we asked her to play today</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> she didn&#039;t hesitate at all and said yes</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and not only that but selected the lovely Welsh hymn tunes</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;ve just heard in the prelude.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I know you won&#039;t believe this but there&#039;s one hymn tune there</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> that I didn&#039;t recognize</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s Llan Sanon and I&#039;m going to ask Kathy</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> just to play a couple lines of it</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and when she does I want those of you who recognize it</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I want you to raise your hand.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Kathy please.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> How many of you recognize it?</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There are some.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well bless your hearts.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay I think Tim wherever he is</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> the Welsh choir&#039;s got some research to do.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lovely thing.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Before I introduce our chairman for today</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> today&#039;s program of song and music</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I would like to have your cooperation</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and just some of the logistics of today&#039;s activities.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> As is the custom of long standing</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> at any Kamanwagani it&#039;s followed by a tabach.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So for your safety and comfort</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> the ushers are going to direct you to the fellowship hall</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> down below immediately after the program as follows.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> First the balcony and if you folks were the late comers</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> boy you got a break you get to go down first.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Secondly the chapel and then the sanctuary</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> starting with the last rows</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ll just exit in a nice orderly fashion</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and I assure you there will be plenty of good things left</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> for the last ones to go down.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact about it you may have to kind of clean it up you know.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> While you&#039;re waiting to be escorted down</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;d give you an excellent opportunity</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> to check with your neighbors</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> say hello to them, introduce yourself</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and ask where did you come from?</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that kind of reminds me of a young lad</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> about 10 or 11 years old who lived in Portmattock</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s up in northern part of Wales</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and one evening after dinner he asked his dad</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> he says Todd where did I come from?</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well his father had somewhat expected</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> that such a question was inevitable</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> so without too much hesitation he answered</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Matthew you&#039;re a product of the love</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> your mother and I have for each other.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Every child in this world is the physical embodiment</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> of the love between his parents.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Your mother carried you until it was time for you</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> to make your appearance into this world</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and we have loved and cared for you ever since.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So after a few moments of serious thought</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Matthew exclaimed to his father</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Coo Todd I think that&#039;s astounding.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to get over to Willie Jones&#039; place straight away.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well why do you want to do that Matthew</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s getting kind of late.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well Tad I&#039;ve got to tell Willie where I came from.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> His dad says he came from Aberystwyth.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s my pleasure now to introduce</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> the chairman of today&#039;s program Mr. Philip Humphreys</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and because of the great importance of this event</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Phil rushed to Seattle after basking</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> in the climes of Algeria this past week</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and Phil in turn will introduce the participants</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> in our program following the invocation.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So for the invocation would you all please rise</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and I will present to you the Reverend Dr. Robert D. Nicholson</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> the pastor of the Lake City Presbyterian Church.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Jochen Bauer.</div></div></p>
