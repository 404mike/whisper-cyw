house.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they could walk over the roof of other people which was quite fun.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> When you are trying to climb on the tree, there may be three or four people and one person will catch you.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Whoever they catch they will be the one.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> She used to play sports.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go out to play.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to play netball.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> She used to go out of the city to play football.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> To present her team.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Not football, netball.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, netball.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What cities did you travel and how old were you going to different places?</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> When you went to different cities, where did you go to play?</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We went to Toba Tek Singh for the first time.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we went to Kamali.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Toba Tek Singh is a city now.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Kamali is another place.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They were playing with different teams.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Different schools.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So she was a teacher.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, she was a teacher.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother thought I was staying there.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She was angry with me.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She said I can&#039;t go to college.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She said all the students who took part in sports, they stayed there.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> When she got home, mom was a bit cross.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> She said I couldn&#039;t travel back.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like from Kamali to Toba.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit of distance.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> She said I couldn&#039;t travel on my own.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The teachers were there.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very disappointed.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have the technology to let the players come.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad was here.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Mom was the sole responsible of the girls and the two boys as well.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a bit of hearts.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Like my grandmother actually.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> My younger sister was also there.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> She was not mine.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> She was worried that she might not be able to travel.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Younger sister went with her.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> She was the younger one in case she knew.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> What was your favourite?</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you got a favourite memory?</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a childhood.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a childhood.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a school.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> School, yes.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I missed my school.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I had friends at school.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And friends, yes.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if it&#039;s school, is there something that stands out?</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it an event or a time or a celebration that stands out?</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to watch sports in school.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a fancy dress show.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember if there was an event where people gathered in school.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There were also clothes dramas.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Dramas, obviously.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She used to take part in dramas.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Like school dramas.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit scared.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> She played the postman role once in one of the dramas.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So, after growing up, is there certain traditions that you would always celebrate as a family or in your community as well?</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was growing up, there were celebrations that we would celebrate as a family.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We would go to the parties that people would celebrate.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we would go to weddings and weddings.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We would all be at home.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We would go to the weddings and weddings.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> She said there was a wedding.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She remembered.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to do the fireworks at the wedding.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Any wedding happens, children.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know about it?</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I lost my husband when I was married.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you one thing.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, a wedding is a very exciting time for children.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The reason is because they were throwing the money when the bridegroom would come.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, even in her own wedding, she went out to pick that money.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to be told by my grandfather and my aunties, don&#039;t you dare, but we will escape.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the best time of childhood.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not about the money.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just fun.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Whoever can collect more money because they used to do coin at that time.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> At the end, she said, with other people, obviously other friends, they&#039;ll see who collected the more money.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But surely when they go home, parents are not very happy.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously the other thing she said, you know, Eid.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, it&#039;s a special Islamic event.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt got angry and said, why did you go?</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, especially on her own wedding when she sneaked out.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So her other sister told her.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> She was young.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> This is when women were getting married at the age of 14, 15.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you allowed to go out and pick up those coins on your own wedding?</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the bridegroom has come basically.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes they&#039;ll go to the mosque first.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s how the masjid is.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;ll come home.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a little bit different than what we do here.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But very memorable time.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And then as you spoke about family and speaking about here, when, because it&#039;s your father, you said.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he sort of gave me some advice.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So you said your

class="transcript_line"> Because many people have said to me that if we miss a wedding, it&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Life goes on.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because people are still there.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But when you lose your loved one, like when we come back, we are never sure when we go

together, people from the community and the group obviously,</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s great for people to come and share their grief and happiness at the same time.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> In addition to some of the things that you just shared,</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> are there other elements of the

do.</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s the most important thing that we have to do.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know that time went so quickly, and by the time having health conditions,</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and trying to bring those cultures here,</div><div id="00:23:16.000" class="transcript_line"> like as she said, festivals, getting married, and all that.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But she said sometimes it feels like I&#039;ve left the best culture behind,</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t do everything here actually.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a big difference in society, and the way the children are treated.</div><div id="00:23:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We are still trying.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> All the children are educated, all the doctors are here.</div><div id="00:23:37.000" class="transcript_line"> All of her children, she&#039;s done her duty, they are all kind of educated,</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> settled in employment, and she&#039;s got the granddaughters.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandson is from China, he&#039;s a good architect.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;s very much happy about that actually, that her own children,</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> even her grandson is gone too, he&#039;s an architect, he did it, and he&#039;s working in Japan.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s nice to have seen the next generation working hard and having good jobs.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that where Age of Life has come as well,</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and your involvement being part of Age of Life in support of that?</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been here for a long time, I&#039;ve been living with my sister,</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and then when I got married, I got married, and then my sister got lazy.</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m very happy with the group.</div><div id="00:24:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She probably knocked on the door and said, look, you need to come.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because people do go obviously for pre-med, which is a cultural thing,</div><div id="00:25:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and Islamic things to go if someone has passed away.</div><div id="00:25:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So she encouraged her to come to the group, and she said she finds it very helpful,</div><div id="00:25:13.000" class="transcript_line"> especially when you&#039;re going through that pre-med process.</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very hard for women to speak about it, Islamic.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We do obviously do Islamic rituals to give us peace of mind,</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> because sometimes you need people around them,</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and she found Age of Life very helpful, Jasmine and everybody else.</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But then recently she hasn&#039;t been very well, so she&#039;s missed.</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But she did her best, she does her best to come.</div><div id="00:25:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She did, I think, Black History, the month they were trying to,</div><div id="00:25:43.000" class="transcript_line"> she came actually when we had the Black History celebration here.</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Both of our daughters brought her in, and she stayed here with us,</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> which was nice to see her actually, just glad to see her back.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Why do you say that that&#039;s important to have a group that can welcome you</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> and you can still go through those processes?</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you feel that when you go to a group, it feels good to go there.</div><div id="00:26:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You feel all the pain, all the tension in the family, you feel it.</div><div id="00:26:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Any worries, any tension at home.</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So when going to the group, you share other things, you respect,</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> you look after each other, but they look after you as well, actually very caring, kind.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So then you forget about, like for that time is her time.</div><div id="00:26:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She forgets about what&#039;s happening in the house actually,</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and then just be with other people and sharing different experiences.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it comforts her, her heart is comfort.</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s different as well, being in the house most of the days and hours.</div><div id="00:26:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially after losing your partner is very difficult for women.</div><div id="00:26:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Men cope different ways, but women are slightly different in our culture.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because women think everything is gone with the husband,</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> even though having the children, grandchildren,</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> still you feel that time you spent together, you could have shared those memories.</div><div id="00:27:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is where she was saying coming to the group actually helps us to share those memories,</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> which she may not share with the family because she doesn&#039;t want to upset anyone.</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They started crying actually because they were very close to dad,</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> so she can&#039;t share that grief and those memories,</div><div id="00:27:32.000" class="transcript_line"> but she&#039;ll come to the group and she can talk.</div><div id="00:27:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we have actually a couple of our members that lost their husbands,</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> so I did found that the group has actually helped them to come out and comfort them.</div><div id="00:27:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We can&#039;t bring the people back, but it&#039;s nice to know there&#039;s a place people can go and share grief.</div><div id="00:27:51.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s everything. Thank you very much for sharing.</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just asking if there&#039;s anything else.</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She said she can&#039;t think of anything else.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But definitely I think a lot of people are saying like childhood, my childhood,</div><div id="00:28:09.000" class="transcript_line"> my story would never end.</div><div id="00:28:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was saying tell him to do it in half an hour, and I forgot to tell him mine was probably one and a half.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no, they will take just the most important things out of it.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think one of the things people...</div><div id="00:28:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think childhood is the best time of your life.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is true because you don&#039;t have any worries,</div><div id="00:28:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was much more safe time in open environment.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> When you are in a town or a village, it&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:28:39.000" class="transcript_line"> People you can trust, they are not related.</div><div id="00:28:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to be very close, which has kind of changed.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If you go and eat whatever you want, you won&#039;t feel hungry.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You can turn up at any door basically, they will feed you, and nobody will tell you off.</div><div id="00:28:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a nice time.</div><div id="00:28:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved it a lot.</div><div id="00:28:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Love and care for each other.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s because people have moved away from the villages actually.</div><div id="00:29:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Parents, grandparents passed away.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Their children grew up, they went out for jobs in cities.</div><div id="00:29:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s not like as it used to be, but still it&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:29:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like it used to be when we came back.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Our father used to come here with his elder brother.</div><div id="00:29:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to have a big tree.</div><div id="00:29:24.000" class="transcript_line"> All the women used to come there and sit.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to enjoy it.</div><div id="00:29:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The children used to say it&#039;s so beautiful.</div><div id="00:29:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They all would sit around.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you can visualize it.</div><div id="00:29:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This was the childhood.</div><div id="00:29:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone used to come here to play and their mothers used to talk to them.</div><div id="00:29:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Moms obviously would share their own skills and things, but the children can play with each other.</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very safe environment as well.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Very friendly, safe.</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like you are not related.</div><div id="00:30:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Anybody was welcome.</div><div id="00:30:08.000" class="transcript_line"> When we were the head of the village, nobody respected us.</div><div id="00:30:12.000" class="transcript_line"> When we used to go to the village, we would get food from the village.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We would eat whatever we wanted.</div><div id="00:30:18.000" class="transcript_line"> When we made chapatis in the Abhavan, that was quite close to our house.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So when people would come and they would run out of chapatis, someone would go there and bring more.</div><div id="00:30:30.000" class="transcript_line"> This was the tradition.</div><div id="00:30:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Anybody who comes, they are not going to leave the house without having the food.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is a little bit different now because families have extended.</div><div id="00:30:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Her health is not very good, but it was very much open air, fresh air, love and care.</div><div id="00:30:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lot and the loved one being missed.</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no one outside the house.</div><div id="00:30:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to sleep openly.</div><div id="00:30:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a gate and we had the wall, but the walls were not very high.</div><div id="00:30:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But still there was no fear that someone would be broken into or there would be something horrible.</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> People would keep their door open and they could still sleep within their boundary.</div><div id="00:31:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The open air, the beds, surely some people are still going and getting the metal pole or the wooden beautiful poles.</div><div id="00:31:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Traditional, traditional.</div><div id="00:31:20.000" class="transcript_line"> She also mentioned actually that when she was in school, she knew very strange how sometimes you connect.</div><div id="00:31:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She is my teacher.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She passed away.</div><div id="00:31:31.000" class="transcript_line"> She was in Northamptom.</div><div id="00:31:32.000" class="transcript_line"> She passed away and I was talking to her.</div><div id="00:31:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Where did you educate her?</div><div id="00:31:36.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes, Birbala Desert.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt was teaching there.</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, rather than study, she was quite pretty as well.</div><div id="00:31:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I will look at her rather than study.</div><div id="00:31:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I told her recently that she passed away.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a very small world actually.</div><div id="00:31:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you get to know people in the background.</div><div id="00:31:53.000" class="transcript_line"> When you ask them, even, well anyway, that&#039;s probably it.</div><div id="00:31:58.000" class="transcript_line"> If you finish that.</div><div id="00:32:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just going to say something.</div><div id="00:32:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You can finish that.</div><div id="00:32:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll just share something else.</div></div></p>
