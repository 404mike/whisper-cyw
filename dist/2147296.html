You know, when I&#039;ve done the work, apart from that, if I&#039;m honest, we just survive.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we can&#039;t do anything for ourselves, just for other people, all the time.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Make them happy. Nobody thinks about me.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> She needs the space or happiness or anything.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t go six years, I didn&#039;t see my parents. After six and a half years, I go first time.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you say that it was your culture that kept you strong or kept you connected, or was it something else?</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> How it&#039;s parents? First is parents, after children?</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, like obviously you didn&#039;t want to upset your parents about marriage or anything difficult.</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very strong when I come. I&#039;m not afraid for anyone, anything or anyone.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m not strong enough for decision, leave the house or leave the husband or leave the people.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I have no guts for like this.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And it is, as you said, with the culture, it&#039;s like people talk, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always say, now, if I&#039;m honest, with my links, with our links, there is no house who hasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> There are different kinds of issues. The life has completely changed.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And especially, you know, when you were saying about the culture in Pakistan, if a son will get married, it&#039;s a different daughter, will have a different life.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But here in this country, because people came in like late 50s or 60s, they were still stuck in that culture that the daughter-in-law is like a maid.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not that she&#039;s married our husband.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> If he&#039;s only husband, maybe life is different. When it comes in the family, it&#039;s very hard.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And you just find yourself.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Five, six, seven, eight, nine people live in the same house and cooking three times a day.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And very young.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What does that look like to you now? What is the culture?</div><div id="00:11:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Now? 22 years I live with my in-law.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And after 15 years I live in the rent house. Now it&#039;s our house. His house, not ours.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I know I had everything.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But I have no feelings for thinking or helpless, speechless, everything.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t say and I can&#039;t explain anyone how I feel.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I want to speak on the culture and traditions as well.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there certain efforts you&#039;ve made in order to preserve?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We tried to preserve our culture.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We were from Pakistan. We have established ourselves here.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. We are behind them.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We tried but we couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Like when she said extended family, loving family.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t give my children more time because we live in an extended family.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And what have you been able to do with your children that you&#039;re kind of proud of?</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there certain things that you&#039;ve done or shared with your children that you&#039;re proud of?</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We have done a lot of things to make our children proud.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of things but I neglect.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel I give them more time when they need me.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m always working in the kitchen, cleaning, visiting.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But they need me.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I say, oh, five minutes, ten minutes and they sleep.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I think I can&#039;t sleep.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Ten days I can&#039;t sleep.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But there must be something that the children say.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> That you&#039;ve done a lot for them.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no discussion.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the thing actually.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to cut a couple of parts from the recording.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> How would it be?</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When they go into the archive, obviously the story will be there.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But in general, it will be in a booklet.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Surely it will be 500.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> In the book it will just be a text.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re proud because they said, take a lot of things for us.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t go back. Don&#039;t leave me.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> If I want to do anything, I get married again and leave this family.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t do it for my children.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The children do appreciate that she did go through a lot because of the children.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s a different time for them.</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got their own stresses.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They do value.</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But then she&#039;s staying with the extended family in marriage just for the sake of first the parents and then the children.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s more cultural, if I&#039;m honest.</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It has nothing to do with the belief.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Religion doesn&#039;t allow a woman to suffer in silence.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just because we are worried about what would my parents think, what would the community say.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s changing.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> When you ask me, what culture, we try to bring it here.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But our children do tell us, why did you suffer that much?</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They always ask me why.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Why didn&#039;t you left?</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My daughter, she&#039;s crying.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Like very loud.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Why you take everything and still taking?</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they are different.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They know they have to stand for themselves but not be quiet like us.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And you said it earlier on how they speak openly from the heart.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But then they wouldn&#039;t be able to do that if it wasn&#039;t for you paving that path and doing exactly what you needed to do so they can&#039;t speak.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we give sacrifices, the children see that we give.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So they would say, we are pleading, pleading for our mother&#039;s life, what we have to do.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They are very upset sometimes when they talk to me, very very upset.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They come, my youngest son comes every five minutes, mom you okay, you okay.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But I have no feeling for anyone.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They are my children but not inside.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know at the moment.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that where Age Alive, something like Age Alive has helped?</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when I go regular now I can&#039;t because I have the surgery.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I go very, a couple of hours, all days were going very good.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I met all friends from different cultures.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s still been on a few groups but it&#039;s like help of other people comforting and making sure that people are you know who got health, that they are safe.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> This is something they look after actually us.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you become involved in Age Alive?</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think because, one of the things was because the group I was running closed.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we go regularly.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And Age Alive started picking up actually because they were dying down basically.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The group was set up by Leanne Taylor from Quinty&#039;s first.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was involved with her but then she left, somebody else employed and more or less it was.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when you started.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I go regular in Age Alive.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Not for two, three years, not regular but before that.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> What does it mean to you as well?</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good, very helpful.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My mind is very, like exercise classes and now she&#039;s coming for meditation.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very helpful, very good.</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I finish my, like when I come regular I take off my medicine, like depression.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good, yes.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And how do you think that supports Asian, black or other minority or majority groups over 50s?</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good, very nice.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I talk to everyone, I don&#039;t mind, I talk to everyone.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is that important?</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> For peace of mind, yes.</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I love to go out all the time but now I&#039;m with health problems.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> She wasn&#039;t going to come actually so I had to come yesterday.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She asked me a lot of times, she said no, no, she said no come, she asked you.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When he asked I said okay, I didn&#039;t say do anything for her.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And you have to share, it&#039;s not all that she&#039;s doing, it&#039;s just that she wants to do the story.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It is very important if I&#039;m honest actually, you know for Age Alive because people do comfort each other.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And when Yasmin comes, despite she is, this is one of her qualities, she doesn&#039;t see inside, she may be broken if I&#039;m honest.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But she does make cracks, leaving jokes and smile and always she&#039;s done that actually.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes people can&#039;t see their qualities, very loving, caring, did her best.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> As a woman sometimes we don&#039;t value ourselves, being patient.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not only about belief obviously, she&#039;s religious but she&#039;s open minded as well.</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Very generous, it doesn&#039;t have to be a bad thing.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s religious but she&#039;s open minded as well.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Very generous, it doesn&#039;t have to be, if she will help, it doesn&#039;t have to be a Muslim person, she has to help anybody in crisis.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if she&#039;s not working and she says wherever disaster is she&#039;ll pay the money actually.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it makes some difference to other people, appreciating what we have but helping others.</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> As a woman sometimes we don&#039;t like praise, we feel sometimes embarrassed when other people tell us this is the good quality.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And she is when she comes and very helpful, when her health was good.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And we do miss her when she doesn&#039;t come.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> This is helpful so thank you so much for coming and accepting the invitation to come and share because it&#039;s really powerful and really important to hear just your story.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank
