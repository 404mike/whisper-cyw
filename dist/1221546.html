    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about your National Series.</div><div id="00:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, you had the option. When you were called up, you went for an interview.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first thing you did was you made out all your terrible illnesses and complaints.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You emphasised all these in the hope that you would be declared not fit enough to go.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But the fact that I did faint at the sight of blood and various other things, they said,</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, we&#039;ll class you as Grade 2, but we&#039;re taking Grade 2s.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So which branch of the service do you want to go into?</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I plumped for the Royal Air Force and they said with my background they would take me in the Air Force.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So about three weeks later you get the dreaded letter with a railway voucher telling you to report to RAF Cardington,</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> which is near Bedford, and make your own way there, which is what I did.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I got on the train and I ended up in the old airship facility, which is RAF Cardington,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> which was where they kept and built the airships.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the hangars were now being used to fit you out with your uniforms and everything else.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you were there for three days and then you were allocated to a basic training camp.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the one I was allocated to was RAF Bridgnorth, which is in Shropshire.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t find that very arduous at all because having spent six years in a British public school,</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> going into the Army is relatively easy.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d also been in the cadet force there, so I knew how to march, I knew how to carry a rifle,</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> how to slope arms, how to order arms, how to strip a Bren gun, all that sort of thing was all very familiar to me.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So I really had no problem with basic training.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then after eight weeks you&#039;re given a weekend pass and you&#039;re sent home</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and then told to report for your trade training after that training.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re given the choice of where they will take you.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And my first choice was photography because that was my hobby.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So before they would take you on the photography course, they sent you off to do a test.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I think they didn&#039;t really want National Servicemen on the photography department</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> because that was one of the better trades to go into.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And they really kept it for the people who&#039;d signed on for three years or longer.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a rule that if a National Serviceman says he wants to do it, he should be allowed to take the test.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Now what they didn&#039;t tell me in the test was what they were looking for.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave me a series of negatives, put me into the darkroom and said,</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> well there you are, get on with it, print these negatives for us.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did as best I could. I knew how to develop and print things.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course what they were really looking for was beautifully, how shall I say,</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> balance negatives all the same with the same level of black and white.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously these are photographs taken from a plane.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When they&#039;re all joined together on a table, they need to look like one.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well of course mine, some were lighter, some were darker, and they looked like terrible patchwork.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said, well I&#039;m sorry you failed.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course if they told me that I need to get them all the same, I could have made more effort.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t. So that was that. So the next option was radio.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did quite well in physics in school and I did in university.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I liked electrical engineering so I said, well I want to become a radio fitter.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So fair enough. The course was nine months long.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was in RAF Compton, Bassett, which is near Caen in Wiltshire.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I went off there for nine months and I quite enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Because of what I&#039;d done in university I didn&#039;t find it particularly difficult.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I passed that course and I came out as a junior technician,</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> which is you get one upside down stripe on your arm.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then because I wanted to sit my university exams again I&#039;d applied for a home posting.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was granted and my posting came through when I was posted to Gloucester, RAF Innsworth.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Now by this time I was engaged to Jill and Jill had got herself a job in Gloucester at the art college.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, ah, heaven, here we are. I&#039;ll be in the RAF Innsworth and we&#039;ll be together again.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I marched in through the gate at RAF Innsworth and the chap who was on guard there took one look at my papers</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said, oh, he said, you&#039;re posted to 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, they&#039;re in Northern Ireland. You&#039;ll be off tomorrow.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had one night in Gloucester, said goodbye to Jill.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And the next day I was on the trek to Northern Ireland, to Londonderry.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is where I spent the rest of the time, all except for the last two months when the whole regiment was transferred to Felixstowe.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I went to Felixstowe and in Felixstowe I was demobbed and then I came back and that was my two years national service.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But I never really regretted it. I know it was a waste of two years,</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> but during that period I grew up and you go in a boy and you come out a man, which is pretty true.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I learned quite a lot. I never really managed to learn how to fix the radios because they were so old and they didn&#039;t work anyway.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I couldn&#039;t get them to work. And it didn&#039;t seem to bother the RAF Regiment at all.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t need it. They were guarding the airfield. The troubles with the IRA hadn&#039;t really started in those days.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They were just rumblings and we had to go out and guard various radio masts.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave us a rifle, but they didn&#039;t give us any bullets. So I don&#039;t know what good the rifle was.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And our joke was if we have to challenge someone and have to shoot him, well, we have to make a loud bang because that&#039;s all we could do or club him with a rifle.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t taken very seriously. And we got on well enough with the locals. All this business of the troubles hadn&#039;t taken off.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the boys went out with the local girls.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> This was what, 1956, 1958?</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. I mean the trouble started in the 70s didn&#039;t it?</div></div></p>
