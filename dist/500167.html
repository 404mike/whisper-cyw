    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was five years old when my parents moved to Glyn Terrace. I was an only child and I</div><div id="00:00:16.840" class="transcript_line"> was told that they were moving house because I was going to have a baby brother or sister.</div><div id="00:00:25.360" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t really want to leave Trevallies Cossages but I soon settled in to Glyn Terrace</div><div id="00:00:33.880" class="transcript_line"> and found it was a delightful place to live. There were plenty of playmates there. Most</div><div id="00:00:40.480" class="transcript_line"> of the people in the terrace spoke Welsh and when I think of it, how lovely it was here.</div><div id="00:00:49.880" class="transcript_line"> The children had the freedom of the mountains. We played in the stream. There was one boy,</div><div id="00:00:57.400" class="transcript_line"> Alan Thomas, who lived just down the road. His favourite hobby was trying to catch the</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> fish in the stream. He&#039;d put his hand under the stones and pulled the trout out. I always</div><div id="00:01:16.520" class="transcript_line"> went to pick bilberries. All the children picked bilberries and I knew when I picked</div><div id="00:01:22.920" class="transcript_line"> bilberries there would be bilberry pie for tea the following day. Sometimes my father,</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> after a day&#039;s work, used to say we&#039;d go pick bilberries and so he used to pick a lot.</div><div id="00:01:39.760" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t pick all that many but it was lovely going up on the hills. I also picked firewood.</div><div id="00:01:49.480" class="transcript_line"> The children, all the cottages had coal fires and the children went into the woodlands,</div><div id="00:01:58.480" class="transcript_line"> with a sack and picked the kindling wood and that was a nice occupation. Sometimes we would</div><div id="00:02:09.880" class="transcript_line"> see the patients from Pendafrin Hall Sanatorium walking around Pendafrin Woods. It was a delightful</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> place. Of course we played in the woodland, over the river. The green was lovely there.</div><div id="00:02:33.080" class="transcript_line"> The boys played football and the girls ran around there. It was altogether a delightful</div><div id="00:02:41.960" class="transcript_line"> place to live. And then the war came and the evacuees arrived from Liverpool. They thought</div><div id="00:02:53.080" class="transcript_line"> it was a wonderful place after Liverpool. The children, it mixed in with the other children</div><div id="00:03:04.200" class="transcript_line"> very well. The children from Liverpool were mainly Roman Catholics but we all played together.</div><div id="00:03:14.200" class="transcript_line"> The local children went down to the Sunday school, Glanaravon. We walked down the stream</div><div id="00:03:25.200" class="transcript_line"> path on a Sunday afternoon. Sometimes on a Sunday morning I went to church in my best</div><div id="00:03:33.400" class="transcript_line"> clothes and then I came home at lunch time and I put on my best clothes for a short time</div><div id="00:03:40.400" class="transcript_line"> in case I got my best clothes dirty. Then I dressed up again to go to Sunday school</div><div id="00:03:47.600" class="transcript_line"> in the afternoon. The Sunday school teacher was Bob Thomas from Glanaravon. It was a well</div><div id="00:03:56.880" class="transcript_line"> attended Sunday school and there were several teachers there. I was in the class that sat</div><div id="00:04:03.200" class="transcript_line"> on the big wooden bench in Glanaravon. In the winter Glanaravon schoolroom was lovely</div><div id="00:04:10.800" class="transcript_line"> and warm. The caretaker Ethel Jones made a fire in the old black stove and heated the</div><div id="00:04:22.400" class="transcript_line"> room up before the children arrived. It was a very happy Sunday school and of course there</div><div id="00:04:30.300" class="transcript_line"> was the Perks Sunday school Christmas party. Then in the summer there was the annual trip</div><div id="00:04:39.300" class="transcript_line"> to Rill, to the Marine Lake mainly. We all loved going around on the equipment in the</div><div id="00:04:47.300" class="transcript_line"> Marine Lake and especially the ghost train. It was a wonderful day out, a treat, especially</div><div id="00:04:56.300" class="transcript_line"> so during the war years.</div></div></p>
