    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Thursday the 11th of July 2019 and I&#039;m here with Peter Hussey at his home in</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Valley. Peter thank you very much for agreeing to this recorded history.</div><div id="00:00:11.400" class="transcript_line"> Just like to start with you telling me a little bit about yourself, your</div><div id="00:00:15.760" class="transcript_line"> background and your family. Okay well I was born in Tempe and lived in South</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> Pembrokeshire for the first 19 years of my life but then left South Pembrokeshire to</div><div id="00:00:32.680" class="transcript_line"> move to Newcastle upon Tyne because of my father&#039;s career and I then moved up</div><div id="00:00:40.640" class="transcript_line"> there at the end of my schooling and joined Fennec Limited which is a retail</div><div id="00:00:49.680" class="transcript_line"> organization and there I met my wife. So fairly quickly we then settled down to</div><div id="00:00:57.800" class="transcript_line"> married life in the Northeast but having got involved in retailing it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:01:06.720" class="transcript_line"> job that tends to demand that as you move through the ranks you also move</div><div id="00:01:14.080" class="transcript_line"> through the geography and so we went to live in Edinburgh, subsequently Manchester, Leeds,</div><div id="00:01:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Liverpool, Bath, London and back again up to Merseyside. So we&#039;d moved around a</div><div id="00:01:34.960" class="transcript_line"> considerable amount. My parents were becoming quite elderly by the time that</div><div id="00:01:43.080" class="transcript_line"> we had finished our career and we decided that it would be very good if we</div><div id="00:01:50.560" class="transcript_line"> could move back into Wales and so we started looking for a business which</div><div id="00:01:59.040" class="transcript_line"> would also provide us with a home and those two things were essentials.</div><div id="00:02:04.600" class="transcript_line"> We found that in the drovers tea rooms in Billswells and we moved in there</div><div id="00:02:12.400" class="transcript_line"> subsequently initially with Maggie&#039;s mother and then subsequently with</div><div id="00:02:19.760" class="transcript_line"> my mum and dad moving up from Temby to Bills as well and they had about the</div><div id="00:02:25.040" class="transcript_line"> last five years of their life with us in Bills. So that&#039;s the very quick resume</div><div id="00:02:34.480" class="transcript_line"> of the geography of my career and life but that brought us back into Wales</div><div id="00:02:41.520" class="transcript_line"> and I had come to the Ellam Valley probably for the first time in 1952 I</div><div id="00:02:50.800" class="transcript_line"> would guess soon after Clarewyn was opened by the Queen and we came up to</div><div id="00:02:58.760" class="transcript_line"> to look at it. We certainly weren&#039;t here for the Queen&#039;s visit and I</div><div id="00:03:05.400" class="transcript_line"> think subsequently we probably came up reasonably often. My dad although he</div><div id="00:03:11.200" class="transcript_line"> drove all week for his as part of his job and still delighted in taking us</div><div id="00:03:19.120" class="transcript_line"> out for rides on a Sunday so I think the Ellam Valley was one of the</div><div id="00:03:25.280" class="transcript_line"> destinations that we would have come to fairly frequently and that left me with</div><div id="00:03:31.400" class="transcript_line"> a picture of the Red House and the White Houses of Glenrhyven and as the entrance</div><div id="00:03:40.640" class="transcript_line"> to the Ellam Valley and then probably the Salt House and the the Waterworks as</div><div id="00:03:48.120" class="transcript_line"> the second entry point into the valley and I had a very clear recollection of</div><div id="00:03:54.520" class="transcript_line"> that that always stayed with me so the words Ellam Valley would produce those</div><div id="00:03:58.480" class="transcript_line"> two pictures. When we moved up to Bills I thought it would be nice one evening to</div><div id="00:04:07.800" class="transcript_line"> bring Maggie out with her mother and we came out to the Ellam Valley from Bills.</div><div id="00:04:13.480" class="transcript_line"> Maggie was just totally blown away by it. I couldn&#039;t imagine</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> that there was such a place so close to where we were living and she just loved</div><div id="00:04:26.600" class="transcript_line"> it and we weren&#039;t able to to come out very often because the the drovers as it</div><div id="00:04:36.800" class="transcript_line"> became very successful demanded 24-7 involvement so it would be fairly</div><div id="00:04:43.960" class="transcript_line"> infrequent that we managed to come up here. Then at the point where we were</div><div id="00:04:51.080" class="transcript_line"> starting to think about retirement we&#039;d been looking for some sort of</div><div id="00:04:58.680" class="transcript_line"> interesting house and some friends rang up one Sunday afternoon to tell us that</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d driven into the Ellam Village and had seen that this house was for sale.</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Now my father had told me about Ellam Village and during the time that he was</div><div id="00:05:19.760" class="transcript_line"> staying with us he had driven up here and mentioned it to me but I had no idea</div><div id="00:05:25.320" class="transcript_line"> what the village was because of course at that time it was totally surrounded</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> by 60 foot high cupresses so you couldn&#039;t see it from the road from Redd to the</div><div id="00:05:39.480" class="transcript_line"> Ellam Valley and even as you went down to the visitor centre and you couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:05:45.760" class="transcript_line"> see anything in the village at all. As you got down to the Bailey Bridge there</div><div id="00:05:51.440" class="transcript_line"> was a sign on it, a wooden sign which I think is still there, saying Ellam Valley</div><div id="00:05:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Lodge. So I presumed that this Bailey Bridge must be some sort of driveway to</div><div id="00:06:03.960" class="transcript_line"> something private and I had no idea that the village was here although I knew</div><div id="00:06:09.800" class="transcript_line"> that the village was somewhere around. So when my friend told me that there was a</div><div id="00:06:16.400" class="transcript_line"> house for sale here we came out that evening and saw it and just loved it.</div><div id="00:06:25.680" class="transcript_line"> It was perfect for what we wanted and so we entered into the very long process of</div><div id="00:06:33.640" class="transcript_line"> buying it. I think that the controlling body for water had instructed</div><div id="00:06:45.200" class="transcript_line"> the water companies that they shouldn&#039;t have property that wasn&#039;t directly</div><div id="00:06:50.320" class="transcript_line"> in producing water and so the companies have to sell off whatever properties</div><div id="00:06:57.280" class="transcript_line"> they had. Locally that involved Welsh Water in deciding to create the Ellam</div><div id="00:07:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Valley Trust and to move its property across to the trust and Severntrent who</div><div id="00:07:12.400" class="transcript_line"> owned the minority of houses in the village decided that they would put</div><div id="00:07:17.880" class="transcript_line"> theirs up for sale as they became available. Now ours was already available.</div><div id="00:07:23.360" class="transcript_line"> The previous tenant had moved out I think two years earlier and it was</div><div id="00:07:29.240" class="transcript_line"> not in good condition but they had put it up for sale and we made an offer</div><div id="00:07:36.040" class="transcript_line"> which was accepted after a period and so our offer was accepted I think on the</div><div id="00:07:44.640" class="transcript_line"> 17th of October but it took until the 17th of March was to actually get possession.</div><div id="00:07:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I think that was quite largely because Severntrent weren&#039;t particularly</div><div id="00:07:53.680" class="transcript_line"> interested in selling the property and so we&#039;re not giving high priority to our</div><div id="00:07:59.480" class="transcript_line"> requests for information and that sort of thing so it was a drawn-out process.</div><div id="00:08:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Eventually we got possession and moved in and began to work on the inside of</div><div id="00:08:13.280" class="transcript_line"> the building to bring it up to the standard that it now is. That was quite a</div><div id="00:08:18.920" class="transcript_line"> long process again because during the tenancy of the building which was</div><div id="00:08:25.760" class="transcript_line"> from start these buildings have tended to have problems with condensation on</div><div id="00:08:36.240" class="transcript_line"> the stone mullions of the windows and that resulted in problems elsewhere.</div><div id="00:08:44.400" class="transcript_line"> The quick answer to this had been to paint them and of course we were aware of the</div><div id="00:08:52.960" class="transcript_line"> fact that that was a major problem also some of the pointing that had been done</div><div id="00:08:56.720" class="transcript_line"> over the years on the outside had been done on the cement and that was again a</div><div id="00:09:01.240" class="transcript_line"> problem so we had to gradually relime the building by using lime mortar in the</div><div id="00:09:12.680" class="transcript_line"> pointing on the exterior. We used lime plaster on interior walls and lime based</div><div id="00:09:21.800" class="transcript_line"> paint and we very very long process of scraping the paint off the stone</div><div id="00:09:29.560" class="transcript_line"> mullions and getting them back to their original shape. We also realigned some of</div><div id="00:09:37.480" class="transcript_line"> the rooms on the ground floor which gave us a lot more light and a lot more</div><div id="00:09:43.280" class="transcript_line"> usable space. The house had of course been designed for artisans living here</div><div id="00:09:49.600" class="transcript_line"> in the 1900s so there was not a lot of utility space and there were areas which</div><div id="00:09:58.880" class="transcript_line"> were no longer particularly appropriate such as a ladder. So we worked on the</div><div id="00:10:07.720" class="transcript_line"> interior of the building but of course keeping the exterior very close to its</div><div id="00:10:14.240" class="transcript_line"> original format and in fact returning it to its original format. So we were then</div><div id="00:10:23.240" class="transcript_line"> able to move in some two years later when we were successful in selling the</div><div id="00:10:28.680" class="transcript_line"> rovers in Bills and we moved in here on the 3rd of January 2008 which was a</div><div id="00:10:36.920" class="transcript_line"> delight for us. We had been able to to come up a little bit for weekends for</div><div id="00:10:43.880" class="transcript_line"> about six months before that. Maggie had been very ill and it was a delight for</div><div id="00:10:50.840" class="transcript_line"> us to be able to come up and get away from the business and relax for maybe</div><div id="00:10:56.680" class="transcript_line"> just 48 hours before we went back to the tumult.</div><div id="00:11:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they give you a different scene sometimes. It&#039;s a real help.</div><div id="00:11:05.600" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re very happy to move in here and we had a fairly wild garden. As you can imagine by this time it</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> hadn&#039;t had any human intervention for about four years. We still had the</div><div id="00:11:24.640" class="transcript_line"> pigsty and the pigsty had been built on. So previous tenants had built sheds onto</div><div id="00:11:36.960" class="transcript_line"> the pigsty. So it had begun to resemble something of like a Swiss chalet but</div><div id="00:11:44.880" class="transcript_line"> very unusable space because it was all tiny rooms at different levels and</div><div id="00:11:49.880" class="transcript_line"> with various obstructions inside. We on the other hand having moved into the</div><div id="00:11:56.640" class="transcript_line"> house realized that the lack of utility space was a problem. So we looked to a</div><div id="00:12:03.480" class="transcript_line"> way in which we could introduce some utility space, possibly a garage which</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> would have been very useful, and the utility space would have provided some</div><div id="00:12:18.520" class="transcript_line"> space that we could put things like washing machines into and maybe a</div><div id="00:12:22.960" class="transcript_line"> chest freezer or something like that. So we began to look at how we could do</div><div id="00:12:31.600" class="transcript_line"> that and we&#039;re thinking in terms of maybe a garage building adjacent to the</div><div id="00:12:36.760" class="transcript_line"> side of the cottage and that would have some utility space on the back and we</div><div id="00:12:45.120" class="transcript_line"> thought maybe we could get some sort of art space, some sort of studio into the</div><div id="00:12:52.800" class="transcript_line"> top of it, into the roof because we knew it would have to match the architecture</div><div id="00:12:58.400" class="transcript_line"> of the village and therefore it would have the high-pitched Luttien&#039;s roof</div><div id="00:13:02.060" class="transcript_line"> that all the buildings have. So we were beginning to think along those lines.</div><div id="00:13:07.040" class="transcript_line"> There is a problem with that for us here and that is that the sewer for the four</div><div id="00:13:13.520" class="transcript_line"> buildings that make up this section of the village all come past the back of</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> our house and in line with the sidewall it diverts and crosses over into the</div><div id="00:13:28.960" class="transcript_line"> field. So this meant that we couldn&#039;t extend backwards and we</div><div id="00:13:34.400" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t extend sideways. That left us with something of a problem and we came</div><div id="00:13:39.040" class="transcript_line"> up with the idea that we could possibly build something in the garden. So we got</div><div id="00:13:45.760" class="transcript_line"> hold of, we had an architect and the architect got hold of the planners</div><div id="00:13:52.040" class="transcript_line"> which involved us with the heritage planning officer who came out and visited</div><div id="00:13:59.600" class="transcript_line"> and we had a very very helpful conversation and a walk around the</div><div id="00:14:05.500" class="transcript_line"> Seeing that other buildings in the village have out buildings, she felt that</div><div id="00:14:11.260" class="transcript_line"> it would not be too unusual for us to have one as well and so we began to</div><div id="00:14:18.740" class="transcript_line"> design the building that eventually became the cottage which is a self</div><div id="00:14:24.980" class="transcript_line"> catering unit. That has a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and a garage and of</div><div id="00:14:32.900" class="transcript_line"> course a lounge and the lounge wonderfully has French windows that</div><div id="00:14:38.140" class="transcript_line"> overlook the Caen Gafault bird reserve so that is absolutely wonderful and that</div><div id="00:14:49.260" class="transcript_line"> was designed originally for use by our family but because of the restrictions</div><div id="00:14:58.180" class="transcript_line"> that planning put on us and linked with the restrictions or rather the</div><div id="00:15:04.500" class="transcript_line"> definitions that are applied by the building regs, the building had become</div><div id="00:15:09.340" class="transcript_line"> rather more expensive than we had initially expected. So we then decided</div><div id="00:15:16.460" class="transcript_line"> that we would try to recover some of that cost by using it for self catering</div><div id="00:15:20.180" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what we&#039;ve been doing in a relatively small way since that time. We</div><div id="00:15:27.020" class="transcript_line"> initially took control of the cottage from the builders in November 2009 and</div><div id="00:15:36.980" class="transcript_line"> so from the Easter of 2010 we began having a relatively small amount of self</div><div id="00:15:46.380" class="transcript_line"> catering rentals of the cottage. I think probably something in the region of six</div><div id="00:15:53.260" class="transcript_line"> or seven weeks of the year initially. We&#039;ve been very successful with that in</div><div id="00:15:59.420" class="transcript_line"> that we have developed a very loyal group of returners and that linked with</div><div id="00:16:09.660" class="transcript_line"> new people coming each year has built up fairly substantially. We&#039;re now at a level</div><div id="00:16:16.540" class="transcript_line"> of about 19 weeks of the year. I think as other buildings in the village became</div><div id="00:16:26.180" class="transcript_line"> available, i.e. that seven trained to put them up for sale, then numbers 10 and</div><div id="00:16:34.100" class="transcript_line"> number 1 both also got purchased and used in a similar way but in both</div><div id="00:16:40.540" class="transcript_line"> those cases it is the entire house that is being let and so they are much bigger</div><div id="00:16:46.940" class="transcript_line"> units, three and four bedroom and they have approached in a much more</div><div id="00:16:55.860" class="transcript_line"> professional way than we have. We have never used an agency for example and</div><div id="00:16:59.780" class="transcript_line"> just basically left it for people to find us. So they&#039;ve become much more</div><div id="00:17:10.140" class="transcript_line"> used than our spaces but that&#039;s good. It&#039;s bringing people to the valley,</div><div id="00:17:17.540" class="transcript_line"> getting them to appreciate it and from that point of view I also welcome the</div><div id="00:17:23.220" class="transcript_line"> way in which self catering has been developed in the town and I think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:17:28.220" class="transcript_line"> helped the town quite a bit and also the development of the Allen Oaks caravan</div><div id="00:17:34.140" class="transcript_line"> site which again brings more people in. It&#039;s very nice to see so many more</div><div id="00:17:39.660" class="transcript_line"> people using the village now and using the valley and of course that</div><div id="00:17:44.980" class="transcript_line"> was very much down to the removal of the cupressus which made such a difference.</div><div id="00:17:52.740" class="transcript_line"> When we first came the the midge problem was severe and during three months of</div><div id="00:17:59.740" class="transcript_line"> the year all you could do was run from the front door to the car and as</div><div id="00:18:03.460" class="transcript_line"> quickly as you could and get out of the valley as quickly as you could. It was</div><div id="00:18:07.260" class="transcript_line"> just unpleasant to be out in in the garden or outside the house and</div><div id="00:18:13.500" class="transcript_line"> particularly on high humidity days it really wasn&#039;t a place to go out in.</div><div id="00:18:19.820" class="transcript_line"> Removal of the trees helped that and gradually the problems become less and</div><div id="00:18:25.540" class="transcript_line"> less. It could also be that the removal of the chestnuts which was a great shame</div><div id="00:18:31.340" class="transcript_line"> and of course was down to disease of the chestnuts when they were removed.</div><div id="00:18:38.220" class="transcript_line"> That may well have also affected it. So we don&#039;t seem to have the problem</div><div id="00:18:46.740" class="transcript_line"> that we did have with midges and this year in particular we seem to have had a</div><div id="00:18:52.780" class="transcript_line"> very successful year from a midge point of view. Yes I think I mean it&#039;s lovely</div><div id="00:18:58.940" class="transcript_line"> to see the valley and the village being used but do you think there&#039;s any</div><div id="00:19:04.580" class="transcript_line"> downsides to that? Do you have any sort of litter problems? Not at this stage we</div><div id="00:19:11.700" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t seen that. As we walk around the valley we do come across</div><div id="00:19:18.380" class="transcript_line"> littering which is obviously sometimes quite purposeful that people sort of</div><div id="00:19:27.540" class="transcript_line"> hiding carrier bags of litter and briars and that sort of thing and the one</div><div id="00:19:34.860" class="transcript_line"> that annoys us enormously is when people pick up their dog poo in little plastic</div><div id="00:19:40.260" class="transcript_line"> bags and then leave them around for somebody else to pick up which is very</div><div id="00:19:45.660" class="transcript_line"> inconsiderate of them. But generally speaking the people who visit the valley</div><div id="00:19:51.620" class="transcript_line"> do so with great appreciation and great respect. One of the delights of the</div><div id="00:19:59.700" class="transcript_line"> year is when quite large extended Asian family come down and play football on</div><div id="00:20:05.220" class="transcript_line"> the football pitch alongside us which they&#039;ve done each year.</div><div id="00:20:08.860" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately they got rained off the football this year but they still</div><div id="00:20:12.980" class="transcript_line"> came and it&#039;s good to see them. Yes we get quite a lot of people from the Birmingham area which is really nice.</div><div id="00:20:20.180" class="transcript_line"> So in your time of the nearly ten years of running the self-catering cottage</div><div id="00:20:25.940" class="transcript_line"> have you had any interesting events happen? Any quirky stories to tell?</div><div id="00:20:31.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think quirky. Basically the people who come very quickly turn out to be</div><div id="00:20:38.980" class="transcript_line"> friends and it&#039;s a very pleasant situation of these people reappearing</div><div id="00:20:47.740" class="transcript_line"> year after year and restarting the friendships that we developed here</div><div id="00:20:54.460" class="transcript_line"> before. We have Matt and Judith coming this weekend. Matt&#039;s a great guy he&#039;s</div><div id="00:21:01.060" class="transcript_line"> very enthusiastic, he&#039;s also very tall and slim and he does everything that</div><div id="00:21:08.620" class="transcript_line"> the valley offers and he does it one after the other. So you&#039;ll see</div><div id="00:21:14.740" class="transcript_line"> him coming back from a fishing trip in his fishing gear which he strips off</div><div id="00:21:19.860" class="transcript_line"> gets into his cycling gear and then off he goes cycling. They come back and go</div><div id="00:21:24.380" class="transcript_line"> walking, they bring their telescope down and go out and examine the night sky.</div><div id="00:21:29.940" class="transcript_line"> They really do everything that the valley offers and as they do it one</div><div id="00:21:36.380" class="transcript_line"> thing after another with enormous enthusiasm. Were you going to offer</div><div id="00:21:42.060" class="transcript_line"> something there Maggie in terms of workiness? The cotton feet. Right, Maggie&#039;s</div><div id="00:21:51.660" class="transcript_line"> reminding me that each year we have a coffee morning in aid of the Bracken</div><div id="00:21:58.420" class="transcript_line"> Trust which takes place on the first Saturday of August each year. Yes, I see</div><div id="00:22:06.140" class="transcript_line"> the sign at the end of the bridge. That&#039;s right and it&#039;s a very successful event. We</div><div id="00:22:12.300" class="transcript_line"> opened up a garage which is also now my studio and we have coffees and teas on</div><div id="00:22:21.060" class="transcript_line"> offer in there and cake and then there&#039;s a we work. I should have</div><div id="00:22:28.900" class="transcript_line"> mentioned the garden and the fact that I initially began to lay out something of</div><div id="00:22:37.940" class="transcript_line"> a formal garden alongside the house but then got inspired by the idea of a</div><div id="00:22:45.580" class="transcript_line"> forest garden and we explored forest gardens and so the bulk of the garden is</div><div id="00:22:54.740" class="transcript_line"> laid out as a forest garden with the three layers of trees, shrubs and</div><div id="00:23:01.260" class="transcript_line"> herbage all fruit producing and food producing so that means that we have a</div><div id="00:23:09.940" class="transcript_line"> huge amount of fruit each year and each year through June and July mainly we</div><div id="00:23:18.500" class="transcript_line"> turn that into jam which we sell at our coffee morning. The activity I disturbed</div><div id="00:23:23.540" class="transcript_line"> you doing this morning. We actually produce I think last year we produced</div><div id="00:23:29.460" class="transcript_line"> something approaching 150 jars of jam for the coffee morning. We then go on to</div><div id="00:23:36.060" class="transcript_line"> produce more later on when the apples, pears and particularly the quinces come</div><div id="00:23:42.140" class="transcript_line"> out and then we buy in oranges in January for the marmalade so we produce a great</div><div id="00:23:50.780" class="transcript_line"> deal of fruit during the year and that&#039;s a major feature of the coffee morning</div><div id="00:23:57.140" class="transcript_line"> and one that attracts a lot of people to return to us each year to buy their</div><div id="00:24:02.460" class="transcript_line"> ration of jam for the year. And how did you get involved in the Bracken Trust?</div><div id="00:24:07.940" class="transcript_line"> Well Maggie had had cancer before we left the drovers in 2006 and had become</div><div id="00:24:18.740" class="transcript_line"> a client of the Bracken Trust and had been helped enormously by them so we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:24:27.140" class="transcript_line"> always been involved with the Bracken Trust. We&#039;ve done cooking for them. They</div><div id="00:24:31.700" class="transcript_line"> have a Tuesday lunch and for many years we cooked for that every now and again</div><div id="00:24:39.140" class="transcript_line"> and went took out the food in and served it. We also got involved in the</div><div id="00:24:45.620" class="transcript_line"> Bracken Singers who are a group of singers who are patients, volunteers and</div><div id="00:24:55.260" class="transcript_line"> family members of people that have been involved with cancer and we go around</div><div id="00:25:02.620" class="transcript_line"> singing and raising money for the trust. So the the garden party is an extension</div><div id="00:25:11.420" class="transcript_line"> the coffee morning is an extension of that and one which has been very</div><div id="00:25:15.860" class="transcript_line"> successful for us the last couple of years we&#039;ve raised just below a thousand</div><div id="00:25:21.300" class="transcript_line"> pounds from it in two hours which is really good going. We sell our jam and</div><div id="00:25:29.540" class="transcript_line"> our plants and because they are ours we&#039;re able to add gift aid onto that.</div><div id="00:25:36.780" class="transcript_line"> And then other Bracken Trust stalls sell cake, bric-a-brac, books and so</div><div id="00:25:47.900" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s always a raffle. So these are all raised money and I say over the</div><div id="00:25:56.460" class="transcript_line"> past two years we&#039;ve been very close to the thousand. Bitterly disappointed last</div><div id="00:26:01.020" class="transcript_line"> year that we didn&#039;t get over the thousand having made just below it the</div><div id="00:26:05.060" class="transcript_line"> year before but hopefully this year will be the year.</div><div id="00:26:08.940" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well well done on that. And you mentioned your arch as well. Tell me a little bit more about that.</div><div id="00:26:15.020" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s a difficult area for me to talk about because I was hoped I think</div><div id="00:26:20.220" class="transcript_line"> that when we retired I would commit myself fully to becoming a proper artist</div><div id="00:26:27.940" class="transcript_line"> in inverted commas. I&#039;ve never done that. The garden, my Quakerism and just things</div><div id="00:26:39.300" class="transcript_line"> like accounts and all this sort of stuff always prevent me from doing from</div><div id="00:26:43.900" class="transcript_line"> getting a hundred percent involvement so my paintings are very few and far between.</div><div id="00:26:48.580" class="transcript_line"> I was doing a monthly life drawing class which meant that at least I was</div><div id="00:26:57.300" class="transcript_line"> doing some drawing and I am part of the Aarhusly artists group and again that</div><div id="00:27:03.020" class="transcript_line"> pushes me towards painting at least once a month but I&#039;m afraid I put other</div><div id="00:27:11.780" class="transcript_line"> priorities ahead of that constantly and also my painting is always very</div><div id="00:27:19.220" class="transcript_line"> experimental and I move through all sorts of different styles and techniques</div><div id="00:27:25.020" class="transcript_line"> and as I explore trying to find my own sort of handwriting and my own purpose.</div><div id="00:27:32.860" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t stick to one particular medium? Not at all.</div><div id="00:27:36.140" class="transcript_line"> Exploratory art. That&#039;s wonderful. So you told me earlier that you&#039;re involved with</div><div id="00:27:46.900" class="transcript_line"> the Ellen Valley Social Club. Can you tell me a little bit more about that and how</div><div id="00:27:50.540" class="transcript_line"> you got involved with that? Well we&#039;re not terribly involved at this</div><div id="00:27:54.940" class="transcript_line"> moment but of course the the bonfire takes place right outside our house so</div><div id="00:28:00.380" class="transcript_line"> we have always been a supporter of that and provide the electricity for the</div><div id="00:28:05.220" class="transcript_line"> the burger tent which is directly outside our front fence. We have been in</div><div id="00:28:15.300" class="transcript_line"> the past, I was treasurer for a few years when we first came, but that again</div><div id="00:28:22.220" class="transcript_line"> provided yet another reason why I shouldn&#039;t be doing art or anything else</div><div id="00:28:27.860" class="transcript_line"> and so I was quite glad to unload that after a few years. We also got</div><div id="00:28:35.780" class="transcript_line"> involved in some of the trips away largely from our point of</div><div id="00:28:42.180" class="transcript_line"> view that we felt that if by buying a ticket we enabled the thing to happen</div><div id="00:28:48.180" class="transcript_line"> then it was worthwhile doing it but we were always rather hoping I think that</div><div id="00:28:58.220" class="transcript_line"> we would get the message back that it&#039;s oversold and we could then not</div><div id="00:29:04.020" class="transcript_line"> necessarily go on the trip itself but just help to fund. So again that&#039;s</div><div id="00:29:10.180" class="transcript_line"> something that we haven&#039;t done much of recently. I think it&#039;s amazing that</div><div id="00:29:16.780" class="transcript_line"> there is a social club which is so active and does pull together all the</div><div id="00:29:23.660" class="transcript_line"> farmers and the residents of the village within the two valleys and I</div><div id="00:29:28.380" class="transcript_line"> think it&#039;s brilliant that that happens.</div><div id="00:29:34.580" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned about the bonfire that the social club holds. How many people come</div><div id="00:29:40.660" class="transcript_line"> to that? Well it&#039;s got to be in excess of a thousand. It&#039;s an amazing event. It is</div><div id="00:29:47.820" class="transcript_line"> quite the best bonfire within the area so people come from Bills, Raird, Llandridnod</div><div id="00:29:54.500" class="transcript_line"> to see it and probably Llandridnod as well and it really attracts huge crowds.</div><div id="00:30:03.700" class="transcript_line"> The social club have throughout the years done a very good job of making</div><div id="00:30:10.180" class="transcript_line"> sure that everyone is trained up in health and safety and that the event is</div><div id="00:30:15.540" class="transcript_line"> safe for all those who participate either as watchers or as workers. St. John&#039;s</div><div id="00:30:23.140" class="transcript_line"> ambulance are brilliant in that they come and stand by in case of any injury</div><div id="00:30:28.540" class="transcript_line"> and as far as I know have never been called upon. So it shows how safe the</div><div id="00:30:36.940" class="transcript_line"> whole thing is but it involves huge amount of preparation with two Sundays</div><div id="00:30:44.260" class="transcript_line"> beforehand of wood collection and the building of the bonfire and the</div><div id="00:30:50.980" class="transcript_line"> preparation of the firework igniting site and then on the day the actual</div><div id="00:30:58.420" class="transcript_line"> firing off of both the bonfire and then the fireworks themselves. And have you</div><div id="00:31:04.260" class="transcript_line"> gone with the modern trend to hold it either the weekend before? No we&#039;ve always</div><div id="00:31:09.180" class="transcript_line"> stuck with the 5th and I think that&#039;s one of the things that makes it good the</div><div id="00:31:16.340" class="transcript_line"> fact that everyone knows it&#039;s going to be on the 5th. Of course that does mean</div><div id="00:31:20.700" class="transcript_line"> that sometimes we hold it in pouring rain and sometimes on a lovely clear</div><div id="00:31:27.060" class="transcript_line"> night everyone can really enjoy it. Yes. Since Ellon Valley got its dark sky</div><div id="00:31:34.220" class="transcript_line"> status have you been further up, you know, sort of any on any of the events that they&#039;ve</div><div id="00:31:39.500" class="transcript_line"> held? We haven&#039;t been involved in the events but we always encourage our</div><div id="00:31:43.100" class="transcript_line"> visitors to really appreciate the sky because you can only appreciate</div><div id="00:31:50.140" class="transcript_line"> the night sky when the clouds allow it. Yes. We do seem to have a huge</div><div id="00:31:58.980" class="transcript_line"> amount of cloud here but quite often when there is a clear night our</div><div id="00:32:05.820" class="transcript_line"> visitors go out and photograph it and one in particular who I&#039;ve already</div><div id="00:32:11.580" class="transcript_line"> mentioned comes in with his telescope. I think people from here have</div><div id="00:32:19.700" class="transcript_line"> gone out with their telescopes up onto the hill on the way out to Pantadour</div><div id="00:32:24.180" class="transcript_line"> and also of course up the valley and it seems to be that most of the</div><div id="00:32:30.980" class="transcript_line"> photographs seem to feature the Lavoieuil Tower so that seems to be a very popular</div><div id="00:32:36.420" class="transcript_line"> place. I suppose with your visitors you get to see their photographs after living out for the day so it&#039;s like rediscovering the valley all over again. That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:32:48.260" class="transcript_line"> There must be some wonderful shots that you&#039;ve seen. Have you recall any other major changes in the valley over the 10-15 years you&#039;ve been here?</div><div id="00:32:58.500" class="transcript_line"> Well it has changed enormously I think in that 10 years. The visitor centre has changed tremendously.</div><div id="00:33:09.260" class="transcript_line"> Of course when we first came they closed on the Sunday before the 5th of November so the end of October</div><div id="00:33:20.260" class="transcript_line"> and then didn&#039;t reopen until birthday the Easter of the following year.</div><div id="00:33:26.260" class="transcript_line"> So that change made a lot of difference. I think now people have really appreciated the new tea rooms at Pennebont</div><div id="00:33:41.260" class="transcript_line"> and our visitors are going to that very regularly. We also mentioned to them the new cafe at Raiders of the Lost Ark and they&#039;ve appreciated that one as well.</div><div id="00:33:55.260" class="transcript_line"> So those are things that people are certainly very appreciative of. I&#039;m very hopeful for the increased amount of interpretation that&#039;s coming into the valley now.</div><div id="00:34:08.260" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s greatly appreciated. I&#039;ve always wished and hoped that the suspension bridge might feature in the interpretation and the development of the valley.</div><div id="00:34:30.260" class="transcript_line"> It always seemed to me that it would be sensible to utilise the Bailey Bridge only for motor traffic and to use a restored suspension bridge.</div><div id="00:34:47.260" class="transcript_line"> Not only as a thing of great beauty and something which really fits the valley incredibly well but that it could become the cycle and pedestrian crossing of the river.</div><div id="00:35:01.260" class="transcript_line"> We find as we turn onto the bridge as we drive home that quite often you are faced with a family right across the bridge, toddlers, dogs, prams who are totally amazed by the fact that there is a car approaching them.</div><div id="00:35:21.260" class="transcript_line"> As far as they&#039;re concerned they are walking in parkland and they don&#039;t expect to have traffic. That&#039;s something that I would have loved to have seen. I&#039;m saddened by the fact that it wasn&#039;t involved in the planning.</div><div id="00:35:38.260" class="transcript_line"> My understanding is that it was put in the original project plan for the Allen Lynx project as one of their things to do. Unfortunately the cost of repairing that bridge is too much.</div><div id="00:35:51.260" class="transcript_line"> They had to take it out. People do keep asking about this.</div><div id="00:35:58.260" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s such a beautiful thing and it&#039;s so much a part of the history of the valley.</div><div id="00:36:05.260" class="transcript_line"> As of course our little pedestrian bridges. That was able to be restored wonderfully by the Army who did it I think from memory over a weekend.</div><div id="00:36:22.260" class="transcript_line"> I mean that&#039;s a much simpler operation but they did an incredibly good job of it.</div><div id="00:36:28.260" class="transcript_line"> When was that done?</div><div id="00:36:30.260" class="transcript_line"> I think about two years ago but I&#039;m going from memory.</div><div id="00:36:34.260" class="transcript_line"> That was originally put in because the original village, the wooden village, was dry with no alcohol allowed which was very sensible for the time.</div><div id="00:36:52.260" class="transcript_line"> But then the Allen Valley Hotel was developed seeing the potential and the bridge was put in as a way of getting to the hotel.</div><div id="00:37:05.260" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s used to a tremendous extent by people who really appreciate being able to cross the river and stand and look at the river.</div><div id="00:37:16.260" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s a lovely spot.</div><div id="00:37:18.260" class="transcript_line"> It is a delightful spot. You can sometimes, very occasionally, see a kingfisher flashing by.</div><div id="00:37:25.260" class="transcript_line"> We do get a gusander. We had a gusander. Gusanders of course nest in woodland.</div><div id="00:37:37.260" class="transcript_line"> So they actually nest up in the Cairn Gaffa woods.</div><div id="00:37:41.260" class="transcript_line"> And then at some point in the spring, Mother Hen gathers up her brood of something like nine chicks and starts marching them off towards the river.</div><div id="00:37:55.260" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d actually march through the garden of number ten.</div><div id="00:37:59.260" class="transcript_line"> And this caused great interest and the interest rather frightened the hen.</div><div id="00:38:08.260" class="transcript_line"> So she took off and flew right around the house, i.e. both houses, picked up her brood by approaching from the other side and then continued marching them off to the river.</div><div id="00:38:22.260" class="transcript_line"> She then hides them very successfully in the undergrowth at the side of the river and they grow up there.</div><div id="00:38:33.260" class="transcript_line"> And we had heard in earlier years of gusanders being seen on the river.</div><div id="00:38:39.260" class="transcript_line"> This was wonderful to see her marching her brood through the garden. That was incredible.</div><div id="00:38:45.260" class="transcript_line"> And what are the birdlife dippers?</div><div id="00:38:47.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we have one couple who can only be described as twitchers.</div><div id="00:38:52.260" class="transcript_line"> There is no other word to describe them.</div><div id="00:38:55.260" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re a delightful couple who come from Norfolk and spend their whole year going from one bird reserve to another.</div><div id="00:39:02.260" class="transcript_line"> And Cairn Gaffa is one of those that they visit and then use us as a base to get over to Machanlleth and the big reserve over there.</div><div id="00:39:15.260" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s here, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:39:17.260" class="transcript_line"> And they record in excess of 50 species each time they come.</div><div id="00:39:24.260" class="transcript_line"> Gosh. We need to talk to them about what they&#039;ve recorded. That would be good.</div><div id="00:39:29.260" class="transcript_line"> And strangely enough, every year they seem to fail to find either a dipper or a tree creeper.</div><div id="00:39:38.260" class="transcript_line"> And yet they&#039;re things that are fairly easy to find.</div><div id="00:39:42.260" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m always surprised that they have that difficulty, but they have that difficulty almost every year.</div><div id="00:39:47.260" class="transcript_line"> Obviously the dippers and the tree creepers know they&#039;re coming.</div><div id="00:39:51.260" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think they must do. But I think if they had those two as well, they would be pushing up towards the 60.</div><div id="00:39:57.260" class="transcript_line"> So what do you think the future holds for the valley? Where do you think it will be?</div><div id="00:40:04.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s going to become much more popular.</div><div id="00:40:07.260" class="transcript_line"> Even more people coming to walk around it and to appreciate it, which probably means a lot more car traffic and car parking,</div><div id="00:40:18.260" class="transcript_line"> which conceivably could become problems that would have to be addressed.</div><div id="00:40:24.260" class="transcript_line"> I think, by the way, that one thing that would be a great help would be we&#039;ve used this plastic stuff.</div><div id="00:40:32.260" class="transcript_line"> Up at the top of the garden where we have a flint on our drive.</div><div id="00:40:40.260" class="transcript_line"> And to allow wheelchairs and other wheeled vehicles, wheeled things to use the gravel, we put these plastic beds in,</div><div id="00:40:55.260" class="transcript_line"> which you can then fill with gravel or allow grass to grass over.</div><div id="00:41:01.260" class="transcript_line"> And I think the side of the road in the village is going to have to be treated in that way because of the amount of parking that&#039;s now taking place.</div><div id="00:41:15.260" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the Ellen Lynx parking is usually anything up to a dozen cars.</div><div id="00:41:22.260" class="transcript_line"> And then you can have another dozen further down by the toilets of temporary visitors.</div><div id="00:41:30.260" class="transcript_line"> And temporary visitors are tending now to park further and further up this end.</div><div id="00:41:36.260" class="transcript_line"> So I think that is something which needs to be addressed in a way that is commensurate with the feel of the village.</div><div id="00:41:46.260" class="transcript_line"> So it doesn&#039;t change the feel of the village.</div><div id="00:41:49.260" class="transcript_line"> And I think that sort of plastic bedding would be a way of doing that.</div><div id="00:41:54.260" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s one of the difficulties, isn&#039;t it, in modern life? Everybody drives to get to where they want.</div><div id="00:42:00.260" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:01.260" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for that, Peter. It&#039;s been fascinating talking to you.</div><div id="00:42:04.260" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m most, most grateful for your time.</div><div id="00:42:07.260" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
