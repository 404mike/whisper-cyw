    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Right then. The interviewer is Catherine McShane and this is an interview for the Cardiff Carnival</div><div id="00:00:14.800" class="transcript_line"> 25th Anniversary Heritage Project. I&#039;m here with Jude Thilburn Price and it&#039;s the 15th</div><div id="00:00:23.400" class="transcript_line"> of October 2014. Could you spell your name just for the recording? All of it? Yes please.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Jude, J-U-D-E, Thilburn, T-H-O-B-U-R-N hyphen Price, P-R-I-C-E. Great, thank you. And we&#039;re</div><div id="00:00:43.080" class="transcript_line"> in Trowbridge in Cardiff. That&#039;s right. And so, I&#039;d just like to ask you, how did you</div><div id="00:00:50.360" class="transcript_line"> get involved in Cardiff Carnival? I used to get involved a long time ago when it used to be the</div><div id="00:00:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Lord Murs Parade. They used to be going on in Cardiff. I used to go with my nan to the church</div><div id="00:01:05.160" class="transcript_line"> halls and they&#039;d be working for ages. It seemed making different things. The lorries would turn</div><div id="00:01:11.320" class="transcript_line"> up on Friday and everyone would start decorating the lorries for the float. So, my involvement</div><div id="00:01:21.880" class="transcript_line"> with the parade through Cardiff has been a lifelong thing. I didn&#039;t do anything for a long time</div><div id="00:01:28.200" class="transcript_line"> and I dragged Ray down one year to see Dragon down by the Millennium Centre and he was at a</div><div id="00:01:39.800" class="transcript_line"> night show which he was quite taken with. I said to him, do you fancy having a go next year</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> for Carnival? And he said, we&#039;d give it a go. So, we&#039;d come down for the launch night</div><div id="00:01:54.360" class="transcript_line"> and from there then we got involved with it. And that&#039;s how we came to do it. It was something</div><div id="00:02:05.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d always wanted to do but I&#039;d never quite got round to getting to Carnival Camp because I&#039;d</div><div id="00:02:11.400" class="transcript_line"> always been working. But when I retired, got retired from work, then obviously I had time to come and</div><div id="00:02:18.040" class="transcript_line"> have a dabble. So, we brought our large puppet making skills with us. So, you started with making</div><div id="00:02:28.120" class="transcript_line"> large puppets? Well, I&#039;d always made puppets and big structures and costumes and animation and done</div><div id="00:02:38.760" class="transcript_line"> film and performance. So, we brought with us the skills, if you like, for making big puppets and</div><div id="00:02:45.320" class="transcript_line"> that was the year that we had Queen Elizabeth to do and a lot of the other big wings, big structures</div><div id="00:02:55.640" class="transcript_line"> as well. So, that was quite an interesting experience. Interesting in what way? Well, we</div><div id="00:03:03.560" class="transcript_line"> went for the one week&#039;s, we signed up to do the one week&#039;s training but unfortunately the people</div><div id="00:03:10.200" class="transcript_line"> that were teaching it could only stay for the week. And we had a bit of a list of to-dos then</div><div id="00:03:17.960" class="transcript_line"> for the following two weeks to make sure that everything was made and constructed</div><div id="00:03:24.040" class="transcript_line"> for dressing so that it could go out for Carnival. So, we spent another two weeks</div><div id="00:03:31.560" class="transcript_line"> full-time really down there to make everything we needed to go for the day. Otherwise people</div><div id="00:03:38.920" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t have had stuff to wear and to do anything with. So, what were they made out of? Mostly</div><div id="00:03:46.680" class="transcript_line"> aluminium, fibre pole, what else? All different fabrics were put on them.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Some latexing was done for unscrimming for hands and large faces.</div><div id="00:04:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I did quite enjoy making all the big hands. They were quite nice to see them all sort of</div><div id="00:04:11.720" class="transcript_line"> stood on the desk. These like five times hands drying out everywhere. They were quite good and</div><div id="00:04:19.480" class="transcript_line"> spraying them out on the sticks was a laugh. Rigging it all up was quite good though. I did</div><div id="00:04:24.680" class="transcript_line"> enjoy rigging them all up and seeing everything moving on the day was a nice thing to see.</div><div id="00:04:33.240" class="transcript_line"> So, how many have you done since then? Let&#039;s see,</div><div id="00:04:37.240" class="transcript_line"> four. I think we&#039;ve done four since then. So, different things each year.</div><div id="00:04:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Have you got a favourite?</div><div id="00:04:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I quite like this year&#039;s when we were all different puppets, when we weren&#039;t big structures</div><div id="00:04:58.840" class="transcript_line"> to wear through. I was mostly down to my health that I wasn&#039;t like 10 to 15 foot tall</div><div id="00:05:05.800" class="transcript_line"> to manoeuvre things about. But we had nice big heads this year and the baby came and she was a</div><div id="00:05:13.640" class="transcript_line"> sausage so we did a punch and duty set loosely based on the muppets. But the kids enjoyed it so</div><div id="00:05:21.160" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s all that mattered. Only the thing was it was raining all the way round and the costumes</div><div id="00:05:26.040" class="transcript_line"> were getting heavier and heavier as they absorbed the water. It&#039;s part of the thing. The other</div><div id="00:05:34.600" class="transcript_line"> ones we&#039;ve been rained on quite a few times. But I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s one of those things. You&#039;ve</div><div id="00:05:42.120" class="transcript_line"> worked so hard for the time leading up to it. It&#039;s the finale, isn&#039;t it? If it rains, it rains</div><div id="00:05:50.440" class="transcript_line"> you get wet. So, it&#039;d be a shame not to take it all out after you&#039;ve spent months working on something.</div><div id="00:05:58.600" class="transcript_line"> So, you spend months on it rather than the three weeks?</div><div id="00:06:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ve spent like a long time making what we make to go out.</div><div id="00:06:10.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, we&#039;ll start planning what to make for next year now.</div><div id="00:06:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Any ideas?</div><div id="00:06:17.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, I do quite like Day of the Dead and I do quite like the big cat arenas. The skeleton&#039;s a</div><div id="00:06:24.440" class="transcript_line"> little dressed with the big hats. I&#039;ve had a couple of people say they&#039;re interested in</div><div id="00:06:31.320" class="transcript_line"> being a section with those so that&#039;s one possibility. I can&#039;t think, I did think of</div><div id="00:06:39.080" class="transcript_line"> something else. I can&#039;t think of what it was now but it&#039;ll probably change a couple of times by then</div><div id="00:06:43.480" class="transcript_line"> anyway. So, is it the making part of Carnival that you&#039;re most interested in or is it the</div><div id="00:06:53.400" class="transcript_line"> performing? I enjoy the making although I don&#039;t say I relish it while I&#039;m sat up at two and three</div><div id="00:07:00.040" class="transcript_line"> o&#039;clock in the morning sewing or sticking and gluing and you can&#039;t get through the house because</div><div id="00:07:04.760" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s full of bits of puppet and structure and stuff like that. So, that can be a bit of a nightmare.</div><div id="00:07:13.080" class="transcript_line"> I do enjoy taking them out and performing them because it&#039;s the only way to see how things work</div><div id="00:07:18.600" class="transcript_line"> and make notes for future builds and stuff like that. So, it&#039;s always good to perform something</div><div id="00:07:25.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve made as a prop maker because you get to see how it functions then because a lot of the time</div><div id="00:07:34.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very rare you&#039;ll make the same thing twice. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever made the same thing twice</div><div id="00:07:40.600" class="transcript_line"> in all my life. So, it&#039;s always like you might use different ways of then constructing the inside</div><div id="00:07:48.600" class="transcript_line"> for next year but the actual outside of whatever it&#039;s going to be might be completely different</div><div id="00:07:54.520" class="transcript_line"> but you sort of change how you rig something up maybe by being able to wear it. So, it gives</div><div id="00:08:03.240" class="transcript_line"> you a lot of insight from the performer&#039;s point of view that you then use like when we&#039;re commissioned</div><div id="00:08:09.480" class="transcript_line"> to do work for other people. So, it&#039;s always good to try your stuff.</div><div id="00:08:18.280" class="transcript_line"> And obviously you&#039;ve performed in the rain. Yeah, quite a few number of times.</div><div id="00:08:25.880" class="transcript_line"> And you mentioned the little ones. Yeah, well they like, my grandchildren like doing it.</div><div id="00:08:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Um, Reese came about three years ago. He wanted to be an electric eel. I don&#039;t know why,</div><div id="00:08:40.280" class="transcript_line"> just one of those things the little boys wanted to be. Ellie was a mermaid. That year we made the</div><div id="00:08:46.440" class="transcript_line"> smallest car in the floating the world which was basically a cut down supermarket trolley,</div><div id="00:08:52.040" class="transcript_line"> no names mentioned, and a car seat so because she can&#039;t walk very fast so we made a little</div><div id="00:08:58.520" class="transcript_line"> trolley that we towed on the back of our disability scooter with the giant mermaid on.</div><div id="00:09:06.600" class="transcript_line"> So, that was their first carnival and even though it did rain a bit on them they did like it so they</div><div id="00:09:12.200" class="transcript_line"> they wanted to do it since. So, I can&#039;t remember what they were last year but this year they were</div><div id="00:09:21.400" class="transcript_line"> Ellie wanted to be the dog from the Muppet so we made a wolf head and</div><div id="00:09:27.800" class="transcript_line"> bodysuit and Reese was Kermit the Frog done as the crocodile from the Punch and Judy.</div><div id="00:09:35.320" class="transcript_line"> We went as Waldorf and Statler Punch and Judy and little Abby she&#039;s only four she wanted to be a</div><div id="00:09:41.640" class="transcript_line"> sausage so we made her. Yeah, you know, but it gives you a chance so you can be anything you like</div><div id="00:09:47.720" class="transcript_line"> really, as long as you&#039;ve got glitter on it. It&#039;s a goer. But yeah, we&#039;re looking at wheels and stuff</div><div id="00:09:55.240" class="transcript_line"> for next year just in case we want to go large again but depends on my health like</div><div id="00:10:02.920" class="transcript_line"> so whether we can actually manage to perform large structures now I might have to scale them down to</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> like eight foot. That&#039;s still big. Yes, it&#039;s not as big as like you know the others but yeah maybe</div><div id="00:10:16.920" class="transcript_line"> scale things down to our eight foot for next year and see what we come up with.</div><div id="00:10:24.120" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, see what the kids want to be and work from there and work from there up. Yeah, you</div><div id="00:10:30.360" class="transcript_line"> normally get like two potato drawings with some arms and legs in unusual places with their</div><div id="00:10:36.520" class="transcript_line"> description of what they want to be and then you have to like you know work from that.</div><div id="00:10:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, is it a challenge? Yeah, it is a bit but it&#039;s always worth seeing their faces when you&#039;ve made</div><div id="00:10:47.160" class="transcript_line"> their costumes and all their stuff and they&#039;ve been trying them on as you&#039;ve been making them</div><div id="00:10:51.720" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve been in and out the conservatories was sewing and sticking and gluing and what have you</div><div id="00:10:57.400" class="transcript_line"> and the little it&#039;s like Christmas morning you know when their costumes made and they&#039;ve got it on</div><div id="00:11:04.200" class="transcript_line"> so they do like they do like doing it and sometimes if they&#039;ve seen their friends as</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re going around they give them a little wave although this year they was too busy getting</div><div id="00:11:13.400" class="transcript_line"> drowned. I think this year was the worst weather we&#039;ve experienced. The other the other years it&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:22.200" class="transcript_line"> rained before we&#039;ve gone out and it&#039;s been all right you know as we&#039;ve done going around but</div><div id="00:11:29.560" class="transcript_line"> god it was wet this year. Yeah carnival in Wales. And as we had a bit of foam and sponge and stuff</div><div id="00:11:39.480" class="transcript_line"> used in our costumes we were just soaking the water up all the way round. It took three weeks</div><div id="00:11:45.960" class="transcript_line"> to dry off with the dehumidifier in the conservatory. The heads and I can put them away now.</div><div id="00:11:53.160" class="transcript_line"> It took three weeks to dry the foam out. There we go memories.</div><div id="00:12:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there any other memorable moments from your carnivals over the last few years?</div><div id="00:12:08.600" class="transcript_line"> When we were when we were making Queen Elizabeth to go out the other year</div><div id="00:12:13.720" class="transcript_line"> a couple years ago Ray had to be Queen Elizabeth because it was quite a heavy structure to</div><div id="00:12:20.360" class="transcript_line"> um to wear and for the time of going out like you got the time of the lineup so that&#039;s about</div><div id="00:12:28.920" class="transcript_line"> an hour you stood in it then you got your like walk around plus the little stops used to be so</div><div id="00:12:34.360" class="transcript_line"> you used to have to be work out that you were in for about two and a half to three hours.</div><div id="00:12:38.920" class="transcript_line"> It was such a heavy structure Ray had to do that one but when we went out the back of the channel</div><div id="00:12:45.160" class="transcript_line"> view to have a look at it and test it for blowing over and stuff like that see how stable it was.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We noticed Caroline, Sian and I that his trainers didn&#039;t match his dress so we had to go looking</div><div id="00:12:58.600" class="transcript_line"> for a pair of beige trainers then that would match his frock for carnival day because they</div><div id="00:13:05.960" class="transcript_line"> just clashed with the ones he had so he had a new pair of trainers out of that and he&#039;d done quite</div><div id="00:13:11.800" class="transcript_line"> well this year he had a new pair to go with his Punch and Duty striped trousers and a new pair</div><div id="00:13:17.240" class="transcript_line"> of blue trainers so obviously Ray gets a new pair of trainers every time we go out and do carnival</div><div id="00:13:27.080" class="transcript_line"> so yeah that was that was quite good um the feeling of relief when I took that</div><div id="00:13:32.040" class="transcript_line"> costume off that that huge structure yeah that was worth it I couldn&#039;t walk for days after then</div><div id="00:13:39.800" class="transcript_line"> and the bruises bruises were horrific from carrying such large packs but um it was worth it</div><div id="00:13:48.120" class="transcript_line"> you came back for more yeah it was worth it though because when you go up and you sneak behind people</div><div id="00:13:53.240" class="transcript_line"> when you got big hands and then you put your hand around them and people like to have their photos</div><div id="00:13:58.520" class="transcript_line"> taken with you so you go stand you stand in the photo so you&#039;re huge and they just like lots of</div><div id="00:14:04.920" class="transcript_line"> people uh want to come up and have a photo taken so you&#039;ve got to catch up to where you were then</div><div id="00:14:10.600" class="transcript_line"> you know in the in the line on the line somewhere so you&#039;ve lost your place because you&#039;ve stopped</div><div id="00:14:15.480" class="transcript_line"> so many times for people to have their photos done I know Ray like scared in the crowd with</div><div id="00:14:21.560" class="transcript_line"> his big hands and stuff so yeah it&#039;s a good laugh I prefer to perform them and they do something</div><div id="00:14:29.160" class="transcript_line"> than just walk about doing nothing with them you know they got to have a little life with their own</div><div id="00:14:35.960" class="transcript_line"> wallet out is uh is best yeah something to play with yeah and it&#039;s a bit more interactive for</div><div id="00:14:45.080" class="transcript_line"> the crowd there and they seem to appreciate it you know when you give them a poke with a big arm</div><div id="00:14:49.880" class="transcript_line"> or something always makes them laugh makes a couple shriek yeah but yeah makes a lot of kids</div><div id="00:14:56.760" class="transcript_line"> cry when they see oh I don&#039;t like the big heads so yeah it&#039;s a laugh so yeah being as Reese and</div><div id="00:15:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Ellie are bigger now we might get them to wear a big puppet well would be a big puppet for them so</div><div id="00:15:10.040" class="transcript_line"> it might be about five foot but it&#039;s still in relation to their size quite uh big</div><div id="00:15:18.680" class="transcript_line"> because Reese&#039;s uh then backpack puppets now for a couple of years so he&#039;s uh</div><div id="00:15:23.640" class="transcript_line"> uh you can take a bigger structure this year after giving me his wheat a bit so</div><div id="00:15:30.600" class="transcript_line"> but uh yeah they enjoy you know so it&#039;s worth doing for that</div><div id="00:15:37.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s nice to go down carnival camp as well and see your everyone down there um and chat to them</div><div id="00:15:44.200" class="transcript_line"> and see what they&#039;re making we help a lot of people make their structures help them with um</div><div id="00:15:50.280" class="transcript_line"> um all the mechanics of things uh their structure um problem solving with them so that&#039;s you know</div><div id="00:16:00.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s always nice to see everyone&#039;s stuff finished and out out and about and knowing like all the</div><div id="00:16:06.760" class="transcript_line"> blood sweat and tears are going into making things uh but yeah it&#039;s a nice it&#039;s a nice day out</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> um apart from the rain of course but can&#039;t can&#039;t have everything can you so yeah</div><div id="00:16:26.120" class="transcript_line"> oh thank you very much oh thank you for having us over</div></div></p>
