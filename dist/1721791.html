over that.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had a good sleep then, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I liked it.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was happy days, because they always played with us.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You either played cards, which was snap or whatever,</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> you played cards, you played drives, snakes and ladders.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a radio?</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was about that big, a bit on the front.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That went years ago, though.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was his master&#039;s voice, if I can remember.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The radio was called.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to be quiet.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They always listened to the arches.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So don&#039;t ask me what time that was on.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Seven o&#039;clock, normally.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you had to be quiet.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you could listen to anything.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, my father used to do rabbits on the wall with the candlelight, you know.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Somehow, and you&#039;d have shadows on the wall.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Shadow puppets.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d do it with his hands.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So somehow, you know, I can remember that now.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What was his name?</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> John.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> John.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> John Johnson?</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, John Hale.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a Hale.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Hale H?</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> A-L-E.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> A-L-E.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And your mother&#039;s name?</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Ruby Victoria.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a nice name.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad was John Valentine, because he was born on the 14th of February.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mam was Ruby Victoria.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So where was your father from?</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Redwick.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He was from Redwick?</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He avenged the, yes, from Redwick, my father was from.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He was born in Redwick Brick House, Parkes is Brick House, the big house.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> He was born there.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And he buried in Redwick, my mother and my two brothers, you know, over there.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Redwick.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said I&#039;m going to Redwick.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I know I was born here.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Was your mother from Redwick?</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What brought them here then, Caz?</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, well, we didn&#039;t own, well they didn&#039;t own it then.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> My gran and grandpa retired from Brick House in Redwick, and they came to live at Fair</div><div id="00:11:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Orchard Farm, Nash.</div><div id="00:11:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, Dad had got married then, and he&#039;d gone out to Lentarnham to live, the other side</div><div id="00:11:12.320" class="transcript_line"> of Newport.</div><div id="00:11:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:14.320" class="transcript_line"> Dad and Mam.</div><div id="00:11:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Then, Uncle, who were never married, he moved down to the farm on Pycorna, right by the</div><div id="00:11:25.080" class="transcript_line"> drainage board, the one on the straight road, not Pycorna Farm, there&#039;s one on the side,</div><div id="00:11:31.120" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t I, just go by that there.</div><div id="00:11:33.120" class="transcript_line"> He moved down there, but not to live with his mum and dad, he moved there on his own.</div><div id="00:11:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Well then, my gran and grandpa, who I never knew any of my grandparents, and I decided</div><div id="00:11:45.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d died before I was born, they, she wasn&#039;t very well, and Dad only had one sister, and</div><div id="00:11:55.920" class="transcript_line"> she lived up us, and got married and went to us to live, and went very well.</div><div id="00:12:01.600" class="transcript_line"> So, things along the line, Dad and Mam, and two children, came back, yes, Bill and I was</div><div id="00:12:10.600" class="transcript_line"> born here, came back from Lentarnham to live with Uncle, not with the mother and father,</div><div id="00:12:19.600" class="transcript_line"> to look after, or be near to his father, like you know, my grandfather, and they nursed</div><div id="00:12:28.440" class="transcript_line"> them at home, the two of them there, and then they didn&#039;t want to go to live in Fair Orchard,</div><div id="00:12:36.440" class="transcript_line"> well there was two others, and I suppose perhaps paying somebody out or something, but the</div><div id="00:12:41.440" class="transcript_line"> oldest brother bought it, and he moved there.</div><div id="00:12:44.440" class="transcript_line"> Well then this farm came up, and Uncle and Dad sort of merged together, and they said</div><div id="00:12:51.440" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d rent this farm, and they moved here.</div><div id="00:12:55.280" class="transcript_line"> Well then Bill was born here, and I was born here.</div><div id="00:12:58.280" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve been here all your life?</div><div id="00:13:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, in the room up above this one.</div><div id="00:13:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Really, you were actually born in the house?</div><div id="00:13:04.280" class="transcript_line"> In the house, and I moved down the land in a bit, and I&#039;m looking over the back now,</div><div id="00:13:11.280" class="transcript_line"> you know.</div><div id="00:13:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:13:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was actually born here.</div><div id="00:13:15.280" class="transcript_line"> So did your mother, was there a local midwife?</div><div id="00:13:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, she lived on the top road where you would have come down, Broad Street Common, Nurse</div><div id="00:13:22.280" class="transcript_line"> Adams.</div><div id="00:13:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Nurse Adams?</div><div id="00:13:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:13:27.120" class="transcript_line"> Nurse Adams.</div><div id="00:13:28.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where she lived, very nice lady, she was there quite a long while after.</div><div id="00:13:34.120" class="transcript_line"> So do you think she was midwife to lots of babies born around here?</div><div id="00:13:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, she was midwife.</div><div id="00:13:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:13:45.120" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of farm was it?</div><div id="00:13:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it large dog, or?</div><div id="00:13:48.960" class="transcript_line"> It was cows and calves, and Dad used to do a bit of dealing as well, he&#039;d go to Gloucester</div><div id="00:13:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Market, and buy milk and cows and sell them to the other dairy farmers.</div><div id="00:14:02.960" class="transcript_line"> He dealt a bit.</div><div id="00:14:03.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:14:04.960" class="transcript_line"> And Uncle didn&#039;t, no Uncle stayed home here, you know, you&#039;re sure.</div><div id="00:14:09.960" class="transcript_line"> I think we had nothing, do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:14:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:14.960" class="transcript_line"> But we were happy.</div><div id="00:14:16.800" class="transcript_line"> There was happy times where, how can I put it, well there was always somebody coming</div><div id="00:14:21.200" class="transcript_line"> in.</div><div id="00:14:22.200" class="transcript_line"> You seem happy.</div><div id="00:14:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:24.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:25.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was always, and now, like Dennis, he&#039;s come down now, he knows where everything</div><div id="00:14:29.200" class="transcript_line"> is.</div><div id="00:14:30.200" class="transcript_line"> So as a child, did you have to work on the farm?</div><div id="00:14:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a day job?</div><div id="00:14:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I did when I was 70, well, that was the scenario, I got through to grammar school when I was</div><div id="00:14:44.440" class="transcript_line"> 77, I passed my exam and I went to Chepstow, Larkfield on the hill at Chepstow, but because</div><div id="00:14:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I was this side of the pond, if we did, in our yard where you&#039;ve pulled in, if I&#039;d have</div><div id="00:14:58.360" class="transcript_line"> been the other side of the pond, I&#039;d have only had a canterbeze lick.</div><div id="00:15:02.240" class="transcript_line"> But because of this side of the pond, then I missed out on quite a few things, because</div><div id="00:15:09.200" class="transcript_line"> in those days, you used to be able to belong to the netball team after school, after activities,</div><div id="00:15:15.820" class="transcript_line"> you could never stay behind, because we didn&#039;t have a car at that stage.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you get to school?</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, it used to be, Mr Jones used to take us to school, and he used to also haul</div><div id="00:15:27.680" class="transcript_line"> cars into market in a van, quite a big van.</div><div id="00:15:31.400" class="transcript_line"> Well on a Wednesday, if he didn&#039;t have time to sweep out, he&#039;d put the benches in, back</div><div id="00:15:35.840" class="transcript_line"> in for us and we got in the van.</div><div id="00:15:39.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s fantastic!</div><div id="00:15:40.720" class="transcript_line"> We had a lovely time, and then his son took over, and his son used to pick us up in the</div><div id="00:15:47.040" class="transcript_line"> mornings, I used to have to be on the, because we had to catch the bus on Crosshands in Newport</div><div id="00:15:53.240" class="transcript_line"> now, we had to catch that bus, the quarter past eight bus at the Crosshands, so picking</div><div id="00:16:02.800" class="transcript_line"> up around here, I had to be on the top road by seven o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:16:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t get home at night, until the quarter past four from there, and then he</div><div id="00:16:13.880" class="transcript_line"> used to have to pick us up and bring us and deliver us all around like at night.</div><div id="00:16:19.720" class="transcript_line"> I used to come in the house year at the earliest, about quarter to six, six o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:16:24.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a long day.</div><div id="00:16:25.560" class="transcript_line"> It was a long day, but the Edmaster was ever so good to us, because we used to do our own</div><div id="00:16:30.160" class="transcript_line"> work on the bus.</div><div id="00:16:32.120" class="transcript_line"> There was only nine of us, nine of us wanted on the, he picked up, from Nashwich, yeah,</div><div id="00:16:39.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean we do our own work on the bus, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:16:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And if one had it wrong, we all had it wrong.</div><div id="00:16:48.600" class="transcript_line"> But he was marvellous, Colonel Webb he was, his name was.</div><div id="00:16:52.520" class="transcript_line"> Colonel Webb?</div><div id="00:16:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the Edmaster, and the first time he had us up outside of his door for copying,</div><div id="00:17:01.360" class="transcript_line"> well you know it was suspicious, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:17:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Well then when we explained what time we get home, when it was time to go to bed, when</div><div id="00:17:08.360" class="transcript_line"> you got home you had a bit of tea, I mean, and you couldn&#039;t do it in the morning, because</div><div id="00:17:13.360" class="transcript_line"> it couldn&#039;t help.</div><div id="00:17:15.360" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh that&#039;s alright, he said, do as you want to do, he said, you know, we</div><div id="00:17:21.960" class="transcript_line"> laughed over it, but the first time he had us up for copying on work.</div><div id="00:17:26.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean if you all had it right it was fine, but sometimes you know, you&#039;d all have a little</div><div id="00:17:31.960" class="transcript_line"> input, no, no, that ain&#039;t right, no, that ain&#039;t right, so we just go for the...</div><div id="00:17:35.960" class="transcript_line"> So you, when were you at school then, there, what year would that have been?</div><div id="00:17:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Er, when I was born in 41 and I would have been 11 when I passed my 11 plus.</div><div id="00:17:46.960" class="transcript_line"> 41, 51, 52.</div><div id="00:17:48.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have been 11, I started in 11, so I&#039;d have started in the September lock.</div><div id="00:17:54.960" class="transcript_line"> September of 52, so 52, ok, yeah, ok, ah.</div><div id="00:18:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was then.</div><div id="00:18:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Well then, I always wanted to be a policewoman, don&#039;t ask me why, when I was at school, yeah,</div><div id="00:18:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why.</div><div id="00:18:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Probably getting a right, left, school, the local bobby.</div><div id="00:18:12.560" class="transcript_line"> I always wanted to be a policewoman, but it didn&#039;t materialise, because I left at 16,</div><div id="00:18:19.560" class="transcript_line"> right, did my exams, left at 16 and came home.</div><div id="00:18:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Mam won very well and in those days I suppose the girl had to, yeah, and my dad had a heart</div><div id="00:18:32.560" class="transcript_line"> attack and he died at 58.</div><div id="00:18:35.560" class="transcript_line"> So of course, mother and uncle and my two brothers, well it would be three brothers</div><div id="00:18:41.560" class="transcript_line"> until the other one got married, was here, so I came home to work then.</div><div id="00:18:46.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve enjoyed it, I&#039;ve been on the farm ever since.</div><div id="00:18:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:18:52.560" class="transcript_line"> I do the book work now, well I&#039;ve done the book work, well I&#039;ve done the vat and all</div><div id="00:18:57.560" class="transcript_line"> that ever since it came out.</div><div id="00:18:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Well done you, because that&#039;s not the easy thing to do.</div><div id="00:19:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I do the vat, I do have an inspection every so often, but I&#039;m alright.</div><div id="00:19:07.560" class="transcript_line"> What about Goldcliff School then, you went there?</div><div id="00:19:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I went to Goldcliff and that&#039;s where we had the 11 plus, we sat there, look.</div><div id="00:19:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Well actually in the school?</div><div id="00:19:16.560" class="transcript_line"> The school, in the school.</div><div id="00:19:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:19.560" class="transcript_line"> So it must have been a good school because a lot of you passed.</div><div id="00:19:22.560" class="transcript_line"> We had two, they were lovely too, Mrs Ayo, funny enough, no relation to us, no.</div><div id="00:19:32.560" class="transcript_line"> She used to live at Land of Any, Megal, you know Land of Any, and Mrs Shepherd we had,</div><div id="00:19:42.560" class="transcript_line"> she used to come down from Pontypool, bus it into Newport and bus down, she didn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:19:48.560" class="transcript_line"> a car.</div><div id="00:19:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, because Dad was Redwick, Mrs Ayo knew, well she was a Miss James first and then she</div><div id="00:19:56.560" class="transcript_line"> married Jim Ayo, I&#039;d always sit on her lap if I was tired and I always had to have a</div><div id="00:20:05.560" class="transcript_line"> bra strap.</div><div id="00:20:06.560" class="transcript_line"> You always had to have a bra strap?</div><div id="00:20:08.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I wouldn&#039;t go to sleep, she used to nurse me and I had to get in there to Oldis to go</div><div id="00:20:14.560" class="transcript_line"> to sleep with a bra strap.</div><div id="00:20:16.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so sweet.</div><div id="00:20:17.560" class="transcript_line"> And then if I won very well she had a car, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:20:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;d bring me home.</div><div id="00:20:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:20:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Leave my bike in school because you know, I mean, they could always get me down, I always</div><div id="00:20:26.560" class="transcript_line">

class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d be doing the banks now where the tractors do it, they all done it by hand.</div><div id="00:21:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Yeah, trimming along, yeah.</div><div id="00:21:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:21:49.560" class="transcript_line"> There was no, well there wasn&#039;t tractors then.</div><div id="00:21:51.560" class="transcript_line"> What sort of time of year would they normally do that?</div><div id="00:21:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Well it didn&#039;t really bother about the birds and all that, did it?</div><div id="00:21:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I shouldn&#039;t say that.</div><div id="00:22:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Well it was a different time.</div><div id="00:22:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they&#039;d do it about, as the grass, oh I should think it would be April, May.</div><div id="00:22:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And would they be doing it on their land or?</div><div id="00:22:14.560" class="transcript_line"> No, everybody, they&#039;d be doing our main

id="00:22:23.560" class="transcript_line"> And they used to keep it under.</div><div id="00:22:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Say no more!</div><div id="00:22:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Say no more?</div><div id="00:22:29.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Did they ever clear it out?</div><div id="00:22:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Clear the stuff out of the reen?</div><div id="00:22:33.560" class="transcript_line"> No, only by raking, if there was a blockage, they had like a big old, about that big I</div><div id="00:22:39.560" class="transcript_line"> think it was, yeah, and they&#039;d just only pull it onto the bank.</div><div id="00:22:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:22:44.560" class="transcript_line"> They never ditched anything out of it.</div><div id="00:22:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Like a rake?</div><div id="00:22:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:47.560" class="transcript_line"> If there was a blockage that could block the water going under the arches, they&#039;d pull</div><div id="00:22:52.560" class="transcript_line"> it out on the side.</div><div id="00:22:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did you ever do that?</div><div id="00:22:57.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:58.560" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:22:59.560" class="transcript_line"> I knew how the reens used to flow, because as a little girl, I think Mum wanted to get</div><div id="00:23:08.560" class="transcript_line"> rid of us sometimes, and if Dad was walking to the reens, going along thinking the water</div><div id="00:23:14.560" class="transcript_line"> reen coming as well as it should do, you know there&#039;s got to be a blockage, he&#039;d take you</div><div id="00:23:17.560" class="transcript_line"> with him.</div><div id="00:23:18.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to love it.</div><div id="00:23:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And nobody would believe me when we had new ones, they went over to all these levels,</div><div id="00:23:26.560" class="transcript_line"> you know, right, so water runs down the middle, don&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:23:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So I told him, who&#039;s the one that I told and he didn&#039;t believe me where our water come</div><div id="00:23:36.560" class="transcript_line"> from?</div><div id="00:23:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Our water in the ditches from here comes from Nasharch.</div><div id="00:23:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Does it really?</div><div id="00:23:42.560" class="transcript_line"> And it wanders its way down and it gets into that when it comes out and then goes into</div><div id="00:23:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Chappalee.</div><div id="00:23:48.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, no, no, no, no, I&#039;ll pump your water, because it was that very dry, he said, oh,</div><div id="00:23:55.560" class="transcript_line"> about 30 years, we had a very dry time.</div><div id="00:23:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:59.560" class="transcript_line"> We had a very dry time.</div><div id="00:24:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, we&#039;ll pump your water, because I said, you can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:24:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he said, of course you can pump water.</div><div id="00:24:10.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, you can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:24:11.560" class="transcript_line"> But they pumped for two days and they shut the pump off at night because the water was</div><div id="00:24:17.560" class="transcript_line"> running down here.</div><div id="00:24:18.560" class="transcript_line"> He was pumping up here, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:24:21.560" class="transcript_line"> But when they shut it, they took levels.</div><div id="00:24:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:24.560" class="transcript_line"> And he wouldn&#039;t believe me that our water comes from Nasharch and I said, well, as a</div><div id="00:24:28.560" class="transcript_line"> little girl, we walked up those fields and we got there, you&#039;d have a blockage.</div><div id="00:24:33.560" class="transcript_line"> So dad had pulled the blockage out.</div><div id="00:24:35.560" class="transcript_line"> That is so interesting.</div><div id="00:24:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re really listening to your dad.</div><div id="00:24:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, you sort of, where?</div><div id="00:24:43.560" class="transcript_line"> I suppose I was sparked by my background.</div><div id="00:24:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps being the only girl.</div><div id="00:24:47.560" class="transcript_line"> You sound like a bright little girl.</div><div id="00:24:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Being the only girl, I think.</div><div id="00:24:51.560" class="transcript_line"> I think the boys were mums.</div><div id="00:24:54.560" class="transcript_line"> No mum was good to me.</div><div id="00:24:56.560" class="transcript_line"> But I think I was dad&#039;s girl.</div><div id="00:24:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Dad died at 58, so of course I was only 17.</div><div id="00:25:03.560" class="transcript_line"> But he knew very well how his reams ran.</div><div id="00:25:08.560" class="transcript_line"> He knew that.</div><div id="00:25:10.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d walk by and say, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:25:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you another thing he used to take me, and I loved it.</div><div id="00:25:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Birds nesting.</div><div id="00:25:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Never to take any eggs out of the nest.</div><div id="00:25:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You just walked and he&#039;d say, listen, and you&#039;d like tweet it.</div><div id="00:25:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d look, oh, there would be sometimes just one on there, but then you&#039;d see little</div><div id="00:25:32.560" class="transcript_line"> babies in the nest.</div><div id="00:25:34.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d done all that with him.</div><div id="00:25:36.560" class="transcript_line"> With your dad?</div><div id="00:25:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you know what the birds were?</div><div id="00:25:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you another thing he used to take me with him.</div><div id="00:25:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Roses.</div><div id="00:25:44.560" class="transcript_line"> He used to love grafting roses.</div><div id="00:25:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Now you walk around the hedges and find the best dogbriar.</div><div id="00:25:52.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;d be a thick one.</div><div id="00:25:55.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d tie a little bit of raffia, whitey stuff around it.</div><div id="00:26:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, then he&#039;d go and dig it up.</div><div id="00:26:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Later on in the autumn, I think, he&#039;d dug it up.</div><div id="00:26:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was the autumn.</div><div id="00:26:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Then you grafted, didn&#039;t you, in the autumn?</div><div id="00:26:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:12.560" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d take off his rose&#039;s ear and he&#039;d graft it.</div><div id="00:26:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d put like muck around it, like clay.</div><div id="00:26:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Then he&#039;d wrap this raffia around it.</div><div id="00:26:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it ain&#039;t cool.</div><div id="00:26:25.560" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s how he had these standard roses.</div><div id="00:26:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Good dogbriar.</div><div id="00:26:30.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:26:31.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, I look at all these things.</div><div id="00:26:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And now when my grandchildren, well, and my two, went into Newport to schools,</div><div id="00:26:43.560" class="transcript_line"> because they took the boundary, took us in, just up the road,</div><div id="00:26:47.560" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t realise till my boy went to school.</div><div id="00:26:52.560" class="transcript_line"> He is 53 this time and my girl&#039;s 49.</div><div id="00:26:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is, I can&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:26:58.560" class="transcript_line"> You forget, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:27:00.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a different world.</div><div id="00:27:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Completely different world.</div><div id="00:27:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Because, how can I put it, they wasted too much.</div><div id="00:27:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to love going to the jumble sales at the school</div><div id="00:27:18.560" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;d throw out a skirt because the zip had gone.</div><div id="00:27:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful clothes.</div><div id="00:27:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And you get it for 10p.</div><div id="00:27:29.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d come home, you know, only had to put a zip in.</div><div id="00:27:33.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, but it was a completely different way of living.</div><div id="00:27:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t realise that until they started school.</div><div id="00:27:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you say yours was a very outdoor life?</div><div id="00:27:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, outdoor, but you didn&#039;t waste anything, get me?</div><div id="00:27:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, even to making cake and all that,</div><div id="00:27:53.560" class="transcript_line"> you used a, what was there, I mean, if the cream went a little bit sour,</div><div id="00:27:58.560" class="transcript_line"> you put it in a cake or in a scone, it&#039;d make a lovely light scone.</div><div id="00:28:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Not really gone off, you know, but just not tainted.</div><div id="00:28:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I still use yogurts or whatever now.</div><div id="00:28:12.560" class="transcript_line"> If a yogurt is out of date, as long as it hasn&#039;t blown, it goes in a cake.</div><div id="00:28:16.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:28:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Where did your milk come from? Did you buy milk?</div><div id="00:28:22.560" class="transcript_line"> No, we always had a house cow.</div><div id="00:28:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Where the calf and Dad milked it or my brothers milked it,</div><div id="00:28:30.560" class="transcript_line"> or I&#039;ve had a milk sometimes, you know.</div><div id="00:28:33.560" class="transcript_line"> If they weren&#039;t yearning, every morning the cow read the calf.</div><div id="00:28:37.560" class="transcript_line"> But you had the milk first, you didn&#039;t let them run free.</div><div id="00:28:41.560" class="transcript_line"> The calf was in the pen and you had your milk.</div><div id="00:28:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you make butter and cheese?</div><div id="00:28:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, still got the churn, the old wooden churn and the glass churn is still here.</div><div id="00:28:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have to do that?</div><div id="00:28:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So once you made the butter, where did you...?</div><div id="00:28:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I got the pats and all, you were in it with, you know, you pat the...</div><div id="00:29:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:29:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:29:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s...</div><div id="00:29:08.560" class="transcript_line"> This is what I think a lot of my grandchildren are losing out,</div><div id="00:29:12.560" class="transcript_line"> because they think you buy everything out of a shop.</div><div id="00:29:19.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry.</div><div id="00:29:20.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re on the farm but they go to town schools.</div><div id="00:29:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:24.560" class="transcript_line"> What about pig?

Well, people suck you down.</div><div id="00:30:23.560" class="transcript_line"> And you were never to play near a ream.</div><div id="00:30:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Never to talk to strangers, but I never seen any strangers.</div><div id="00:30:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:30:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you knew everybody.</div><div id="00:30:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And Dad used to cut people&#039;s hair.</div><div id="00:30:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come in and say, oh, yes, he&#039;d trim the...</div><div id="00:30:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I still got his cutters in the old drawer outside.</div><div id="00:30:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Really, Cuff?

So you didn&#039;t ask questions, but they didn&#039;t talk a lot then, did they?</div><div id="00:31:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Our mother didn&#039;t seem to talk a lot.</div><div id="00:31:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d be here every Sunday to dinner and I&#039;d think, oh.</div><div id="00:31:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Then Mum said to him, now that&#039;s your Uncle Morgan.</div><div id="00:31:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had an auntie Claire up the road, no relation, and Auntie Annis and all those, no relations with her.</div><div id="00:31:55.560" class="transcript_line"> And Uncle Morgan, asked me, Uncle Morgan.</div><div id="00:31:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Why wonder where does he live?</div><div id="00:32:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, every Sunday he was at dinner with our mam.</div><div id="00:32:08.560" class="transcript_line"> It turned out he was our mam&#039;s brother.</div><div id="00:32:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:32:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. He said, you&#039;re coming home with me today?</div><div id="00:32:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Am I?</div><div id="00:32:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can go. You can go, because Auntie Anna wants to see you.</div><div id="00:32:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh. Well, we peddled all up the moor.</div><div id="00:32:29.560" class="transcript_line"> He lived at Land of Any, right by the railway line, where the bridge goes off.</div><div id="00:32:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it Whitehall, the farm right by the railway line?</div><div id="00:32:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, he lived right by there.</div><div id="00:32:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;d go and sit in the house, but he had eight children.</div><div id="00:32:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:32:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I stayed there. I wonder why mam had packed my...</div><div id="00:32:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It was then when I found out he was mam&#039;s brother.</div><div id="00:33:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Because mamma never told me, should you go in and stay up there? So that was my holiday then.</div><div id="00:33:07.560" class="transcript_line"> It was your holiday, how funny.</div><div id="00:33:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I had a couple of days up there.</div><div id="00:33:14.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we peddled up like that. Well, he&#039;d already told me that I was their cousin, and you know.</div><div id="00:33:21.560" class="transcript_line"> We slept three in a bed.</div><div id="00:33:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Two on that end, one at the other end, you know.</div><div id="00:33:29.560" class="transcript_line"> The girls and me.</div><div id="00:33:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Had you peddled everywhere in those days, Michael?</div><div id="00:33:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But what I couldn&#039;t cope with, because the house was so near the railway line, and we are so quiet here,</div><div id="00:33:43.560" class="transcript_line"> oh, those blooming trains, they&#039;d rattle by.</div><div id="00:33:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Would they be the steam train then?</div><div id="00:33:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they&#039;d be going quite fast, and they&#039;d carry on talking.</div><div id="00:33:54.560" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t hear a thing. They must have got oblivious to the noise, and they&#039;d be talking away, and I couldn&#039;t hear a thing.</div><div id="00:34:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And in bed at night, there weren&#039;t many at night, mind.</div><div id="00:34:09.560" class="transcript_line"> I suppose today there&#039;s trains all the time, but you go to bed and you hear, oh, this blooming train, you hear it coming down the line, you know.</div><div id="00:34:18.560" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;d be more or less the house was only like from here to that wall over there from the actual train.</div><div id="00:34:27.560" class="transcript_line"> But that man that came in every Sunday was Mums Weather.</div><div id="00:34:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So as a child, what sort of games did you play?</div><div id="00:34:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Opscotch, skipping, climbing trees, falling out many a time.</div><div id="00:34:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever swim in the reams despite being a cockatoo?</div><div id="00:34:50.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:34:51.560" class="transcript_line"> No boating or jumping over them?</div><div id="00:34:54.560" class="transcript_line"> No, except that day when my two brothers trod on my hands going over.</div><div id="00:34:59.560" class="transcript_line"> What about the sea wall? Did you ever go down there?</div><div id="00:35:02.560" class="transcript_line"> No, that was the walk from school, our nature walk from school.</div><div id="00:35:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you never went like they do abroad and all they do today.</div><div id="00:35:14.560" class="transcript_line"> You either went down a lane, you went up the sea wall, or you took nature walks.</div><div id="00:35:21.560" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do on the sea wall?</div><div id="00:35:24.560" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a little bit of sand on the one side.</div><div id="00:35:26.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d walk in, the fisheries used to be there, they used to catch the fish, look.</div><div id="00:35:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:31.560" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d walk in there and play on this little bit of sand.</div><div id="00:35:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was always tea rooms down there because there used to be a big house called the Temporous Hotel.</div><div id="00:35:41.560" class="transcript_line"> A three-storey house at the sea wall, they took it down.</div><div id="00:35:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Where was that?</div><div id="00:35:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Right as you drive down to the, go down the sea, right to the sea wall as far as you can go.</div><div id="00:35:51.560" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t mean Porton?</div><div id="00:35:53.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:35:54.560" class="transcript_line"> The actual Clifton Court one.</div><div id="00:35:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the little cafe there?</div><div id="00:35:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, the cafe used to be in the house before that.</div><div id="00:36:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:04.560" class="transcript_line"> When I was a kid.</div><div id="00:36:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:06.560" class="transcript_line"> But there was a house the other side right on the sea wall, Temporous Hotel it was called.</div><div id="00:36:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve not heard of that before.</div><div id="00:36:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember Temporous.</div><div id="00:36:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, three-storey house.</div><div id="00:36:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Newtons lived in it, Mr. and Mrs. Newton, Bill Newton lived in it.</div><div id="00:36:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:36:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s another story.</div><div id="00:36:23.560" class="transcript_line"> If you go over the New Southern Bridge and you come to England, as you look on the left,</div><div id="00:36:29.560" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a house there, three-storey, exactly the same as the one that used to be down there.</div><div id="00:36:32.560" class="transcript_line"> They took it down.</div><div id="00:36:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Down there.</div><div id="00:36:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:36:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ll see it on the left-hand side.</div><div id="00:36:36.560" class="transcript_line"> They took it down because they wanted to do something to the sea wall and they moved it.</div><div id="00:36:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when they widened the wall, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Wait a minute.</div><div id="00:36:44.560" class="transcript_line"> 70s?</div><div id="00:36:45.560" class="transcript_line"> 70-something?</div><div id="00:36:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:36:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, she was still living in the whole house when her son got lost on the Southern Bridge.</div><div id="00:36:52.560" class="transcript_line"> 70-something?</div><div id="00:36:53.560" class="transcript_line"> What, he got lost in 60-something?</div><div id="00:36:54.560" class="transcript_line"> He got lost?</div><div id="00:36:55.560" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean?</div><div id="00:36:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was working on the Southern Bridge and he was getting in his car on the... he&#039;d</div><div id="00:37:03.560" class="transcript_line"> finished his shift.</div><div id="00:37:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And an alarm went off and he rushed back in and he got in the boats and he never ever found</div><div id="00:37:09.560" class="transcript_line"> his body.</div><div id="00:37:10.560" class="transcript_line"> They reckoned he&#039;d got under one of the other boats or something.</div><div id="00:37:13.560" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a thing about it on the telly.</div><div id="00:37:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, there was a program on it about telly.</div><div id="00:37:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:37:18.560" class="transcript_line"> It was the only funeral I remember my dad going to.</div><div id="00:37:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, sorry.</div><div id="00:37:22.560" class="transcript_line"> No, my brother&#039;s going to where there was no body.</div><div id="00:37:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Mam&#039;s sister lived the other way on the sea wall then.</div><div id="00:37:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:33.560" class="transcript_line"> But when she was ill, she&#039;d give me two and sixpence anti-D.E.C. did to go and do her ironing.</div><div id="00:37:41.560" class="transcript_line"> So I used to ride down to Mrs. Newton&#039;s and walk the sea wall all the way down there to</div><div id="00:37:47.560" class="transcript_line"> do her ironing and come back.</div><div id="00:37:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Two and sixpence if she had a lot of ironing, two shillings if it was a small iron.</div><div id="00:37:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So, it depended on...</div><div id="00:37:56.560" class="transcript_line"> How far along the sea wall did you...</div><div id="00:37:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Grimineck, Mildermore.</div><div id="00:38:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:38:02.560" class="transcript_line"> You walked, yeah, to there, come back, pedal my back home.</div><div id="00:38:06.560" class="transcript_line"> So the Temperance Hotel, was it a hotel?</div><div id="00:38:10.560" class="transcript_line"> People would go there...</div><div id="00:38:11.560" class="transcript_line"> At one stage, but not when Newton&#039;s was there.</div><div id="00:38:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Newton, who used to wait, I used to put my bike in her coal house in her shed on the</div><div id="00:38:22.560" class="transcript_line"> side, and she&#039;d wait until I&#039;d come back, see me walk back along the sea wall and have</div><div id="00:38:27.560" class="transcript_line"> a few words with me and I&#039;d pedal home then.</div><div id="00:38:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:38:31.560" class="transcript_line"> But you knew everybody, see?</div><div id="00:38:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And Mam used to go there.</div><div id="00:38:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Well then, Auntie Daisy moved from there then, and she moved where Margaret Russell used</div><div id="00:38:41.560" class="transcript_line"> to live on the Cardcliffe and Court.</div><div id="00:38:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:38:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Um...</div><div id="00:38:48.560" class="transcript_line"> She moved there.</div><div id="00:38:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go out into the estuary and walk out there or swim in the river there?</div><div id="00:38:54.560" class="transcript_line"> No, we used to walk out, but I tell you what, we used to go more than anywhere.</div><div id="00:38:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It was down...</div><div id="00:39:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, not Saltmash, there was a lot of grass.</div><div id="00:39:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what&#039;s that lane where you go to Nash Church?</div><div id="00:39:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Walk on down there.</div><div id="00:39:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I know where you go, yeah.</div><div id="00:39:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And down there, there was a lot of grass.</div><div id="00:39:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was lovely to go and you could watch the ships come in through the dock down there,</div><div id="00:39:20.560" class="transcript_line"> look.</div><div id="00:39:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:39:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be watching the ships coming into the dock.</div><div id="00:39:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we used to have a ride sometimes on our bikes, because you never took shopping</div><div id="00:39:30.560" class="transcript_line"> with your mam in those days, right?</div><div id="00:39:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And to see the shops when I was about 13, we used to go over the transporter bridge,</div><div id="00:39:40.560" class="transcript_line"> pedal our bikes up the main street of town.</div><div id="00:39:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Pedal your bikes to Newport?</div><div id="00:39:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;d pedal our bikes down where the transporter bridge is in Traston Road.</div><div id="00:39:51.560" class="transcript_line"> And you went across on the transporter bridge?</div><div id="00:39:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Up where the cross on the transporter bridge.</div><div id="00:39:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Pedal our bikes up town, looking in the shop windows, right?</div><div id="00:40:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And then come on along down Chepstral Road, turn off at the crosshands and pedal on.</div><div id="00:40:08.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was not everything, it was only in the summer.</div><div id="00:40:11.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d see lovely shoes, you&#039;d see everything, you know.</div><div id="00:40:14.560" class="transcript_line"> But you had to have plain Jane when you went to school, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:40:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, that&#039;s such a lovely story.</div><div id="00:40:20.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to have fun as kids, I mean, we had no money.</div><div id="00:40:26.560" class="transcript_line"> No money, no?</div><div id="00:40:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Were there any shops in the parish?</div><div id="00:40:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sure, shop on the end of Straits Lane.</div><div id="00:40:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was one down by Eskmouth, it was a post office, Thomas&#039;s, Moorcroft.</div><div id="00:40:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was one in Whitsun, yeah, she used to do post office and pension, she didn&#039;t have a shop.</div><div id="00:40:54.560" class="transcript_line"> She just had the actual pensions.</div><div id="00:40:56.560" class="transcript_line"> And the post got delivered and the post lady had pedaled around with mail.</div><div id="00:41:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:41:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, get delivered there, I mean, they&#039;d pedaled around with the mail.</div><div id="00:41:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Our mail used to come from Lamburn, yeah, they&#039;d come over the railway line.</div><div id="00:41:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:41:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was a railway line there, look, you could go up there, pedal over and get over into Langston if you wanted to.</div><div id="00:41:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the butcher ranks out there at Porton?</div><div id="00:41:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:41:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes?</div><div id="00:41:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I remember all those.</div><div id="00:41:26.560" class="transcript_line"> My cousin used to fetch the salmon in.</div><div id="00:41:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s your cousin?</div><div id="00:41:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Baker, oh he&#039;s been dead years now.</div><div id="00:41:32.560" class="transcript_line"> That was Auntie Daisy, used to go and do the ironing is, right there, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you who used to do it here at the seawall down here, it all belonged to the same fishing, Burgess I think used, and then Williams&#039;s, it was Burgess.</div><div id="00:41:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ve heard the name Burgess.</div><div id="00:41:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And then I think Williams&#039;s bought it after he died.</div><div id="00:41:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because they had, he&#039;s still living down there, one of the Williams&#039;s.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> She was a hale.</div><div id="00:42:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So your cousin used to fetch the salmon?</div><div id="00:42:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well he used to go out with a little tractor to fetch it in, and in the house there where he lived, down Auntie Daisy, right by there, they had slabs, called slabs.</div><div id="00:42:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d put the, he&#039;d go and get them out of the pouches and then put them in his place for them to

all now when the steel has come.</div><div id="00:43:39.560" class="transcript_line"> My father used to like eels.</div><div id="00:43:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:43:42.560" class="transcript_line"> So the bean sticks that he used to get, the stick for the runner beans, you&#039;d add a bit</div><div id="00:43:48.560" class="transcript_line"> of wire on it and a nook, stick it in the bank and then go back at night to see if you caught</div><div id="00:43:54.560" class="transcript_line"> any in the rain.</div><div id="00:43:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:43:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, I used to catch them like fun.</div><div id="00:43:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:43:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I tell you what we used to see, and I don&#039;t know whether they&#039;re there now,</div><div id="00:44:04.560" class="transcript_line"> down the bottom of Chappel Ream before it goes out to sea, right, you&#039;d see bunches</div><div id="00:44:09.560" class="transcript_line"> of eels, you know they.</div><div id="00:44:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Elvers.</div><div id="00:44:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Elvers, yeah, they&#039;d be there in bunches.</div><div id="00:44:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ve heard this.</div><div id="00:44:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:18.560" class="transcript_line"> But you could see them.</div><div id="00:44:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, they were like.</div><div id="00:44:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Like big club flat.</div><div id="00:44:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:44:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:44:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh aye.</div><div id="00:44:24.560" class="transcript_line"> So you used to go and watch that?</div><div id="00:44:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Well the thing is, what else was there to watch around you?</div><div id="00:44:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Did anyone ever eat Elvers here?</div><div id="00:44:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Not the Elvers, but Dad liked the eels.</div><div id="00:44:38.560" class="transcript_line"> So when he caught the eel, did he bring it back?</div><div id="00:44:41.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d go down and look and fetch it back, Rod as well.</div><div id="00:44:44.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d fetch it back?</div><div id="00:44:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Rod as well, only on the end of our road.</div><div id="00:44:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:44:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:44:51.560" class="transcript_line"> How many would you have, just the one?</div><div id="00:44:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Well if you took three bean sticks down with you and he&#039;d come and show you how to push</div><div id="00:44:58.560" class="transcript_line"> it in the bank, well then you didn&#039;t go back till about two or three hours, and you could</div><div id="00:45:03.560" class="transcript_line"> have three.</div><div id="00:45:04.560" class="transcript_line"> And he used to love them, Mam used to boil them for him.</div><div id="00:45:08.560" class="transcript_line"> So did she skin them first?</div><div id="00:45:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:11.560" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d have an old sink outside where she&#039;d put them in.</div><div id="00:45:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and she boiled them?</div><div id="00:45:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Mm-mm.</div><div id="00:45:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t ask me how she&#039;d done it, but she boiled them.</div><div id="00:45:22.560" class="transcript_line"> So did that stop when landlorn went up?</div><div id="00:45:26.560" class="transcript_line"> It went, well yes you got dirt would come in the water, which he said they wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:45:33.560" class="transcript_line"> pollute, but they did.</div><div id="00:45:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And you could go out sometimes and they&#039;d have something burst over there.</div><div id="00:45:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I mean, did they have arsenic or cyanide over there?</div><div id="00:45:44.560" class="transcript_line"> And all the fish would be up on top of the water dead.</div><div id="00:45:47.560" class="transcript_line"> You actually saw that?</div><div id="00:45:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:45:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was in Monks Pill, and, because like Monks Pill joins us down here look, just down</div><div id="00:45:56.560" class="transcript_line"> the road.</div><div id="00:45:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:58.560" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, they&#039;d be floating on top of the water.</div><div id="00:46:01.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d had a leak, didn&#039;t they, or something over there, and nobody&#039;s seen anything would</div><div id="00:46:05.560" class="transcript_line"> they?</div><div id="00:46:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember when landlorn was being constructed?</div><div id="00:46:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:09.560" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:46:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Terrible for us along here, because the lorries, which was all in the shale and all that, you&#039;d</div><div id="00:46:18.560" class="transcript_line"> see, well it wasn&#039;t safe to go out on the roads really, because they&#039;d be coming up</div><div id="00:46:23.560" class="transcript_line"> fast.</div><div id="00:46:24.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d be in hedges, they&#039;d be everywhere.</div><div id="00:46:29.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d see a lorry, they did, you&#039;d see, you know, they were everywhere.</div><div id="00:46:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And you didn&#039;t want to go into the main of Newport, because there was only one bridge</div><div id="00:46:38.560" class="transcript_line"> then, look, which was the old bridge.</div><div id="00:46:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:46:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Not the George Street Bridge, and we&#039;ve got City Bridge now.</div><div id="00:46:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So you could be queuing way down on Corporation Road, or Chepster Road, because the lorries</div><div id="00:46:52.560" class="transcript_line"> took over.</div><div id="00:46:54.560" class="transcript_line"> And then you had to camp up the road, yeah, with all the Irishmen.</div><div id="00:46:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:47:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:47:01.560" class="transcript_line"> You know where NRW is now, well, Caldercott and Wendtl was, but just up the road there,</div><div id="00:47:07.560" class="transcript_line"> coming towards me on the left-hand side, there was an hostel there.</div><div id="00:47:10.560" class="transcript_line"> There was even a church they put in there for the Irishmen, they were all Irish.</div><div id="00:47:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:47:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:47:17.560" class="transcript_line"> They were there building, they were the main ones on the stewardess, and they&#039;d go to</div><div id="00:47:22.560" class="transcript_line"> a town on a Friday night, come home drunk, and the old, no, I don&#039;t call them, a priest</div><div id="00:47:32.560" class="transcript_line"> would be collecting them up, because there used to be a garage there selling petrol where</div><div id="00:47:36.560" class="transcript_line"> NRW is now, German&#039;s Garage.</div><div id="00:47:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:47:40.560" class="transcript_line"> When we had a car then, we picked our petrol up there, and he used to shoe horses as well</div><div id="00:47:46.560" class="transcript_line"> for anybody to ride.</div><div id="00:47:47.560" class="transcript_line"> He had his thing in the back, Mr. German did, where he showed the horses, and he had two</div><div id="00:47:54.560" class="transcript_line"> petrol pumps there.</div><div id="00:47:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:47:56.560" class="transcript_line"> And behind that was the hostel.</div><div id="00:47:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Just, you know where Geoff said he was born, that farm opposite?</div><div id="00:48:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:48:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And that side of the road, just around the bend, you&#039;ll see like a lot of rubble now.</div><div id="00:48:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:09.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was the hostel where the Irishmen was.</div><div id="00:48:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And they had a little church there as well?</div><div id="00:48:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they used to go to town, get drunk, and oh, it was, you never come along that</div><div id="00:48:20.560" class="transcript_line"> road on a Saturday night because they&#039;d be all over the road.</div><div id="00:48:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:48:24.560" class="transcript_line"> And the priest would be rounding them up and taking them in.</div><div id="00:48:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve not heard that before.</div><div id="00:48:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:48:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Where?</div><div id="00:48:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Up on that road, near a new port, there was a caravan site for the workers on the steelworks.</div><div id="00:48:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:48:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And they had a church up on there as well, and a supermarket, like not today, like a</div><div id="00:48:46.560" class="transcript_line"> corp on there.</div><div id="00:48:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to go in and get stuff, and a post office and all that.</div><div id="00:48:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:48:51.560" class="transcript_line"> That must have been, do you remember the village of Lambwine?</div><div id="00:48:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:48:56.560" class="transcript_line"> What was it like?</div><div id="00:48:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, by the, do you know where the golf club is?</div><div id="00:49:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:49:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, that Tennyson Avenue, was it?</div><div id="00:49:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Or Tennyson Road, I think, because we used to pedal our bikes over the railway.</div><div id="00:49:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:49:09.560" class="transcript_line"> And then go up around the Martin and come back home along the moor.</div><div id="00:49:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was nowhere else to go, you know.</div><div id="00:49:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:49:17.560" class="transcript_line"> And then there was Banffam.</div><div id="00:49:20.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to turn up by there, but like the little village was there by the Milton and</div><div id="00:49:24.560" class="transcript_line"> all that, and few around by there.</div><div id="00:49:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know anyone who worked there at Lambwine?</div><div id="00:49:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Did it employ a lot of local people?</div><div id="00:49:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:49:34.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, a lot of people from around here worked when the work started, you know.</div><div id="00:49:40.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was mainly the Irish that was...</div><div id="00:49:43.560" class="transcript_line"> That Irish Navvies that were building it.</div><div id="00:49:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:49:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:49:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:49:49.560" class="transcript_line"> What about, so you were born in 41?</div><div id="00:49:52.560" class="transcript_line"> 41, January.</div><div id="00:49:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the winter of 47?</div><div id="00:49:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:49:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, where the sheep, we had snow, a bad winter, and you&#039;d go out in the field out there and</div><div id="00:50:03.560" class="transcript_line"> all you&#039;d see was the poor sheep and their nostrils showing.</div><div id="00:50:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And Dad used to, and Uncle and my two brothers, not me, because I mean, the snow was...</div><div id="00:50:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I remember that well.</div><div id="00:50:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:50:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it cut off here then?</div><div id="00:50:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were cut off.</div><div id="00:50:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:50:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And was it the same in 63?</div><div id="00:50:24.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s another bad winter.</div><div id="00:50:25.560" class="transcript_line"> That was another one, yes.</div><div id="00:50:27.560" class="transcript_line"> We could get from here with a tractor then, because you had tractors then, you know.</div><div id="00:50:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So you got from here.</div><div id="00:50:34.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you didn&#039;t go out there, you went and did any shopping.</div><div id="00:50:39.560" class="transcript_line"> So in 47 was it...</div><div id="00:50:40.560" class="transcript_line"> But in those days, see, you had shopping.</div><div id="00:50:44.560" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot more local shops than there is now.</div><div id="00:50:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:50.560" class="transcript_line"> So, Mum would go up as far as Kendal&#039;s, which was only opposite Lissowerry High School,</div><div id="00:50:55.560" class="transcript_line"> where my grandkids go.</div><div id="00:50:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, and where they went.</div><div id="00:51:00.560" class="transcript_line"> There was the shop there.</div><div id="00:51:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:51:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Kendal&#039;s had that shop, and he had the shop farther up, and then the baker was on that</div><div id="00:51:07.560" class="transcript_line"> roundabout by Aldi&#039;s.</div><div id="00:51:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:51:09.560" class="transcript_line"> The baker.</div><div id="00:51:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So you only had to get on the tractor then, you could go in 63, and get the bread out</div><div id="00:51:15.560" class="transcript_line"> of the bakehouse there.</div><div id="00:51:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Haynes was there, and you&#039;d get the bread off him.</div><div id="00:51:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:51:22.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember all that before the school was built up there and all.</div><div id="00:51:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Lissowerry School College and all that.</div><div id="00:51:28.560" class="transcript_line"> So all that area, and the area where all that shopping centre is, you know...</div><div id="00:51:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was all farmland.</div><div id="00:51:33.560" class="transcript_line"> That was all farmland.</div><div id="00:51:35.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s hard to believe, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:51:37.560" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:51:38.560" class="transcript_line"> And when I look at how Newport have grown in all ways, do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:51:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:51:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, well, it was only those houses on Nash Road, as I call Nash Road by</div><div id="00:51:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Lissowerry, there was only the houses there.</div><div id="00:51:55.560" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing behind them.</div><div id="00:51:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Now there&#039;s all Pont Fein, what do you call it, Crescent, the other side.</div><div id="00:52:01.560" class="transcript_line"> No, that was all land.</div><div id="00:52:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was wartime buildings on that side of the road.</div><div id="00:52:07.560" class="transcript_line"> You know those banglows?</div><div id="00:52:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:09.560" class="transcript_line"> What do you call them?</div><div id="00:52:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Prefabs.</div><div id="00:52:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Prefabs.</div><div id="00:52:12.560" class="transcript_line"> They were there, and another lot on Chepstow Road.</div><div id="00:52:15.560" class="transcript_line"> But I can remember when I used to go to school, none of Allway or all that was ever built.</div><div id="00:52:21.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was all farmland?</div><div id="00:52:22.560" class="transcript_line"> All farmland, yes.</div><div id="00:52:23.560" class="transcript_line"> The head of the</div><div id="00:52:27.480" class="transcript_line"> There was the Endrew Farm up there, on the left, when you went up there, yeah.</div><div id="00:52:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Because they were butchers in the town.</div><div id="00:52:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Auntie Rose Thompson.</div><div id="00:52:38.560" class="transcript_line"> No relation of ours, but I just had to call her Auntie Rose because she&#039;s mam&#039;s friend.</div><div id="00:52:42.560" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re only 78, which isn&#039;t that old, and you&#039;ve seen all these changes.</div><div id="00:52:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:48.560" class="transcript_line"> There was none of those houses there when I went to school.</div><div id="00:52:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was a very rural area.</div><div id="00:52:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was all rural right up, yeah.</div><div id="00:52:58.560" class="transcript_line"> So did the M4 coming through affect you at all here? Was that noticed?</div><div id="00:53:03.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it was noticed.</div><div id="00:53:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:06.560" class="transcript_line"> But that you got off at Magor and then you was like, but the other one that will come through will come not far from Pike Corner, won&#039;t it? If it comes.</div><div id="00:53:15.560" class="transcript_line"> If it comes through.</div><div id="00:53:16.560" class="transcript_line"> If it comes through.</div><div id="00:53:17.560" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about that?</div><div id="00:53:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, we do need something in Newport because we&#039;re gridlocked only nearly all the time now.</div><div id="00:53:26.560" class="transcript_line"> You can be queuing back to Pike Corner to get into town if you don&#039;t go early.</div><div id="00:53:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:53:33.560" class="transcript_line"> But I think what done that was, they put that road through Lanwerne.</div><div id="00:53:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it brought the traffic quicker, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:53:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:44.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, instead of coming along this road, they come straight through now.</div><div id="00:53:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think it&#039;s quicker. It&#039;s got to the bridge and it&#039;s jamming us up.</div><div id="00:53:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what? You see coaches come along our top road now sometimes.</div><div id="00:54:00.560" class="transcript_line"> What, to avoid the traffic?</div><div id="00:54:01.560" class="transcript_line"> To avoid the traffic.</div><div id="00:54:02.560" class="transcript_line"> To avoid the traffic, but they&#039;re not getting anywhere because they only turn and before you turn back to go back on or go straight up, you&#039;re queuing.</div><div id="00:54:11.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s crazy.</div><div id="00:54:12.560" class="transcript_line"> It took me to go to the school. Well, Lane took me up to school because they had a concert on.</div><div id="00:54:18.560" class="transcript_line"> She took the kids up. She said, Mom, hurry up. You&#039;re going to have to wait. Come quickly. She said, because we&#039;re going queuing.</div><div id="00:54:25.560" class="transcript_line"> It took us three quarters of an hour to do two and a half miles to get to the school.</div><div id="00:54:32.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s off walking, aren&#039;t you? Really? Or cycling?</div><div id="00:54:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Or cycling.</div><div id="00:54:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what? I haven&#039;t cycled a bike for years. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:54:40.560" class="transcript_line"> What about the trains? Did you ever use trains as a child?</div><div id="00:54:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Dad had to go to Gloucester, look. Pedal up to Lanwerne Station on the bike, get on the train there to Gloucester and do the same coming home.</div><div id="00:54:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Gloucester Market was right by the railway lines in Gloucester, look.</div><div id="00:54:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So I know where Gloucester Market is.</div><div id="00:54:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, where it is now. Oh, where it used to be in the town. Yeah, when Dad would get off the train and you only sort of come down, you were in the market.</div><div id="00:55:06.560" class="transcript_line"> So what if he bought anything?</div><div id="00:55:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was always a cattle lorry. No, he didn&#039;t have a cattle lorry in the beginning.</div><div id="00:55:12.560" class="transcript_line"> But in the beginning, did they come back on the train with him?</div><div id="00:55:15.560" class="transcript_line"> No. There was a lorry from this area. It was either Mr Arthur, Mr Rees or who else used to fetch it down. But there was always a lorry to bring whenever he bought home.</div><div id="00:55:28.560" class="transcript_line"> And would you ever go with him to Gloucester?</div><div id="00:55:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:55:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Mam used to want to get rid of me, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:55:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So you were both cycled to...</div><div id="00:55:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Lanwerne. Put our bikes in the station.</div><div id="00:55:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Were they trained up then or would you just leave them there?</div><div id="00:55:42.560" class="transcript_line"> No, put them in a little hut in there. And then you&#039;d go on the train, look all the way. Well, Dad had a cousin living just outside Gloucester.</div><div id="00:55:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:53.560" class="transcript_line"> In Minsterworth.</div><div id="00:55:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Minsterworth?</div><div id="00:55:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I was brought up in Minsterworth.</div><div id="00:55:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you?</div><div id="00:55:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, where in Minsterworth?</div><div id="00:55:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Erm, what&#039;s the name of it? Well, Harvey&#039;s the name was. Do you remember Harvey&#039;s?</div><div id="00:56:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Not John Harvey.</div><div id="00:56:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Harvey&#039;s the poet?</div><div id="00:56:07.560" class="transcript_line"> No, there was a John and Agnes Harvey who used to run the shop in Minsterworth by the butchers.</div><div id="00:56:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Hunter Gladys she was. She was Dad&#039;s first cousin.</div><div id="00:56:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s really funny.</div><div id="00:56:19.560" class="transcript_line"> And erm...</div><div id="00:56:22.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on the River Severn.</div><div id="00:56:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And she&#039;d come into Gloucester and pick me up and take me back there. And fetch me back if I wanted to come back. She didn&#039;t have any children. She was married late in life.</div><div id="00:56:35.560" class="transcript_line"> But her brother was Harvey the poet.</div><div id="00:56:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Harvey the poet? Who&#039;s he?</div><div id="00:56:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was a soldier. Remember he was the soldier poet?</div><div id="00:56:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:56:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s buried in... yeah, the church up there.</div><div id="00:56:47.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:56:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got his poetry books upstairs.</div><div id="00:56:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Have you?</div><div id="00:56:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So this was, well this would have been a steam train and...</div><div id="00:56:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go to Gloucester. Dad had fall asleep. It used to worry me. Because I think, well how do you know to get off?</div><div id="00:57:04.560" class="transcript_line"> It was a station. Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:57:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I used to go with him regularly to Gloucester.</div><div id="00:57:09.560" class="transcript_line"> What about the Severn Bridge? Do you remember when that was opened?</div><div id="00:57:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember it being built.</div><div id="00:57:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you?</div><div id="00:57:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I would have been about 17 would I then? No.</div><div id="00:57:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And does it make a big... I mean what do you remember about it being built?</div><div id="00:57:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Erm... remember that you could go over the other side of the water.</div><div id="00:57:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Without going all the way up around. Or unless you went over on the...</div><div id="00:57:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Severn Tunnel?</div><div id="00:57:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Or... Williamson&#039;s Down here used to have a... what do you call it? Take you across on the water. A boat.</div><div id="00:57:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:57:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Where from?</div><div id="00:57:52.560" class="transcript_line"> From Chesby. Where the Severn Bridge was. It went down... because I went to school in Chesby. Look, see? So I know all Bullwok and all that.</div><div id="00:57:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And you could take your car on this boat.</div><div id="00:58:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, what was it called?</div><div id="00:58:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Not Oust.</div><div id="00:58:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Oust?</div><div id="00:58:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Port Scuett.</div><div id="00:58:12.560" class="transcript_line"> No, farther up than that.</div><div id="00:58:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Sadbrook.</div><div id="00:58:16.560" class="transcript_line"> No, farther up. It was in Chepstow. It was...</div><div id="00:58:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, once the Severn Bridge got built, you know, people never used it. It was like transporting you from this side to the other.</div><div id="00:58:28.560" class="transcript_line"> You drove your car on it and you&#039;d go over the other. It might have been Oust. He was on...</div><div id="00:58:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think there is a famous Oust it is.</div><div id="00:58:36.560" class="transcript_line"> What was it like going across? Because it looks a bit precarious in photographs I&#039;ve seen.</div><div id="00:58:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I only went over once.</div><div id="00:58:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:58:44.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was with Geoff&#039;s auntie. She took us over on this boat. Well, and drove the car on it. If you went up and it was on it.</div><div id="00:58:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So you said that Williams, they live around here?</div><div id="00:58:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, that is the Williams.</div><div id="00:58:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the Andrean Williams?</div><div id="00:58:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, his father had it.</div><div id="00:59:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right, okay.</div><div id="00:59:02.560" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s only moved down here since they sold that up there. Look, he hadn&#039;t always been down here. No, it&#039;s only like late turn.</div><div id="00:59:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Ah, what about... Would you know the names of all the reams on your land?</div><div id="00:59:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:59:18.560" class="transcript_line"> You do? Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:59:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And what, further afield?</div><div id="00:59:22.560" class="transcript_line"> As far as Redwick.</div><div id="00:59:24.560" class="transcript_line"> As far as... Do you?</div><div id="00:59:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So when you&#039;re driving along in your car, could you say, oh, that&#039;s such and such and that&#039;s such and such?</div><div id="00:59:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Could you? That&#039;s really impressive.</div><div id="00:59:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because, like, Dad was from Redwick.</div><div id="00:59:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Um, I suppose Redwick, although I&#039;ve always lived here, born here and all that, I&#039;ve always got a love for Redwick.</div><div id="00:59:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I suppose because Dad&#039;s... My two brothers are buried here. One is buried over here, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:59:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you marry there?</div><div id="00:59:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes, in Redwick Church.</div><div id="01:00:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the shop then? The little shop?</div><div id="01:00:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, on the bottom by the crossroads.</div><div id="01:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, run by one of the howls, was it?</div><div id="01:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Now... Hang on.</div><div id="01:00:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Um, yes, Howells&#039;s mother had it, wasn&#039;t it? Mrs. Howells&#039;s mother.</div><div id="01:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Howells&#039;s grandmother. Duck Howells&#039;s grandmother, I think, had it.</div><div id="01:00:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:26.560" class="transcript_line"> I think, or something like that.</div><div id="01:00:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Now, wasn&#039;t the daughter there adopted or a niece?</div><div id="01:00:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes. His mother was adopted, yeah.</div><div id="01:00:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="01:00:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:36.560" class="transcript_line"> What was her name?</div><div id="01:00:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I used to go to that shop because when I said to you about Auntie Daisy, if on light nights you were in the shop,</div><div id="01:00:45.560" class="transcript_line"> you know, you could walk across the Islet ground, as I call it, up Mead Lane.</div><div id="01:00:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:53.560" class="transcript_line"> And then you came out by the church and then just walked along there.</div><div id="01:00:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And then she&#039;d buy me some sweets and we&#039;d get her a bit of shopping, then we&#039;d walk back down the Islet.</div><div id="01:01:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you what we used to do, I don&#039;t know if we&#039;re allowed to do it today.</div><div id="01:01:07.560" class="transcript_line"> In the Islet ground, there were lovely cow slips.</div><div id="01:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Cow slips. So I always used to pick a bunch of cow slips from them.</div><div id="01:01:15.560" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re not supposed to pick them today, are you?</div><div id="01:01:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really? How lovely.</div><div id="01:01:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was full of cow slips. The Island ground was, and the Island ground is right at the bottom.</div><div id="01:01:25.560" class="transcript_line"> When Mead Lane comes into the steelworks, which they made the road down there, you just go that way, through that gateway,</div><div id="01:01:34.560" class="transcript_line"> and two fields in was the Island ground.</div><div id="01:01:37.560" class="transcript_line"> The Highland ground?</div><div id="01:01:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was called the Island ground.</div><div id="01:01:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Why was it called that?</div><div id="01:01:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it had a little bit of a mound in it or something.</div><div id="01:01:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And they picked some cow slips when they were out.</div><div id="01:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Never dug any up mine or nothing like that.</div><div id="01:01:51.560" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re not supposed to pick them today, are you?</div><div id="01:01:54.560" class="transcript_line"> I mowed some in my garden the other day.</div><div id="01:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were just going over.</div><div id="01:01:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, going over.

And we have been flooded here where we couldn&#039;t get out.</div><div id="01:06:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:06:34.560" class="transcript_line"> One was up to our gate that comes on the back.</div><div id="01:06:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:06:38.560" class="transcript_line"> And all Chapel Road in the low bits then was all flooded over, you know, we couldn&#039;t either...</div><div id="01:06:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we have been flooded here, but never up to the house.</div><div id="01:06:49.560" class="transcript_line"> But we never think of...</div><div id="01:06:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we&#039;d have to get a boat, wouldn&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:06:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Never think of being actual flooded.</div><div id="01:07:00.560" class="transcript_line"> When was the Great Floods?</div><div id="01:07:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, you mean...</div><div id="01:07:05.560" class="transcript_line"> In the churches and all that.</div><div id="01:07:07.560" class="transcript_line"> 1606 I think it was.</div><div id="01:07:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because they say that was a tsunami, don&#039;t they, already?</div><div id="01:07:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:07:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, I didn&#039;t see that.</div><div id="01:07:15.560" class="transcript_line"> So what caused the flood that time then, when you were here?</div><div id="01:07:18.560" class="transcript_line"> It was coming over the wall.</div><div id="01:07:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you, one day we went up...</div><div id="01:07:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it Linmouth got flooded?</div><div id="01:07:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:07:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I shouldn&#039;t say it, but it was a good job, because that night we went to see it,</div><div id="01:07:35.560" class="transcript_line"> because it was lapping over the wall, and we went to see it down the corridor, because</div><div id="01:07:38.560" class="transcript_line"> we got land on the corridor, steelworks, you know, which goes to the sea wall.</div><div id="01:07:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And we went up there and it was just about to come over the wall.</div><div id="01:07:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And then next day, because I thought, oh Jesus, we&#039;ve got land, we&#039;ve got cattle down here.</div><div id="01:07:54.560" class="transcript_line"> That must be so daunting seeing that.</div><div id="01:07:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I was worried about the cattle, you know.</div><div id="01:07:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, then next day on the news, when I put on the wireless, Linmouth had had it, and</div><div id="01:08:02.560" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh thank God it went that way and not our way.</div><div id="01:08:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I mean, we&#039;re more or less opposite of it.</div><div id="01:08:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:10.560" class="transcript_line"> That we would have had it then, because we went down just to see and sit on the wall</div><div id="01:08:14.560" class="transcript_line"> to see what was happening, and it was just about that much starting to...</div><div id="01:08:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you keep an eye on weather conditions then, just in case of the high tides and...</div><div id="01:08:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, they are looking after us quite well now.</div><div id="01:08:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:30.560" class="transcript_line"> They do put the boards, if it&#039;s going to be really to stop it coming up.</div><div id="01:08:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:36.560" class="transcript_line"> But if the boards...</div><div id="01:08:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, we&#039;ve got new boards now, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:08:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, where they wind them.</div><div id="01:08:44.560" class="transcript_line"> You could get salt water right up through Chapel Ream when the tides was really going,</div><div id="01:08:49.560" class="transcript_line"> when we had the old boards, because I think the weight and the drift of it would move them.</div><div id="01:08:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, you get salt water right past us here.</div><div id="01:08:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:08:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Crikey.</div><div id="01:09:00.560" class="transcript_line"> So how far are we from the seawall here?</div><div id="01:09:02.560" class="transcript_line"> What would it be?</div><div id="01:09:03.560" class="transcript_line"> About a mile and a half, we&#039;re really...</div><div id="01:09:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Crikey.</div><div id="01:09:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Right down the road.</div><div id="01:09:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because there&#039;s one at the bottom there, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="01:09:09.560" class="transcript_line"> The gout.</div><div id="01:09:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, there&#039;s no wall there, is there?</div><div id="01:09:13.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a filter off, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="01:09:15.560" class="transcript_line"> So do you still have grips on your land?</div><div id="01:09:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Still got the old grips.</div><div id="01:09:21.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve never been drained, you know.</div><div id="01:09:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Because they work effectively for you.</div><div id="01:09:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when your grip&#039;s full up, you know, go on the end.</div><div id="01:09:28.560" class="transcript_line"> But I tell them it&#039;s the tractors they&#039;re driving that cracks the pipes on the end.</div><div id="01:09:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you think so?</div><div id="01:09:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s got to be weight on it.</div><div id="01:09:37.560" class="transcript_line"> It only used to be cows or horses, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:09:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Or, well, the tractors are getting heavier and heavier.</div><div id="01:09:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And bigger and bigger.</div><div id="01:09:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Bigger, yeah.</div><div id="01:09:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So in your father&#039;s time, was it still horse drawn?</div><div id="01:09:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="01:09:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you?</div><div id="01:09:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I used to ride the horse.</div><div id="01:09:52.560" class="transcript_line"> We had a horse.</div><div id="01:09:53.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d make the A-Ricks in the field.</div><div id="01:09:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And they used to have a horse in front of it like a wooden sweep.</div><div id="01:10:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:10:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d row it up and the horse would be pulling it up.</div><div id="01:10:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Dad used to chuck me on there, put me on their backs.</div><div id="01:10:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:10:08.560" class="transcript_line"> To ride the horse down.</div><div id="01:10:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So are there any words that you&#039;ve used around here that might not be used anywhere else?</div><div id="01:10:16.560" class="transcript_line"> I never thought of that.</div><div id="01:10:20.560" class="transcript_line"> All traditions or myths or ghost stories or folk stories.</div><div id="01:10:27.560" class="transcript_line"> I did love the folk stories.</div><div id="01:10:30.560" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:10:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Any old characters that you remember around here?</div><div id="01:10:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, old Mad Jack, Derby Joe, old Bob Groves.</div><div id="01:10:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Who were they?</div><div id="01:10:48.560" class="transcript_line"> They used to come around when you were busy and live in your couch head or something like</div><div id="01:10:54.560" class="transcript_line"> that and have food and do work on the farms.</div><div id="01:10:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:10:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:10:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know where they...</div><div id="01:11:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Bill Newport.</div><div id="01:11:01.560" class="transcript_line"> There was lots of them.</div><div id="01:11:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know where they came from or anything like that and their background?</div><div id="01:11:08.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:11:09.560" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="01:11:10.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:11:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Are you too young to remember the war?</div><div id="01:11:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was born in 41.</div><div id="01:11:17.560" class="transcript_line"> So you wouldn&#039;t remember?</div><div id="01:11:18.560" class="transcript_line"> I was born when it was...</div><div id="01:11:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Apparently...</div><div id="01:11:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, this house here had all the windows...</div><div id="01:11:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Bombs dropped on the shed on the end of the house and blew all the windows in.</div><div id="01:11:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Mamma always used to...</div><div id="01:11:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t it sound daft.</div><div id="01:11:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Put us under the kitchen table.</div><div id="01:11:40.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard that from several people actually.</div><div id="01:11:43.560" class="transcript_line"> But it does sound daft, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:11:45.560" class="transcript_line"> What would the kitchen table do?</div><div id="01:11:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And we still got the same table in the kitchen now.</div><div id="01:11:50.560" class="transcript_line"> You haven&#039;t.</div><div id="01:11:51.560" class="transcript_line"> I have.</div><div id="01:11:52.560" class="transcript_line"> It was a good table then.</div><div id="01:11:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll show it to you.</div><div id="01:11:55.560" class="transcript_line"> In my kitchen there, the table...</div><div id="01:11:59.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the table I can always remember.</div><div id="01:12:04.560" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="01:12:05.560" class="transcript_line"> From a kid sat at the same table.</div><div id="01:12:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So would you...</div><div id="01:12:12.560" class="transcript_line"> We haven&#039;t altered it a lot.</div><div id="01:12:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I mean?</div><div id="01:12:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:16.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a junk room upstairs.</div><div id="01:12:19.560" class="transcript_line"> I expect everybody have.</div><div id="01:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Which...</div><div id="01:12:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Lots of things in there.</div><div id="01:12:29.560" class="transcript_line"> I got lots of photographs too when I get down to digging around in there.</div><div id="01:12:34.560" class="transcript_line"> If you have any photographs, I would love to see them.</div><div id="01:12:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I got photographs up there.</div><div id="01:12:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you might need to dig around for them.</div><div id="01:12:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So what is it? What&#039;s special about this place, this area?</div><div id="01:12:56.560" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s special?</div><div id="01:12:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it&#039;s special because we got...</div><div id="01:13:00.560" class="transcript_line"> On the part of the farm here too, we&#039;ve got an ancient monument where you can&#039;t dig.</div><div id="01:13:05.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a tent where they say it was a burial ground.</div><div id="01:13:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:13:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t touch it.</div><div id="01:13:11.560" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t blow it. You don&#039;t do anything to it. You can mow it. You can graze it.</div><div id="01:13:15.560" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re not allowed to...</div><div id="01:13:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Disturb it?</div><div id="01:13:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, you&#039;re not allowed to do a... What do they do? Metal detector?</div><div id="01:13:23.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not allowed to do anything.</div><div id="01:13:25.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s by the cottage that joins us on the far end of the farm.</div><div id="01:13:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Apparently it was the man from the ancient monument&#039;s core one day.</div><div id="01:13:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think he...

Well, yeah, there was a cider press but we used to have a travelling press.</div><div id="01:15:48.560" class="transcript_line"> A man come around and do the cider in the front yard, I got photographs of that somewhere.</div><div id="01:15:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Melville Jones.</div><div id="01:15:54.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the one!</div><div id="01:15:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:15:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Who was he then?

I can remember all that.</div><div id="01:16:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, if you find those photographs I would love to see them.</div><div id="01:16:12.560" class="transcript_line"> I know, I can.</div><div id="01:16:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.

Oh, did you ever go to Whitsun Sioux?</div><div id="01:16:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Mrs Mayberry, Whitsun Sioux, yes.</div><div id="01:16:33.560" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely.</div><div id="01:16:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:16:35.560" class="transcript_line"> She was a lovely old lady.</div><div id="01:16:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Was she?</div><div id="01:16:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she was lovely.</div><div id="01:16:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:16:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And in her latter years she had a deer at the Sioux, right?</div><div id="01:16:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:16:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And she had to keep it tethered down because every time she&#039;d let it go it landed here with us.</div><div id="01:16:48.560" class="transcript_line"> In the end she&#039;d give it to us.</div><div id="01:16:50.560" class="transcript_line"> She gave you the deer?</div><div id="01:16:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, it stayed with our cattle. We fed it in the shed and all. It would stay with her.</div><div id="01:16:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d be fed up coming to get it and then they tethered it over there.</div><div id="01:17:01.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was coming up here to you?</div><div id="01:17:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was coming across the hills. Because like the Sioux was already just like there across.</div><div id="01:17:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:17:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And it stayed with our cattle all the time. And she said in the end, she said, oh, I&#039;m going to give you the deer.</div><div id="01:17:17.560" class="transcript_line"> She said, leave it home. And never left us. It died in the shed up the common. Happy with us. Never bothered as long as we were there.</div><div id="01:17:24.560" class="transcript_line"> And what used to amuse me, she used to take all, if you had an animal die, you took it over to her and she&#039;d put it into the lions.</div><div id="01:17:32.560" class="transcript_line"> She had lions there.</div><div id="01:17:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I heard that, yeah.</div><div id="01:17:35.560" class="transcript_line"> But oh, she had to keep these lions in. Oh, a good fence around there, yeah.</div><div id="01:17:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:17:40.560" class="transcript_line"> But like the old fashioned chain arrows, you know, what they pull behind the level of ground.</div><div id="01:17:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;ll always remember, she used to open up, we used to get money for the church.</div><div id="01:17:54.560" class="transcript_line"> She did and all that. She&#039;d open one of her rooms and we&#039;d play whist in the house there.</div><div id="01:18:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, about once a month she&#039;d have us playing whist. We&#039;d be playing whist and all the money went to charity.</div><div id="01:18:07.560" class="transcript_line"> She was lovely.</div><div id="01:18:09.560" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="01:18:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you see the lions and the bears there?</div><div id="01:18:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yeah, well, no, this is what I was going to tell you.</div><div id="01:18:15.560" class="transcript_line"> She had, people used to take, they used to have trips out from town, you know, to see them.</div><div id="01:18:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, she put the two bears together this day when this trip was coming.</div><div id="01:18:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, they arrived and all of a sudden they started to fight and one nearly killed the other.</div><div id="01:18:33.560" class="transcript_line"> But the two bears did together. Oh, she was a lovely lady.</div><div id="01:18:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, someone was telling me over at Porton that they could sometimes hear the lion roar.</div><div id="01:18:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we heard you when the wind was in our direction.</div><div id="01:18:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:18:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And she had peacocks and all their luck. Well, you could hear them squawking. Monkeys she had, she had everything.</div><div id="01:18:54.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll always remember this one day. The monkeys had broke out.</div><div id="01:19:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="01:19:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah? Well, the vet had to come to shoot them and we were having to...</div><div id="01:19:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Who was the vet then?</div><div id="01:19:07.560" class="transcript_line"> What are you doing down here with the gun? Why I didn&#039;t want to see you, Kathy, he said.</div><div id="01:19:12.560" class="transcript_line"> What are you doing? He said, I&#039;ve got to shoot, there&#039;s a couple monkeys up the tree over there.</div><div id="01:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, and I&#039;m going to go shoot these monkeys.</div><div id="01:19:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And we laughed, I didn&#039;t believe him. And he said, yeah.</div><div id="01:19:26.560" class="transcript_line"> All right, then I said, we&#039;ll sit on the road and wait. No, we&#039;ll come back along after and see if you had them.</div><div id="01:19:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you shot him. I said two or three, he chopped these monkeys.</div><div id="01:19:36.560" class="transcript_line"> I think Margaret was telling me that.</div><div id="01:19:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:19:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Just going back to the cider, so did your dad make cider?</div><div id="01:19:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:19:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Where did he keep it?</div><div id="01:19:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, where that kitchen is there. That was the cider casks used to be on things and barrels. I still got a couple of them.</div><div id="01:19:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:19:55.560" class="transcript_line"> The taps that you tap into the...</div><div id="01:19:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And was it just for your own consumption?</div><div id="01:20:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, but everybody had come here and sort of had cider. I can remember about four or five, they&#039;d arrive and they&#039;d be drinking cider and not drunk.</div><div id="01:20:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, just sociable.</div><div id="01:20:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:20:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:20:15.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think, yes, dad used to play, because he used to come from Redwick to you as well.</div><div id="01:20:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:20:25.560" class="transcript_line"> What did he use to play? A game called Penny something?</div><div id="01:20:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Shove Penny.</div><div id="01:20:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Shove Penny.</div><div id="01:20:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:20:32.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think they used to play with, you know...</div><div id="01:20:36.560" class="transcript_line"> This must have been a fantastic place to grow up in here.</div><div id="01:20:40.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;s lots of things.</div><div id="01:20:42.560" class="transcript_line"> He sounds like quite a character.</div><div id="01:20:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was. He went to town, somebody brought a rabbit for me. Oh, hang on, I think it was...</div><div id="01:20:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I can&#039;t think of her name now, but I always wanted a rabbit, right?</div><div id="01:21:02.560" class="transcript_line"> So on a Wednesday, he said when he left, he was... this lady, oh, God, I don&#039;t know what her name was, bringing me in a rabbit.</div><div id="01:21:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, dad used to ride his bike to Newport Market, look, before we had a car.</div><div id="01:21:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:21:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Right?</div><div id="01:21:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:21:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it wasn&#039;t far up there. And he took a bag with him, or a frame or a bag on the bike, right?</div><div id="01:21:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, then he&#039;d gone and had a drink in the White Hart pub.</div><div id="01:21:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:21:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, coming home with the rabbit on the bike, he killed my rabbit because he fell off the bike or the bag got caught in the wheel. I cried my eyes out.</div><div id="01:21:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div id="01:21:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:21:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div id="01:21:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I shouldn&#039;t laugh, really.</div><div id="01:21:47.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t at the time because I broke my heart. I was looking forward to this rabbit. They&#039;d even made me a little wooden hatch.</div><div id="01:21:53.560" class="transcript_line"> But the rabbit... I think it had either got caught in the wheel or...</div><div id="01:21:59.560" class="transcript_line"> One of the others.</div><div id="01:22:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:22:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:22:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And he brought the dead rabbit home.</div><div id="01:22:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="01:22:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Baby chicken in the garden.</div><div id="01:22:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div id="01:22:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh, hi, the shawls and the rabbit.</div><div id="01:22:11.560" class="transcript_line"> So was there a livestock market in Newport?</div><div id="01:22:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:22:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it a big one?</div><div id="01:22:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.

And then when my two brothers died, look, I was left here then to farm the thing.</div><div id="01:22:28.560" class="transcript_line"> And I used to go to the Newport market every Wednesday, take the stock in, you know, in a box to market.</div><div id="01:22:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Then they went to Abergavenny, they closed, they went to Abergavenny and now it&#039;s Raglan.</div><div id="01:22:45.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was a... Yes, because they still got a little bit of the old market. They didn&#039;t let them take it down, did they?</div><div id="01:22:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, as there was, yeah.</div><div id="01:22:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:22:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:22:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But the docks, did you ever go to the docks?</div><div id="01:22:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yes, because we used to love to go to see the docks on a Sunday because you were allowed in there.</div><div id="01:23:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:23:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And you pedal your bikes, look, and you go and watch the ships and the big ships and nobody ever saw you.</div><div id="01:23:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:23:15.560" class="transcript_line"> But now you can&#039;t get in there now, can you?</div><div id="01:23:16.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s all securities.</div><div id="01:23:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="01:23:18.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all securities.</div><div id="01:23:19.560" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t get... I went to a funeral once, but I jibbed on going out on the boat. She wanted her ashes spread out to sea, look, and on the tugboat would they take him out on it?</div><div id="01:23:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:23:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:23:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was Auntie Clara&#039;s sister, I know what it was, and Auntie Clara lost her sight, so I used to take her and the rest of them, they had no children, wherever they wanted to go, I&#039;d take them, it didn&#039;t embarrass me.</div><div id="01:23:47.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he used to like a drop of drink, Uncle Perth&#039;s did, and there was a club on Conwy Road in Newport, it was men only, right? Pioneer Club.</div><div id="01:23:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And he got that he couldn&#039;t go, because I used to take him on a Wednesday, pick him up on the way back home from market, he had a couple hours there with his mates, you know.</div><div id="01:24:10.560" class="transcript_line"> But he got then he couldn&#039;t go.</div><div id="01:24:13.560" class="transcript_line"> How am I going to manage, because you know women are allowed in, I was allowed to go in and pick him up, but you couldn&#039;t have a drink or anything, you know, but I never drank him alive.</div><div id="01:24:25.560" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d go and pick him up on a Wednesday, Kathy said I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to come much more, he said I&#039;m getting feeble.</div><div id="01:24:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, alright then, I wonder could you pick it up for me, I said, but they might not serve me, you know, we&#039;d better make sure they&#039;ll, I&#039;ll take your crate up and bring it back.</div><div id="01:24:48.560" class="transcript_line"> So the following week he, I went in and Stuart, Stuart, aren&#039;t they in the club, he said, you&#039;re Kathy, aren&#039;t you? Yes, I said, he said, yeah, my wife says she knows you, because she&#039;s usually here on a Wednesday.</div><div id="01:25:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what trouble am I in now? Because I was allowed to go in and pick him up, look he&#039;d be sat in a chair and all that.</div><div id="01:25:11.560" class="transcript_line"> No trouble at all, he said, but we&#039;re going to let you come in and pick his case up every week, you bring the empties and you can pay for it for him.</div><div id="01:25:22.560" class="transcript_line"> And then he said you can bring him up to the Christmas party, they&#039;ll allow you to stay with him if he wants.</div><div id="01:25:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I laughed, but you won&#039;t be allowed to drink in your mind, but you can stay with him, because his sight was going about you.</div><div id="01:25:38.560" class="transcript_line"> That is so funny, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:25:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was funny, and my mother was alive then and she said, the jobs you do, you&#039;re going to get into trouble one day, I said, you&#039;ve got to help somebody when they&#039;re going blind.</div><div id="01:25:53.560" class="transcript_line"> But then his wife went into hospital, now this was the funniest part, because we&#039;ve got another farm up the road and they lived on the end, right?</div><div id="01:26:01.560" class="transcript_line"> She had cancer, and she had to go in to have her breasts removed, and he&#039;d only go in with me, right?</div><div id="01:26:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Well then, Auntie Clara was there a fortnight, and I thought, oh my God, he wouldn&#039;t allow it, I could go in the kitchen, I tidied that up, but I thought, oh I wonder what the bed is like, you know?</div><div id="01:26:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Because there was news now, she was coming home, I thought, oh my God, he&#039;d been sleeping up there.</div><div id="01:26:36.560" class="transcript_line"> So I said to him, I said, Uncle Perth, I&#039;m coming up tomorrow, alright, he said, do you know, I went up there the following day, I said, I&#039;m going upstairs to strip your bed, I know it all is clean.</div><div id="01:26:49.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, oh you can&#039;t go upstairs, he said, people will talk about us.</div><div id="01:26:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Now he was so deep-lied, I said, don&#039;t be so stupid.</div><div id="01:27:01.560" class="transcript_line"> He said, well he said, if you do, draw the curtains, so as nobody can see you upstairs.</div><div id="01:27:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="01:27:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Well I thought it was hilarious, so that night then, I went in, took him in to see Auntie Clara, she said, hope to be home on the weekend, I said, well I&#039;ve been up and stripped all the beds and all that, I said, but you&#039;ll never guess.</div><div id="01:27:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what have you done?</div><div id="01:27:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Well I said, he wouldn&#039;t let me go upstairs to start with, he said, because people would be talking.</div><div id="01:27:34.560" class="transcript_line"> But I said, he did then, allow me upstairs, but I had to draw the curtains so as nobody could see you, for they were going on the road, I was upstairs changing the bed.</div><div id="01:27:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, just priceless, that&#039;s wonderful.</div><div id="01:27:46.560" class="transcript_line"> And we laughed over it, and always, you know, I mean, she finished up in her home, but every so often she&#039;d say, I can never forget Perth being like that with you.</div><div id="01:27:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, I was only about 30 and he was about 70-odd, you know, it was so funny, I never dreamt of it.</div><div id="01:28:05.560" class="transcript_line"> I thought, go up and strip the beds and put them all clean and put the cleaner around, because she didn&#039;t have a hoover in those days, look.</div><div id="01:28:13.560" class="transcript_line"> It was a pusher, well, or carry the mats downstairs and shake them and mop around.</div><div id="01:28:19.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;d be lovely for her to come home, well, it&#039;d be, you know, but he didn&#039;t mind me doing it downstairs, look.</div><div id="01:28:25.560" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t like me upstairs.</div><div id="01:28:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I think he was all on edge, that he wanted me to...</div><div id="01:28:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I said, it&#039;s very traditional and worried about what people would say, they saw a woman up there, maybe...</div><div id="01:28:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I was always there, like downstairs, but, you know, I think...</div><div id="01:28:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I laughed, I couldn&#039;t believe it, I couldn&#039;t stop laughing, I thought, oh my God, would they think like that?</div><div id="01:28:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;d be amazed, wouldn&#039;t you really, sometimes?</div><div id="01:28:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but she was in hospital, they had no children or anything, you know.</div><div id="01:29:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he was having, he had a good job on the railway.</div><div id="01:29:04.560" class="transcript_line"> What was he doing?</div><div id="01:29:06.560" class="transcript_line"> He was over, oh, didcot.</div><div id="01:29:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="01:29:10.560" class="transcript_line"> He was up a didcot, he had one of the boss&#039;s jobs up a didcot.</div><div id="01:29:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:29:14.560" class="transcript_line"> And she was a schoolteacher, Auntie Clara was, never had no children, they didn&#039;t, I don&#039;t know whether they could or didn&#039;t want to, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:29:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t suppose there are any diaries in your family or letters or receipts and that sort of thing, Kath, at all?</div><div id="01:29:29.560" class="transcript_line"> It could be in the drawer upstairs.</div><div id="01:29:32.560" class="transcript_line"> In my junk room.</div><div id="01:29:34.560" class="transcript_line"> In my junk room?</div><div id="01:29:36.560" class="transcript_line"> I just want to check, let me just check this.</div><div id="01:29:39.560" class="transcript_line"> So, we&#039;ve been talking for an hour and a half, should I turn it off now?</div><div id="01:29:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you better.</div><div id="01:29:46.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;m always aware when I...</div></div></p>
