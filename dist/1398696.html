class="transcript_line"> In caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons,</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> In damp front farmhouse pallets,</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And we chased the English, the bears,</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And before the motor car, before the wheel,</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the Duchess faced horse,</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> When we rode the daft and happy hills bareback,</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It snowed and snowed.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Snow that swam and drifted out of the arms and hands of bodies of trees,</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Snow that grew overnight on the roofs of the houses,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a pure and grandfather moss,</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Minutely white, ivy the walls,</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And settled like a dumb thunderstorm of white-tone Christmas cards.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Mistletoe howled from the gas brackets in all the front parlours.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There were sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessert spoons,</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And cats in their furibolds watched the fires,</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the melon pokers.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Uncles sat in the front parlours without their collars,</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Trying their new cigars, holding them judiciously at arm&#039;s length,</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Returning them to their mouths, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And a few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, or anywhere else for that matter,</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Sat on the very edges of their chairs, poised and brittle,</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Afraid to break like faded cups and saucers.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We are not our ever-dislike health,</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> When we are sad in our death-loving health,</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Or when our present is in the fire,</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> For so time never our well-required.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Monachor lead honour high, our bow young</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> O&#039;er the land of the free and the home of the

At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house,</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night,</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand, in case,</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and all of us too brave to say a word.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant,</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and maybe web-footed men, freezing in caves.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We reached the black bulk of the house.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What shall we give them?
