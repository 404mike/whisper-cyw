    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so this is Jim Barrett interviewing Mike Williams in his lovely music room at</div><div id="00:00:13.520" class="transcript_line"> his home on the 26th of February 2018. Mike has signed the project consent form and this</div><div id="00:00:21.640" class="transcript_line"> interview is being recorded for Wonder Bros 25 project funded by HLF Cymru. Right Mike,</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> so when did you first come across Wonder Bros? That would be at the Holly Bush pub in</div><div id="00:00:37.240" class="transcript_line"> Opkinstone in about 1997 or 98 when I was going there for the Ponder Breeze motorcycle club and</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> discovered a group of musicians, interesting looking types, in the back in the back room</div><div id="00:00:56.240" class="transcript_line"> and got talking to Richard Evans who&#039;s a trumpet player and I came down with my trombone that</div><div id="00:01:03.320" class="transcript_line"> belonged to my grandfather that went through the Great War and they suggested I take it home,</div><div id="00:01:08.440" class="transcript_line"> put it in a glass case and play this brand new valve trombone that they got from a lottery grant</div><div id="00:01:13.760" class="transcript_line"> and I took up the valve trombone and continued. Lovely, so you&#039;ve been playing before, what sort</div><div id="00:01:23.720" class="transcript_line"> of playing had you done before? Oh yeah, I played in a brass band, I played in school,</div><div id="00:01:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Midgley Morgan Youth Brass Band and then when I left I thought where&#039;s the nearest band?</div><div id="00:01:32.440" class="transcript_line"> Then it was Lady Unsubble, Lady Windsor Colliery Band where I played cornet and tenor horn for a</div><div id="00:01:39.200" class="transcript_line"> couple of years and visited many many interesting places such as Blackpool and Pontains Rest and</div><div id="00:01:47.720" class="transcript_line"> Supermae, brass band competitions. I then gave it up for about ten years and it was only after</div><div id="00:01:53.080" class="transcript_line"> buffing it to Richard that I decided to take it back up. And what did you think of Wonder Bros in</div><div id="00:01:58.600" class="transcript_line"> comparison to your brass bands? Totally wild really, it was a totally different situation,</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> the brass band spent most of the time drinking actually but within two weeks of joining Wonder</div><div id="00:02:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Brass I was on stage in Brecon Jazz standing next to very experienced trombonists, pretending I</div><div id="00:02:20.280" class="transcript_line"> knew what I was doing but it was great, yeah, I really enjoyed it. Are there any particular</div><div id="00:02:25.160" class="transcript_line"> gigs that sort of stand out in your memory? Oh, there were some amazing times, the trip to</div><div id="00:02:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Paris to support Pont Reprise in their match against Stade Francais, it was an amazing weekend</div><div id="00:02:37.440" class="transcript_line"> in the Wonder Bus and we actually drunk the bar dry after coming out of the match. Ponti didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:46.600" class="transcript_line"> win, I won&#039;t mention the score but we had a great time. Any other gigs that you remember? Well,</div><div id="00:02:54.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean the most amazing gigs I think that I enjoyed really were at Cork Jazz in 99,</div><div id="00:03:01.080" class="transcript_line"> where we all travelled over by road through Rosley and all the way down to Cork, put up a</div><div id="00:03:09.280" class="transcript_line"> hotel for the weekend and played five gigs, played a thousand seat room, we didn&#039;t have a</div><div id="00:03:13.360" class="transcript_line"> thousand people sitting in it actually but they were amazing gigs and the Metropole in the centre</div><div id="00:03:19.280" class="transcript_line"> of Cork City were some fantastic gigs and the other players, that weekend we had Roy A&#039;s in</div><div id="00:03:27.400" class="transcript_line"> the next world famous jazz musician in the room next to us which is an amazing weekend in Cork.</div><div id="00:03:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic. Yeah, and sort of, well, how is it, why did you sort of stop playing with Wonder</div><div id="00:03:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Brass? What was the reason? Family commitments really, my wife noticed that every weekend I was</div><div id="00:03:50.640" class="transcript_line"> off from this band of musicians and there wasn&#039;t any income which of course that&#039;s with you,</div><div id="00:03:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Wonder Brass, that&#039;s what also makes it so special really that it is totally out there.</div><div id="00:04:03.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was just, yeah, I was taking up too much time, I had a young family and I had a break and</div><div id="00:04:11.520" class="transcript_line"> never went back. So regret the day, regret the day. But have you been doing any other playing since?</div><div id="00:04:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I kept, a couple of years later I bought myself a trumpet because I realised that the</div><div id="00:04:24.720" class="transcript_line"> trombone was a bit heavy to carry around and my dad actually, who&#039;s passed away now, bought me a</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> nice x-rental trumpet from a shop in Cardiff and I continued on with Ponderbury Jazz Club once a</div><div id="00:04:39.440" class="transcript_line"> month. I really enjoyed, I still do. And over the last four years we&#039;ve got a band together</div><div id="00:04:46.720" class="transcript_line"> called The Unforgiven where I sing, I pushed forward as a vocalist and found out that I could</div><div id="00:04:52.400" class="transcript_line"> sing without making people run out the room so I was quite amazed by that and still play trumpet</div><div id="00:04:58.640" class="transcript_line"> as well with the band. Great. And do you think those are things that you might not have done if</div><div id="00:05:04.400" class="transcript_line"> you hadn&#039;t been in Wunder Bros? Oh I&#039;m sure, yeah. I mean, I would probably have never realised</div><div id="00:05:11.440" class="transcript_line"> that I still had that love for music, you know, and had those opportunities. It was great. The gigs</div><div id="00:05:17.440" class="transcript_line"> were amazing gigs from South Wales Mining Club to, South Wales Caving Club, sorry, to many</div><div id="00:05:27.280" class="transcript_line"> nights in Cardiff at places that don&#039;t exist anymore such as the Baltimore and the New Year&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:34.080" class="transcript_line"> parades out of Cardiff Castle were fantastic. A bit uncomfortable though, a bit freezing cold but</div><div id="00:05:41.440" class="transcript_line"> yeah, excellent times. Okay, so you&#039;ve taken up singing since Wunder Bros? Yeah, I&#039;ve come out</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> to the shower, I&#039;m singing in the shower and I&#039;ve gone in front of a microphone here and it&#039;s working</div><div id="00:05:55.600" class="transcript_line"> okay at the present. Yeah, any other instruments you&#039;ve taken up? Yeah, I have actually, I can</div><div id="00:06:02.400" class="transcript_line"> learn to play the guitar, I can strum. I&#039;ve been playing about three or four years and I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:06:08.720" class="transcript_line"> got two nice examples, an electric acoustic and what I call a Chuck Berry guitar with F holes and</div><div id="00:06:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I do play a few numbers on stage which is, I think it&#039;s very interesting because you can also sing</div><div id="00:06:21.760" class="transcript_line"> at the same time. Okay, so presumably you hadn&#039;t done any improvisation before you joined Wunder Bros?</div><div id="00:06:29.760" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s true, that&#039;s true, yeah. In the brass band it&#039;s quite regimented, you play the dots</div><div id="00:06:35.040" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s it, and that&#039;s it really. Even tunes that are jazz tunes are the set melody so</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah, I find that, you know, I&#039;m still developing that. I think music is a lifelong</div><div id="00:06:52.080" class="transcript_line"> development really but yeah, Wunder Bros helped me with that. So would you say that it was Wunder</div><div id="00:06:58.480" class="transcript_line"> Bros that got you into playing music sort of more by ear, less off the dots? Yeah, definitely,</div><div id="00:07:05.680" class="transcript_line"> definitely. I mean most of the time we didn&#039;t use sheet music in Wunder Bros. I can still</div><div id="00:07:11.360" class="transcript_line"> remember, still play the tunes by ear that we played in Wunder Bros because they&#039;re in my memory.</div><div id="00:07:19.360" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s definitely made a change, added something to your musical abilities and</div><div id="00:07:26.400" class="transcript_line"> taken you somewhere that you might not have gone. Even all that, what sort of grade did you get on</div><div id="00:07:31.200" class="transcript_line"> the, up to on the corner before you? I think I did great, I remember doing great up to grade four</div><div id="00:07:37.840" class="transcript_line"> right when I was a teenager. Okay. That was as far as it went then. So it&#039;s sort of taken you</div><div id="00:07:44.480" class="transcript_line"> beyond your sort of, as it were, your academic musical career. Yeah, I don&#039;t know what grade</div><div id="00:07:53.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be judged to be now. I don&#039;t know. I wouldn&#039;t say I was a great trumpet player.</div><div id="00:07:59.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ve been seeing some Wunder Bros gigs in the last couple of years at the Globe and</div><div id="00:08:07.040" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff, it was a fantastic one, and there&#039;s some trumpet solos played there that surpassed my</div><div id="00:08:13.600" class="transcript_line"> my achievements. But yeah, it&#039;s definitely, definitely advanced my playing.</div><div id="00:08:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Would you want to get involved with Wunder Bros again, perhaps as part of this project?</div><div id="00:08:28.320" class="transcript_line"> I have thought about it, yeah. I definitely want to expand my playing because I&#039;m just playing</div><div id="00:08:37.040" class="transcript_line"> a set list of about 20 tunes.</div><div id="00:08:42.240" class="transcript_line"> And I think, yeah, if I could fit it in time, obviously, I work</div><div id="00:08:46.320" class="transcript_line"> forward it five days a week. Yeah, I&#039;d like to do some more with Wunder Bros.</div><div id="00:08:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay, well, we&#039;ll have to see what&#039;s possible. Okay. Okay, thanks, Mark.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:09:06.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing what you remember. It&#039;s that. Let&#039;s have you start asking any questions.</div><div id="00:09:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Cold as a...</div><div id="00:09:19.440" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s this?</div></div></p>
