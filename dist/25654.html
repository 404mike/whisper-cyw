The 135 mile route runs in a horseshoe shape and is completely contained in the county</div><div id="00:00:22.200" class="transcript_line"> of Powys. Owen Glyndwr, after which the trail is named, was the last native Welsh person</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> to hold the title Prince of Wales. His hero status was assured after an ultimately unsuccessful</div><div id="00:00:36.840" class="transcript_line"> but long running revolt against English rule of Wales at the start of the 15th century.</div><div id="00:00:42.560" class="transcript_line"> His revolution led to the liberation of North and Central Wales in 1401 and he was at nearby</div><div id="00:00:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Manedd Hyfgen to the west and he led his small army to the first major victory in the field</div><div id="00:00:55.380" class="transcript_line"> later that year. In response, King Henry IV issued anti-Welsh legislation designed</div><div id="00:01:02.620" class="transcript_line"> to re-establish English dominance in Wales. All it did though was push many more Welshmen</div><div id="00:01:08.820" class="transcript_line"> into rebellion. In 1408 however, nearby Harlech and Aberystwyth</div><div id="00:01:14.860" class="transcript_line"> castles had fallen to the English King and to avoid imprisonment he fled.
