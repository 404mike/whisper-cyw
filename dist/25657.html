I know it looks odd in the middle of the mountain.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Looking across the lake you will see a distinctively green piece of land, unlike that of its heather-clad</div><div id="00:00:12.280" class="transcript_line"> neighbours, which provides us with a window into the past.</div><div id="00:00:16.840" class="transcript_line"> People forget how much of a desperate situation that we were in as a nation.</div><div id="00:00:21.400" class="transcript_line"> Immediately after the Second World War we were in rationing for many years after the</div><div id="00:00:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And so obviously the government had subsidies that promoted the use of every scrap of land</div><div id="00:00:34.160" class="transcript_line"> they could possibly get their hands on for the production of food.</div><div id="00:00:38.120" class="transcript_line"> With incentives for much greater food production, sheep numbers increased here, as it did across</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> much of the Welsh hills. And as a young lad, local farmer Arred Davies was responsible</div><div id="00:00:50.340" class="transcript_line"> for creating a more productive piece of land to help feed the growing flock.</div><div id="00:00:54.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well we rotivated it for Mr Jones. He decided that he was taking the sheep up to</div><div id="00:01:00.040" class="transcript_line"> the mountains in the summer and there wasn&#039;t enough food there. So he decided that we&#039;ll</div><div id="00:01:04.320" class="transcript_line"> do about 25, 30 acres. So he hired a tractor and we rotivated it. And he put about four</div><div id="00:01:11.680" class="transcript_line"> tonnes of lime down per acre. And that&#039;s why you see the piece on the top there today</div><div id="00:01:17.120" class="transcript_line"> still hasn&#039;t grown back because nothing will grow back like the vegetation on the top there</div><div id="00:01:22.920" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;ve got lime. So you&#039;ve got to kill the lime in the ground before it comes back.</div><div id="00:01:27.440" class="transcript_line"> So that is still today as it was there. I was the one that did that. I know it looks</div><div id="00:01:32.320" class="transcript_line"> odd in the middle of the mountain but it was a very good piece for Griffey. He was very</div><div id="00:01:36.240" class="transcript_line"> happy with it, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:38.760" class="transcript_line"> When the Wildlife Trust bought Glasslin, they hoped to restore the heather on this patch.</div><div id="00:01:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Because of the liming and fertiliser this proved almost impossible. The field has now</div><div id="00:01:48.680" class="transcript_line"> been grazed and managed in such a way as to gradually restore some biodiversity. But</div><div id="00:01:54.800" class="transcript_line"> it will probably never revert to full heather cover. Some land use changes can be irreversible.</div><div id="00:02:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Follow the path to the viewpoint and listen to track seven where the path terminates at</div><div id="00:02:08.880" class="transcript_line"> the spectacular edge overlooking a deep ravine on your right. When you&#039;ve listened to track</div><div id="00:02:14.760" class="transcript_line"> seven you need to retrace your steps to the lakeside and turn right.</div></div></p>
