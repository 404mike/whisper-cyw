    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:04.480" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Nicola Fogarty.</div><div id="00:00:10.160" class="transcript_line"> We are holding the interview in the Swooker office</div><div id="00:00:13.040" class="transcript_line"> and today&#039;s date is the 2nd of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Nicky, well that is your name by which we know you.</div><div id="00:00:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Could you spell your full name for us for the record please?</div><div id="00:00:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Certainly, N-I-C-O-L-A-F-O-G-A-T-Y.</div><div id="00:00:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Full marks, very good.</div><div id="00:00:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:34.400" class="transcript_line"> So Cardiff Carnival, how did you first get involved?</div><div id="00:00:37.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not, well, lived in Carnival, lived in Carnival,</div><div id="00:00:41.600" class="transcript_line"> lived in Cardiff since 1990.</div><div id="00:00:46.440" class="transcript_line"> Had Alice in 1996, had been to a couple of carnivals</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> before she was born, as you know, party, party.</div><div id="00:00:54.380" class="transcript_line"> And then, started going to carnival when she was little</div><div id="00:01:00.700" class="transcript_line"> to show her, so she was in a push chair and all wrapped up</div><div id="00:01:04.860" class="transcript_line"> because it was usually quite chilly.</div><div id="00:01:07.140" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like Cardiff in the summer, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:08.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:01:09.940" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go and we used to try and score a nice place</div><div id="00:01:14.780" class="transcript_line"> by wherever the end of the carnival was happening that year</div><div id="00:01:17.900" class="transcript_line"> so that we could see the entirety of the parade.</div><div id="00:01:21.300" class="transcript_line"> Always impressed by the big things,</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> the big strange, wonderful things that were on the parade.</div><div id="00:01:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Big creations on backpacks.</div><div id="00:01:27.360" class="transcript_line"> On backpacks and stilts and other things.</div><div id="00:01:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Remember the Jumbies, Kevin and Oggy?</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t remember the names, you see,</div><div id="00:01:34.360" class="transcript_line"> because I wasn&#039;t that involved.</div><div id="00:01:36.360" class="transcript_line"> You just see the thing pass by and go,</div><div id="00:01:38.560" class="transcript_line"> ooh, that&#039;s lovely and amazing and wonderful.</div><div id="00:01:40.920" class="transcript_line"> And decided when she was about four or five,</div><div id="00:01:44.680" class="transcript_line"> that I was gonna get involved,</div><div id="00:01:45.760" class="transcript_line"> but when she was a bit older,</div><div id="00:01:47.080" class="transcript_line"> because I thought taking a four or five year old</div><div id="00:01:48.960" class="transcript_line"> would be too much like hard work.</div><div id="00:01:51.480" class="transcript_line"> And by the time she was eight,</div><div id="00:01:53.240" class="transcript_line"> I thought she was capable enough</div><div id="00:01:54.480" class="transcript_line"> so she could go along and join in in her own right</div><div id="00:01:56.880" class="transcript_line"> rather than just be an appendage to her mother.</div><div id="00:02:00.640" class="transcript_line"> So we went in and we joined in</div><div id="00:02:01.920" class="transcript_line"> and we started doing the printing of Rainbow People costumes.</div><div id="00:02:05.920" class="transcript_line"> Lots of dots, little production line going on.</div><div id="00:02:08.880" class="transcript_line"> Did that for about three days.</div><div id="00:02:10.800" class="transcript_line"> And then the man, yeah, how many dots did you produce?</div><div id="00:02:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough of this.</div><div id="00:02:15.640" class="transcript_line"> Millions, millions.</div><div id="00:02:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Enough of this.</div><div id="00:02:17.320" class="transcript_line"> They were quite pretty though.</div><div id="00:02:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:02:19.440" class="transcript_line"> It was quite nice to do.</div><div id="00:02:20.880" class="transcript_line"> And then didn&#039;t get actually to go on the carnival</div><div id="00:02:24.520" class="transcript_line"> because I broke my toe the weekend before.</div><div id="00:02:26.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s dashed bad luck as we say.</div><div id="00:02:28.520" class="transcript_line"> So daddy had to join in</div><div id="00:02:29.800" class="transcript_line"> and daddy had to be a rainbow man.</div><div id="00:02:31.640" class="transcript_line"> Mick was the rainbow man.</div><div id="00:02:33.200" class="transcript_line"> I shall always think of him that way.</div><div id="00:02:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can get the photos to prove it.</div><div id="00:02:38.440" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;re going to have to ask you</div><div id="00:02:39.760" class="transcript_line"> to share those with us so we can put those online</div><div id="00:02:42.920" class="transcript_line"> as part of the archive.</div><div id="00:02:45.600" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll love me for that one.</div><div id="00:02:46.920" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:02:48.160" class="transcript_line"> So the first costume that you and Alice performed</div><div id="00:02:51.320" class="transcript_line"> was part of a rainbow section.</div><div id="00:02:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, we were part of the rainbow section.</div><div id="00:02:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Of course Mick was.</div><div id="00:02:55.680" class="transcript_line"> But Mick was, I didn&#039;t actually go in.</div><div id="00:02:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Did Mick have time to learn a few moves?</div><div id="00:02:58.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, how did he?</div><div id="00:02:59.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think he did to be honest.</div><div id="00:03:01.840" class="transcript_line"> He facilitated Alice&#039;s enjoyment.</div><div id="00:03:03.880" class="transcript_line"> And Tabitha, we always brought down Alice</div><div id="00:03:06.440" class="transcript_line"> or I always brought down Alice and a friend.</div><div id="00:03:08.800" class="transcript_line"> It was usually Tabitha and Tabitha was, you know,</div><div id="00:03:12.200" class="transcript_line"> a little rainbow girly.</div><div id="00:03:14.280" class="transcript_line"> So your foot is now healed.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I hasten to add that you didn&#039;t limp into this interview.</div><div id="00:03:19.720" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t permanently scarred by the carnival experience.</div><div id="00:03:22.320" class="transcript_line"> I actually can&#039;t feel the tip of my toe</div><div id="00:03:23.520" class="transcript_line"> because of the break in my big toe.</div><div id="00:03:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Even to this day, folks.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:03:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I&#039;m okay.</div><div id="00:03:30.080" class="transcript_line"> I can still walk.</div><div id="00:03:30.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good sign.</div><div id="00:03:32.920" class="transcript_line"> So you did the rainbow section.</div><div id="00:03:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Take us through your story.</div><div id="00:03:35.400" class="transcript_line"> What happened next?</div><div id="00:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> What happened next?</div><div id="00:03:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Next year,</div><div id="00:03:40.200" class="transcript_line"> next year was the,</div><div id="00:03:42.440" class="transcript_line"> it was the under the sea theme.</div><div id="00:03:45.280" class="transcript_line"> And we did a lot of, of,</div><div id="00:03:48.720" class="transcript_line"> tissueing on the big,</div><div id="00:03:51.760" class="transcript_line"> there was like a sea serpent.</div><div id="00:03:53.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember.</div><div id="00:03:53.920" class="transcript_line"> In sections.</div><div id="00:03:54.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very much so.</div><div id="00:03:55.600" class="transcript_line"> And Alice and I did a lot of tissue paper on it,</div><div id="00:03:58.920" class="transcript_line"> but we opted to be in the sea urchin.</div><div id="00:04:01.280" class="transcript_line"> It was one of Lizzie&#039;s lovely little drawings of sea urchins.</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> And we opted to be in the sea urchin drawings.</div><div id="00:04:06.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, the sea urchin costumes didn&#039;t get made</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> right until the last minute.</div><div id="00:04:11.160" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re actually a bit nervous.</div><div id="00:04:13.520" class="transcript_line"> But we went in them anyway.</div><div id="00:04:16.320" class="transcript_line"> We were very pink.</div><div id="00:04:17.640" class="transcript_line"> They were little pink sea urchins with puffed wool</div><div id="00:04:19.960" class="transcript_line"> kind of skirts.</div><div id="00:04:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And we had, yeah, that was, that was a kind of like,</div><div id="00:04:24.440" class="transcript_line"> oh no, please don&#039;t come see me in this costume.</div><div id="00:04:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, after that, the following year,</div><div id="00:04:31.320" class="transcript_line"> I think was the year of,</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> the theme was festivals from around the world.</div><div id="00:04:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:38.400" class="transcript_line"> And we came in in the open evening and we saw,</div><div id="00:04:41.160" class="transcript_line"> again, a Lizzie&#039;s illustration for Day of the Dead people.</div><div id="00:04:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, excellent, the Mexican Day of the Dead, yes.</div><div id="00:04:47.520" class="transcript_line"> Mexican Day of the Dead.</div><div id="00:04:48.360" class="transcript_line"> And we went, and Alice was just sort of at 10,</div><div id="00:04:52.960" class="transcript_line"> kind of proto-Goth mode.</div><div id="00:04:54.560" class="transcript_line"> She went into Goth mode at the beginning of high school,</div><div id="00:04:57.960" class="transcript_line"> you know, for a couple of years, but she was kind of-</div><div id="00:05:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Great tradition.</div><div id="00:05:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she was into skulls and other things like that.</div><div id="00:05:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And she just saw it and went,</div><div id="00:05:04.400" class="transcript_line"> yes, I want to be one of those.</div><div id="00:05:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And I felt, right, fine.</div><div id="00:05:06.960" class="transcript_line"> And by this time, I knew the staff better</div><div id="00:05:10.200" class="transcript_line"> and said, you know, could we have a go at building</div><div id="00:05:15.640" class="transcript_line"> three big skulls and-</div><div id="00:05:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember.</div><div id="00:05:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Having, being independent in our own little-</div><div id="00:05:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and wonderfully big skeletal hands as well.</div><div id="00:05:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they did have, it&#039;s strange,</div><div id="00:05:24.880" class="transcript_line"> because we were thinking of revisiting it next year,</div><div id="00:05:27.480" class="transcript_line"> because it would have been her 20th birthday.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow, her birthday.</div><div id="00:05:32.200" class="transcript_line"> So it would have been from 10 to 20, 10 years on to do the-</div><div id="00:05:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:37.800" class="transcript_line"> But we probably won&#039;t get the opportunity now,</div><div id="00:05:40.640" class="transcript_line"> because it won&#039;t be here.</div><div id="00:05:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Sadly, this is a strong likelihood,</div><div id="00:05:43.880" class="transcript_line"> is all I can say at this joke show.</div><div id="00:05:44.720" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ll just have to make them</div><div id="00:05:45.880" class="transcript_line"> and walk around the streets with them for fun.</div><div id="00:05:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Because they were the best costumes.</div><div id="00:05:51.400" class="transcript_line"> I still maintain they were the best costumes to wear</div><div id="00:05:54.080" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;ve ever made.</div><div id="00:05:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:05:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Because they had our faces in the middle</div><div id="00:05:59.560" class="transcript_line"> of the big gaping mouth so that people could see,</div><div id="00:06:02.440" class="transcript_line"> even though we were covered in black face paint</div><div id="00:06:04.680" class="transcript_line"> and meant to paint.</div><div id="00:06:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember the heads themselves being really quite big.</div><div id="00:06:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were.</div><div id="00:06:09.320" class="transcript_line"> How big would you guess to make them were?</div><div id="00:06:12.360" class="transcript_line"> I suppose mine was about three foot,</div><div id="00:06:15.960" class="transcript_line"> maybe a little bit bigger across.</div><div id="00:06:17.760" class="transcript_line"> These were very big.</div><div id="00:06:18.600" class="transcript_line"> And maybe four foot deep.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were so light,</div><div id="00:06:20.840" class="transcript_line"> because you- Yeah, they were on backpacks</div><div id="00:06:22.320" class="transcript_line"> above our heads.</div><div id="00:06:23.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I can remember you dancing them,</div><div id="00:06:24.800" class="transcript_line"> you never seemed to stop.</div><div id="00:06:25.760" class="transcript_line"> And the hands, having sort of poles</div><div id="00:06:28.960" class="transcript_line"> with the skeletal arm and hands on to the arms,</div><div id="00:06:33.960" class="transcript_line"> you could actually- Last girl puppets, obviously.</div><div id="00:06:35.360" class="transcript_line"> Would you describe those puppets?</div><div id="00:06:36.200" class="transcript_line"> They felt like puppets.</div><div id="00:06:37.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were the first puppets, really,</div><div id="00:06:38.720" class="transcript_line"> that we made.</div><div id="00:06:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was the girls, particularly,</div><div id="00:06:42.840" class="transcript_line"> little 10-year-old girls in big skull heads</div><div id="00:06:46.080" class="transcript_line"> going out to the audience.</div><div id="00:06:47.080" class="transcript_line"> They were very interactive.</div><div id="00:06:48.680" class="transcript_line"> In most things that cover your face,</div><div id="00:06:51.480" class="transcript_line"> the public have a problem with dealing with the puppet,</div><div id="00:06:54.720" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s sort of like, where is the human being in this?</div><div id="00:06:57.400" class="transcript_line"> If your face is completely covered,</div><div id="00:06:59.800" class="transcript_line"> then people sometimes are a bit wary of it.</div><div id="00:07:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s not as welcoming, is it?</div><div id="00:07:05.800" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s not as wary.</div><div id="00:07:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Whereas if they could see the faces</div><div id="00:07:08.320" class="transcript_line"> and see the delight and glee on little girls&#039; faces</div><div id="00:07:11.680" class="transcript_line"> as they were poking you with a skeletal finger</div><div id="00:07:14.680" class="transcript_line"> to try and frighten you, then, yeah,</div><div id="00:07:17.560" class="transcript_line"> they got a big reaction and they got a positive reaction</div><div id="00:07:19.840" class="transcript_line"> because people were acting scared</div><div id="00:07:22.640" class="transcript_line"> in order to get the reaction from the girls.</div><div id="00:07:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember, musically,</div><div id="00:07:24.600" class="transcript_line"> what band you were near in that parade?</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t a clue.</div><div id="00:07:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Probably Samba of some sort.</div><div id="00:07:28.880" class="transcript_line"> Samba of some sort, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:29.720" class="transcript_line"> That normally does it, it was fun.</div><div id="00:07:32.080" class="transcript_line"> And we had sort of ponchos and things to-</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we definitely got images on the archive of those.</div><div id="00:07:38.240" class="transcript_line"> They were wonderful.</div><div id="00:07:39.640" class="transcript_line"> They were fun.</div><div id="00:07:40.480" class="transcript_line"> So you started on the puppet road.</div><div id="00:07:42.080" class="transcript_line"> What was your next carnival adventure after that?</div><div id="00:07:44.280" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> This is, I can&#039;t remember 11.</div><div id="00:07:48.640" class="transcript_line"> I think 11, when she was 11, was a year we missed,</div><div id="00:07:51.360" class="transcript_line"> and I can&#039;t remember why.</div><div id="00:07:52.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it could have been a family holiday.</div><div id="00:07:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, mistimed.</div><div id="00:07:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:57.520" class="transcript_line"> But when she was 12, we did the,</div><div id="00:08:02.040" class="transcript_line"> they were the cat spirits.</div><div id="00:08:05.280" class="transcript_line"> She had, it was the first costume</div><div id="00:08:06.680" class="transcript_line"> that Alice had designed herself.</div><div id="00:08:08.200" class="transcript_line"> Right, that&#039;s something.</div><div id="00:08:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And because she was beginning to pester me</div><div id="00:08:12.320" class="transcript_line"> about what we&#039;re gonna do, what we&#039;re gonna do,</div><div id="00:08:13.680" class="transcript_line"> and I sat down, piece of paper, right.</div><div id="00:08:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Whatever you want, you draw it, we&#039;ll make it.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, wow.</div><div id="00:08:18.840" class="transcript_line"> And so she drew the first, and I don&#039;t know why,</div><div id="00:08:22.040" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s not, we did have a cat,</div><div id="00:08:23.520" class="transcript_line"> but she wasn&#039;t particularly fond of it.</div><div id="00:08:24.920" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s never been fond of animals.</div><div id="00:08:27.640" class="transcript_line"> So she drew this sort of cat-like creature</div><div id="00:08:30.400" class="transcript_line"> with, hers had a big splash.</div><div id="00:08:32.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and had very big eyes.</div><div id="00:08:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Very beautiful eyes, yes.</div><div id="00:08:36.280" class="transcript_line"> Touch of Japanese manga comics in there.</div><div id="00:08:38.720" class="transcript_line"> I have no idea where they&#039;re.</div><div id="00:08:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think they&#039;re very beautiful.</div><div id="00:08:41.720" class="transcript_line"> And just for me, there was an echo</div><div id="00:08:43.360" class="transcript_line"> of a Japanese style cartoon called Manga.</div><div id="00:08:46.480" class="transcript_line"> By the eyes, definitely. Big eyes, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she drew hers first,</div><div id="00:08:51.560" class="transcript_line"> and she decided it was the spirit, the water,</div><div id="00:08:55.440" class="transcript_line"> no, the cat spirit of water.</div><div id="00:08:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Right, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:59.400" class="transcript_line"> If, as if. Or spit, as we think of it.</div><div id="00:09:01.760" class="transcript_line"> As if there is such a thing.</div><div id="00:09:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Hello, after all, is there?</div><div id="00:09:04.880" class="transcript_line"> And then we sold the idea to Tabitha,</div><div id="00:09:08.080" class="transcript_line"> who was gonna do it with us.</div><div id="00:09:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Excellent. And she came up with the,</div><div id="00:09:10.320" class="transcript_line"> she was gonna be the night sky,</div><div id="00:09:11.680" class="transcript_line"> and hers went up to a point.</div><div id="00:09:13.720" class="transcript_line"> They were almost like onions, the shape initially.</div><div id="00:09:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Interesting shapes.</div><div id="00:09:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Alice&#039;s went wide at the top,</div><div id="00:09:20.480" class="transcript_line"> and Tabitha&#039;s went up to a point</div><div id="00:09:23.080" class="transcript_line"> that then came over with little stars dangling from it,</div><div id="00:09:26.080" class="transcript_line"> and it was midnight blue with,</div><div id="00:09:28.280" class="transcript_line"> so Alice&#039;s was blue because it was water,</div><div id="00:09:30.560" class="transcript_line"> and Tabitha&#039;s was the deep dark blue</div><div id="00:09:32.680" class="transcript_line"> with lots of little silver bits and stars on it.</div><div id="00:09:35.800" class="transcript_line"> And then I decided I was going to be</div><div id="00:09:37.440" class="transcript_line"> the cat spirit of nature.</div><div id="00:09:39.960" class="transcript_line"> And mine was like a big gourd shape.</div><div id="00:09:43.240" class="transcript_line"> It had a twisty bit at the top,</div><div id="00:09:45.280" class="transcript_line"> and was green and yellow and orange with the big.</div><div id="00:09:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Hey, that&#039;s a sort of vegetable-like thing</div><div id="00:09:50.760" class="transcript_line"> going in there somewhere. Yes, yeah, it was weird.</div><div id="00:09:52.240" class="transcript_line"> It was weird. No, no, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:53.080" class="transcript_line"> They were just slightly surreal.</div><div id="00:09:55.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:56.120" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t as friendly to wear</div><div id="00:09:58.480" class="transcript_line"> because we didn&#039;t have,</div><div id="00:10:00.840" class="transcript_line"> our faces were completely covered.</div><div id="00:10:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:03.200" class="transcript_line"> And when you stare at somebody</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> through a giant cat head&#039;s eyes,</div><div id="00:10:06.720" class="transcript_line"> they kind of look at you as if you&#039;ve gone off your trolley.</div><div id="00:10:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:10.200" class="transcript_line"> Mom, make it go away.</div><div id="00:10:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, what&#039;s going on here?</div><div id="00:10:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Not quite good.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Not as accessible as the skull heads.</div><div id="00:10:18.360" class="transcript_line"> The skulls, no, no.</div><div id="00:10:20.200" class="transcript_line"> So after the cat heads,</div><div id="00:10:22.960" class="transcript_line"> now we&#039;re up to, oh,</div><div id="00:10:25.920" class="transcript_line"> what do we do after that?</div><div id="00:10:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:10:31.720" class="transcript_line"> I know there was one that Alice,</div><div id="00:10:33.080" class="transcript_line"> I think that was the, no,</div><div id="00:10:35.120" class="transcript_line"> because if that was 10, 11, 12,</div><div id="00:10:38.240" class="transcript_line"> maybe it was 13, she fell off that.</div><div id="00:10:43.800" class="transcript_line"> I wish I could see the pictures</div><div id="00:10:44.920" class="transcript_line"> because Mick&#039;s got all the archive of the pictures.</div><div id="00:10:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Right, right, right.</div><div id="00:10:48.080" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s easier to go through,</div><div id="00:10:50.240" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t remember exactly which one comes next.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, let&#039;s fast forward to the summer</div><div id="00:10:56.440" class="transcript_line"> because I think we&#039;ve just gone</div><div id="00:10:57.680" class="transcript_line"> because of course, you know.</div><div id="00:10:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Possibly our most ambitious and most stressful so far.</div><div id="00:11:05.080" class="transcript_line"> No, but on my side, you were there every day.</div><div id="00:11:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Every day for 17 days in a row and then some.</div><div id="00:11:11.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so I mean, you know.</div><div id="00:11:17.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the one opportunity a year you get</div><div id="00:11:20.440" class="transcript_line"> to just go for it and make something huge</div><div id="00:11:23.920" class="transcript_line"> and out there and, you know, most of the time,</div><div id="00:11:28.320" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re making something,</div><div id="00:11:29.440" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re making it on a domestic scale within your own home.</div><div id="00:11:32.280" class="transcript_line"> And so, you know, it can&#039;t be that big.</div><div id="00:11:35.200" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t be able to live with it if it was that big.</div><div id="00:11:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Or get it through the door.</div><div id="00:11:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it wouldn&#039;t all get it through the door.</div><div id="00:11:39.520" class="transcript_line"> You know, so the things you make, you know,</div><div id="00:11:42.280" class="transcript_line"> and I do make stuff.</div><div id="00:11:43.200" class="transcript_line"> I mean, usually it&#039;s jewelry or stuff like that.</div><div id="00:11:46.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s small, itty bitty stuff.</div><div id="00:11:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:48.760" class="transcript_line"> And I paint as well, so I do that,</div><div id="00:11:51.080" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s not a chance to do just go for it and be creative</div><div id="00:11:55.880" class="transcript_line"> and not worry about having to pay for materials</div><div id="00:11:58.240" class="transcript_line"> and not worry about any of the, you know,</div><div id="00:12:01.120" class="transcript_line"> serious logistics of it.</div><div id="00:12:02.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sort of like Adrian&#039;s great in that he comes along</div><div id="00:12:05.040" class="transcript_line"> and he goes, hmm, yeah, sure, go ahead.</div><div id="00:12:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Is that how the conversation goes?</div><div id="00:12:11.240" class="transcript_line"> Usually, usually it&#039;s sort of like he&#039;ll,</div><div id="00:12:14.800" class="transcript_line"> when he doesn&#039;t know, he just looks at you and goes,</div><div id="00:12:17.840" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll figure it out.</div><div id="00:12:19.720" class="transcript_line"> And you have to, and you always do.</div><div id="00:12:21.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you always seem to triumph.</div><div id="00:12:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t get it to walk, which is...</div><div id="00:12:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, describe it before we go any further.</div><div id="00:12:28.160" class="transcript_line"> It was a 14 foot high, naked woman.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:12:33.400" class="transcript_line"> Called Delilah Furiosa.</div><div id="00:12:35.600" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t seen the Mad Max film,</div><div id="00:12:37.400" class="transcript_line"> which is Furiosa Roaned or something like that.</div><div id="00:12:40.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the current one, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Alice has seen it.</div><div id="00:12:43.960" class="transcript_line"> And described that she comes home from these films</div><div id="00:12:47.320" class="transcript_line"> and she sits and spends about an hour relating every detail</div><div id="00:12:50.520" class="transcript_line"> of the plot. So I don&#039;t have to go.</div><div id="00:12:52.880" class="transcript_line"> So yes, she was Delilah Furiosa.</div><div id="00:12:55.320" class="transcript_line"> She had moving joints from her neck</div><div id="00:13:02.320" class="transcript_line"> to her shoulders, elbows, even all her finger joints worked,</div><div id="00:13:06.880" class="transcript_line"> but I couldn&#039;t get them to move.</div><div id="00:13:08.320" class="transcript_line"> That was another frustrating thing.</div><div id="00:13:10.160" class="transcript_line"> They were too far up.</div><div id="00:13:11.400" class="transcript_line"> There was too much translation of, you know,</div><div id="00:13:14.400" class="transcript_line"> the string had to move too far to get it.</div><div id="00:13:16.360" class="transcript_line"> So you had to pull it too much.</div><div id="00:13:17.960" class="transcript_line"> And you know...</div><div id="00:13:18.800" class="transcript_line"> But you can see the steps you&#039;ve made from the relative</div><div id="00:13:21.080" class="transcript_line"> simple mix of them.</div><div id="00:13:22.920" class="transcript_line"> Now there&#039;s how many joints in your creation?</div><div id="00:13:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Way too many.</div><div id="00:13:26.360" class="transcript_line"> The year, actually it could have been that year.</div><div id="00:13:29.720" class="transcript_line"> That could have been...</div><div id="00:13:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, anyway, I&#039;ll go back to them.</div><div id="00:13:32.240" class="transcript_line"> The year that Ben and Jude came to do the giant things</div><div id="00:13:39.680" class="transcript_line"> that were made that year.</div><div id="00:13:41.600" class="transcript_line"> I think from that moment on, they were,</div><div id="00:13:43.720" class="transcript_line"> Ben and Jude were fantastic.</div><div id="00:13:45.200" class="transcript_line"> They were just completely inspirational.</div><div id="00:13:48.760" class="transcript_line"> And so they came in and did this wonderful workshop</div><div id="00:13:53.520" class="transcript_line"> and just went, make giant puppets.</div><div id="00:13:55.440" class="transcript_line"> And I went, ooh!</div><div id="00:13:57.400" class="transcript_line"> Now that&#039;s a good idea.</div><div id="00:13:59.440" class="transcript_line"> So from that moment on, it&#039;s been how many moving bits</div><div id="00:14:03.880" class="transcript_line"> can I get into it?</div><div id="00:14:05.760" class="transcript_line"> And so, yes, we ended up with Delilah Furiosa.</div><div id="00:14:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s on a backpack and...</div><div id="00:14:10.760" class="transcript_line"> She wasn&#039;t on a backpack, she was on a trolley.</div><div id="00:14:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, of course, yeah, yeah, indeed.</div><div id="00:14:14.320" class="transcript_line"> She was too big to be on a backpack.</div><div id="00:14:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:16.320" class="transcript_line"> I did contemplate having her on a backpack</div><div id="00:14:18.640" class="transcript_line"> because she wasn&#039;t that heavy in the end.</div><div id="00:14:21.120" class="transcript_line"> It was just that I would have appeared to be</div><div id="00:14:25.440" class="transcript_line"> as if she&#039;d given birth to me.</div><div id="00:14:27.320" class="transcript_line"> There was a dilemma about finding yourself suspended</div><div id="00:14:29.440" class="transcript_line"> between a giant woman&#039;s legs, now you mention it.</div><div id="00:14:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it just didn&#039;t seem a comfortable place to be.</div><div id="00:14:34.360" class="transcript_line"> I can understand that.</div><div id="00:14:35.480" class="transcript_line"> So we did put her on the trolley.</div><div id="00:14:37.880" class="transcript_line"> And mostly willows and withy sticks and paint her</div><div id="00:14:41.320" class="transcript_line"> and colored and then painted, varnished,</div><div id="00:14:44.440" class="transcript_line"> yeah.</div><div id="00:14:45.720" class="transcript_line"> She was mostly withy.</div><div id="00:14:47.560" class="transcript_line"> There was some carbon fiber pole in,</div><div id="00:14:49.840" class="transcript_line"> there was some bamboo in the basic structure,</div><div id="00:14:53.120" class="transcript_line"> but it was all covered in...</div><div id="00:14:53.960" class="transcript_line"> And you had some rather wonderful sayings</div><div id="00:14:56.360" class="transcript_line"> painted onto her.</div><div id="00:14:57.400" class="transcript_line"> Feminist slogans.</div><div id="00:14:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:59.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:00.240" class="transcript_line"> Can you, Larry, for the record?</div><div id="00:15:02.880" class="transcript_line"> She had,</div><div id="00:15:04.720" class="transcript_line"> We Are Not Things written on her tummy.</div><div id="00:15:08.480" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s had women hold up half the world.</div><div id="00:15:11.240" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a Chinese prophet.</div><div id="00:15:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t remember what was on the other arm.</div><div id="00:15:16.200" class="transcript_line"> There was a women reclaim the night.</div><div id="00:15:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:19.160" class="transcript_line"> From all the reclaim the night marches.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was...</div><div id="00:15:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Which is quite a political statement, you know.</div><div id="00:15:23.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no.</div><div id="00:15:24.640" class="transcript_line"> And Carnival has a point for that.</div><div id="00:15:26.960" class="transcript_line"> What kind of reaction did you get from the public?</div><div id="00:15:29.880" class="transcript_line"> From, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Interesting.</div><div id="00:15:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of women were cheering.</div><div id="00:15:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:15:35.560" class="transcript_line"> A lot of women, a lot of men kind of slightly more reserved.</div><div id="00:15:40.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a guy who came up to grope her bum</div><div id="00:15:44.160" class="transcript_line"> as he walked, as she walked past him.</div><div id="00:15:46.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:47.800" class="transcript_line"> And I just looked at him because I was on the arm.</div><div id="00:15:49.880" class="transcript_line"> Actually, no, I was pushing at this point.</div><div id="00:15:51.480" class="transcript_line"> So it was behind the arm person and in between.</div><div id="00:15:56.480" class="transcript_line"> And he went up to grope her bum and I said, no consent.</div><div id="00:16:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And he walked away.</div><div id="00:16:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant, brilliant.</div><div id="00:16:03.200" class="transcript_line"> That was a, wow.</div><div id="00:16:04.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a very telling, excellent.</div><div id="00:16:07.280" class="transcript_line"> It was interesting.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were people who walked up and went,</div><div id="00:16:13.240" class="transcript_line"> actually one of the people from the band,</div><div id="00:16:14.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what he said he was called,</div><div id="00:16:16.360" class="transcript_line"> one of the bands came up and said,</div><div id="00:16:18.040" class="transcript_line"> I have two daughters, I&#039;m so glad you&#039;ve done this.</div><div id="00:16:20.280" class="transcript_line"> It really means a lot.</div><div id="00:16:21.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, and he was absolutely gushing.</div><div id="00:16:24.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no, no.</div><div id="00:16:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And I was quite taken aback by it because it was,</div><div id="00:16:28.200" class="transcript_line"> you know, people don&#039;t tend to get emotional</div><div id="00:16:30.600" class="transcript_line"> about these things.</div><div id="00:16:31.440" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:16:32.280" class="transcript_line"> But he was really heartfelt in that he thought</div><div id="00:16:34.400" class="transcript_line"> it was a fantastic thing to do.</div><div id="00:16:36.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:16:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, dear, dear.</div><div id="00:16:39.280" class="transcript_line"> So positive and negative.</div><div id="00:16:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.</div><div id="00:16:43.240" class="transcript_line"> But it was, it was the first time I think</div><div id="00:16:45.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been out there politically.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, right, right.</div><div id="00:16:47.840" class="transcript_line"> I hadn&#039;t done anything that I...</div><div id="00:16:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And of course, while you&#039;re working,</div><div id="00:16:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Alice, your daughter is there alongside you,</div><div id="00:16:53.880" class="transcript_line"> but with her own visions now.</div><div id="00:16:55.320" class="transcript_line"> With my own.</div><div id="00:16:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Separate.</div><div id="00:16:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, with her own creation.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> This year, she had, she came up with the idea ages ago,</div><div id="00:17:01.640" class="transcript_line"> it must have been at least six months before the carnival,</div><div id="00:17:04.760" class="transcript_line"> that she wanted to do an octopus</div><div id="00:17:08.080" class="transcript_line"> but its legs moved up.</div><div id="00:17:10.360" class="transcript_line"> And she came up with the idea that if she put it</div><div id="00:17:12.520" class="transcript_line"> on an umbrella, which had eight spikes,</div><div id="00:17:16.080" class="transcript_line"> then she could make this.</div><div id="00:17:18.800" class="transcript_line"> And the only problem being is that umbrellas</div><div id="00:17:20.840" class="transcript_line"> aren&#039;t made that, with that much fortitude.</div><div id="00:17:23.760" class="transcript_line"> And during the process of making the creature...</div><div id="00:17:27.120" class="transcript_line"> How many umbrellas died in the making of the show?</div><div id="00:17:30.440" class="transcript_line"> At least two.</div><div id="00:17:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:17:32.120" class="transcript_line"> And each time it was a major trauma.</div><div id="00:17:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:17:34.920" class="transcript_line"> And she was so near the end of her tether</div><div id="00:17:39.240" class="transcript_line"> because she wanted it...</div><div id="00:17:41.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like she can make,</div><div id="00:17:42.760" class="transcript_line"> she knows she can make things that are beautiful.</div><div id="00:17:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:45.520" class="transcript_line"> But she has, was making...</div><div id="00:17:46.360" class="transcript_line"> She knows one end of a glue gun from another.</div><div id="00:17:47.760" class="transcript_line"> She does.</div><div id="00:17:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But she didn&#039;t, she wanted to prove</div><div id="00:17:52.720" class="transcript_line"> that she could have make something</div><div id="00:17:54.520" class="transcript_line"> that was puppet-like, like I do.</div><div id="00:17:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Kinetic.</div><div id="00:17:57.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, kinetic sculpture.</div><div id="00:17:59.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And that she wanted to do something that was naturalistic</div><div id="00:18:04.280" class="transcript_line"> in that it was like the creature</div><div id="00:18:06.200" class="transcript_line"> that she was attempting to create.</div><div id="00:18:07.880" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t just she was trying to make a pretty thing</div><div id="00:18:09.840" class="transcript_line"> that looked like an octopus,</div><div id="00:18:11.160" class="transcript_line"> but it had to move like an octopus.</div><div id="00:18:13.480" class="transcript_line"> And so we had several points</div><div id="00:18:16.480" class="transcript_line"> at which she was at the point of,</div><div id="00:18:19.600" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t do this in a bloody umbrella.</div><div id="00:18:21.520" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:18:22.360" class="transcript_line"> Blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="00:18:23.960" class="transcript_line"> And at one stage when I was trying to get mine to walk</div><div id="00:18:26.400" class="transcript_line"> and she was trying to get hers to flap its tentacles</div><div id="00:18:30.280" class="transcript_line"> at people, we&#039;ve had a point where we&#039;ve just hugged</div><div id="00:18:32.560" class="transcript_line"> each other and burst into tears.</div><div id="00:18:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And the people all around us were kind of edging slowly away.</div><div id="00:18:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Cardinal trauma alert,</div><div id="00:18:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Cardinal trauma alert.</div><div id="00:18:43.080" class="transcript_line"> Whoop, whoop, whoop.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sort of like, yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:18:45.480" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s got a bit tense and emotional.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t worry about it.</div><div id="00:18:47.840" class="transcript_line"> It goes carry on.</div><div id="00:18:48.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, absolutely.</div><div id="00:18:50.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll sequel it in the morning.</div><div id="00:18:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:52.680" class="transcript_line"> In fact, she had a friend with her</div><div id="00:18:54.240" class="transcript_line"> who made a rather extraordinary sort of,</div><div id="00:18:56.480" class="transcript_line"> well, yeah, I&#039;ll let you describe it.</div><div id="00:18:57.560" class="transcript_line"> The teacup.</div><div id="00:18:58.400" class="transcript_line"> The teacup.</div><div id="00:18:59.240" class="transcript_line"> This is the new one.</div><div id="00:19:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Why did that come from?</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Katrin&#039;s only been doing it since last year.</div><div id="00:19:04.880" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:19:06.280" class="transcript_line"> And Katrin came along last year and was,</div><div id="00:19:11.120" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s quite a creative person</div><div id="00:19:12.640" class="transcript_line"> but hadn&#039;t done anything before.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Wanted to do her own backpack.</div><div id="00:19:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And so decided last year she was going to be</div><div id="00:19:22.600" class="transcript_line"> that Lego character, the Unikitty.</div><div id="00:19:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Unikitty, well, Katrin, Kat, Kitty.</div><div id="00:19:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:30.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s totally logical.</div><div id="00:19:32.200" class="transcript_line"> And so she made this fairly simple structure</div><div id="00:19:34.880" class="transcript_line"> but beautifully decorated and everybody loved it.</div><div id="00:19:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Unikitty, Unikitty all the way around.</div><div id="00:19:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Unikitty, Unikitty.</div><div id="00:19:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And so thoroughly enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:19:46.240" class="transcript_line"> Came back this year.</div><div id="00:19:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Went through several incarnations of what she wanted to be.</div><div id="00:19:55.840" class="transcript_line"> But decided in the end she wanted to be</div><div id="00:19:58.840" class="transcript_line"> an Alastin Wonderland themed teacup and saucer.</div><div id="00:20:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, extraordinary.</div><div id="00:20:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Or rather the cat peering out</div><div id="00:20:04.880" class="transcript_line"> of an Alastin Wonderland themed teacup and saucer.</div><div id="00:20:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant colors.</div><div id="00:20:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s a psychedelic character.</div><div id="00:20:09.880" class="transcript_line"> It was absolutely psychedelic.</div><div id="00:20:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And also when the structure itself was slightly asymmetrical</div><div id="00:20:19.680" class="transcript_line"> rather than getting het up about this,</div><div id="00:20:21.320" class="transcript_line"> went, oh, obviously that&#039;s the way it&#039;s meant to be</div><div id="00:20:23.560" class="transcript_line"> and made a very asymmetrical saucer</div><div id="00:20:25.640" class="transcript_line"> to go with a very asymmetrical cup</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> as a handle.</div><div id="00:20:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think I&#039;ve added to it.</div><div id="00:20:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it did, it did.</div><div id="00:20:31.520" class="transcript_line"> There was movement in it.</div><div id="00:20:32.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:20:33.200" class="transcript_line"> And so.</div><div id="00:20:34.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I carry cups of tea upstairs, you know.</div><div id="00:20:36.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I never seem to make it in one.</div><div id="00:20:38.720" class="transcript_line"> And didn&#039;t want to be sort of in amongst a group.</div><div id="00:20:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Had enjoyed the attention.</div><div id="00:20:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Unikitty, so, you know.</div><div id="00:20:48.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know.</div><div id="00:20:49.480" class="transcript_line"> The attention of, yeah.</div><div id="00:20:50.320" class="transcript_line"> So, but yeah.</div><div id="00:20:52.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re a strange band.</div><div id="00:20:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, you know, you&#039;ve been a wonderful</div><div id="00:20:57.960" class="transcript_line"> and as I say, virtually on a daily basis,</div><div id="00:21:00.240" class="transcript_line"> permanent feature of carnival camps for a long time.</div><div id="00:21:03.680" class="transcript_line"> If you had to speak to future generations</div><div id="00:21:07.320" class="transcript_line"> and try and sum up the atmosphere of the carnival camp,</div><div id="00:21:10.960" class="transcript_line"> how would you describe it?</div><div id="00:21:11.800" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s going on around you as you, over time?</div><div id="00:21:14.200" class="transcript_line"> What sort of, what&#039;s it feel like?</div><div id="00:21:16.560" class="transcript_line"> What did it feel like?</div><div id="00:21:18.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s usually the camaraderie.</div><div id="00:21:20.240" class="transcript_line"> This year, doing the feminist thing.</div><div id="00:21:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, excellent.</div><div id="00:21:23.080" class="transcript_line"> Wearing my hair shirt in public.</div><div id="00:21:25.800" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:21:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Has been wonderful.</div><div id="00:21:28.640" class="transcript_line"> The reaction to a naked woman statue.</div><div id="00:21:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the parade through the middle of Cardiff, yay!</div><div id="00:21:34.760" class="transcript_line"> But during the making of her, in the workshops,</div><div id="00:21:37.520" class="transcript_line"> you know, when I&#039;m sculpting a bottom or breasts.</div><div id="00:21:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:21:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Then the reaction of, I mean, there are,</div><div id="00:21:44.960" class="transcript_line"> I would say predominantly women to men on most camps.</div><div id="00:21:47.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, gender-wise.</div><div id="00:21:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, gender-wise, that&#039;s the split.</div><div id="00:21:51.200" class="transcript_line"> But definitely the room we were in was predominantly women.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:21:55.840" class="transcript_line"> And just coming over and touching and feeling</div><div id="00:21:59.120" class="transcript_line"> and suggesting and, you know, all the comments</div><div id="00:22:03.280" class="transcript_line"> and being incredibly positive from a body positive sort of.</div><div id="00:22:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:09.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, she wasn&#039;t as...</div><div id="00:22:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I remember you showing me some,</div><div id="00:22:11.120" class="transcript_line"> is it some pre-Columbian artifacts?</div><div id="00:22:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the little Venus statues.</div><div id="00:22:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:17.400" class="transcript_line"> Because the idea arrived in my head.</div><div id="00:22:19.880" class="transcript_line"> She wasn&#039;t of the...</div><div id="00:22:23.680" class="transcript_line"> I wanted her to...</div><div id="00:22:24.800" class="transcript_line"> The little Venus statues are really almost spherical.</div><div id="00:22:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:28.800" class="transcript_line"> And their breasts are so abnormally large</div><div id="00:22:30.640" class="transcript_line"> and their hips are so abnormally wide.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Curve upon curve upon curve.</div><div id="00:22:34.800" class="transcript_line"> And they don&#039;t know why they made them</div><div id="00:22:36.840" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;re prehistoric.</div><div id="00:22:38.400" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve obviously got no text about these figures.</div><div id="00:22:41.520" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s two suggestions,</div><div id="00:22:42.800" class="transcript_line"> one that they are fertility symbols</div><div id="00:22:46.440" class="transcript_line"> or that they were given to women during birth</div><div id="00:22:50.480" class="transcript_line"> to hold onto.</div><div id="00:22:51.320" class="transcript_line"> Interesting.</div><div id="00:22:52.160" class="transcript_line"> As, you know, as symbols of female strength</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> or female abilities.</div><div id="00:22:58.080" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it came via that kind of feeling</div><div id="00:23:02.400" class="transcript_line"> and it was all about how...</div><div id="00:23:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And also there&#039;s a song by Kimia Dawson</div><div id="00:23:09.360" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s an American folk singer,</div><div id="00:23:13.560" class="transcript_line"> really short black woman who...</div><div id="00:23:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:23:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:23:21.840" class="transcript_line"> I was telling you about Kimia Dawson</div><div id="00:23:23.520" class="transcript_line"> who was an American folk singer.</div><div id="00:23:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:26.200" class="transcript_line"> Who was also part of the inspiration</div><div id="00:23:27.720" class="transcript_line"> for the giant woman sculpture that I made</div><div id="00:23:30.560" class="transcript_line"> because she wrote a song called I Like Giants,</div><div id="00:23:33.360" class="transcript_line"> especially female giants.</div><div id="00:23:35.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:35.920" class="transcript_line"> And it has the line in it,</div><div id="00:23:38.360" class="transcript_line"> all women feel too big sometimes regardless of their size.</div><div id="00:23:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, nice.</div><div id="00:23:42.440" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s how women are put in, you know,</div><div id="00:23:43.960" class="transcript_line"> made to be little than made to feel small.</div><div id="00:23:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:23:48.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:48.920" class="transcript_line"> And made to want to be small.</div><div id="00:23:50.600" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:23:51.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:52.280" class="transcript_line"> So that was part of the influence.</div><div id="00:23:54.120" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, Delilah Furiosa arrived in my head,</div><div id="00:23:58.920" class="transcript_line"> almost fully formed with the Aboriginal hand painting</div><div id="00:24:02.880" class="transcript_line"> on her legs and the starry, starry...</div><div id="00:24:04.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s beautiful art.</div><div id="00:24:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Really beautiful.</div><div id="00:24:06.320" class="transcript_line"> Starry, starry night and sunset.</div><div id="00:24:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:09.160" class="transcript_line"> All fully formed.</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:10.840" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know quite where she arrived from,</div><div id="00:24:12.760" class="transcript_line"> but once she&#039;d arrived in my head, she had to be made.</div><div id="00:24:15.680" class="transcript_line"> I say, I mean, you&#039;re one of the people</div><div id="00:24:20.080" class="transcript_line"> who approach carnival with a macro hat on,</div><div id="00:24:22.600" class="transcript_line"> you always make big statements.</div><div id="00:24:24.160" class="transcript_line"> And of course, two that come to mind is your...</div><div id="00:24:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Was the hair a Mad March hair or not?</div><div id="00:24:29.600" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a Mad March hair.</div><div id="00:24:31.480" class="transcript_line"> It was...</div><div id="00:24:32.360" class="transcript_line"> It certainly wasn&#039;t a rabbit.</div><div id="00:24:33.200" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a rabbit.</div><div id="00:24:34.040" class="transcript_line"> It was definitely a hair.</div><div id="00:24:36.440" class="transcript_line"> It was the year after...</div><div id="00:24:37.280" class="transcript_line"> You can tell by the elongated body.</div><div id="00:24:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was the year after Ben and Jude came.</div><div id="00:24:42.200" class="transcript_line"> And it was, I want to build a puppet,</div><div id="00:24:44.800" class="transcript_line"> a thing with moving bits on it and in it.</div><div id="00:24:49.080" class="transcript_line"> I want to be put in it, inside it as part of the creature.</div><div id="00:24:53.520" class="transcript_line"> And I think because of the way they worked,</div><div id="00:24:57.120" class="transcript_line"> I started building a skeleton first.</div><div id="00:25:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And I worked from the inside</div><div id="00:25:02.160" class="transcript_line"> and then I built the hair outside it</div><div id="00:25:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and skinned it with the hair.</div><div id="00:25:07.440" class="transcript_line"> And that, but Delilah Furiosa,</div><div id="00:25:11.120" class="transcript_line"> I worked the other way round.</div><div id="00:25:13.280" class="transcript_line"> I worked with the idea of the skeleton in mind,</div><div id="00:25:16.240" class="transcript_line"> but I made the...</div><div id="00:25:17.800" class="transcript_line"> Because...</div><div id="00:25:18.640" class="transcript_line"> She was all bum, belly and bust.</div><div id="00:25:20.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she was all bum, belly and bust.</div><div id="00:25:21.720" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted her to be sort of in proportion</div><div id="00:25:24.760" class="transcript_line"> as a human figure, because the human figure,</div><div id="00:25:26.240" class="transcript_line"> the thing that if you look through carnivals</div><div id="00:25:28.320" class="transcript_line"> all over the world, the thing that gets most distorted,</div><div id="00:25:30.960" class="transcript_line"> if they make large figures, is the human figure.</div><div id="00:25:34.240" class="transcript_line"> It just doesn&#039;t work on some level,</div><div id="00:25:37.520" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s not in proportion to itself.</div><div id="00:25:39.120" class="transcript_line"> So I worked the other way around, which was not ideal.</div><div id="00:25:41.880" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:25:42.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a process of trying to learn.</div><div id="00:25:45.400" class="transcript_line"> Exactly, you never learn.</div><div id="00:25:46.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s creativity.</div><div id="00:25:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and then after the hair,</div><div id="00:25:50.280" class="transcript_line"> the hair was lovely to be inside, actually.</div><div id="00:25:52.880" class="transcript_line"> It was a slightly drizzly day, so I kept dry.</div><div id="00:25:57.880" class="transcript_line"> And got a lovely reaction from the public.</div><div id="00:26:00.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s legs had a realistic movement</div><div id="00:26:03.040" class="transcript_line"> and its paws had a realistic movement.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I could go and lean a paw on somebody&#039;s shoulder.</div><div id="00:26:09.320" class="transcript_line"> That was quite sweet.</div><div id="00:26:10.160" class="transcript_line"> I think your interaction with the audience</div><div id="00:26:11.440" class="transcript_line"> has always been one of the loveliest points.</div><div id="00:26:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:14.680" class="transcript_line"> And it makes for a very bespoke appearance.</div><div id="00:26:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Nobody else is gonna have that.</div><div id="00:26:19.360" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:20.200" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:26:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Mommy, are you there?</div><div id="00:26:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Mommy.</div><div id="00:26:22.720" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m stopping for lots of pictures,</div><div id="00:26:24.280" class="transcript_line"> which does hold other people up and they get, you know.</div><div id="00:26:26.640" class="transcript_line"> No, no, but...</div><div id="00:26:27.480" class="transcript_line"> You have to have patient people behind you.</div><div id="00:26:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely, but I mean, I think people actually vote</div><div id="00:26:31.240" class="transcript_line"> with their mobile phones now, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:26:32.680" class="transcript_line"> If they want a picture, they want a picture.</div><div id="00:26:33.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this is true.</div><div id="00:26:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And you know, we&#039;ve always made a point of saying,</div><div id="00:26:36.720" class="transcript_line"> please, you know, play with the public, you know.</div><div id="00:26:39.400" class="transcript_line"> And then I went to make a puppet lizard.</div><div id="00:26:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:45.640" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted the mouth.</div><div id="00:26:47.040" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to, ideally...</div><div id="00:26:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t a touch of chameleon about him or not?</div><div id="00:26:50.040" class="transcript_line"> Was a touch of chameleon about him.</div><div id="00:26:51.640" class="transcript_line"> Nothing, good.</div><div id="00:26:52.720" class="transcript_line"> Eddie lizard.</div><div id="00:26:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Of the chameleon future generations.</div><div id="00:26:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Eddie lizard, very pretty.</div><div id="00:26:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Eddie lizard.</div><div id="00:27:01.320" class="transcript_line"> He was supposed to be over an arm, but...</div><div id="00:27:05.920" class="transcript_line"> But I chose to clad him in latex,</div><div id="00:27:09.320" class="transcript_line"> and latex is really heavy.</div><div id="00:27:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Even in thin layers, it&#039;s quite,</div><div id="00:27:14.440" class="transcript_line"> made him too heavy to go one-sided.</div><div id="00:27:16.880" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise I&#039;d have ended up walking around</div><div id="00:27:18.840" class="transcript_line"> with the puppet dragon on the floor.</div><div id="00:27:20.480" class="transcript_line"> He was that limpy round the carnival side, hooray.</div><div id="00:27:22.600" class="transcript_line"> So in the end, he went above my head</div><div id="00:27:25.480" class="transcript_line"> and I had to create a little pull mechanism</div><div id="00:27:27.520" class="transcript_line"> to make the jaws.</div><div id="00:27:28.360" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful, beautiful colors.</div><div id="00:27:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very vivid and neon colors.</div><div id="00:27:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, really exciting, really exciting.</div><div id="00:27:35.880" class="transcript_line"> And he had a lovely slinky tail.</div><div id="00:27:37.120" class="transcript_line"> My favorite bit of him was the slinky tail.</div><div id="00:27:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, those little mini silver fishes</div><div id="00:27:43.880" class="transcript_line"> that you can get that have rings of lessening cones.</div><div id="00:27:52.480" class="transcript_line"> And joined together at the top of the bottom,</div><div id="00:27:53.920" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s how the tail.</div><div id="00:27:57.520" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely.</div><div id="00:27:58.360" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely being able to walk along</div><div id="00:28:01.040" class="transcript_line"> and slink the tail behind you,</div><div id="00:28:02.560" class="transcript_line"> and the tail would come all the way around</div><div id="00:28:04.120" class="transcript_line"> and curve around the body.</div><div id="00:28:04.960" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely.</div><div id="00:28:05.800" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely to wear.</div><div id="00:28:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think we&#039;ve had a fairly good,</div><div id="00:28:11.520" class="transcript_line"> and what can I say, lighthearted Rob</div><div id="00:28:14.080" class="transcript_line"> through well over 10 years of carnival contributions.</div><div id="00:28:17.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s at this point that I say thank you very much,</div><div id="00:28:20.520" class="transcript_line"> Nikki, for all you&#039;ve given to Cardiff Carnival.</div><div id="00:28:23.520" class="transcript_line"> And hereby give you the completely unbankable,</div><div id="00:28:26.960" class="transcript_line"> but nonetheless worthy title of carnival hero.</div><div id="00:28:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Nikki, thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:28:32.920" class="transcript_line"> Pleasure.</div></div></p>
