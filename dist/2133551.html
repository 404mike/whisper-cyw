    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, recording. The day is Thursday the 13th of April. The time is 1438. Mike Nicholson</div><div id="00:00:13.120" class="transcript_line"> interviewing Susan Nicholson for the Mencap Heritage Project. Present also with us are</div><div id="00:00:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Charlotte Edmonds and Joanne Nash. Okay, Susan, where would you like to start?</div><div id="00:00:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Hi, I&#039;m Sue Nicholson. I&#039;m chair of Chepstow Mencap. I&#039;ve been chair since 2011.</div><div id="00:00:41.360" class="transcript_line"> So quite a long time then?</div><div id="00:00:43.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, 11 years I believe it. No, 12 years this year it will be coming up.</div><div id="00:00:48.360" class="transcript_line"> But am I right in saying that your involvement with Chepstow Mencap begun a lot sooner than 2011?</div><div id="00:00:55.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So I was there at the beginning 50 years ago because my mother, Heather Parrott, is actually the founder of Chepstow Mencap.</div><div id="00:01:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re celebrating our 51st year this year. So I became chair in 2011 and I had the fabulous opportunity</div><div id="00:01:15.360" class="transcript_line"> with my trustee board to look at a building that came up for sale called the Board School.</div><div id="00:01:22.360" class="transcript_line"> Our building that we were actually in at the time had outgrown the service that we provided.</div><div id="00:01:32.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a converted pub over three floors and the lift shafts were in the chimneys of that old pub.</div><div id="00:01:42.360" class="transcript_line"> And of course from 1998 up to the present day wheelchairs have got that much bigger so it was no longer fit for purpose.</div><div id="00:01:51.360" class="transcript_line"> People with mobility issues had difficulty getting to all the floors and for personal care we had to go outside the building down a ramp to our changing facilities.</div><div id="00:02:05.360" class="transcript_line"> So the Board School came up for sale in 2013. The Board came along, had a look at it, we had the funds to purchase it but we didn&#039;t have many other funds apart from that.</div><div id="00:02:18.360" class="transcript_line"> We felt it was a good buy so we took the chance and the purchase went through in August that year.</div><div id="00:02:26.360" class="transcript_line"> In my naivety I thought a few grand, a lick of paint, it will be alright.</div><div id="00:02:34.360" class="transcript_line"> And I thought again in my naivety we&#039;d apply for something like the lottery funding and that would be okay.</div><div id="00:02:42.360" class="transcript_line"> The reality is it&#039;s taken us ten years in the making but in that time we&#039;ve done loads of fundraising.</div><div id="00:02:50.360" class="transcript_line"> We were given a lottery grant on the second application which was incredible and that gave us half a million pounds which was our starting point.</div><div id="00:03:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Wow, so that&#039;s quite a lot of money then.</div><div id="00:03:05.360" class="transcript_line"> It was, the total bill though was 1.4 million and fair play to all the grant holders who gave us the funds.</div><div id="00:03:14.360" class="transcript_line"> But a big shout out to Chepstow Community because everyone rallied together and everyone contributed to the project which we originally named Vision 2020.</div><div id="00:03:28.360" class="transcript_line"> But as we all know Covid came along in 2020 which kind of scuppered and delayed the plans.</div><div id="00:03:38.360" class="transcript_line"> But actually we got through it and we&#039;re now in this building as beautiful as it is.</div><div id="00:03:45.360" class="transcript_line"> So you said you were based at the Barclay before coming here to the board school.</div><div id="00:03:50.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:51.360" class="transcript_line"> The Barclays are building in Chepstow.</div><div id="00:03:54.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in the centre of Chepstow. It was a pub when we bought it.</div><div id="00:03:59.360" class="transcript_line"> We got planning permission to operate as a day centre and they actually converted and opened in 1998 which is 25 years ago.</div></div></p>
