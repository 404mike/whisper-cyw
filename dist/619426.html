    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born on the 11th of the 1st 1930 in Welshpool and I lived in Welshpool until I</div><div id="00:00:10.240" class="transcript_line"> went into the RAF at 20 years of age.</div><div id="00:00:14.240" class="transcript_line"> I came out of the Air Force in 1952 and I bought my old ironmonger shop down Bridge</div><div id="00:00:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Street and we came to move into the big house that was part of the business.</div><div id="00:00:26.040" class="transcript_line"> My father always used to come to Lambullin on a Thursday which was market day in Lambullin.</div><div id="00:00:32.800" class="transcript_line"> He had some very good friends at that time and these were on singing together.</div><div id="00:00:38.960" class="transcript_line"> My father was a real singer, he followed anywhere for a singing and spent the afternoon there</div><div id="00:00:44.520" class="transcript_line"> with the master of the dolly.</div><div id="00:00:47.720" class="transcript_line"> He was a big singer and they&#039;d go everywhere, they had a choir in Lambullin.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually he&#039;d have some of the inmates of the dolly in the choir and my father would</div><div id="00:00:58.680" class="transcript_line"> go and pick them up and help to take them to wherever they went.</div><div id="00:01:01.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean little villages and singing around the place but it kept the inmates, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:07.480" class="transcript_line"> like that word.</div><div id="00:01:08.480" class="transcript_line"> Well they kept them happy, they went out for a little bit of an evening out and a cup of</div><div id="00:01:12.640" class="transcript_line"> tea singing at the different villages and they got on well together.</div><div id="00:01:17.920" class="transcript_line"> There were some young people there as well, people that were homeless because circumstances</div><div id="00:01:24.440" class="transcript_line"> made it that way, nothing else.</div><div id="00:01:26.920" class="transcript_line"> And then there was some of the tramps they used to call him in my young day, I remember</div><div id="00:01:32.720" class="transcript_line"> one George the Tramp we called him and he used to do the garden for us when we were</div><div id="00:01:39.200" class="transcript_line"> living down Bridge Street and he did it for a good many years and I think all he used</div><div id="00:01:44.720" class="transcript_line"> to come for was to come for a meal that&#039;s what he said because he used to come in his</div><div id="00:01:48.160" class="transcript_line"> dinner ready and I go to be a little loved if he&#039;d sit in the household, it&#039;s raining</div><div id="00:01:53.080" class="transcript_line"> today, he&#039;d say I can&#039;t go out.</div><div id="00:01:55.640" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d sit there all day with us.</div><div id="00:01:57.480" class="transcript_line"> And then at night he went back to the dolly?</div><div id="00:01:59.120" class="transcript_line"> At night he&#039;d probably have to have somebody take him down in the car or something or he</div><div id="00:02:02.680" class="transcript_line"> could slip away and have a pint.</div><div id="00:02:04.760" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember the name of the person who came after?</div><div id="00:02:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Davies his name was.</div><div id="00:02:09.240" class="transcript_line"> William Thomas Davies?</div><div id="00:02:10.760" class="transcript_line"> He had a son Ryan he was Ryan and they were on the telly call and they were both beautiful</div><div id="00:02:17.680" class="transcript_line"> singers.</div><div id="00:02:18.680" class="transcript_line"> I can see him standing on the street in Lanluttenia now, he&#039;s standing outside where the spa</div><div id="00:02:25.560" class="transcript_line"> used to be.</div><div id="00:02:26.560" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d be standing on the corner and he would always dress the part of an actor or something</div><div id="00:02:32.800" class="transcript_line"> like that.</div><div id="00:02:33.800" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d have one of these trench coats, a silver hat, a cigarette in his hand and he used to</div><div id="00:02:40.640" class="transcript_line"> talk to him for ages.</div><div id="00:02:41.640" class="transcript_line"> Before long they&#039;d have a gang around and they&#039;d be all singing and before you could</div><div id="00:02:46.920" class="transcript_line"> say anything half the Count Valley or they&#039;d be coming out and joining the choir outside.</div><div id="00:02:52.280" class="transcript_line"> It was great days in those days, Lanluttenia was a great place to live.</div><div id="00:02:56.560" class="transcript_line"> So that would be sort of late 50s?</div><div id="00:02:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Late 50s, early 60s.</div><div id="00:03:01.040" class="transcript_line"> It sounds from what you&#039;re saying the town had a good relationship with the Dollies.</div><div id="00:03:06.520" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t any bad relationship, I think there were a lot of snooty people living in</div><div id="00:03:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Lanluttenia.</div><div id="00:03:12.600" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t like to be associated with the Dollies.</div><div id="00:03:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s what they called it in Lanluttenia, the workhouses and of course that didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:22.200" class="transcript_line"> go down with them.</div><div id="00:03:23.200" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d say there were mixed attitudes then?</div><div id="00:03:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Mixed attitudes yes.</div><div id="00:03:27.800" class="transcript_line"> It had quite a bit to do with the Dollies because you know when they&#039;d garden stuff,</div><div id="00:03:32.560" class="transcript_line"> the seeds and things we used to deliver it down and anything they wanted from the Iron</div><div id="00:03:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Wungry that we used to sell we used to go down there, go in and have a cup of tea with</div><div id="00:03:41.160" class="transcript_line"> them.</div><div id="00:03:42.160" class="transcript_line"> We used to have a lot of laughs with them down there.</div><div id="00:03:45.040" class="transcript_line"> Really they were some real comedians.</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember it as being full?</div><div id="00:03:49.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, a lot of people.</div><div id="00:03:54.440" class="transcript_line"> On the whole I think they all got on pretty well together.</div><div id="00:03:59.160" class="transcript_line"> They had a good home there.</div><div id="00:04:01.440" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit rough and ready but they had good food.</div><div id="00:04:05.960" class="transcript_line"> They were restricted to a few hours and things that they did, some of them didn&#039;t like.</div><div id="00:04:10.600" class="transcript_line"> They liked to be able to walk up to the pub at night going out fighting and perhaps they&#039;d</div><div id="00:04:15.400" class="transcript_line"> forget to come back.</div><div id="00:04:17.760" class="transcript_line"> They got on very well with people indeed.</div><div id="00:04:20.520" class="transcript_line"> In the forest, the forest church mouses we used to say, you could always get on and this</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> is both nicely to them and treated them as it.</div><div id="00:04:29.640" class="transcript_line"> There used to be one old chap.</div><div id="00:04:34.160" class="transcript_line"> I think he stopped in the Dollies in the winter but he used to sleep under the stars through</div><div id="00:04:41.560" class="transcript_line"> the summer.</div><div id="00:04:42.680" class="transcript_line"> He could tell you some tales he could tell you but it was nearly all in Welsh.</div><div id="00:04:48.120" class="transcript_line"> He used to say the most beautiful poetry so I&#039;m told.</div><div id="00:04:52.360" class="transcript_line"> All self-taught.</div><div id="00:04:53.360" class="transcript_line"> They say if you could understand it, something they did was, but there was a little to his</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> voice as well like he.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was a chap of about six foot four.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> A big chap and he built like a tank.</div></div></p>
