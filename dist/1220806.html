    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather, he was just a remarkable man. He was an extreme disciplinarian. He brought</div><div id="00:00:05.840" class="transcript_line"> my father unfortunately, I lost him during the war. I lived with my grandfather from</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> birth till I was 17 years of age. So in fact he was my father more than anybody else. He</div><div id="00:00:15.640" class="transcript_line"> was a disciplinarian. He was highly intelligent, very successful. I always remember when I</div><div id="00:00:21.760" class="transcript_line"> joined the British Army he wrote me a letter and the first thing he put on it was, remember</div><div id="00:00:25.760" class="transcript_line"> always to clean the welts of your shoes. I remember it to this day. He said because</div><div id="00:00:29.760" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re on parade the officers will look down and if you&#039;ve got dirty welts. He taught</div><div id="00:00:34.240" class="transcript_line"> me manners. He taught me how to behave. Although I&#039;m 80 years of age now, I&#039;ll never forget</div><div id="00:00:38.160" class="transcript_line"> it and he was a very strict but a good man. He had a very, very, very hard job. Times</div><div id="00:00:44.160" class="transcript_line"> you think about it now, he used to hand make all this mineral water, crates and crates</div><div id="00:00:48.720" class="transcript_line"> and crates of it. There were no heating, it was very difficult and he&#039;d load up a horse</div><div id="00:00:53.520" class="transcript_line"> and cart or a lorry in the winter and then suddenly a frost would come, break all the</div><div id="00:00:57.880" class="transcript_line"> bottles. Can you imagine it? And hundreds of the hours and had to do it all again. He&#039;d</div><div id="00:01:02.320" class="transcript_line"> open his shop on a Sunday morning and literally during the war the queues, a penny a bottle,</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> tuppence a bottle, things like that. And I used to count all the pennies and literally</div><div id="00:01:11.880" class="transcript_line"> maybe a hundred pound he&#039;d take on a Sunday morning which was all in pennies and tuppences.</div><div id="00:01:16.640" class="transcript_line"> And eventually he got old and he died at the age of 69 and he sold the business then I</div><div id="00:01:21.880" class="transcript_line"> believe to a company, another mineral water company. But he was very shrewd and he had</div><div id="00:01:27.720" class="transcript_line"> a house in Dukestown, the factory was next to the house and next to the factory he let</div><div id="00:01:34.080" class="transcript_line"> out a huge building to the Cooperative Wholesale Society who used it as a food warehouse during</div><div id="00:01:40.360" class="transcript_line"> the war. Now my earliest memories as a child was in the middle of the night of police and</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> other people coming with little tins to get food and it was very, very interesting how</div><div id="00:01:51.120" class="transcript_line"> they all did it and he was so generous with people, you know. The house was called Hawthorne</div><div id="00:01:54.960" class="transcript_line"> House and it became a staging post for refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany and the continent.</div><div id="00:02:01.080" class="transcript_line"> They used to come to Tredegar and I can remember them vividly with long beards and big hats</div><div id="00:02:05.980" class="transcript_line"> and couldn&#039;t speak English and they&#039;d come to the house. My grandfather would give them</div><div id="00:02:10.160" class="transcript_line"> then a five pound note, clothing, send them then to the next post which was probably in</div><div id="00:02:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham then they&#039;d do the same there and send them to Manchester and they&#039;d disperse</div><div id="00:02:19.800" class="transcript_line"> themselves but they all came to Tredegar. My cousins and I, I&#039;m sorry to say, used to</div><div id="00:02:24.640" class="transcript_line"> make fun of them and we used to call them Vishki Vashkis because they had such great</div><div id="00:02:27.720" class="transcript_line"> big whiskers, I&#039;ve never forgotten it. And we also adopted a couple of children, my grandfather</div><div id="00:02:32.360" class="transcript_line"> did, we took them in, refugees. The house was always full of people. I don&#039;t think there</div><div id="00:02:36.080" class="transcript_line"> was never a period between 1942 and 1944, two years, three years, where the house wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:42.680" class="transcript_line"> there. They had nine bedrooms, every night people were sleeping there and they had no</div><div id="00:02:46.800" class="transcript_line"> clothes, no they were in rags. How they came to, it is quite a story and a lot of them</div><div id="00:02:49.600" class="transcript_line"> became so successful in life afterwards but they were, they got out of Nazi Germany and</div><div id="00:02:55.080" class="transcript_line"> in fact in Merthyr Tidville there was a house there and I happened to know the gentleman</div><div id="00:03:01.480" class="transcript_line"> and he was doing some work in the house and he was stripping the walls and he had all</div><div id="00:03:05.800" class="transcript_line"> these names on this wall here and they were Jewish children who had written their names</div><div id="00:03:11.080" class="transcript_line"> on the wall and I believe the Jewish, the Kfarther Park Museum is trying to get those</div><div id="00:03:17.080" class="transcript_line"> names put in there. But the history, it means my grandparents were so much involved, you</div><div id="00:03:22.280" class="transcript_line"> know they were frightened to death that Hitler would invade because God knows we wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:26.080" class="transcript_line"> be here today if they had. And they did as much as they could and he wasn&#039;t on his own.</div><div id="00:03:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Jewish people in Triniga, in Cardiff, all over South Wales were so good to the Jewish</div><div id="00:03:34.720" class="transcript_line"> refugees. I don&#039;t think it would happen today the way they, you know, they realised what</div><div id="00:03:38.160" class="transcript_line"> was going on. They couldn&#039;t believe what they were saying because there was no news</div><div id="00:03:41.040" class="transcript_line"> coming out of Germany like this. And this is very strange, my uncle who came from Czechoslovakia,</div><div id="00:03:48.280" class="transcript_line"> his father and his brother was a Rabbi in Cardiff and he married my aunt. He was fought</div><div id="00:03:54.480" class="transcript_line"> in the First World War, in the Second World War, he was decorated from Gadendry at Dunkirk</div><div id="00:03:59.520" class="transcript_line"> but he was still a Czech national. Now he married my aunt and he was waiting for his</div><div id="00:04:04.160" class="transcript_line"> nationalisation papers to come. I can remember vividly at the end of the war, 1945 this must</div><div id="00:04:10.640" class="transcript_line"> have been, how old was I? I was probably about seven. And there was such a scene in the house,</div><div id="00:04:15.160" class="transcript_line"> he had a little baby, a telegram had arrived from the home office ordering him out of the</div><div id="00:04:18.560" class="transcript_line"> country to deport him because his nationalisation papers. My grandfather lifted up a telephone</div><div id="00:04:23.880" class="transcript_line"> and got through to an iron beaven who, my grandfather was a mentor of his and who supported</div><div id="00:04:28.980" class="transcript_line"> him very much and within hours it had all been put right and of course, but it was a</div><div id="00:04:33.120" class="transcript_line"> terrible shock at that time. He was very much involved with the Labour Party, my grandfather,</div><div id="00:04:37.360" class="transcript_line"> he was a tremendous socialist and I think he turned in his grave if he saw what was</div><div id="00:04:41.480" class="transcript_line"> happening today. And my mother in fact was a great friend of Jenny Lee so the association</div><div id="00:04:47.160" class="transcript_line"> goes back and it even goes back to me because when I was a young boy and we come to one</div><div id="00:04:51.560" class="transcript_line"> of the things here, I was educated in a Jewish school in London because there was no schooling,</div><div id="00:04:57.200" class="transcript_line"> no ministers, we used to have a Rabbi come over the mountains from Abedai to teach my</div><div id="00:05:01.560" class="transcript_line"> cousin and myself Hebrew which he did and my grandfather taught me but Jewish boys at</div><div id="00:05:06.800" class="transcript_line"> the age of 13 as you know get bar mitzvah and I had to go to a Jewish school to get</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> the knowledge. Now we had one particular day we went to the House of Commons and who should</div><div id="00:05:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I see was an iron beaven and I went up to him, much to the astonishment of the school</div><div id="00:05:21.960" class="transcript_line"> and he picked me up when I mentioned to him I was from Tredegar, a couple of weeks later</div><div id="00:05:27.600" class="transcript_line"> we had an invite from him to my school, invited myself and three of my friends to have tea</div><div id="00:05:31.640" class="transcript_line"> with him.</div></div></p>
