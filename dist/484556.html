Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Venue Swicker Office.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Date?</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> October 17th 2014.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee June Campbell-Davies.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> June, could you spell your full name for the record please?</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> J-U-N-E C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L-D-A-V-I-E-S.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks June.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, opening shot, could you explain how you first became or experienced Carnival in the UK?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, when I was quite young, maybe sort of 15, 16 years old, my dad used to take me and my sister to Carnival, Notting Hill Carnival.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> In London, and it&#039;s such a massive event, and we just basically used to go down and just stand on the side and watch the Carnival floats, listen to the steel pan.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he would just say, well let&#039;s go along and we&#039;ll find a favourite group and we&#039;ll just tag along behind.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;ll be hundreds of people and we would just sort of, they call it chipping where you just kind of have this little miniature sort of jog walk with the band that you&#039;re following.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was usually really loud, your eardrums would be ringing for days afterwards.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was brilliant because you just go for miles and miles on end and you&#039;d be tired, you&#039;d have a stitch and your feet are hurting but you still keep going.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we did this for a couple of years and I&#039;d be, every year, as soon as school finished, I&#039;d be thinking, can&#039;t wait to get to Carnival.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my first experience and it&#039;s never left me.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously when I moved to Cardiff, there wasn&#039;t any sort of Carnival as such until one year I saw, I was in town shopping and I heard this drumming from somewhere.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just saw this sort of like loads of people dressed up in the costumes I can think of.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> All I can remember now is like whites and blues in blocks and just traveling, dancing down St. Mary Street.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I just couldn&#039;t get over it.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was my first image of...</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you were an innocent bystander who saw the very first Cardiff Mars Carnival in 1990.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a traditional sailor Mars influenced by tradition from Trinidad.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And then a number of years later, you got involved in the Carnival for the first time.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell us more.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I had my daughter, she was about five then, and I used to go to dance classes at Rubicon in Splott and Jane Bellamy and Sally Verrell used to do a lot of community projects.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And they happened to mention that they are being involved in this Carnival.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, great, because I&#039;d seen...</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always missed it because I think me because I was going to Notting Hill, so I was never around when the Carnival was happening in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, well, you know, this will be great.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So it would be great to get feel involved because they said, anyone, you don&#039;t have to pay.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t get over you didn&#039;t have to pay.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You just turn up.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was free and people would help you make costumes.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, wow, this is brilliant.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So they told us to go along to Cattay&#039;s Terrace Community Center and went along.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was it was it just blew my mind when we walked in because they happened to be everything happened to be people making costumes.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They had drummers on one side.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a little area where people would dance.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to think, well, where are they going to do the dance?</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s no space.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But somehow they managed to clear the space and people learned to dance.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And Jane was leading some of the dance sequences.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t really know what group we were going to involve, but we just came along and we would just help making something.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just really was just trying to get feel involved.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it didn&#039;t take very long to start a conversation talking to people, complete strangers.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That was I found quite amazing because it&#039;s quite daunting when you walk into a place and you don&#039;t know where to go.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I do I do remember a lady called Shona who had this amazing dreadlocks, blonde dreadlocks and sort of toolkit and just kind of like a little</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> toolkit and just coming up with a really lovely friendly face coming up and saying, oh, you know, what would you like to do?</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we need this. And I&#039;m just just helping.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was just gobsmacked.</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was my that&#039;s my and my daughter&#039;s first experience.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And we the procession was quite a short procession, but it was just brilliant anyway, because what I didn&#039;t realize was that the drummers were going to be drumming as well.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why. You just don&#039;t connect everything together.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You just sort of hell bent on making what you make and make make making friends.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then on the day when everyone gets kitted out and you line up and then you start parading through the streets.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was fantastic. And then we ended up on the museum stairs and there&#039;s all these lights and sound and just seeing the general public behind this barricade, which was I don&#039;t know how thick it was.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like maybe 10 rows thick.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was just amazing. And we were on a real high and feel just loved it.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We just couldn&#039;t wait when it was over. It was like we want more.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So obviously his daughter, Fionn, grew up with the Carly Carnival.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What sort of impact do you think it&#039;s had on her in her younger days?</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And can you trace through to her more recent professional development?</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, well, she just loved it because we were able to take one of the little headdresses.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like from that that particular card, we kind of it was like some sort of purple sparkly and kids like sparkly stuff.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We have to take the mask home or something.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was playing with a lot at home.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I do remember her not being it can&#039;t can&#039;t wait for the next year.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And she would be really she wasn&#039;t always a hyper, but she&#039;s quite quiet child.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But at school, she said, Oh, mom, the kids keep telling me I&#039;m mad because, you know, I&#039;m just like, I do all sorts of strange things, whatever that was dancing around or whatever.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, if only they did carnival, they&#039;d understand.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, I was like, oh, my gosh, she really does.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> She really does like it. I mean, the thing is, at home when we put music on and she&#039;d be dancing and dressing up.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the I think the thing for young kids that they can express themselves.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we dance a lot at home and everything, but dressing up and putting on and making designing, what have you.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So every year we had to go religiously for carnival.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We would try and find out when it was happening and we would go down and we&#039;d learn the dances.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And she would she just had enormous energy.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I think when most kids will probably stop and cry and they&#039;re tired, she&#039;d just keep going.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a bit like a sort of Duracell batch.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You just keep going.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, yeah, every year she&#039;s probably she&#039;s got involved.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And the last couple of years, she&#039;s she&#039;s worked with Swicker helping out on the team and she has an interest in art.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So that kind of naturally sort of fell into place.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, with the advice of other artists just helping, she was able to kind of just get an idea of making stuff and putting that together,</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> helping other people put her own artistic input as well.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s been a real it&#039;s been a real she really looks forward to it.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> She gets a lot out of it.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t I think when she left to go away to train for three years in London and she came back, she and she got involved again.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s thought, God, I really miss this.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d really missed and value how important it is to be creative in that way.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, oh, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s wonderful is she falls in those bracket of people who originally had contact with Cardiff Carnival as community participants.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And now they&#039;re part of the professional team who help animate and inspire.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Of course, your role has been primarily about movement.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But we know you can wield a glue gun like a man.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you learn. That&#039;s it. You learn as you go along.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I must admit the early days I was just coming in just to kind of, you know, get high, dance on the street, make your costume and have a good good burst of energy.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember there was one dancer and I&#039;m wondering if it was a carnival that was maybe it was a carnival.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was some event in Channel View.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lady called Jenny Barbieri and they had Zamba Gala&#039;s playing and she managed to get a whole lot of dancers, professional dancers.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> This would be a Zamba Dome event.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Was that what it was?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I remember.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was amazing because we kind of filled, the whole place was filled in Channel View.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But she managed to get all these costumes together.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think she went to Sari shops and kind of got this fabric and billowed out these, you know, these, these, I don&#039;t know what kind of dancers we were.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if we were Bayana. I don&#039;t know what kind of.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was another memorable moment.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Fiona wasn&#039;t born at, I don&#039;t know, Fiona wasn&#039;t around at that time, but I remember thinking this is really great.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t take to the streets with that, but that was indoor.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was fabulous.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, I mean, whole generations of Cardiff Carnival revelers and participants have to thank you for personally releasing their inner dancer,</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> inspiring and encouraging them and getting people to move.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Even the classic, Oh, I can&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> People, I&#039;ve seen you.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as you say, it&#039;s all about the arts of transformation.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But on top of all the movement, of course, there is the costumes and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Given your long 18 year history of association with the Cardiff Carnival,</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> do you have some memorable standout costumes that you&#039;ve played that have meant something special for you whilst performing on parade?</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There there&#039;s a few. Let&#039;s see now.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one year where it was called Mask, I think the Mask, Mask, Harade.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we we all had to design sort of masks of some sort.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember who was working alongside me.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We had Melissa, because she&#039;s very good at Zamba dancing.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were some really nice designs.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was one that was a bit like sort of burlesque, but with sort of Victorian flouncy sort of skirts.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And and we had a lot of people actually get involved.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t have time to work on your own costume.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember thinking, God, I&#039;d really like to kind of I really like a costume like that.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So while we&#039;re there busy helping other people get stuff together and and you know, by the third week, you still have to get sequins on and more feathers and more.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I just thought I&#039;ll never get my costume together.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember I had something at home, an old skirt that I had.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, right, I&#039;m going to design my own little kind of damn Lorraine character.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was this old lady.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The only thing I could make, we had time to make was our masks.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a little half face mask and feathers.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had this damn Lorraine character and I sort of stuffed at my bottom with huge buttocks so that my Victorian green and black dress could hang outside.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, right, I&#039;m going to be an old lady.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a year that we had this sort of dragon feature.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We had this massive red dragon leading the parade.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And and I was just normally I run up and down and help out, get people zip tied and what have you.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, no, I really need to let us team.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I paraded up and down in character.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I still help people get in and out of their costumes and develop art.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember thinking, I&#039;m going to stay in this old character.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s see how long I can stay in this old character.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And because I noticed a lot of people bystanders are watching and they were really serious.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They were didn&#039;t seem to be enjoying.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, this is ridiculous. This is a colorful event.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not raining. It&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got people maybe they don&#039;t understand what it&#039;s about.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had gone up to a few people who were serious and kind of waved my umbrella at them and then wiggled my bum.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s only when I wiggled my bum that I managed to get a smile out of them.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So and that was that was fantastic.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Another memorable costume was well, we didn&#039;t have much of a costume actually.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a memorable event was being part of the Blue Devils.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a guy called Spooky had come over and he said that this is some kind of thing where everyone gets painted blue.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they have some rope tied around their waist and you&#039;ve got some sort of devil wings.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a particular drum beat and you would again it was it was a way of suddenly you became a different character.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Not you know, you just suddenly you&#039;re somebody else and you could be as impish and just wicked and devilish as you want.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Or you could you could just be really nice and you there was an opportunity to go up and beg for money.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t do that. But unfortunately, some of the kids did that.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> They enjoyed it. I think it&#039;s quite close to sort of Halloween where they can let you know trick or treat.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And if they didn&#039;t pay you, if they didn&#039;t pay and then they would get splattered with blue water.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But that what was interesting about that one was that you realize you had such power.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> People were absolutely freaked out by you if you looked at them, if you just looked and they didn&#039;t want to look at you.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember that was quite that was quite a memorable experience.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, it rained as well. So but it didn&#039;t stop us.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We just continue to, you know, go and do what we did.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I know that for my costume, I had the first time I wore a kind of corset and I had to use some blue material to kind of emphasize the your derriere backside.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had some really nice high cut knee boots.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, my heel broken one of them. So I had one heel.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So I felt like a sort of semi goat. So that&#039;s that&#039;s why a memorable and another memorable one.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And another carnival much earlier, probably 2000.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s to do with the citizenship.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s 2002 and that was working with Jane Bellamy.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to to the backpacks were like two blocks of flats.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It kind of it kind of went up in a kind of semi pyramid.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And and it was also a bit kind of awkward to dance with.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was quite memorable because it could have stood out.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember remembering looking at photographs, it stood out from all the rest of what was being made that these tower blocks.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not even sure if it&#039;s to do with nine and low.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know. But anyway, I remember that being quite memorable.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And the choreography, because Jane was very good at kind of, you know, getting things to change direction and getting people to cross over,</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> which sometimes isn&#039;t easy when you got people who involved in the dance and who haven&#039;t had much dance ability,</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> but she kind of persevered. And that was interesting also because we were working somewhere down in the down in the bay.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There was supposed to be the old Casablanca used to be.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a building there that we kind of rehearsed in there.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the first time we had a really nice dance space with two levels.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s kind of memorable and special, memorable again, because we had I&#039;m going off the tangent here.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember one girl falling off off the railing somehow and got impaled.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There was quite it was that was the only sad bit of the whole thing.</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We just thought what a wonderful place.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we and we couldn&#039;t work there again, I suppose we didn&#039;t, you know.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, those kind of three that really stood out as obviously the vast majority of our audience while we&#039;re praying,</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> enjoy, appreciate and even applaud.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But back in the mid 90s, you had a very unpleasant experience in public, but which I hasten to add,</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you brought to well, a certain amount of natural justice was served.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you care to tell us more about that?</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was again dancing.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was actually wasn&#039;t actually working part of I was like a participant coming in dancing with Jane Bellamy&#039;s group.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t remember how costumed as such.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was with another mother, Marion.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think feeling was feeling wasn&#039;t around then at all, actually.</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But Marion and both of both of us were in this section dancing and we were parading through a number of different places.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> In this section dancing and we were parading through a new part of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember where we have the the market and where you have the stairs that goes up into Argos.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That was kind of fairly new.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were parading around there and that&#039;s an area where we stood for a bit.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And also the pedestrian could they could stand up on the stairs and look down as we were passing through.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we noticed there was one guy we had whistles.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We could blow whistles and make our own little sort of our own sound as we went along.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We noticed one guy had come in from the crowd into the group.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were a bit annoyed because we&#039;re doing the choreography and he was getting in the way.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t we just thought, oh, maybe he&#039;ll just surpass us and go off.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t. He just kept he was just there kind of hanging about.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just remember blowing the whistle, a particular rhythm or whatever it was.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And he just turned around, said something quite racist, spat at me,</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> which really threw me because I wasn&#039;t expecting it, spat at Marion as well.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he just he just ran off.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, the thing is, I was so I mean, I did have a small bag with me.</div><div id="00:17:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m really glad that I had, you know, I had a little kind of I don&#039;t know what it was.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t special brew. I did have a little drink just to help me along the way, you know,</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> with as I was dancing, as you do.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was a little bit merry as well as shocked at the same time.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was really annoyed. I thought, I&#039;m not going to have this guy getting over this.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So I very quickly looked around to see if there was any cameras around.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I just charged off to try and chase him as he went through the car.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I kicked him up the backside and ran back, hoping that he wasn&#039;t going to wasn&#039;t going to find me.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a bit of a cat and mouse kind of thing going on.</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was so miffed because I thought this has never happened before.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And we did report him to the stewards.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And we looked to see where he&#039;d gone because there&#039;s a lot of people.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d gone up the stairs and we&#039;d seen that he&#039;d changed from what he was wearing into something else.</div><div id="00:18:19.000" class="transcript_line"> He put a jacket on or something.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they I think they must have questioned him, whatever.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But by that time we had to carry on.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the most unpleasant thing. That&#039;s never we never had any racist anything.</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Racist happened to us or abuse or anything.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was that was a bit that moment there was a little bit worrying because I wasn&#039;t sure what he was going to do.</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure I must have swore back at him in shock and horror.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m glad I gave him a kick.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I just think it&#039;s fabulous that you had the last word kicked about the bum.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I that that made me feel better.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if I hadn&#039;t had that lager.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what I would have done. I probably wouldn&#039;t have done that.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not what one should do.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> As somebody who&#039;s had contact with the carnival, both as participants and as the most fabulous colleague and choreographer and dance tutor,</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> for we reckon that you&#039;ve had contact with 18 years of Cardiff Carnival, which makes you a carnival hero.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> If you had any thoughts about the future or the importance of Cardiff Carnival, would you care to share them with us just to end the interview?</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s it all about? Where&#039;s it going? Why are we here?</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, I think I think what them know, as I&#039;ve seen carnival over the years in Cardiff and I think what&#039;s really</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> magical about it, apart from when we go out on the street and you actually see the work that&#039;s gone into what people have made,</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s really important. It just brings people together.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s it&#039;s amazing what it does. Just the fact you come in and you make you make you you help make other people&#039;s costumes or you help make your own.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can talk to somebody who you&#039;ve never met before.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s really great at breaking down barriers.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Some people, a lot of people still, you know, maybe at home they don&#039;t do anything.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They might be out of work, they might be disabled, they can&#039;t get out.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And it really brings people out. And I think it&#039;s fantastic that it&#039;s free.</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think people still don&#039;t realize that it&#039;s free, even though we get all the leaflets out.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re still amazed. People still forget sometimes that it&#039;s on this particular day, because when they see it and you see their faces, it&#039;s like they are, you know, they&#039;re in awe of it all.</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s changed from I remember from the very beginning, it was a bit more I wouldn&#039;t say the costumes.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They were a bit more, I suppose, creative in a sense that you might have an idea and so that it might slightly veer off a little bit.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was room for creative experiment. I think now we&#039;re looking at more detail.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So in a way, as well as it looking beautiful and polished and exquisitely made, there&#039;s detail in there and people are learning.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I think people are learning more from the skills of making something, maybe much more than they did earlier on.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I didn&#039;t when I first participated. It was a case of just stick it whatever on.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I&#039;m thinking, right, if I had to go and do this and I wasn&#039;t involved in Cardiff, I think I can remember how to make a template.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And so there&#039;s some sort of skills that are being passed down and around.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think what is really still difficult is getting people from different areas of Cardiff to come into one area to participate.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, you won&#039;t be from Adamstown or from Ely or they&#039;re still really difficult.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t that&#039;s because that&#039;s what Cardiff&#039;s like.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So but I think it&#039;s I think it&#039;s a really important thing that has to keep going.</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Even with all the cuts, I think Carnival is one way of getting people together of all different age groups.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something that makes people feel proud of their city, whether it&#039;s raining, snowing or whatever.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That galvanizes people onto the streets.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They come together for a special moment.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And and again, for those who have been with the car on and off, who&#039;ve maybe been in the early days and come back later on, it&#039;s a bit like Christmas.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t see people for a long time.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s that once a year we all gather together and celebrate, celebrate life, celebrate, catch upon what people are doing.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think I think it&#039;s amazing that it&#039;s just keeps going and it keeps evolving.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think things do have to evolve.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know which way.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully it will still happen.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> June Campbell Davis, I repeat, you are a carnival hero and many, many thanks for the interview.</div><div id="00:22:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And thank you.</div></div></p>
