Elizabeth, can we start first of all with your early life,</div><div id="00:00:16.320" class="transcript_line"> where you were born, where you grew up?</div><div id="00:00:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m close to 50 now.</div><div id="00:00:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t do a come on back.</div><div id="00:00:25.320" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s all right. Yeah, just talk. That&#039;s fine, yes.</div><div id="00:00:28.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, you came from Liverpool, I believe.</div><div id="00:00:31.640" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Liverpool. I was there until I was eight when the war broke out, removed from there.</div><div id="00:00:36.640" class="transcript_line"> So you basically came as an evacuee, did you? Was that the term they used?</div><div id="00:00:41.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:00:42.640" class="transcript_line"> To come to Mid Wales, right? Where exactly in Mid Wales did you come to?</div><div id="00:00:47.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, my twin and I came to Aberlebenny, which is a village on the side of my country.</div><div id="00:00:52.960" class="transcript_line"> To people my parents knew. Everyone had to take refugees anyway.</div><div id="00:00:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was a big house and they were very important people in the military.</div><div id="00:01:04.960" class="transcript_line"> And my other sisters, they were twins, went to a small holding near Clwyd o&#039; Gwydarn,</div><div id="00:01:12.960" class="transcript_line"> called the Dollars. And they were there with three old aunts, very quaint old aunts.</div><div id="00:01:18.280" class="transcript_line"> They wore clogs and long black skirts and they were very old, very ancient.</div><div id="00:01:23.280" class="transcript_line"> But they loved it there.</div><div id="00:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, that would have been quite enough rooting, but what a lovely place.</div><div id="00:01:30.280" class="transcript_line"> We were all split up.</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a bit unfortunate, I suppose.</div><div id="00:01:35.280" class="transcript_line"> And my brother up in Bangor with his school.</div><div id="00:01:38.280" class="transcript_line"> Right. But you all came to very rural settings then, totally different from Liverpool, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:01:43.600" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely, yes.</div><div id="00:01:44.600" class="transcript_line"> No bathroom, no water outside, no water in.</div><div id="00:01:50.600" class="transcript_line"> It was quite different. I actually liked to get the sticks and things for the fire to boil the kettle sort of thing.</div><div id="00:01:56.600" class="transcript_line"> And a little oil lamp, a little oil stove.</div><div id="00:02:01.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember something about that.</div><div id="00:02:04.600" class="transcript_line"> But not like today with the electric.</div><div id="00:02:07.600" class="transcript_line"> People today just wouldn&#039;t recognise places like that.</div><div id="00:02:11.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to go and see it now, see what it&#039;s like.</div><div id="00:02:14.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you will. I hope you have the opportunity.</div><div id="00:02:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Right, so you were living in mid Wales and I believe at some point in your life you trained as a nurse.</div><div id="00:02:28.920" class="transcript_line"> Did you go back to Liverpool to do that?</div><div id="00:02:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did. I was born in Birmingham, Liverpool.</div><div id="00:02:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Back there before, yes.</div><div id="00:02:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Back to Liverpool.</div><div id="00:02:40.240" class="transcript_line"> I certainly remember my own mother meeting you in the orthopaedic hospital in Gubowin in the very early 50s.</div><div id="00:02:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember that.</div><div id="00:02:49.240" class="transcript_line"> I was a very little girl there but Mum did tell me about that.</div><div id="00:02:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> So how, if I can ask, how did you come to marry Alan?</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> How did you come to meet him?</div><div id="00:03:00.240" class="transcript_line"> He was a blind date.</div><div id="00:03:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And I went on this Sunday afternoon to both my twin and her boyfriend and Nana.</div><div id="00:03:08.560" class="transcript_line"> It was friendly with him.</div><div id="00:03:10.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where we met.</div><div id="00:03:12.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where we met a bit.</div><div id="00:03:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Indeed.</div><div id="00:03:15.560" class="transcript_line"> What a lovely memory.</div><div id="00:03:17.560" class="transcript_line"> That blind date was obviously meant to be, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Especially in a lovely place like both.</div><div id="00:03:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You certainly came to the best part of the world, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:25.560" class="transcript_line"> I think so.</div><div id="00:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> For your early years and your early years of knowing Alan, of course.</div><div id="00:03:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Fine.</div><div id="00:03:31.880" class="transcript_line"> So when you decided to get married then, farming life wasn&#039;t really new to you at all.</div><div id="00:03:36.880" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d had quite a bit of experience.</div><div id="00:03:38.880" class="transcript_line"> And small holding.</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we got used to the animals.</div><div id="00:03:42.880" class="transcript_line"> We could milk and do all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:03:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Right, so it wasn&#039;t just a big shock, having grown into farming life.</div><div id="00:03:52.880" class="transcript_line"> And of course they had men.</div><div id="00:03:54.880" class="transcript_line"> The women didn&#039;t really have to go out on the park to do anything like that.</div><div id="00:03:58.200" class="transcript_line"> Today, women all go out on their wives to help their husbands.</div><div id="00:04:02.200" class="transcript_line"> It seems that way, yes.</div><div id="00:04:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any special memories of farming in Kevin Kaido as you were living then?</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Nothing that stands out.</div><div id="00:04:15.200" class="transcript_line"> It was just everyday things that we had to do.</div><div id="00:04:18.200" class="transcript_line"> We had to separate it.</div><div id="00:04:20.200" class="transcript_line"> We always milked.</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> We never bought any milk until we went to live in town.</div><div id="00:04:24.520" class="transcript_line"> We used to milk and separate it and make butter, churn and things.</div><div id="00:04:28.520" class="transcript_line"> The wives today all go out to work, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:31.520" class="transcript_line"> They seem to, yes.</div><div id="00:04:33.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you haven&#039;t got time to do your own work, never mind go out there with no electric or anything.</div><div id="00:04:38.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so hard to believe, isn&#039;t it?
