    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:06.960" class="transcript_line"> The location of the interview is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date is the 13th of October 2015 and with me I have Sarah and Ren.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Ren would you be kind enough to go first and spell your name in full for the record?</div><div id="00:00:24.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Ren Hubbock-Mellie, so that&#039;s R-E-N-N-N-N-H-U-B-B-U-C-K-M-E-L-L-Y.</div><div id="00:00:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Lovely. Sarah would you do the same please?</div><div id="00:00:34.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Sarah Annoil, which is spelled S-A-R-A-A-N-N-W-Y-L.</div><div id="00:00:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Lovely and we&#039;re off. So the carnival just gone, Cardiff Carnival 2015.</div><div id="00:00:45.080" class="transcript_line"> How and in what way did you lovely people take part?</div><div id="00:00:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, we were participating in glorious fashion by puppeteering a giant blue bald naked fertility goddess</div><div id="00:01:01.080" class="transcript_line"> down through the streets of Cardiff, which is an awesome experience.</div><div id="00:01:06.200" class="transcript_line"> A really hard physical work and just really, really sort of celebratory and fun as well as quite adversarial at times.</div><div id="00:01:14.920" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the vision and the author of the work was Nicky Fogarty.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> What were her influences when she made this piece?</div><div id="00:01:24.520" class="transcript_line"> I remember she said some photographs with me way before she ever bent a willow cane and covered it with anything.</div><div id="00:01:30.120" class="transcript_line"> I think the whole idea grew and grew and grew until it became enormous and became much bigger than she expected.</div><div id="00:01:34.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:01:36.200" class="transcript_line"> She was looking into pre-Columbian fertility goddess ideas basically around feminine empowerment and feminine sexuality.</div><div id="00:01:44.440" class="transcript_line"> But accessing a whole load of sort of contemporary and sort of 70s feminist ideas about the female radical sort of sexual power.</div><div id="00:01:52.520" class="transcript_line"> I remember her showing me a picture of a sort of a pre-Columbian fertility goddess and we both agreed that,</div><div id="00:02:00.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah, she&#039;s all bum, belly and bust. That&#039;s what she&#039;s going to be.</div><div id="00:02:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Nicky was saying that.</div><div id="00:02:05.560" class="transcript_line"> So Nicky&#039;s inside this backpack and she&#039;s in a sense coming down.</div><div id="00:02:10.920" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s an extension of the spine of this giant blue woman who&#039;s got to be at least three meters high, if not higher.</div><div id="00:02:17.400" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m right in thinking that she&#039;s in a, we can name it, why not, we&#039;re advertising a Tesco trolley too.</div><div id="00:02:24.360" class="transcript_line"> And that she has two hands which can be operated as well and they&#039;re on bamboo sticks.</div><div id="00:02:29.640" class="transcript_line"> And this is where you both come in. Is that right?</div><div id="00:02:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So what was it like operating that?</div><div id="00:02:34.680" class="transcript_line"> What was it? Because it seems to be quite a powerful statement to be parading a giant,</div><div id="00:02:42.360" class="transcript_line"> naked blue woman through the streets of Cardiff in 2015.</div><div id="00:02:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Exactly the kind of statement I personally approve of.</div><div id="00:02:49.160" class="transcript_line"> How did the audience react or not, as the case may be?</div><div id="00:02:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was lots of different kind of reactions.</div><div id="00:02:55.720" class="transcript_line"> The older women were cheering as soon as they saw it.</div><div id="00:02:59.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because there&#039;s also not just that this beautiful blue woman,</div><div id="00:03:04.120" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s also these quotes that she put on, such as we are people, not things.</div><div id="00:03:09.240" class="transcript_line"> She took, I think, from the internet or other places.</div><div id="00:03:13.800" class="transcript_line"> So they were all over.</div><div id="00:03:15.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think people are also quite confused by what it was.</div><div id="00:03:19.400" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t entirely sure how to take it.</div><div id="00:03:21.960" class="transcript_line"> So the men, a lot of them were just sort of quite quiet and didn&#039;t really know how to react.</div><div id="00:03:27.720" class="transcript_line"> It was quite interesting that because it wasn&#039;t sexy, but it was naked.</div><div id="00:03:32.920" class="transcript_line"> She had a big belly, big boobs, big bums.</div><div id="00:03:34.840" class="transcript_line"> People were initially like, my god&#039;s big naked lady.</div><div id="00:03:38.120" class="transcript_line"> And then they were like, well, there&#039;s something more being said here.</div><div id="00:03:40.360" class="transcript_line"> So that was just, there was not confusion, but an interesting sort of it was the biggest impact,</div><div id="00:03:44.920" class="transcript_line"> I think, of that particular carnival.</div><div id="00:03:46.520" class="transcript_line"> The biggest.</div><div id="00:03:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was the biggest single visual statement.</div><div id="00:03:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:03:49.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, really strong, really big.</div><div id="00:03:52.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:52.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had half the sky written on the back as well, which is Chinese phrase,</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> which is basically women are half the sky.</div><div id="00:03:59.320" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:04:00.920" class="transcript_line"> And so she had the sky and the sky theme going through it,</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> which is why the sculpture was blue and had stars.</div><div id="00:04:05.480" class="transcript_line"> Desert and everything at the bottom.</div><div id="00:04:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was a thing of great beauty.</div><div id="00:04:09.480" class="transcript_line"> And there will be pictures of this in the Victoria archive that we put up as well.</div><div id="00:04:13.720" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a mistake in your saying that there was one male scallywag who,</div><div id="00:04:19.240" class="transcript_line"> in fact, took it upon themselves to express their artistic critical opinion of.</div><div id="00:04:24.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was I was operating one of the hands.</div><div id="00:04:26.680" class="transcript_line"> So while Sarah was with the other arm and Nicky was sort of pulling pushing the trolley,</div><div id="00:04:32.200" class="transcript_line"> this man sort of stepped out pretty much in front of me and he just looked at it.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he initially was sort of quite happy to see it, I think,</div><div id="00:04:42.280" class="transcript_line"> because it was like a sexy lady.</div><div id="00:04:43.640" class="transcript_line"> But then he read some of the quotes and he basically said, F you.</div><div id="00:04:48.120" class="transcript_line"> And he tried to laugh it off almost.</div><div id="00:04:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, I was I was not entirely sure what he said at first.</div><div id="00:04:53.880" class="transcript_line"> I realized I was it was too late to be like, why did you say that?</div><div id="00:04:57.800" class="transcript_line"> And what really offended you about this?</div><div id="00:05:00.120" class="transcript_line"> It was interesting because the whole thing wasn&#039;t negative.</div><div id="00:05:02.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hugely positive.</div><div id="00:05:03.560" class="transcript_line"> So basically it was just celebration.</div><div id="00:05:05.080" class="transcript_line"> It was saying nothing negative about men, nothing negative about women,</div><div id="00:05:07.640" class="transcript_line"> just a celebration of female sexuality.</div><div id="00:05:09.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it really.</div><div id="00:05:10.840" class="transcript_line"> But basically, because it made it really clear to me as somebody</div><div id="00:05:14.680" class="transcript_line"> who basically just assumes that we&#039;re all feminists these days,</div><div id="00:05:17.800" class="transcript_line"> that that isn&#039;t the scenario.</div><div id="00:05:19.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where you go down the street and you see like men hanging out of windows,</div><div id="00:05:23.880" class="transcript_line"> cat calling it.</div><div id="00:05:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:25.180" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re like, because of the buzz.</div><div id="00:05:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s a boo.</div><div id="00:05:29.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s kind of sad.</div><div id="00:05:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But also, yeah, a lot of younger women, one young lady came up to me and said,</div><div id="00:05:34.040" class="transcript_line"> can I just ask what this is about?</div><div id="00:05:35.480" class="transcript_line"> So she was probably about 18 or 19.</div><div id="00:05:37.320" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, it&#039;s about us being people, not things.</div><div id="00:05:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, that&#039;s what we thought it was about.</div><div id="00:05:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Yay.</div><div id="00:05:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was positive.</div><div id="00:05:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Very positive.</div><div id="00:05:48.120" class="transcript_line"> I think it was.</div><div id="00:05:49.080" class="transcript_line"> And of course, you did mention what should we call the tumbleweed factor,</div><div id="00:05:53.080" class="transcript_line"> that not only did you have the biggest structure with the three of you</div><div id="00:05:57.080" class="transcript_line"> weeding it, the length and breadth of Cardiff City Centre,</div><div id="00:05:59.800" class="transcript_line"> but then you have the last stretch on the way home.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How were you affected by the wind and the rest of it?</div><div id="00:06:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Because it was a big structure.</div><div id="00:06:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Basically, I pulled my back out.</div><div id="00:06:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Will your lawyers be in touch?</div><div id="00:06:12.040" class="transcript_line"> They will, yes.</div><div id="00:06:13.400" class="transcript_line"> Because it was hugely heavy.</div><div id="00:06:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Really physical.</div><div id="00:06:16.280" class="transcript_line"> But that was part of it, really, because you put loads of work into making</div><div id="00:06:19.640" class="transcript_line"> the sculpture move and dance and stuff.</div><div id="00:06:21.480" class="transcript_line"> We had this really strong wind, especially on Churchill Way.</div><div id="00:06:25.320" class="transcript_line"> And we were almost toppled over in this.</div><div id="00:06:28.120" class="transcript_line"> It felt almost like both of you had a physical fight as well,</div><div id="00:06:31.480" class="transcript_line"> because you had to push this big object.</div><div id="00:06:34.600" class="transcript_line"> And it was hard.</div><div id="00:06:35.800" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t easy.</div><div id="00:06:37.240" class="transcript_line"> And you had to just keep on going.</div><div id="00:06:38.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was like this endurance test as well.</div><div id="00:06:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of mirrored the struggle of women.</div><div id="00:06:44.520" class="transcript_line"> No, no, there&#039;s a synergy about the whole.</div><div id="00:06:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:06:48.920" class="transcript_line"> I could see it all in my head.</div><div id="00:06:50.360" class="transcript_line"> It was great because we were dressed in blue and we had sky face paint on.</div><div id="00:06:53.400" class="transcript_line"> So it was like we were part of the sculpture.</div><div id="00:06:55.240" class="transcript_line"> And then to puppety of the arms, we have the dance.</div><div id="00:06:57.720" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like this thing that we were all part of.</div><div id="00:07:00.280" class="transcript_line"> It was really great.</div><div id="00:07:01.080" class="transcript_line"> A gestalt being more than the sum of your parts.</div><div id="00:07:03.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s how I felt about it.</div><div id="00:07:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the Cardiff Parliament War 2015 parade</div><div id="00:07:10.840" class="transcript_line"> is not the only parading you have done with Swicker.</div><div id="00:07:14.200" class="transcript_line"> You are, if not veterans, then you&#039;ve certainly had a taste</div><div id="00:07:17.240" class="transcript_line"> of more on one occasion of the National St David&#039;s Day parade.</div><div id="00:07:22.280" class="transcript_line"> How does that feel?</div><div id="00:07:22.920" class="transcript_line"> How does that compare?</div><div id="00:07:24.760" class="transcript_line"> What are your experiences there?</div><div id="00:07:25.800" class="transcript_line"> What did you do?</div><div id="00:07:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Were you dragons?</div><div id="00:07:27.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was quite interesting.</div><div id="00:07:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Such sculptures that we had on us were probably one of the biggest.</div><div id="00:07:35.480" class="transcript_line"> The costies, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:36.760" class="transcript_line"> In the carnival.</div><div id="00:07:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lot of attention on us, especially when we got to the end</div><div id="00:07:41.640" class="transcript_line"> and we were just out in the castle.</div><div id="00:07:44.200" class="transcript_line"> So many people wanted photos and that was really odd.</div><div id="00:07:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Ren basically had a shamanic experience.</div><div id="00:07:51.560" class="transcript_line"> She went into dragon mode and she wasn&#039;t Ren anymore.</div><div id="00:07:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Jumping around like, I was a fly.</div><div id="00:08:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes the costume came over.</div><div id="00:08:02.840" class="transcript_line"> It really did.</div><div id="00:08:03.400" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it felt like.</div><div id="00:08:04.600" class="transcript_line"> I was in an altar state, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:08:06.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:08:07.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s funny.</div><div id="00:08:08.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:08:09.240" class="transcript_line"> She was photobombing my photos.</div><div id="00:08:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was like.</div><div id="00:08:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the thing about that particular parade is that you get to see in such sort of explicit</div><div id="00:08:18.680" class="transcript_line"> and again, celebratory party manner, all the different sort of communities, basically.</div><div id="00:08:24.360" class="transcript_line"> So you have people and they&#039;re all, you know, the Malaysians of Cardiff or so and so.</div><div id="00:08:28.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just so great that everybody&#039;s coming together into that thing.</div><div id="00:08:32.280" class="transcript_line"> It just doesn&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:08:34.760" class="transcript_line"> And it makes you realise how many different communities there are in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:08:37.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, hidden communities for most of us.</div><div id="00:08:39.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:08:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re both practicing artists.</div><div id="00:08:44.120" class="transcript_line"> I want to again, just for austerity, for we are talking into the future here.</div><div id="00:08:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Would you care to say a little bit about yourself as an artist?</div><div id="00:08:50.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re yeah, well, you&#039;ve come and practice a statement from Ren.</div><div id="00:08:55.400" class="transcript_line"> What do you think, Ren?</div><div id="00:08:56.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a writer and I also perform as well.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of the stuff that I perform is quite graphic.</div><div id="00:09:02.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite explicit.</div><div id="00:09:03.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about the body.</div><div id="00:09:04.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about boundaries and a lot of it&#039;s about sex.</div><div id="00:09:07.720" class="transcript_line"> So I try to sort of broach to be subjects by basically throwing it in people&#039;s face.</div><div id="00:09:13.800" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s comic.</div><div id="00:09:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:18.600" class="transcript_line"> And also I host events.</div><div id="00:09:20.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to set up a young writers collective called Etch.</div><div id="00:09:24.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m also trying to set up an open mic for specifically to</div><div id="00:09:31.960" class="transcript_line"> try to encourage people to perform, like to experiment performance as well.</div><div id="00:09:36.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s called Duke.</div><div id="00:09:37.720" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not trying to set it up.</div><div id="00:09:38.600" class="transcript_line"> You are setting it up.</div><div id="00:09:39.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I am.</div><div id="00:09:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:41.320" class="transcript_line"> And also I&#039;m...</div><div id="00:09:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Listen to your manager.</div><div id="00:09:43.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m also in the third year of uni and my dissertation is creative writing</div><div id="00:09:49.720" class="transcript_line"> and is also focused on female sexuality.</div><div id="00:09:52.040" class="transcript_line"> So it felt very much synchronous for me to...</div><div id="00:09:56.920" class="transcript_line"> To go through that experience in carnival.</div><div id="00:09:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:59.240" class="transcript_line"> And to realize that this fight isn&#039;t over.</div><div id="00:10:02.440" class="transcript_line"> That we need to keep talking about this.</div><div id="00:10:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:05.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not old hat.</div><div id="00:10:06.280" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:10:07.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m an artist.</div><div id="00:10:08.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a contemporary artist, which means that I do all kinds of stuff,</div><div id="00:10:11.160" class="transcript_line"> which are really hard to pigeonhole.</div><div id="00:10:12.520" class="transcript_line"> But basically my work as an artist tends to involve engagement with other people,</div><div id="00:10:16.680" class="transcript_line"> conversations, work involving video or kind of event based stuff.</div><div id="00:10:21.640" class="transcript_line"> I also curate, which means I work with other artists and their practices</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> to make events happen so they bring all their artwork in.</div><div id="00:10:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m writing as well and I&#039;m writing a book at the moment.</div><div id="00:10:32.040" class="transcript_line"> The main thing, which really was odd about doing the sculptural thing,</div><div id="00:10:35.720" class="transcript_line"> is that I&#039;ve just started a project for three years called Perfect Me,</div><div id="00:10:39.320" class="transcript_line"> which isn&#039;t feminist per se, but it absolutely hits all of those things,</div><div id="00:10:43.080" class="transcript_line"> those things, those kind of targets,</div><div id="00:10:44.920" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s about our relationship to our bodies, our physicality.</div><div id="00:10:47.800" class="transcript_line"> So I have a big problem, like most women, accepting my body,</div><div id="00:10:51.320" class="transcript_line"> feeling overweight and generally being burdened by the Western objectification of selfhood.</div><div id="00:10:57.240" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it felt very, very, again, synchronous that we were doing it.</div><div id="00:11:01.320" class="transcript_line"> But also you&#039;re bald.</div><div id="00:11:02.600" class="transcript_line"> And also I&#039;m bald.</div><div id="00:11:03.720" class="transcript_line"> So not that big of a deal.</div><div id="00:11:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a pre-Columbian for tinnitus.</div><div id="00:11:07.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:11.400" class="transcript_line"> What can I say?</div><div id="00:11:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Sara Red, thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:11:13.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to award you the invisible but yet eternal.</div><div id="00:11:18.040" class="transcript_line"> You are both heroes of Cardiff Cardinal.</div><div id="00:11:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:11:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Yay, thank you.</div><div id="00:11:22.280" class="transcript_line"> That was lovely.</div></div></p>
