    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Upper Avon Valley Collieries. The Upper Avon Valley had five working</div><div id="00:00:05.680" class="transcript_line"> collieries on vesting day. Nantelite Colliery sunk in 1884 closed October</div><div id="00:00:12.080" class="transcript_line"> 1948. North Rhondda Colliery, North Pit, sunk in 1908 closed July 1960. Dufferin</div><div id="00:00:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Rhondda, unknown which year it was sunk, closed November 1966. Avon Colliery, sunk</div><div id="00:00:26.880" class="transcript_line"> in 1877 closed September 1969. Glyncorug Colliery, South Pit, sunk 1904 closed May</div><div id="00:00:35.480" class="transcript_line"> 1970. Most of the miners from Glyncorug would have worked at South Pit which</div><div id="00:00:40.720" class="transcript_line"> employed 772 men in 1950 or in North Pit which employed 220 men in 1954. Both of</div><div id="00:00:48.320" class="transcript_line"> these pits were within half a mile of the village. Nantelite Colliery, the</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> deepest of all the Upper Avon Collieries, was about a mile further down the valley.</div><div id="00:00:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Work in the mines was both dirty and dangerous but each pit had its own</div><div id="00:01:00.440" class="transcript_line"> peculiar conditions. Some would work high seams other much lower seams as</div><div id="00:01:04.880" class="transcript_line"> low as two feet which meant that most of the time they were lying on their sides</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> to fill the coal. During the summer months the men would swim with their</div><div id="00:01:12.960" class="transcript_line"> children in the River Corug in makeshift swimming pools. You could always tell</div><div id="00:01:16.720" class="transcript_line"> the men from South Pit by their strong well-developed stomach muscles which</div><div id="00:01:20.220" class="transcript_line"> came from working the low seams. Whilst the community of Glyncorug was strong</div><div id="00:01:24.480" class="transcript_line"> and close-knit the pits could be said to represent a community within a</div><div id="00:01:27.680" class="transcript_line"> community so to speak. This was no more evident than when entering any of the</div><div id="00:01:31.920" class="transcript_line"> public houses at the time. The men from South Pit would sit together in groups</div><div id="00:01:35.480" class="transcript_line"> as with those from North Pit. Not that they were not good mates because they</div><div id="00:01:39.880" class="transcript_line"> were but because members of the individual groups had something in</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> common. They worked at the same pit and the topic of conversation was always the</div><div id="00:01:47.080" class="transcript_line"> same. What happened today in their pit? It was often said that there was more coal</div><div id="00:01:51.940" class="transcript_line"> produced in the pub than ever there was in the pits. The largest of the</div><div id="00:01:55.860" class="transcript_line"> collieries in the area was Dufferinrondhe, situated at the mouth of the</div><div id="00:01:59.660" class="transcript_line"> Corug Valley which in 1950 employed 1,031 men. Located in the village of</div><div id="00:02:05.340" class="transcript_line"> Abergynvie around four miles from Glyncorug in the upper reaches of the</div><div id="00:02:08.700" class="transcript_line"> Avon Valley was the Avon Colliery which in 1950 had a workforce of 669 men.</div><div id="00:02:14.100" class="transcript_line"> Within a space of 10 years between 1960 and 1970 all the collieries in the upper</div><div id="00:02:19.300" class="transcript_line"> Avon had closed with a loss of 2,596 jobs. In 1961 the population of</div><div id="00:02:25.980" class="transcript_line"> Glyncorug stood at 1,862 but by 1991 this had been reduced to just 1,247, a</div><div id="00:02:33.780" class="transcript_line"> massive 33% reduction over a 30-year period. When South Pit closed in 1970 the</div><div id="00:02:41.460" class="transcript_line"> South Wales Mineral Railway also closed which left Glyncorug and the rest of the</div><div id="00:02:45.500" class="transcript_line"> upper Avon Valley isolated, effectively cutting them off from the lucrative</div><div id="00:02:49.460" class="transcript_line"> coastal belt.</div></div></p>
