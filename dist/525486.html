    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is the 23rd of June 2009. My name is John Butler and I&#039;m in the Connors Key</div><div id="00:00:12.560" class="transcript_line"> home of my former English teacher Kerry Hughes. Kerry you&#039;ve kindly agreed to let me document</div><div id="00:00:19.520" class="transcript_line"> today something about your life as a student and a subsequent career both as a flinching</div><div id="00:00:24.960" class="transcript_line"> teacher and then as a worker in the research and education department of a global business.</div><div id="00:00:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Kerry let me start by asking you to tell us something of your early schooling and when you</div><div id="00:00:38.400" class="transcript_line"> might first have been aware that language, literature and learning were going to be the</div><div id="00:00:42.720" class="transcript_line"> focus of much of your life. I suppose that I was never aware of that. I mean one goes to school,</div><div id="00:00:48.480" class="transcript_line"> I went to an ordinary little church school in Connors Key. It was the one primary school that</div><div id="00:00:53.600" class="transcript_line"> Connors Key had. There was a little infant school and then you went to St Mark&#039;s school which was</div><div id="00:00:59.520" class="transcript_line"> a church school. The next other school was Shotton Primary and therefore the local children did not</div><div id="00:01:07.920" class="transcript_line"> walk or catch buses to Shotton Primary. Most of them went to St Mark&#039;s and left at 14.</div><div id="00:01:15.120" class="transcript_line"> The fellow who came to teach what might have been termed a scholarship class, except that there were</div><div id="00:01:21.040" class="transcript_line"> only four of us who were put in for the entrance examination for the grammar school in that year.</div><div id="00:01:26.800" class="transcript_line"> So it was four out of what 25 or 30. He detected we had ability and he was determined that he would</div><div id="00:01:37.840" class="transcript_line"> make every effort to get us through the exam. I mean I liked boarding school stories or something</div><div id="00:01:45.200" class="transcript_line"> of that sort and Alice in Wonderland and things like that I was given to read.</div><div id="00:01:51.920" class="transcript_line"> We were all taken to the Hippodrome to see David Copperfield, a film version of it, and we had to</div><div id="00:02:00.080" class="transcript_line"> write an essay on David Copperfield and I won the prize and I think it was</div><div id="00:02:08.720" class="transcript_line"> a shilling or two shillings or something like that. But obviously I had been very</div><div id="00:02:14.400" class="transcript_line"> struck by it. You then moved up to what was at the time known as Hardin County School.</div><div id="00:02:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you get there by an examination process? Was it called in those days the 11 plus?</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> No it was called a scholarship. You could go in for it at any age so that was why it wasn&#039;t called</div><div id="00:02:32.880" class="transcript_line"> the 11 plus. And Hardin County School was based on a four-year matriculation course.</div><div id="00:02:43.920" class="transcript_line"> O levels were later to be 11 plus entry and you did your O levels at 16. Now when I went to the</div><div id="00:02:53.920" class="transcript_line"> county school age 10 I was going obviously to do my matriculation course which was the equivalent</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> of O levels in four years and therefore I went into the sixth form at 14 because I had done that</div><div id="00:03:11.680" class="transcript_line"> in four years. This gave you an advantage. You had three years in the sixth form and you therefore</div><div id="00:03:19.520" class="transcript_line"> could sit scholarships for other places or you know improve on your results or something like</div><div id="00:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> that and still only be 17 when you went to university. While still a child going to a</div><div id="00:03:32.240" class="transcript_line"> school quite a long way from your home in Connors Quay did you have to travel there daily and how</div><div id="00:03:37.120" class="transcript_line"> did you do that? Oh yes of course we had a private bus. Richardson&#039;s Buckley provided the bus and we</div><div id="00:03:44.320" class="transcript_line"> got on it and came home on it. And was that part of the school experience? Yes. Did you feel when</div><div id="00:03:53.040" class="transcript_line"> you first went to Hardin County School that you were entering a place of excellence? Oh I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:58.960" class="transcript_line"> think you have any judgment as to what is a place of excellence at that time. I mean so long as I</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> got good marks I really wasn&#039;t very bothered. I think that you judge a place after you&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:04:14.400" class="transcript_line"> through it and you have the opportunity of judging it compared with other places. But was there any</div><div id="00:04:20.960" class="transcript_line"> particular awe that might have been engendered by your new surroundings something that might</div><div id="00:04:25.840" class="transcript_line"> have impressed you upon first entering? No because it was all the old buildings. It was not I mean</div><div id="00:04:37.680" class="transcript_line"> places that we found we we talked about later like the new corridor had only just come into</div><div id="00:04:42.960" class="transcript_line"> existence and the new hall was relatively new as well. Did your family have to make any sacrifice</div><div id="00:04:51.600" class="transcript_line"> to support your attendance at that school? No because I had I think a boss bursary when your</div><div id="00:05:00.720" class="transcript_line"> income when family income was looked at money was given for books or for travel or something like</div><div id="00:05:09.520" class="transcript_line"> that and in my case I had some grant towards the travel which as I record it was something</div><div id="00:05:15.040" class="transcript_line"> that throttled today anyway. Did you feel at the time that you had any sort of obligation to</div><div id="00:05:21.920" class="transcript_line"> succeed at school or were you self-motivated anyway? Neither I just did what I did my homework</div><div id="00:05:32.320" class="transcript_line"> and it generally got good marks and we had examinations at the end of pretty well every term</div><div id="00:05:40.720" class="transcript_line"> so you were able to keep track of where you were in the class. I had a cousin who had been top of</div><div id="00:05:50.640" class="transcript_line"> the county in the year that we passed for the county school. Her name was Meryl Bailey and</div><div id="00:06:00.240" class="transcript_line"> she could always beat me. If I became second in class Meryl was always first. Meryl sadly</div><div id="00:06:08.960" class="transcript_line"> died of peritonitis in our second year in the sixth form otherwise she would have gone on to</div><div id="00:06:15.520" class="transcript_line"> great things. Was the study of classics and in particular Latin the norm at schools like</div><div id="00:06:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Hardin County School? I should have thought so but I mean it was only available</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> to a certain number. As I recall it most people would encourage for example to do French</div><div id="00:06:39.840" class="transcript_line"> and the choice was French or Welsh. Only a small minority ever did Welsh and I think they felt</div><div id="00:06:45.680" class="transcript_line"> that one had to come from a Welsh background where Welsh would be spoken in the home. In the case of</div><div id="00:06:52.960" class="transcript_line"> the other three languages it was Latin, German, Spanish. You selected one of those. The Spanish</div><div id="00:07:03.200" class="transcript_line"> department was less strong and I suspect the Latin department was as well. The German department was</div><div id="00:07:12.720" class="transcript_line"> very strong indeed because George Lawson who was head of English was also head of German.</div><div id="00:07:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Did he give you a little verbal test on your expertise in Latin that was a deciding factor in</div><div id="00:07:30.400" class="transcript_line"> his letting you join a class? Oh no, no I had already joined the English class. I decided on my</div><div id="00:07:38.320" class="transcript_line"> subjects for higher school certificate and I was doing history, Latin, English and French but</div><div id="00:07:48.480" class="transcript_line"> he was rather appalled at the idea of 14 year olds going into the sixth form. He thought and</div><div id="00:07:57.520" class="transcript_line"> this I was one of the first to do this but it happened several years afterwards. I mean people</div><div id="00:08:03.200" class="transcript_line"> came into the sixth form the following year at exactly the same age and he thought we were too</div><div id="00:08:10.720" class="transcript_line"> immature. He was probably right but the incident you mentioned was he talked about</div><div id="00:08:22.880" class="transcript_line"> captive Greece taking captor Rome captive and he had a new dictionary of quotations. This was I</div><div id="00:08:31.920" class="transcript_line"> think the first Oxford dictionary of quotations or the first edition of it and he hadn&#039;t really</div><div id="00:08:39.600" class="transcript_line"> shown much interest in me. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d written any good essays or anything like that.</div><div id="00:08:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Anyway he said you know where is this from and everybody looked a bit blank and I recall that</div><div id="00:08:50.880" class="transcript_line"> actually it was part of our school certificate Latin course included some Horace and it was a</div><div id="00:09:00.880" class="transcript_line"> part part of a bit of Horace so I said this and thereafter he took more interest in me because</div><div id="00:09:07.760" class="transcript_line"> he realised that I had recalled that but I mean I thought that he in his own way was</div><div id="00:09:18.240" class="transcript_line"> the sort of teacher that made you curious. He could plant a little seed and you would follow it up</div><div id="00:09:28.640" class="transcript_line"> and that was his great talent. There were two prizes in the sixth form available</div><div id="00:09:37.280" class="transcript_line"> to people who did well at A level which were called higher school certificates then and</div><div id="00:09:48.320" class="transcript_line"> the Henry Neville Gladstone prize I rather think was available to boys for</div><div id="00:09:54.960" class="transcript_line"> two years out of three and it was available to girls one year out of three. Everybody who was</div><div id="00:10:02.880" class="transcript_line"> in the history class in the sixth form was expected to write an essay annually called the</div><div id="00:10:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Gladstone essay and this subject was chosen by our history teacher and it would be on some aspect of</div><div id="00:10:18.800" class="transcript_line"> of what Victorian history and we submitted our rather lengthy essays and she then</div><div id="00:10:29.840" class="transcript_line"> selected the one that was best for a prize and in my third year in the sixth form the prize was</div><div id="00:10:36.160" class="transcript_line"> shared with another pupil myself. Apart from that there was another prize for girls only the Helen</div><div id="00:10:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Gladstone prize. I did win the Helen Gladstone prize yes £10 and of course it was supposed to</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> provide books. Well we had had the war heaven&#039;s sake it was not yet over and who was going to</div><div id="00:10:59.440" class="transcript_line"> spend £10 on books when they were going to university so it bought a dress didn&#039;t it? Well</div><div id="00:11:05.360" class="transcript_line"> it bought several dresses. Miss Thomason who was our history teacher and head of history of course</div><div id="00:11:14.960" class="transcript_line"> arranged with the authorities at St Daniel&#039;s that those of us who were learning history or</div><div id="00:11:22.240" class="transcript_line"> taking history in the sixth form should have the privilege of going down to St Daniel&#039;s library</div><div id="00:11:28.960" class="transcript_line"> to consult books if we needed to but perhaps to do some homework or something of that sort</div><div id="00:11:36.960" class="transcript_line"> and it involved a double period that is to say lessons lasting two school lessons and usually</div><div id="00:11:45.440" class="transcript_line"> were the last two in an afternoon so in my case it was a Friday afternoon that I used to go down</div><div id="00:11:51.760" class="transcript_line"> there. One didn&#039;t go every week it depended what there was on. We were allowed to go into what was</div><div id="00:12:00.320" class="transcript_line"> a relatively new wing as I recall it it was a bit like a breeze block structure or something of that</div><div id="00:12:10.560" class="transcript_line"> sort an annex of the library I suppose one would have said and I don&#039;t recall finding very much</div><div id="00:12:19.040" class="transcript_line"> that was terribly useful to me but it certainly was quiet and well it afforded</div><div id="00:12:29.760" class="transcript_line"> a studious place to learn. I don&#039;t think that I recall ever having seen anybody else in this</div><div id="00:12:36.960" class="transcript_line"> particular area on a Friday afternoon. I think that the more used books were elsewhere. I knew</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> that it catered for people who were ordained usually. I knew that it was Gladstone&#039;s own</div><div id="00:12:54.480" class="transcript_line"> library that he had moved from the castle there. I think that everything else was pretty well</div><div id="00:13:03.600" class="transcript_line"> a mystery. I can remember Alec Vidler as warden and seeing him in Hardin in his</div><div id="00:13:11.920" class="transcript_line"> grey cloak and looking rather interesting and different but I think that it was a place of</div><div id="00:13:23.920" class="transcript_line"> studious refuge. I don&#039;t think that I mean for example I had grandparents who lived in</div><div id="00:13:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Hardin and an aunt and uncle Meryl&#039;s parents who lived in Hardin and I never heard them discuss it.</div><div id="00:13:36.240" class="transcript_line"> It was just the library. It was there. It had Gladstonean connections and that was that.</div><div id="00:13:44.560" class="transcript_line"> I am aware only vaguely of the way it has been opened up and I have enjoyed several lunches</div><div id="00:13:52.880" class="transcript_line"> there. I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s easy to see any other part of it apart from separate days when</div><div id="00:14:02.560" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t go and have a tour of the library just at the drop of a hat as I understand it.</div><div id="00:14:12.880" class="transcript_line"> I think that I probably favour some things more than other things that I have heard go on there.</div><div id="00:14:18.720" class="transcript_line"> As somebody sitting highers in history we had it drummed into us by our history teacher that if</div><div id="00:14:29.360" class="transcript_line"> we could quote from Gladstone&#039;s speeches this would adorn our history answers and one of the</div><div id="00:14:38.320" class="transcript_line"> quotations that I remember was that the Turk needed clearing bag and baggage out of Europe</div><div id="00:14:45.840" class="transcript_line"> because they had maltreated the Armenian refugees and it therefore strikes me as odd that now there</div><div id="00:14:54.160" class="transcript_line"> is going to be an Islamist room at the library. I can only imagine that WE is turning over in his</div><div id="00:15:01.040" class="transcript_line"> grave. Were you aware at the time of Helen Gladstone&#039;s relationship to Hardin County School?</div><div id="00:15:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Apart from the fact that she was a daughter of WE as far as I know that was all I knew.</div><div id="00:15:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Does that suggest that maybe the Gladstone legacy in those times was not being exploited in the way</div><div id="00:15:27.600" class="transcript_line"> that it is today?</div><div id="00:15:31.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether such things ought to be exploited. I think that if a family is good enough</div><div id="00:15:39.600" class="transcript_line"> to endow a school with prizes I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary to do any excessive publicity or something</div><div id="00:15:48.720" class="transcript_line"> of that sort. You get prizes given to schools by a variety of people. I know for example that</div><div id="00:15:57.840" class="transcript_line"> there was an Arthur Jones prize and a Florence Garland prize and these were in memory of two</div><div id="00:16:05.280" class="transcript_line"> members of staff who had unfortunately died during a summer holiday. And I gather that places like</div><div id="00:16:13.760" class="transcript_line"> I gather that places like Hollywood for example sometimes a member of staff can come along and</div><div id="00:16:20.880" class="transcript_line"> enjoy teaching there and leave something behind by way of an athletics prize or something like that.</div><div id="00:16:29.920" class="transcript_line"> When I went to university they were looking I was registering for the course and one of the senior</div><div id="00:16:37.520" class="transcript_line"> lecturers who anybody who studied Wordsworth will know his name was Earnshaw and he edited</div><div id="00:16:44.080" class="transcript_line"> the favourite edition of Wordsworth. He said oh good school when he saw where I came from.</div><div id="00:16:51.520" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t really ever plan to do a degree in English literature. Most courses at universities</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> are labelled English literature. Mine was not. I selected Aberystwyth because it was English</div><div id="00:17:07.680" class="transcript_line"> language and literature and apart at that time from one of the Oxford colleges it was the only</div><div id="00:17:15.680" class="transcript_line"> place that was actually teaching Icelandic, Old Norse and the language. So I spent at least half</div><div id="00:17:28.640" class="transcript_line"> of my time on studying language as distinct from literature. I went to France for the first time</div><div id="00:17:36.400" class="transcript_line"> in my graduation year which was 1948 because we those of us who had a good enough degree</div><div id="00:17:44.800" class="transcript_line"> well first class honours degree and a second class top degree were eligible for £37 travelling grant</div><div id="00:17:53.920" class="transcript_line"> and I got that travelling grant and I went to visit my French exchange, French correspondent</div><div id="00:18:01.520" class="transcript_line"> and her family had gone to the area of Normandy near Caen for the summer and I went to stay with</div><div id="00:18:11.360" class="transcript_line"> them and then Denise and I travelled to Paris because they had a flat in Naye, a very fashionable</div><div id="00:18:18.480" class="transcript_line"> suburb of Paris so that was my first trip abroad. Thereafter I suppose that they happened</div><div id="00:18:26.240" class="transcript_line"> pretty frequently, I mean on the whole once every year.</div><div id="00:18:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes I did and I afterwards went over I think some of this gear was</div><div id="00:18:44.960" class="transcript_line"> taken onto the continent, I don&#039;t know whether I&#039;m right, oh Brussels or somewhere like that and I</div><div id="00:18:49.360" class="transcript_line"> afterwards went to see it there. I don&#039;t think that it had the quality or the width of something</div><div id="00:19:01.360" class="transcript_line"> like the 1851 exhibition. I mean I know nothing about that first hand but I gather that the 1851</div><div id="00:19:09.440" class="transcript_line"> exhibition promoted Britain as an empire etc and was highly ranked among all the exhibitions</div><div id="00:19:18.400" class="transcript_line"> in the world whereas I thought that the 1951 exhibition didn&#039;t affect us locally and wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:19:25.920" class="transcript_line"> of any great interest. I get very annoyed when I hear people talk about life in the 50s being dreary</div><div id="00:19:36.720" class="transcript_line"> because I would have said that we were so thankful that the war was over that we found</div><div id="00:19:41.680" class="transcript_line"> nothing dreary about being able to go out or have clothes and things like that. I mean it so happened</div><div id="00:19:51.920" class="transcript_line"> that I went to the West Riding of Yorkshire for just two terms and then came home and discovered</div><div id="00:20:00.720" class="transcript_line"> that the job at Hardin was going and I had 11 and 8 pence in my bank account and my mother said</div><div id="00:20:08.080" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t it be sensible to apply for the job just to get some money. I mean teachers were very badly</div><div id="00:20:14.880" class="transcript_line"> paid and it was a means to an end except that I&#039;d always loved school and I knew that it would find</div><div id="00:20:24.400" class="transcript_line"> favour with the staff there who taught me because they&#039;d always been nice and kind to me etc</div><div id="00:20:31.680" class="transcript_line"> and I just recall well going out with friends, going to quaint ways to dances and things of that</div><div id="00:20:41.600" class="transcript_line"> sort. I mean one went to the local cinemas and trips to London and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:20:50.800" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a long career in teaching. I&#039;d been teaching 10 years so that&#039;s not a long career</div><div id="00:20:56.480" class="transcript_line"> in teaching really. I was determined to get out of teaching after I had done a fair amount of it and</div><div id="00:21:02.400" class="transcript_line"> I did get out of teaching. I mean as soon as firms were offering jobs and I decided when the</div><div id="00:21:10.800" class="transcript_line"> opportunity came that I would go into industry yes and I was looking around and I can truthfully say</div><div id="00:21:20.080" class="transcript_line"> there were very few opportunities. They were not keen, firms were not keen as they are now,</div><div id="00:21:27.200" class="transcript_line"> to accept a graduate whatever the discipline and say well all right we&#039;ll use your nouse.</div><div id="00:21:35.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean my niece who graduated with a degree in German in the what 70s was able to get a job with</div><div id="00:21:44.720" class="transcript_line"> ease comparatively not using her German. I went to work for Unilever on the site in Port Sunlight</div><div id="00:21:54.720" class="transcript_line"> there are there is Leaver Brothers obviously but there are about four other companies. Unilever</div><div id="00:22:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Research, Unilever Merseyside, Unilever Export, Unilever Limited and I went to research. I realised</div><div id="00:22:10.640" class="transcript_line"> swiftly that I really needed to learn some detergent chemistry to do this and I did so.</div><div id="00:22:22.320" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people fell by the wayside because they didn&#039;t want to do this. The particular job that</div><div id="00:22:29.360" class="transcript_line"> they had in mind when I went there and when I said I was interested in having a job there</div><div id="00:22:36.320" class="transcript_line"> was liaison with their education department in London which involved actually a bit of teaching</div><div id="00:22:44.480" class="transcript_line"> inasmuch as they then employed lots of girls who were personal advisors but they had to be given</div><div id="00:22:55.120" class="transcript_line"> correct information about fabrics and fibres and the various detergents that were then available</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and they held meetings up and down the country and gave demonstrations to people etc.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So I became part and parcel of all this. I for example delivered a lecture on stain removal</div><div id="00:23:24.240" class="transcript_line"> to the South of Scotland Electricity Board personnel which was a great change from Shakespeare</div><div id="00:23:30.400" class="transcript_line"> but it was very enjoyable just the same because everything was done with</div><div id="00:23:37.200" class="transcript_line"> taste and aplomb. Unilever is a very good company.</div><div id="00:23:42.880" class="transcript_line"> When the grammar schools closed I was in industry and I was not in any way so pro that I was fighting</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> for the cause or anything like that. Had I been on the staff of the school I no doubt would have</div><div id="00:23:58.960" class="transcript_line"> felt very different about it but I thought that it was being done for all the wrong reasons.</div><div id="00:24:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Anthony Crossland was the villain of the piece so far as I was concerned and Shirley Williams.</div><div id="00:24:11.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean I reflect on Shirley Williams and I think of the fact that she was one of the children</div><div id="00:24:17.200" class="transcript_line"> evacuated from this country during the war by her mother Vera Britton and therefore when</div><div id="00:24:24.160" class="transcript_line"> um she has made a great fuss of as indeed she is it seems to me by a lot of male chairman of panels</div><div id="00:24:34.160" class="transcript_line"> I think that she betrayed the cause though I am a great admirer of Margaret Thatcher.</div><div id="00:24:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m afraid she did the same and she now I gather regrets it and I am a rather dismayed that when</div><div id="00:24:51.280" class="transcript_line"> people beg the Tory party to be on the side of the grammar schools if they want to have a grammar</div><div id="00:24:59.840" class="transcript_line"> school in their neighborhood it is quite clear that David Cameron has said no. On reflection</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I do agree with pupils that I have met since who liked their grammar school experience to such an</div><div id="00:25:18.240" class="transcript_line"> extent that they were determined to bring their families to areas where grammar schools still</div><div id="00:25:24.480" class="transcript_line"> existed. I think that there is too little attention given in the comprehensive school</div><div id="00:25:32.320" class="transcript_line"> to the gifted child. We make all sorts of provisions for those with special needs.</div><div id="00:25:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Well as I see it being gifted is a special need and if there was greater evidence in the school</div><div id="00:25:50.240" class="transcript_line"> itself that gifted children were being given as much help as they could be given I would feel</div><div id="00:26:02.480" class="transcript_line"> more optimistic about the future. I would say that when I joined the comprehensive system</div><div id="00:26:10.640" class="transcript_line"> a lot of the staff were still grammar school staff. They had taught at Hollywood grammar school</div><div id="00:26:17.680" class="transcript_line"> which had a very good reputation and when I retired there were about</div><div id="00:26:26.160" class="transcript_line"> half a dozen men probably and four or five women who had been on the grammar school staff</div><div id="00:26:35.280" class="transcript_line"> or had themselves been taught at a grammar school. I am sure that the very fact that they have all</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> retired or left has affected the situation. I don&#039;t know how well or how badly. The ethos of the</div><div id="00:26:54.960" class="transcript_line"> grammar school was something that those of us who taught at the grammar school just almost</div><div id="00:27:03.680" class="transcript_line"> accidentally imposed. We weren&#039;t aware of the fact that we were doing it. It was just that we</div><div id="00:27:09.680" class="transcript_line"> treated children in a rather different way from the people who had been secondary modern. Well</div><div id="00:27:14.640" class="transcript_line"> it was very obvious in our treatment of the children that&#039;s all I can say. There&#039;s a very</div><div id="00:27:19.760" class="transcript_line"> fond relationship. It always speaks of you with great affection. Yes. Even with huge gaping.</div><div id="00:27:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes yes and I&#039;ve always had I&#039;m pleased to say that relationship with all pupils. I mean to say</div><div id="00:27:33.520" class="transcript_line"> you would have thought that at the comprehensive school I might not have found them so what shall</div><div id="00:27:40.720" class="transcript_line"> I say innately attractive to keep up a connection but that was not so. With the sixth forms it is a</div><div id="00:27:50.400" class="transcript_line"> different relationship that you have and I&#039;m pleased to say that with boys and girls I&#039;ve always had</div><div id="00:28:01.360" class="transcript_line"> well an ease of relationship that&#039;s all about it. I would say that I had very many bright pupils to</div><div id="00:28:09.520" class="transcript_line"> teach when I came to comprehensive education. The sixth form was virtually the same. It was full of</div><div id="00:28:16.400" class="transcript_line"> people who wanted to go to university or college and they were very equal to finding their way there.</div><div id="00:28:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Turning to recent concerns for the integrity of people in public life and the political systems</div><div id="00:28:36.720" class="transcript_line"> do you think present-day media is rising to the challenges traditionally that were the domain of</div><div id="00:28:41.840" class="transcript_line"> the fourth estate? I read the telegraph from cover to cover every day. I think that this</div><div id="00:28:51.040" class="transcript_line"> treatment of the expenses by the telegraph has been absolutely brilliant. I not only think that</div><div id="00:28:57.040" class="transcript_line"> it was very worthwhile doing but I don&#039;t know whether you saw the publication on Saturday</div><div id="00:29:02.160" class="transcript_line"> and I think that it has been beautifully done as a piece of what</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> well almost a picture post type thing. I think it is brilliant and all the people</div><div id="00:29:15.440" class="transcript_line"> responsible deserve congratulations. I like the spectator. I don&#039;t always buy it but at the moment</div><div id="00:29:25.120" class="transcript_line"> they have sent me five complimentary copies so I&#039;m pleased about that. I am a great listener to</div><div id="00:29:33.840" class="transcript_line"> radio and to various programs that I respect like Melvin Bragg in our time and things of that sort.</div><div id="00:29:47.280" class="transcript_line"> I do take the trouble to listen to the Westminster Hour on a Sunday night in order to perhaps have</div><div id="00:29:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Caroline Quentin or before her Andrew Raunsley give me some left-wing ideas so that I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:30:00.160" class="transcript_line"> become too right-wing. I watch Channel 4 news. I do not on the whole watch BBC News. I cannot say</div><div id="00:30:11.520" class="transcript_line"> that I approve of the presenters on Channel 4 but I think that on the whole they do a better job of</div><div id="00:30:20.080" class="transcript_line"> of handling prejudice and bias better than the BBC does. The Today program is a case in point.</div><div id="00:30:29.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean I know what Jim Nocty&#039;s politics are and therefore I think he should be taken off the job</div><div id="00:30:36.560" class="transcript_line"> as an election comes nearer. I go to the cinema fairly regularly and the theatre fairly regularly.</div><div id="00:30:44.160" class="transcript_line"> I loathe popular culture and that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:30:51.840" class="transcript_line"> What are the things in your life for which you might wish the people you taught would remember you by?</div><div id="00:31:01.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know John. I think that introducing them to certain books. When I went to this particular</div><div id="00:31:12.400" class="transcript_line"> reunion I had people whose names I didn&#039;t remember coming up to me and saying oh I shall never</div><div id="00:31:20.400" class="transcript_line"> forget your lessons on Northanger Abbey and when I lost my daughter and this was a very</div><div id="00:31:27.360" class="transcript_line"> sad moment I found comfort in literature and all that you had taught us and you realised then that</div><div id="00:31:37.520" class="transcript_line"> just as I would claim that George Lawson was my mentor so to a degree I had been theirs.</div><div id="00:31:46.320" class="transcript_line"> That is a great responsibility that one doesn&#039;t imagine one has but I&#039;m the most unambitious</div><div id="00:31:53.040" class="transcript_line"> creature you have ever encountered. I have never longed for a car or a house or for that matter a</div><div id="00:31:59.600" class="transcript_line"> husband. I have always just been content with the moment.</div><div id="00:32:08.080" class="transcript_line"> Kerry Hughes thank you for our conversation today. Thank you John.</div></div></p>
