    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Jill Willie, it&#039;s the first of August, and I&#039;m speaking with Des Lloyd at his home</div><div id="00:00:07.920" class="transcript_line"> in Llanier. Right, Des, let&#039;s get started now. Let&#039;s talk about your early days in the</div><div id="00:00:16.240" class="transcript_line"> longhouse called Roundfield, I believe. Can you take us through the house, what it was</div><div id="00:00:20.640" class="transcript_line"> like if we walked through the front door?</div><div id="00:00:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can do. I was born there November 1943. They say if I&#039;d have been a little bit later,</div><div id="00:00:31.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have been called Guy, so that&#039;s giving a clue to my date of birth. Yeah, there were mom and dad,</div><div id="00:00:36.800" class="transcript_line"> obviously, and three of us. I was the middle one, the only boy, and I had a younger sister</div><div id="00:00:42.400" class="transcript_line"> and an older sister. Now, in those days, it was, how can I put it, there&#039;s so many different types</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> of Welsh longhouse. The cows were under the same roof. We both had a front door. There was only one</div><div id="00:00:57.680" class="transcript_line"> door for us and one door for the cows. Now, we lived in the one end. There were four rooms,</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> two downstairs and two upstairs, and then there was a solid wall in the middle so the cows couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:09.120" class="transcript_line"> get at us, even though we could hear them at night. And they came in through their own door,</div><div id="00:01:15.680" class="transcript_line"> and there was tie-ins, as we say in Wales, for three cows in there. Now, above the cows</div><div id="00:01:23.200" class="transcript_line"> was what we called the tollant, where we stored hay for the winter. Now, this tollant, it wasn&#039;t a</div><div id="00:01:30.400" class="transcript_line"> very secure thing because there were sort of loose poles fixed in the wall, no boards or anything</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> like that. And on top of that, you put sort of loose hedging wood. It was old sticks or anything</div><div id="00:01:44.560" class="transcript_line"> like that. So when you were actually putting hay in there, you had to be very careful,</div><div id="00:01:50.480" class="transcript_line"> because otherwise you&#039;d be down, if the cows were in there, you&#039;d be on their back in no time and</div><div id="00:01:54.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d be in trouble. You&#039;d be kicked. Anyway, the house, well, it was the front door for a time.</div><div id="00:02:02.880" class="transcript_line"> As I remember, when the wind used to blow from the east, it came all the way from Radnor Forest.</div><div id="00:02:09.760" class="transcript_line"> So there was a very useful implement employed at the bottom of the door, a feed sack,</div><div id="00:02:16.560" class="transcript_line"> stopped the wind coming in. But when the wind was strong, it used to blow it from the door.</div><div id="00:02:21.840" class="transcript_line"> We were absolutely freezing in there. There was the cooking equipment, was a black, what we call a</div><div id="00:02:28.480" class="transcript_line"> black-red grate. They did have an old boiler in the thing, but I think that was removed before</div><div id="00:02:36.480" class="transcript_line"> mum and dad came there. Incidentally, they came there in 1938 when they got married.</div><div id="00:02:41.760" class="transcript_line"> So mother used to do all her cooking on this open fire. She was a hook above it and she&#039;d have a big</div><div id="00:02:48.560" class="transcript_line"> pot going on that. And there was an oven by the side of it, but you had to get a lot of fire going</div><div id="00:02:53.600" class="transcript_line"> to keep the oven going. So the oven was only used on a Sunday or when she was baking.</div><div id="00:02:59.440" class="transcript_line"> We managed. We had plenty of food because we obviously kept chickens, ducks and geese for</div><div id="00:03:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Christmas. And we had our own milk, mother made butter, never made cheese. And we almost had a</div><div id="00:03:17.680" class="transcript_line"> veg garden. And I shall say more about that later. We planted potatoes at a neighbouring farm in</div><div id="00:03:25.920" class="transcript_line"> exchange for doing work at any time when he wanted it sort of thing, which was one of the</div><div id="00:03:31.680" class="transcript_line"> things people did in those days. You were planting potatoes on a farm and then in the harvesting</div><div id="00:03:37.600" class="transcript_line"> weather you were, you paid back that way. But going back to the Welsh Longhouse, at the end,</div><div id="00:03:45.360" class="transcript_line"> we had the cows at the one end and joining that attached to it was the pigsty or pigs cot, as we</div><div id="00:03:52.720" class="transcript_line"> call it in Wales. And it was a pig at his little house. It was a slated roof, that was a pitched</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> roof. There&#039;s a pig, he&#039;s a very clean animal. He never soils in his own bed. He ought to come out.</div><div id="00:04:05.840" class="transcript_line"> He has his own little yard to do that in. And there was a wall around that. But above that,</div><div id="00:04:11.120" class="transcript_line"> there was a hole in the end of the house, obviously to get the hay in. And that was the only way we</div><div id="00:04:16.240" class="transcript_line"> could get the hay in. It was called the pitching hole. Anyway, when it came to harvesting time,</div><div id="00:04:21.520" class="transcript_line"> the only way we could do it, we used to take the door off the pig&#039;s house. The pig was banished to</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> his living quarters and told us to stay there. And then we put it across the walls. Then the</div><div id="00:04:32.240" class="transcript_line"> horse and cart, which we used then, was brought up alongside. And the man on the cart put it onto the</div><div id="00:04:39.360" class="transcript_line"> door. There was another man on the door who then lifted it through the hatch. And then there was</div><div id="00:04:44.800" class="transcript_line"> another man inside who had the most risky job, no health and safety then. And he sorted it out</div><div id="00:04:52.640" class="transcript_line"> inside. It worked very, very well. We never had any problems. Never any problems.</div><div id="00:05:00.480" class="transcript_line"> Going back to harvesting, they never had,</div><div id="00:05:06.720" class="transcript_line"> we never had any implements of our own until much, much later. So the farmer below us was an</div><div id="00:05:21.040" class="transcript_line"> excellent neighbor. And we obviously, Dad worked for him and I worked for him when I was older.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We always used to borrow his horse and cart. And he&#039;d actually come and cut the hay for us with his</div><div id="00:05:32.640" class="transcript_line"> with his mowing machine. And it was pulled by two horses. They&#039;d cut the hay. Then it actually</div><div id="00:05:39.440" class="transcript_line"> turned the hay with the horses. And we&#039;d haul it with what we call in Wales, the gambo, which was</div><div id="00:05:45.760" class="transcript_line"> like a cart with four sticks at the end and then runners in the middle and big wheels and cart</div><div id="00:05:52.560" class="transcript_line"> horses. They weren&#039;t big cart horses. They were sort of a, they depended on speed really. They were</div><div id="00:05:59.440" class="transcript_line"> a cross between a Welsh Cob, I would think, and a big Shire. But they were, I can remember one in</div><div id="00:06:06.880" class="transcript_line"> particular, she was called Topsy. Now she was one of the most contrary women I&#039;ve ever met.</div><div id="00:06:14.400" class="transcript_line"> She wouldn&#039;t do anything she was told. When we came to, if there was a large implement,</div><div id="00:06:19.600" class="transcript_line"> like what we use a horse rake in those days to get through a gate, and it was probably about</div><div id="00:06:25.120" class="transcript_line"> one inch each side, we knew damn well that she would not go through it without taking a run at</div><div id="00:06:32.400" class="transcript_line"> it. So we used to have to stop and reverse her through as otherwise there&#039;d be no wheel left on</div><div id="00:06:37.440" class="transcript_line"> the rake. And another one of her traits was when we were unloading the hay, like say putting it</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> in on the door and then going up into the thing. And after that, when we had a three bay Dutch bar,</div><div id="00:06:52.480" class="transcript_line"> she used to be tied to the hedge while we were unloading. But she had her own agenda. And when</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> she heard the pike, which we were shifting the hay off with, hit the bottom of the cart,</div><div id="00:07:05.200" class="transcript_line"> she decided to reverse out on her own. So whoever was on the cart, if they weren&#039;t aware of what</div><div id="00:07:12.080" class="transcript_line"> was happening, they were on their back underneath. She had many, I shouldn&#039;t say it, a slap on the</div><div id="00:07:18.240" class="transcript_line"> backside for that, but she was a lovely old pony in her way, but she was a contrary lady,</div><div id="00:07:26.480" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no doubt about that. Well, I think those animals could really write a book on their own,</div><div id="00:07:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Des, and I&#039;m sure you could as well. Well, that was an absolutely fascinating insight into</div><div id="00:07:38.560" class="transcript_line"> farming and the methods and the places of probably almost a bygone era, which we&#039;ll be.</div><div id="00:07:44.480" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s get back to you now and your early life. You lived in Llanier, but you didn&#039;t go to school</div><div id="00:07:49.440" class="transcript_line"> in Llanier. I understand there wasn&#039;t a school there. So what about your schooling? Where did</div><div id="00:07:54.880" class="transcript_line"> you go? How did you get there? The schooling? I went to the Oxford Road Primary School in</div><div id="00:08:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Llandrind at Wells. Now, I didn&#039;t, I think I started school when I was about six. And I can</div><div id="00:08:08.400" class="transcript_line"> remember my mum taking me first of all, and I wasn&#039;t very pleased with it. I wasn&#039;t very pleased</div><div id="00:08:12.960" class="transcript_line"> at all, but I soon got the hang of it. And then we used to have to walk. Mum used to come and</div><div id="00:08:18.960" class="transcript_line"> collect me, because only the elder children went on the bus. So we had to walk, but I soon got fed</div><div id="00:08:26.800" class="transcript_line"> up with that. And father purchased a bicycle for me for the sum of five pounds. And we&#039;re gentlemen</div><div id="00:08:33.200" class="transcript_line"> who since passed away a long time ago in Howey, but there we are. But unfortunately, it was too</div><div id="00:08:39.360" class="transcript_line"> big for me to reach the saddle. So the saddle was removed. A sack was tied around the frame. So I</div><div id="00:08:46.960" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t injure myself. We&#039;ll leave that to people&#039;s imagination. And I used to ride the bike to</div><div id="00:08:53.280" class="transcript_line"> school. And I soon got very used to this cycle. And at the time there was what we called the garage</div><div id="00:08:59.280" class="transcript_line"> corner. They used to have petrol pumps there. And there was a haulage business operating from</div><div id="00:09:04.320" class="transcript_line"> there. Now this corner is a right angle. So I could get as much speed as I could coming down</div><div id="00:09:08.880" class="transcript_line"> through the village. And then the object of the exercise showing off, of course, was to ground</div><div id="00:09:14.560" class="transcript_line"> the pedals on the road. And I had some impossible angles. Anyway, that was that. And I can remember,</div><div id="00:09:24.880" class="transcript_line"> well, there were two of us actually then. There was a lad I&#039;ve been friends with for all of my life.</div><div id="00:09:29.920" class="transcript_line"> And we were told off for overtaking the school bus going down the Cwm pitches. By the bus driver,</div><div id="00:09:37.440" class="transcript_line"> Jim, I can remember him well. He wasn&#039;t the fastest in the world. He&#039;d probably been faster</div><div id="00:09:44.240" class="transcript_line"> in reverse. But I can remember we overtook him going down the pitches. And then we were called</div><div id="00:09:49.040" class="transcript_line"> in to see the headmaster. And he said, we shouldn&#039;t do that, which was against the road regulations</div><div id="00:09:53.600" class="transcript_line"> or what have you. Anyway, going back to primary school. Primary school, yeah, I enjoyed that</div><div id="00:10:01.040" class="transcript_line"> up to a point. And then I passed the GCSE, whatever, no, the 11 plus in those days,</div><div id="00:10:11.040" class="transcript_line"> and went to the grammar school. And the grammar school then was up Wellington Road. It was the</div><div id="00:10:16.960" class="transcript_line"> grammar and the modern, as we called it then, together. Then after a couple of years,</div><div id="00:10:24.640" class="transcript_line"> that they built a new school, which is the present school. So I believe, and we moved down there and</div><div id="00:10:32.400" class="transcript_line"> the modern school, as they say, it stayed up there. Well, it sounds as though you and your friends</div><div id="00:10:42.480" class="transcript_line"> on those bicycles were really a force to be reckoned with. Yes. Well, let&#039;s get away from</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> education now. Let&#039;s get on to your working life. Would you like to tell us a little bit about that?</div><div id="00:10:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I joined the post office as a counter clerk in 1961. Now I was appointed, in those days,</div><div id="00:11:06.560" class="transcript_line"> it was a good job. Probably is now, I don&#039;t know. Anyway, I was appointed for Bills Wells.</div><div id="00:11:13.120" class="transcript_line"> My first experience was on the counter in Bills Wells. I wasn&#039;t there long in Bills because there</div><div id="00:11:18.320" class="transcript_line"> was a lad who was working in Llandrind and Wells, and he lived in Bills Wells. He wanted a direct</div><div id="00:11:25.520" class="transcript_line"> transfer back, so it suited me grand. So I was transferred to Llandrind and Wells. Now one thing</div><div id="00:11:31.280" class="transcript_line"> I remember, I was a very shy lad, believe it or not, when I started in the post office. I&#039;d never</div><div id="00:11:38.720" class="transcript_line"> used the telephone in my life. I know people will find it hard to believe today with all this</div><div id="00:11:43.920" class="transcript_line"> modern technology. So one of the lads who was working with me or training me used to go into</div><div id="00:11:50.240" class="transcript_line"> the sorting office where the mail was, and he used to make phone calls and make me answer them</div><div id="00:11:54.160" class="transcript_line"> in the things so I get used to using the phone. I soon got the hang of it. I must admit I can spend</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> a lot of time on the telephone now. But one thing I&#039;ve got to say, and if anybody&#039;s listened to this</div><div id="00:12:04.640" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s in the radio area, I&#039;ve got to give a great compliment to my old friend Harvey Pugh.</div><div id="00:12:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Harvey trained me in Llandrind and Wells, and he was very, very good to me. We remained friends</div><div id="00:12:18.400" class="transcript_line"> for practically the end of his life. I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t know he&#039;d passed away until a few years</div><div id="00:12:26.400" class="transcript_line"> after. But there we are. But Harvey was very, very good to me. He trained me well.</div><div id="00:12:31.600" class="transcript_line"> One thing I remember, it was in the September of 61, and the International Six Days Motorcycle</div><div id="00:12:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Trials was based in Llandrind and Wells. So I had a quick baptism of all different languages,</div><div id="00:12:47.360" class="transcript_line"> people asking for this, people asking for that. But it was very, very interesting.</div><div id="00:12:54.240" class="transcript_line"> I really loved it because I obviously loved bicycles and motorcycles, and I&#039;ve still got</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> a great collection of badges and memorabilia that the teams gave me when they were coming</div><div id="00:13:07.040" class="transcript_line"> into the counter. I can remember that very well. I stayed on the counter, and then in those days,</div><div id="00:13:16.560" class="transcript_line"> it was a head post office in Llandrind and Wells. We had the writing room where different tasks</div><div id="00:13:22.160" class="transcript_line"> were undertaken. There was a staff branch, or what they called, and then there was the wages</div><div id="00:13:28.320" class="transcript_line"> and the accounts and all that. I worked my way through that. Eventually I got promotion,</div><div id="00:13:33.920" class="transcript_line"> and I ended up as the staff, well, executive officer they called us, but now I believe they</div><div id="00:13:41.680" class="transcript_line"> call them HDs or whatever. By that time, we&#039;d actually taken over Brecon area and Newtown area.</div><div id="00:13:50.400" class="transcript_line"> So the whole of my patch was Powys. It was from the Storey Arms, almost to Lake Burnway.</div><div id="00:13:56.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think there were about 200 staff altogether, varying from sub postmasters to postmen to</div><div id="00:14:03.600" class="transcript_line"> auxiliary postmen, county clerks, the whole works. And I really, really loved the job. You could go</div><div id="00:14:09.920" class="transcript_line"> out in the car in those days, and of course there were no mobile phones. Nobody could get hold of</div><div id="00:14:14.400" class="transcript_line"> you. You were your own boss. And one thing about it I&#039;ve got to say is the sub postmasters, they</div><div id="00:14:22.400" class="transcript_line"> were a breed apart. Without exception, they were excellent. And the first thing, no matter what you</div><div id="00:14:28.080" class="transcript_line"> went to do in an office, you had to have either breakfast, tea, dinner or supper or whatever.</div><div id="00:14:34.160" class="transcript_line"> That was essential. No matter what, you had to have that. And I&#039;ve always got on, well, I think,</div><div id="00:14:42.400" class="transcript_line"> got on well with people. I like talking to people, and I thoroughly enjoyed that element of the job.</div><div id="00:14:51.520" class="transcript_line"> At the end, I married a colleague, and then the post office was changing. It wasn&#039;t a service</div><div id="00:15:02.720" class="transcript_line"> industry as such. The way I saw it, and many others as well, it was to make money, and that was it.</div><div id="00:15:09.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was a certain element of service, but it was certainly getting less and less.</div><div id="00:15:14.880" class="transcript_line"> And when the chance came to take redundancy, because Landrind and Wells was what we say then</div><div id="00:15:22.080" class="transcript_line"> regraded as a post office, I took redundancy with my wife, and we left. And that started another</div><div id="00:15:32.800" class="transcript_line"> chapter in my life. Before we go on to that other chapter, can I say you&#039;ve obviously met a lot of</div><div id="00:15:40.960" class="transcript_line"> people, had a lot of experiences, and you&#039;re obviously a very quick learner. You could write</div><div id="00:15:45.840" class="transcript_line"> another book on that in itself, I&#039;m sure. Can you talk about any interesting people, any unusual</div><div id="00:15:53.440" class="transcript_line"> people who used to deal with you professionally or perhaps just came in to buy stamps?</div><div id="00:15:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, I can. There were thousands. Winford Vaughan Thomas used to come in.</div><div id="00:16:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Winford Vaughan Thomas is probably well known. He used to come in on a Wednesday.</div><div id="00:16:09.440" class="transcript_line"> He was a chap with me. They were both in the Second World War, and I used to listen as a youngster to</div><div id="00:16:19.520" class="transcript_line"> the conversations, and it was wonderful to hear. But there were characters, numerous characters.</div><div id="00:16:26.720" class="transcript_line"> And there was a chap in Landrind and Wells. He used to come in. He was a betting man,</div><div id="00:16:33.440" class="transcript_line"> and he used to do his polls and that. He had a little dog with him. I can remember one Saturday,</div><div id="00:16:40.640" class="transcript_line"> the postman, what we had then was what we called the front office box. It was a letter box. You</div><div id="00:16:45.840" class="transcript_line"> put the letters in from outside, or you could put them in from inside. And it was always taken out.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a sack and emptied and taken through to be sorted. Anyway, the chap came out from the sorting</div><div id="00:16:56.320" class="transcript_line"> office, and he could see the little dog wandering around, and the gentleman was up at the counter</div><div id="00:17:00.880" class="transcript_line"> buying his postal orders, whatever you did in those days. And he took the little dog,</div><div id="00:17:05.120" class="transcript_line"> and he put the dog in the box, and he shut the door, and the dog was in the letter box.</div><div id="00:17:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, all hell broke loose then. Everybody was looking for the dog. You could hear the dog barking.</div><div id="00:17:17.760" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t find him. The chap was running in and out of the office. People were looking everywhere</div><div id="00:17:22.320" class="transcript_line"> for this dog. Eventually, somebody twigged that he was in the box, and the dog had to be retrieved.</div><div id="00:17:28.720" class="transcript_line"> That was a great one. And there was another one. We used to then close at half past six,</div><div id="00:17:35.600" class="transcript_line"> but then it was brought down to six o&#039;clock. And there was a business</div><div id="00:17:39.840" class="transcript_line"> not too far away from the office in Llandrind and Wells. And we used to have to balance to the penny</div><div id="00:17:46.240" class="transcript_line"> every day then. And of course, when it came to half past five, things like that, we started writing</div><div id="00:17:51.760" class="transcript_line"> things down. And so we&#039;d only have to just do a little bit, and we&#039;d be balanced in 10 minutes.</div><div id="00:17:57.520" class="transcript_line"> And there was a chap, and he used to wait to the last minute. He&#039;d wait till the last minute,</div><div id="00:18:03.360" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d run down the street, and he&#039;d come in, and he&#039;d run all sorts of things like insurance</div><div id="00:18:07.600" class="transcript_line"> stamps and stamps. So if you&#039;d written them down, I think he just did it for devilment.</div><div id="00:18:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, one day he was caught out. The gentleman who was the cleaner, he was in charge of shutting</div><div id="00:18:19.440" class="transcript_line"> the door, and the chap must have got his timing a little bit wrong. And I can see him now, and the</div><div id="00:18:26.080" class="transcript_line"> cleaner was at the door with a bolt in his hand, ready to put the bolt in, and he was running down</div><div id="00:18:30.400" class="transcript_line"> the street shouting, please don&#039;t shut the door, please don&#039;t shut the door. But he shut the door.</div><div id="00:18:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Say no more. Oh, there were numerous people, and lovely people. Yes, we used to have a few.</div><div id="00:18:47.600" class="transcript_line"> We would have a bit of a, perhaps a stern conversation, shall I put it with. But</div><div id="00:18:52.400" class="transcript_line"> the majority of people that came in then, they were old school, and we never had any problems</div><div id="00:18:57.280" class="transcript_line"> whatsoever. If you were good with them, they were good with you. But that&#039;s the way it should be.</div><div id="00:19:03.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, those are some of the many people who&#039;ve touched your professional life, and</div><div id="00:19:08.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve got lots of very fond memories of your life in the post office.</div><div id="00:19:21.920" class="transcript_line"> Was there a noise or something? No, it was the postman. Oh, I see. He&#039;s found the bloody dog.</div><div id="00:19:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Right, let&#039;s continue now, Des, with the new venture that you and your wife went into.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was something to do with cars, wasn&#039;t it? Obviously, a very much of a passion for you.</div><div id="00:19:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was not cars. It was the Mini, the proper Mini, as we say, not the BMW so-called Mini as</div><div id="00:19:54.960" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got today. It was the Mini that was first produced in 1959. I&#039;d always had a great interest</div><div id="00:20:01.600" class="transcript_line"> in cars, and I had a Mini. It was a Mini Cooper, and I always enjoyed fiddling with them, even</div><div id="00:20:10.160" class="transcript_line"> though I wasn&#039;t a trained mechanic. I&#039;d worked with a lot of very, very good mechanics who taught</div><div id="00:20:16.320" class="transcript_line"> me an awful lot of things. When we left the post office in 1985, we decided to start our own little</div><div id="00:20:24.640" class="transcript_line"> business. Why not Minis? That was my wife and myself, and we were called the Mini Man and the</div><div id="00:20:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Mini Woman by many. The majority of our business were for youngsters. In those days, they couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:20:38.720" class="transcript_line"> borrow money from the banks. The banks weren&#039;t lending, so whatever savings they had or whatever</div><div id="00:20:43.360" class="transcript_line"> their mum and dad would give them, they used to come to us. Mostly, they were their mum and dad.</div><div id="00:20:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps they hadn&#039;t even passed their test. They used to say, have you got a Mini, or can you</div><div id="00:20:53.200" class="transcript_line"> build a Mini for us? We used to find an old one and do whatever needed doing to it.</div><div id="00:20:58.960" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d have the Mini. It was a very personal business. As I say, even though my wife and</div><div id="00:21:06.480" class="transcript_line"> myself never had any children, our family was very, very large. Characters, well,</div><div id="00:21:14.240" class="transcript_line"> they were all mad. They were very, very quiet when they came here. They were driving perfectly.</div><div id="00:21:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Many of the time, a policeman has said to me, Dez, I saw one of your Minis going through Middleton</div><div id="00:21:31.200" class="transcript_line"> Street in Llandrindard Wells. It was doing much more than 30 miles an hour. I used to say,</div><div id="00:21:35.680" class="transcript_line"> well, that was sold four years ago. I can&#039;t drive every Mini. But that&#039;s it. I can remember one</div><div id="00:21:43.360" class="transcript_line"> tale in particular. It was a young lady. She was taught by her dad then how to check the oil.</div><div id="00:21:50.720" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, she was checking the oil when the car was on the uphill. She rang me one day and</div><div id="00:21:57.360" class="transcript_line"> she said, when I start my car, I can&#039;t see anywhere for smoke. Anyway, she brought the car here.</div><div id="00:22:03.680" class="transcript_line"> To cut a long story short, there should have been eight pints of oil in it. I think it was as much</div><div id="00:22:08.880" class="transcript_line"> as you could get in it. When she revved it up, the property across the field just disappeared in</div><div id="00:22:14.240" class="transcript_line"> smoke. I said, the next time you check the oil, make sure it&#039;s on the level. At least there was</div><div id="00:22:19.600" class="transcript_line"> plenty in it. We had a few here that when they took the dipstick out, there wasn&#039;t any oil in it at</div><div id="00:22:25.760" class="transcript_line"> all. Thankfully, even though some of the lads and the lasses had some horrendous crashes,</div><div id="00:22:33.040" class="transcript_line"> no one was hurt. That was the main thing. We did that for 15 years. But then, of course,</div><div id="00:22:41.520" class="transcript_line"> the banks were lending money willy-nilly, as they say, excuse the expression, Joe.</div><div id="00:22:50.240" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t want to beat up all Mini then. Most of them, they wanted a GTI or whatever</div><div id="00:22:54.320" class="transcript_line"> was the going thing at the time. So our customers dwindled and we didn&#039;t want to go into anything</div><div id="00:23:01.360" class="transcript_line"> else. So we decided to call it a day. There was no point in working for the tax man.</div><div id="00:23:06.720" class="transcript_line"> We retired gracefully. What an interesting chapter of your life. I&#039;m sure you touched</div><div id="00:23:12.880" class="transcript_line"> the lives of a lot of people and made a lot of friends and helped and influenced a lot of people</div><div id="00:23:19.360" class="transcript_line"> as well. Now, you say you weren&#039;t much of a mechanic. Well, I&#039;m sure you were, but you were</div><div id="00:23:26.160" class="transcript_line"> a rallying person too, weren&#039;t you? Can you tell us a little bit about your rallying experiences</div><div id="00:23:31.600" class="transcript_line"> over the years? Yes, well, rallying. Well, my old friend, he&#039;s still going. He&#039;s struggling a bit at</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> the moment. He used to live on the next farm to me and he was very, very keen on cars. We grew up,</div><div id="00:23:48.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known him since he was six. I think he was always like me, a bit of mad as a box of frogs,</div><div id="00:23:53.760" class="transcript_line"> but there we are. Anyway, I can remember he had a Mini and he decided he was going to go racing.</div><div id="00:24:02.640" class="transcript_line"> The first meeting we both went, I went with him. It was at Landau down on the old airfield</div><div id="00:24:10.480" class="transcript_line"> at Cowbridge. I&#039;d never been, I&#039;m not ashamed to admit it, I&#039;d never been far. So I had the</div><div id="00:24:16.720" class="transcript_line"> Batholomew Road Atlas navigating and my best glasses and we set off. Well, I think we should</div><div id="00:24:23.120" class="transcript_line"> have got there in about an hour and a half. It took us three by the time we negotiated everywhere.</div><div id="00:24:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, he enjoyed the meeting and after that he did circuit racing with Minis and we used to go</div><div id="00:24:35.120" class="transcript_line"> to Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Castle Combe, all those places. And then he decided he was going</div><div id="00:24:40.560" class="transcript_line"> rallying. He got the rallying bug. And so I did a lot with him on the rallying, but going back to</div><div id="00:24:48.320" class="transcript_line"> myself, I did quite a few road rallies and also as well organized rallies. And what we used to do as</div><div id="00:24:58.320" class="transcript_line"> well, a gang of lads, we always used to hire a mini bus or a couple of vans and we&#039;d go to rallies</div><div id="00:25:03.760" class="transcript_line"> in Scotland, the Isle of Man and places like that. We really used to enjoy ourselves and we made an</div><div id="00:25:10.240" class="transcript_line"> awful lot of friends and I&#039;m still enjoying rallying now. I still go out even though I&#039;m</div><div id="00:25:17.600" class="transcript_line"> getting on a bit. I don&#039;t compete. I haven&#039;t competed for years, but I still know many of</div><div id="00:25:22.880" class="transcript_line"> the people and I still enjoy watching rallies with my old friend. There&#039;s only two of us left. There</div><div id="00:25:28.400" class="transcript_line"> used to be three of us. They used to call us the last of the summer wine, but unfortunately we lost</div><div id="00:25:33.440" class="transcript_line"> one last year to a heart attack. So that&#039;s life. So you just enjoy every day as you can.</div><div id="00:25:40.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, you can. It&#039;s obviously a very important part of your life, even though perhaps you&#039;re in</div><div id="00:25:44.960" class="transcript_line"> more of a spectator or specter, sedentary role at the moment, but I mean, you&#039;re still seeing</div><div id="00:25:52.080" class="transcript_line"> so many people who are enjoying it as much as you used to. Oh yes, I&#039;m sorry to interrupt,</div><div id="00:25:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Jill, but yes, but rallying&#039;s changed now from a spectator point of view.</div><div id="00:26:03.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, you would call it probably now an anti-social sport and you&#039;re not allowed to go and watch where</div><div id="00:26:11.440" class="transcript_line"> you want to go. They&#039;ve got designated areas for spectators and old people like me. I shouldn&#039;t say</div><div id="00:26:18.480" class="transcript_line"> that word. I know it&#039;s just a number, but we&#039;ve always done and we will think we&#039;ve got an element</div><div id="00:26:24.800" class="transcript_line"> of common sense. We always stood far enough back from the, and having done it yourself, you know,</div><div id="00:26:30.400" class="transcript_line"> what to do. But it&#039;s the way it&#039;s going and it has to be controlled. They have so many controls.</div><div id="00:26:36.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like health and safety. You don&#039;t do anything. It&#039;s got to be authorized for this,</div><div id="00:26:41.920" class="transcript_line"> authorized for that. And personally, I can see the writing on the wall and a lot of the rallying in</div><div id="00:26:47.760" class="transcript_line"> this country will cease, which is unfortunate because some of the rallies, they&#039;re quite big.</div><div id="00:26:53.360" class="transcript_line"> They bring an awful lot of money into the area, accommodation and federal and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:26:58.880" class="transcript_line"> But what will happen is it&#039;ll vanish from this country and it will flourish in Ireland,</div><div id="00:27:05.280" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no southern Ireland, and also on the continent where there&#039;s not so many rules and</div><div id="00:27:09.600" class="transcript_line"> regulations. But that&#039;s my own personal view and I don&#039;t think I&#039;m alone in saying that.</div><div id="00:27:15.840" class="transcript_line"> I suppose everything changes, doesn&#039;t it? Not always for the better. Des, it&#039;s been wonderful</div><div id="00:27:22.720" class="transcript_line"> sharing your experiences. We could talk all day, couldn&#039;t we? Before we finish off,</div><div id="00:27:28.800" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re obviously a Radnish person through and through. Now, Radnish has their own dialect,</div><div id="00:27:35.280" class="transcript_line"> perhaps we could call it a language even. Now you&#039;ve got quite a few up your sleeve. Can we</div><div id="00:27:40.240" class="transcript_line"> have some real Radnish expressions before we finish up? Well, Radnish expressions and</div><div id="00:27:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Radnish language, I&#039;ll just say before I&#039;ve only got a couple because they just come in normal</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> conversation to me. There was a gentleman that taught me English in the grammar school in</div><div id="00:27:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Andoran and Wells, Mr. Peter. He was a wonderful gentleman and at that time there was a market in</div><div id="00:28:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Llanbad and Vannad and he used to go to Llanbad and Vannad and he used to sit there and listen to the</div><div id="00:28:13.120" class="transcript_line"> farmers talking and he used to say that he could hear many, many traces of the old Queen&#039;s English.</div><div id="00:28:18.880" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, that&#039;s as an aside. Now there&#039;s one, there&#039;s a couple here. Now this was one of my,</div><div id="00:28:23.520" class="transcript_line"> my dad always used to say this. If there was a problem or anything he used to say,</div><div id="00:28:28.160" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t worry, it all brings night. And there&#039;s another one about somebody who was a bit mean.</div><div id="00:28:35.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll have to excuse the language. He used to say, well, he&#039;s as tight as a bull&#039;s bum in flytime</div><div id="00:28:41.600" class="transcript_line"> or variations on that. And if anybody was from the rural community would understand what I&#039;m saying.</div><div id="00:28:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s another one when we were making hay before a thunderstorm,</div><div id="00:28:53.600" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d be a bit of loose hay on the ground and it would pick it up. And there was a couple around</div><div id="00:28:59.120" class="transcript_line"> here and they used to say, ah, this is the whiffle before the storm. In other words, the wind before</div><div id="00:29:03.120" class="transcript_line"> the thunder. And there&#039;s another one, which somebody who thought quite a bit of himself,</div><div id="00:29:08.800" class="transcript_line"> and you would say to him, where&#039;s the come boy through the glatt or over the hedge.</div><div id="00:29:13.280" class="transcript_line"> But most people would know if they were a radnisher, what a glatt is.</div><div id="00:29:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s usually tied up with string though, but that&#039;s another story. And there&#039;s another one,</div><div id="00:29:24.080" class="transcript_line"> everybody can manage a kicking horse except the bugger who owns him. And another one, he who</div><div id="00:29:29.760" class="transcript_line"> labours and does his best goes down the road along with the rest. And there are many, many more.</div><div id="00:29:35.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve got a lot up your sleeve. Des, thank you very much. It&#039;s been wonderful talking</div><div id="00:29:40.640" class="transcript_line"> to you. Thank you. Can I say, can I say thank you, Jill? It&#039;s been very, very,</div><div id="00:29:46.080" class="transcript_line"> I feel privileged to be able to do it because I said to you over the years that I&#039;ve been doing</div><div id="00:29:50.560" class="transcript_line"> family history, the many, many people that have given up their time to talk to me and tell me</div><div id="00:29:56.160" class="transcript_line"> stories. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for sharing. Thank you.</div></div></p>
