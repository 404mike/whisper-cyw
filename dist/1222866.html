I learnt, I had a smattering of</div><div id="00:00:07.280" class="transcript_line"> Croatian when I went to Yugoslavia. Croatian is easy, Slovene isn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:15.860" class="transcript_line"> easy. But they were gold in comparison to Hungarian because Hungarian I could</div><div id="00:00:25.940" class="transcript_line"> not pick up. I had a two-cent of one year with the High Tatras and Lake Balaton</div><div id="00:00:34.260" class="transcript_line"> and the most I could do in Hungarian was count the numbers, I can&#039;t do that now,</div><div id="00:00:40.980" class="transcript_line"> the flaws of people went up in the left. Sorry. We&#039;ll come on to that in a minute.</div><div id="00:00:47.300" class="transcript_line"> So you were in Brnoz√°ros for a while in Argentina. Did you move around in</div><div id="00:00:54.500" class="transcript_line"> Argentina then or did you stay in Buenos Aires?</div><div id="00:01:03.500" class="transcript_line"> I stayed in, no it was the other way around, I went, when my money ran out I</div><div id="00:01:14.940" class="transcript_line"> started working in Buenos Aires but by that time I had already met my father&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:24.020" class="transcript_line"> next up Uncle Walter&#039;s brother and his wife</div><div id="00:01:36.540" class="transcript_line"> and their daughter had gone to America. That was Uncle Walter&#039;s wife, all right?</div><div id="00:01:55.260" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s Tante Emi to me. These are my two who are now 40. This is a</div><div id="00:02:02.540" class="transcript_line"> picture with the with the ribbon on the frame, yeah, okay. Yeah. So then you came</div><div id="00:02:08.940" class="transcript_line"> back from Argentina. Sorry, yeah. Right, I went to Rio Tisero to see my father&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:21.580" class="transcript_line"> eldest brother with his wife and they didn&#039;t have any children of their own,</div><div id="00:02:34.300" class="transcript_line"> they had adopted a girl who was really nasty to them for whatever reason. All</div><div id="00:02:43.940" class="transcript_line"> the brothers, if you saw them walking you would know that they belonged. They all,</div><div id="00:02:53.340" class="transcript_line"> as they walked, somehow a hand, as they walked, they walked with this hand like</div><div id="00:03:01.420" class="transcript_line"> that. Was the right hand twisted back? Yeah, really odd. Like paddling? They all had that, I mean</div><div id="00:03:09.340" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Walter when he walked, Uncle Herbert, Uncle Peter I didn&#039;t know. One of the</div><div id="00:03:17.700" class="transcript_line"> older brothers I didn&#039;t get to know. Yeah. I got on very very well with Uncle</div><div id="00:03:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Herbert and he had wanted me to stay in Rio Tisero. He practically built, I don&#039;t know what made</div><div id="00:03:40.280" class="transcript_line"> him go out there, but he practically built the town. It was quite a bustling</div><div id="00:03:45.640" class="transcript_line"> town. He said he can remember when there was horses, when there were no roads and</div><div id="00:03:53.120" class="transcript_line"> they all rolled and he could remember tethering the, as you do in cowboy</div><div id="00:04:00.440" class="transcript_line"> films, tethering it to a bar, tethering the horse to a bar. So you came back to the UK?</div><div id="00:04:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sorry, I&#039;m still in Rio Tisero. I then went back to Buenos Aires and then</div><div id="00:04:20.080" class="transcript_line"> as the money had run out I then went to work in English Electric and I was</div><div id="00:04:27.360" class="transcript_line"> there for the Bay of Pigs incident. My parents were extremely worried but as we</div><div id="00:04:35.360" class="transcript_line"> all know nothing happened. And then I went home in 62 and Cardiff, first of all I</div><div id="00:04:50.320" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t want to live with my parents anymore, I wanted to branch out and live</div><div id="00:04:55.080" class="transcript_line"> on my own. They wouldn&#039;t fund me because it wasn&#039;t the done thing.</div></div></p>
