    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was the summer warden at Kemlin in 1994.</div><div id="00:00:07.320" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m looking at a picture from then</div><div id="00:00:11.120" class="transcript_line"> of somebody looking out at the turns from the ridge</div><div id="00:00:15.440" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re lying down on the shingle,</div><div id="00:00:19.120" class="transcript_line"> looking up over the top of the ridge.</div><div id="00:00:21.720" class="transcript_line"> And as I remember, that was mostly what we used to do then.</div><div id="00:00:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And it makes me think about how the shape of the ridge</div><div id="00:00:32.920" class="transcript_line"> has changed.</div><div id="00:00:34.640" class="transcript_line"> And I know the ridge has always changed over time</div><div id="00:00:39.080" class="transcript_line"> and it was created in the 19th century by a storm.</div><div id="00:00:42.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s always been a kind of dynamic thing anyway.</div><div id="00:00:47.280" class="transcript_line"> But looking at this picture brings back the memory</div><div id="00:00:52.040" class="transcript_line"> of a ridge that had a different kind of profile</div><div id="00:00:57.520" class="transcript_line"> and there were other changes associated with that.</div><div id="00:01:02.920" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember who this guy was.</div><div id="00:01:04.240" class="transcript_line"> I think he was one of the people that came</div><div id="00:01:06.480" class="transcript_line"> and helped volunteer for a day.</div><div id="00:01:09.040" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re looking out at the turn islands.</div><div id="00:01:16.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think one thing that people sometimes say</div><div id="00:01:20.560" class="transcript_line"> and that I certainly notice as someone who&#039;s been</div><div id="00:01:23.240" class="transcript_line"> going back to Kenlin for many, many years</div><div id="00:01:26.800" class="transcript_line"> and people who come back after time,</div><div id="00:01:30.840" class="transcript_line"> they feel that the ridge,</div><div id="00:01:33.120" class="transcript_line"> that you somehow are closer to the turns than you used to be.</div><div id="00:01:36.280" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s actually the case.</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> I think the ridge is moving slowly inland</div><div id="00:01:43.160" class="transcript_line"> only by a matter of inches each year, perhaps.</div><div id="00:01:47.800" class="transcript_line"> But as well as that phenomenon,</div><div id="00:01:50.320" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s also the thing of how the ridge is shaped</div><div id="00:01:54.040" class="transcript_line"> by particular weather patterns that you get,</div><div id="00:01:59.440" class="transcript_line"> particularly what winter storms you get</div><div id="00:02:01.440" class="transcript_line"> and what direction they come from.</div><div id="00:02:04.120" class="transcript_line"> That can really change the shape of the ridge.</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> And I think my sense is that now the ridge,</div><div id="00:02:12.200" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s very little space between the top of the ridge</div><div id="00:02:20.400" class="transcript_line"> and the high tide mark.</div><div id="00:02:24.320" class="transcript_line"> That is, once you get to the high tide mark,</div><div id="00:02:26.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re basically almost at the top of the ridge</div><div id="00:02:28.480" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s not much space in between.</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s got implications both for how people access,</div><div id="00:02:39.560" class="transcript_line"> where you put the rope line to keep people</div><div id="00:02:42.040" class="transcript_line"> on the seawood side of the ridge</div><div id="00:02:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and also for what ground nesting birds make use of the ridge</div><div id="00:02:49.840" class="transcript_line"> because back in 1994 when I was the warden,</div><div id="00:02:53.680" class="transcript_line"> we had both several pairs of nesting ring plovers</div><div id="00:03:00.600" class="transcript_line"> on the ridge, some oyster catchers nesting on the ridge</div><div id="00:03:04.720" class="transcript_line"> and also at that time, some Arctic terns still nesting</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> on the ridge itself.</div><div id="00:03:10.880" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a change from now.</div><div id="00:03:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Now we don&#039;t really have,</div><div id="00:03:17.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we had any successful ground nesters</div><div id="00:03:23.360" class="transcript_line"> on the ridge last summer.</div><div id="00:03:26.240" class="transcript_line"> I think we had a couple of pairs.</div><div id="00:03:28.280" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had some ring plovers nesting on the truyn</div><div id="00:03:32.200" class="transcript_line"> or trying to in recent years,</div><div id="00:03:33.840" class="transcript_line"> but not on the ridge as far as I know successfully.</div><div id="00:03:37.320" class="transcript_line"> And certainly the terns haven&#039;t even tried to nest</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> on the ridge for many years.</div><div id="00:03:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m wondering whether this is related to the shape</div><div id="00:03:46.320" class="transcript_line"> of the ridge and also perhaps increased visitor pressure,</div><div id="00:03:51.080" class="transcript_line"> visitors and dogs just because they&#039;re close</div><div id="00:03:56.440" class="transcript_line"> to where the birds want to nest.</div><div id="00:03:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And that space between the top of the high tide mark</div><div id="00:04:03.120" class="transcript_line"> and the top of the ridge has also been squeezed</div><div id="00:04:05.960" class="transcript_line"> just by the effect of probably of sea level rise,</div><div id="00:04:11.720" class="transcript_line"> which is to do with climate change we know.</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> And this sort of incremental effect of that,</div><div id="00:04:16.880" class="transcript_line"> but also perhaps the effect on weather patterns.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think in the last,</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> my sense is in the last sort of five or 10, five years,</div><div id="00:04:28.200" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s been more winter storms</div><div id="00:04:31.840" class="transcript_line"> that have come from different directions.</div><div id="00:04:33.320" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve had these north or northeasterly storms,</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> which goes straight into Kremlin</div><div id="00:04:39.640" class="transcript_line"> because Kemenin&#039;s kind of faces,</div><div id="00:04:43.600" class="transcript_line"> the bay itself is kind of open</div><div id="00:04:46.760" class="transcript_line"> to the northeasterly direction from the open sea.</div><div id="00:04:49.480" class="transcript_line"> And that meant that the ridge has been,</div><div id="00:04:52.440" class="transcript_line"> has taken more of a battering from that direction</div><div id="00:04:54.400" class="transcript_line"> and has even been overtopped by a couple of particularly,</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, ferocious winter storms.</div></div></p>
