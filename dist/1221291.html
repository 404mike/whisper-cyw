    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just brilliant. We had such fun. It was just, you know, everybody was in the show,</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> or a lot of people were in the show, so there was that camaraderie that you get anyway.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you build friendships quicker when you&#039;re in amateur dramatics of any type.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You bond in such a way. And we just had so many laughs, arguments and laughs. It was amazing.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> When we started to do the shows, the Zioner ladies used to cook a three-course meal for a hundred-odd people.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d be in the kitchen all day in between rehearsing, in the heat of the kitchen, arguing with each other.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;d come on the stage laughing, you know, smiling, etc. But the camaraderie was unbelievable.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Unbelievable. They would never get outside of the provinces.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you think Cardiff is a small community, and you would imagine that Liverpool, Manchester, would have these great things going on,</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> nobody had that. Nobody had that. The ladies used to come from the head office in London, Zioner,</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and they used to come and they used to marvel at the community.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The shows, you know, they weren&#039;t brilliant when we started because the majority had never been on stage before.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But the camaraderie, you could touch, you could feel it. It swamped you.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve been here a little bit over 40 years. Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> What changes have you noticed in that time then? It must have changed.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so much. The dwindling of the community. The dwindling of the community.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Really, Wolf is a great person for really giving everybody a kick to keep that community together as best she can.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s still key people here. Another lady, Judy Cotson. Judy and Hayden Cotson.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant at attempting to keep the community together. But it&#039;s the dwindling community, which is great sadness.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a kosher butcher here anymore. Kosher butcher has to come from away.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So how are you managing that? Are you ordered from London?</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean a lot of us have got kids in London, so we&#039;ll go and we&#039;ll stock up a bit. Good old freezer, etc.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The kosher butcher does come once a week and has a little place, it&#039;s like Anatevka, if you go on the roof, by the synagogue.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the van pulls up and they go into their little hut and sell their wares.</div></div></p>
