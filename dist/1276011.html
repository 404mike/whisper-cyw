    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important to understand that the race riots in Wales, the race riots in England,</div><div id="00:00:06.240" class="transcript_line"> were not totally in isolation and they&#039;re treated as if they were in isolation. But much was</div><div id="00:00:12.800" class="transcript_line"> happening in America at the same time and much was said about that. But there are things that</div><div id="00:00:18.640" class="transcript_line"> connect them. So chapter 17 and 18 of our project will relate to Elaine Arkansas, the brutal events</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> of 1919. And for that we link our work to the superb work of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation</div><div id="00:00:39.760" class="transcript_line"> and this is narrated by the actor Ozzie Davis. This is part two of Elaine Arkansas,</div><div id="00:00:48.400" class="transcript_line"> which was during the Red Summer in America in October 1919. The all-white jury debates the</div><div id="00:00:55.360" class="transcript_line"> charges less than eight minutes per man and finds each guilty. The judge sentences all 12 to death.</div><div id="00:01:04.400" class="transcript_line"> As far as Arkansas is concerned, the case is closed. But for Scipio Africanus Jones, an African-American</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> Little Rock attorney, the case is far from closed. As far as he is concerned, the trial is a lynching</div><div id="00:01:23.760" class="transcript_line"> that wears the mask of law. Born in slavery, Jones was driven to succeed in life. He worked his way</div><div id="00:01:32.480" class="transcript_line"> through college, studied law, and eventually became Little Rock&#039;s most prominent black lawyer.</div><div id="00:01:39.600" class="transcript_line"> Jones came into his manhood at a time when opportunities still existed for black people</div><div id="00:01:44.560" class="transcript_line"> in Arkansas. In the late 19th century, blacks held political office, became doctors and lawyers,</div><div id="00:01:52.320" class="transcript_line"> voted, owned property, built churches, and organized women&#039;s clubs and fraternal groups.</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> By 1919, although segregation is deeply entrenched in Arkansas, Scipio Jones is determined</div><div id="00:02:06.640" class="transcript_line"> to save the 12 condemned farmers from execution. But unknown to Jones, Walter White,</div><div id="00:02:14.080" class="transcript_line"> the Assistant Secretary of the NAACP and its Chief Investigator of lynchings, is already on the case.</div><div id="00:02:22.480" class="transcript_line"> Back in New York, Walter White recruits Colonel George Murphy, a lawyer from Little Rock,</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> to represent the condemned men. He is a white southerner, a Confederate war hero,</div><div id="00:02:34.480" class="transcript_line"> a first-rate lawyer, and sympathetic to the defendants. Jones agrees to work with Murphy.</div><div id="00:02:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Jones and Murphy immediately head to Helena, Arkansas, where racial tensions are still as</div><div id="00:02:49.360" class="transcript_line"> volatile as gas fumes. What I find so extraordinary about Scipio Africanus Jones</div><div id="00:02:56.720" class="transcript_line"> is his courage, his willingness to go to Helena, knowing that his life was always at risk as soon</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> as he crossed the county line. Knowing he&#039;s surrounded by men hoping for the chance to kill</div><div id="00:03:10.240" class="transcript_line"> him, Jones sleeps in a different house each night. By day, he and Murphy prepare a motion for a new</div><div id="00:03:17.920" class="transcript_line"> trial. They charge that the presence of the mob and the use of torture made it impossible</div><div id="00:03:24.080" class="transcript_line"> for the defendants to have a fair trial. Jones gathers testimony from a number of tenant farmers,</div><div id="00:03:30.880" class="transcript_line"> including Ath Banks. I was frequently whipped and also put in an electric chair and shocked</div><div id="00:03:39.280" class="transcript_line"> and strangling drugs would be put in my nose to make me tell that others had killed or shot at</div><div id="00:03:46.080" class="transcript_line"> white people and to force me to testify against them. The trial judge denies their motion.</div><div id="00:03:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Jones and Murphy appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The court orders a new trial for six of</div><div id="00:04:04.720" class="transcript_line"> the defendants on technical grounds, but allows the death sentences to stand for the other six.</div><div id="00:04:12.400" class="transcript_line"> The first six are sentenced to death again, but again the appeals court overturns the verdict.</div><div id="00:04:21.760" class="transcript_line"> When Murphy dies shortly after the trial, the fate of all 12 men is left in the hands</div><div id="00:04:29.440" class="transcript_line"> of Scipio Jones and Murphy&#039;s partner, Edgar McKaynie. Jones faces an immediate crisis.</div><div id="00:04:38.640" class="transcript_line"> Six of the men are only days away from execution. There seems no hope.</div><div id="00:04:45.360" class="transcript_line"> Frank Moore, one of the six, watches prison coppers build their coffins in front of their cells.</div><div id="00:04:52.480" class="transcript_line"> They showed us our coffins and laughed and said that&#039;s where we&#039;ll be resting tomorrow night,</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> but we had faith in our lawyer and said no, that won&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:05:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Jones needs four weeks time in order to appeal the case in the federal courts,</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and he knows that the Arkansas Supreme Court will not stop the executions. With hours left before</div><div id="00:05:16.880" class="transcript_line"> the men are to die, Jones and McKaynie surprise everyone by appealing for and obtaining a delay</div><div id="00:05:24.880" class="transcript_line"> of execution from Chancery Court. Some folks perhaps would have even questioned the wisdom</div><div id="00:05:32.320" class="transcript_line"> of Mr. Jones filing a petition in the Chancery Court which had no jurisdiction. Ultimately and</div><div id="00:05:38.560" class="transcript_line"> practically speaking, it turned out to be a brilliant move by Mr. Jones because he did</div><div id="00:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> secure a delay of the execution which bought him and his client&#039;s time to pursue more appropriate</div><div id="00:05:52.160" class="transcript_line"> appeals. Several weeks later, the Arkansas Supreme Court removes the stay, but Jones has gained the</div><div id="00:06:01.200" class="transcript_line"> time he needs to file his appeal in the federal district court. The case is known as Moore versus</div><div id="00:06:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Dempsey. Jones&#039;s strategy saves the men&#039;s lives, but for how long? The NAACP now brings in</div><div id="00:06:20.720" class="transcript_line"> Moorefield Story, a constitutional lawyer and president of the NAACP, to work with Jones.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They feel their strongest argument is that the presence of a mob surrounding the court</div><div id="00:06:33.680" class="transcript_line"> made it impossible for the defendants to receive a fair trial. Sturgeon Jones are concerned that the</div><div id="00:06:41.360" class="transcript_line"> court will reject their appeal as it has already done in a similar case. In 1913, a Georgia mob</div><div id="00:06:50.800" class="transcript_line"> demanded that a jury find Leo Frank, a Jewish manager of a clothing factory, guilty of murdering</div><div id="00:07:00.240" class="transcript_line"> a young woman worker at the plant. Frank was innocent, but the judge and jury, intimidated by</div><div id="00:07:08.320" class="transcript_line"> the mob, convicted him and Frank was sentenced to death. The United States Supreme Court refused to</div><div id="00:07:16.880" class="transcript_line"> intervene and Frank was ultimately lynched. But there was a dissenting voice, Justice Oliver Wendell</div><div id="00:07:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Holmes. Jones hopes that Justice Holmes can convince his colleagues to reverse that decision.</div><div id="00:07:39.040" class="transcript_line"> On February 19, 1923, the Supreme Court announces its decision,</div><div id="00:07:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Justice Holmes speaking for the majority. If the whole case is a mask, that counsel, jury and judge</div><div id="00:07:52.560" class="transcript_line"> were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible tide of public passion and the state courts</div><div id="00:07:58.720" class="transcript_line"> refused to correct the wrong, then nothing can prevent this court from securing to the petitioners</div><div id="00:08:05.600" class="transcript_line"> their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court orders the case back to the federal district</div><div id="00:08:11.280" class="transcript_line"> courts for further review. Jones immediately seizes the opportunity. He pressures the states</div><div id="00:08:18.160" class="transcript_line"> to release everyone imprisoned in the case. The state surrenders. By 1925, everyone is released.</div><div id="00:08:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Jones&#039;s victory in Moore versus Dempsey did not compensate for the deaths at Elaine,</div><div id="00:08:37.280" class="transcript_line"> but it did help prevent future deaths. For the first time in American history, the Supreme Court</div><div id="00:08:43.840" class="transcript_line"> handed down a verdict favoring black defendants in a criminal case. For the next 50 years,</div><div id="00:08:51.280" class="transcript_line"> the NAACP will build on Moore versus Dempsey to win other major victories in the Supreme Court</div><div id="00:08:57.920" class="transcript_line"> that eventually will help end legal segregation. Although Jones may be little known today,</div><div id="00:09:06.480" class="transcript_line"> his legacy remains as one of the first black lawyers to challenge southern legal injustice</div><div id="00:09:14.480" class="transcript_line"> and win. No finer tribute has been given him than that written almost 80 years ago in the African</div><div id="00:09:23.120" class="transcript_line"> American newspaper, the Arkansas Survey. Mr. Jones went to Helena and took charge of the case</div><div id="00:09:32.640" class="transcript_line"> when Helena was a seething cauldron of hate and the least in discretion meant death.</div><div id="00:09:39.680" class="transcript_line"> For four years, he traveled and investigated and pled until the 13th of January when Governor McCrae</div><div id="00:09:48.480" class="transcript_line"> opened the prison gates to the last of the rioters. All hail Jones. Praise him for his knowledge of</div><div id="00:09:58.800" class="transcript_line"> the law, his nerve, and his sagacity. He will receive little glory, but it is the great state</div><div id="00:10:06.560" class="transcript_line"> of Arkansas which is the real beneficiary of his service and the people of America as well.</div></div></p>
