    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re listening to Stephen talking about a long-distance relationship in his past.</div><div id="00:00:04.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had my first girlfriend, really interesting story this is. I went to the Welsh Games</div><div id="00:00:09.840" class="transcript_line"> to represent the South Welsh team. We had the events in the afternoon and then in the evening</div><div id="00:00:15.680" class="transcript_line"> then they said we&#039;re going to pick the best people to go to Cardiff, meet the mayor and the mayoress</div><div id="00:00:21.920" class="transcript_line"> and have a buffet. Certain ones from South Wales would go, mid and west of North Wales.</div><div id="00:00:28.240" class="transcript_line"> So he picked me and my other friend. So we met them and then Christine was there,</div><div id="00:00:33.520" class="transcript_line"> just there, my other one there. And I seen Christine sitting there with her medals. She was on her own</div><div id="00:00:38.720" class="transcript_line"> so I went over to her and I said is it okay if I sit by her? Is anybody sitting there? And she said no.</div><div id="00:00:45.520" class="transcript_line"> So we started talking to her. My coach was there but I forgot to tell my coach we were getting</div><div id="00:00:49.920" class="transcript_line"> interested with each other talking. And then I got to know her then in a party and then I</div><div id="00:00:57.360" class="transcript_line"> asked her for her address where she lives. I found it was Aberystwyth.</div><div id="00:01:02.800" class="transcript_line"> And so her mother said to Christine, I had a letter, we said oh we&#039;re right back and</div><div id="00:01:08.160" class="transcript_line"> forth as pen friends. So I went back and forth for a year and then the following year and in</div><div id="00:01:13.440" class="transcript_line"> the next world games I met her mother. And her mother said, so she said come back for a couple</div><div id="00:01:19.680" class="transcript_line"> of days. The first time I went up there my father took me up to meet him. He stayed in a hotel and</div><div id="00:01:26.480" class="transcript_line"> I stayed at Christine&#039;s place and that was in August. And he said then I went successful. And then</div><div id="00:01:34.800" class="transcript_line"> after that we just got to know each other. She came down to my house every Easter. I&#039;d go up</div><div id="00:01:40.880" class="transcript_line"> to Aberystwyth for eight days over Easter or she&#039;d come down to my place. You had a long</div><div id="00:01:46.720" class="transcript_line"> distance relationship? Yeah and I went on for about 12 years. 12, 13 years, a long time. And then when</div><div id="00:01:53.600" class="transcript_line"> I moved up there I wanted to move to Aberystwyth. There was a bungalow up there I was going to move.</div><div id="00:01:59.520" class="transcript_line"> So Christine came down that was in, I know the year that was. Parents came down in 1996.</div><div id="00:02:07.680" class="transcript_line"> We said I want to move up to, we had a round table talk with her parents, man was in.</div><div id="00:02:12.960" class="transcript_line"> And they said too much responsibility, you can&#039;t move to Aberystwyth. Who said that then? Her mother.</div><div id="00:02:19.840" class="transcript_line"> My mother said back to her mother, give them a six months trial to see where you get on. But she</div><div id="00:02:25.600" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t having that. So it didn&#039;t happen? No. Her parents stopped it. So what happened then?</div><div id="00:02:34.240" class="transcript_line"> What happened? She met a friend who lived in Lampeter. And then on that, and she was going</div><div id="00:02:41.760" class="transcript_line"> with him, but then I went up there for the Christmas party and Christine said to her mother,</div><div id="00:02:46.960" class="transcript_line"> and she knew I&#039;d looked at that fella, she said oh I want to marry Stephen, me now. Mother said no,</div><div id="00:02:53.120" class="transcript_line"> we can&#039;t do that, we got a secret. And then I went back to my mum and they said stop it,</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like a hand in a fire. Just stop the relationship, we stopped it then. Because we&#039;re not going anywhere.</div></div></p>
