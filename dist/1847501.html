widow now.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband got killed.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I invited to a wedding for St. Kitts.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And my husband, he&#039;s one in all.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, Caribbean people are not one for time.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And he hates to be on time.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, so what I&#039;ll do, we&#039;re going to London.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ll go to college, bring your parents up,</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and they can stay here.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we all traveled up early then,</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> ran away to London.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, okay.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was on his way to Cardiff, and articulated Laurie,</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> hit the driver&#039;s side and killed him outright.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so I&#039;ve been a widow.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been with two children, you know, a boy and a girl.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve been widows ever since 40 odd years.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been in Newport now 50 odd years.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> A long time, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very long time, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so sorry to hear that.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> That must have been so dramatic for you.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> When I met him, it was my very first time out.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;ve never been in a club before.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And my friend, they felt sorry for me</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;ve never been to the park.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t let us go to the park.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Never been to the park.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Never been to the picture house before ever.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d think I&#039;d just come from abroad.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Parents didn&#039;t let us.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very strict.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So my friend kept with his story.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, make sure you&#039;re ready when I come for you.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, okay.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she knew when we&#039;re in the house,</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> we are closed, which is for the house.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> When we&#039;re going out, we change for your best clothes.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like that in those days.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So when she came, I&#039;d already had a bath</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and put my best clothes underneath</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and my old clothes on the top of it.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So when she came in, she said, Mr. Brody.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was begging him.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to her,</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said to her, Gwen&#039;s a Christian.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I heard him.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, but I want to go still.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, Gwen, you can&#039;t have God in one hand</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and the devil in the other.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, but I want to go.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s kind of short story.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It came to the point.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, yes, so I went.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s that night I met my husband.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, I was telling about God.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went, oh, Flo, I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re on about.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And he invited me to the flicks.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yes.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what the flicks were.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the pictures.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I asked my father, can I go?</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, can I go?</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, meet who?</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I said a friend.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, what friend?</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, a friend.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, what sort of a friend?</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t say the word boyfriend.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, sort of a memory like that.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Boyfriend.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I&#039;ll tell you what.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Go and meet him.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Bring him here first.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you can go out with him.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I met him and I brought him back to the house.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> In Cardicatis.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my father asked him, you know, how old he was,</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> what his job was, what was his intention, all that.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t get over it.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He was laughing his head off.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He was telling his friends about it.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were in stitches over it.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I thought I was going back in time, he said.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> In there with them.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you when you met him?</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I met him at 16.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married at 17.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, go and I&#039;d be very lucky if I lived to be 28.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to watch.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh, is something wrong with him?</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want him no more now.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was nothing wrong with him.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He just felt it all along.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember saying to him, Tony, you&#039;re 28 and you&#039;re still alive.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to me, Gwen, well, I hate to leave you with nothing.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I want you to take out the insurance.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to take out the insurance for him.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I took it out.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt so pleased.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Cardicatis and sent my file.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Tony, you&#039;ve told me to take out the insurance if anything happens to him.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I love him so much.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> My father tore me off.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re after a dead man&#039;s money.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And that played on my mind, you know.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told Tony what he said.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Tony said to me, take the notice of him.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s that silly West Indian nonsense.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He just take the notice of it.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But I let the insurance, I let it lapse.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I let it lapse, I told him.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, we take it out again.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I took it out again, you know.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But it played on my mind, you know, my father said.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, but when it happened, I didn&#039;t have no insurance.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But you work for medical and surgical exhibition.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the chop farm his way came to see me at the time.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> All in my house discussing, no, she got no insurance.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> All the West Indian nutrition, but no one offered.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can get over it.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So he went back to his boss.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he told him what was going on.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boss, they paid for the funeral,</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> cost everything for me, so God was good.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Either way, you know, I still provide you for, you know.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> God was good.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you came over here as a little girl,</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> what was it like?</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to start going to school, right?</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know if you, do you remember going to school</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and getting kids?</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Or were you too little to go to school?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I do not be racking my brains about it.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember any.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the experience in school at all.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember that at all.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the experience in school in Britain?</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, of course.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> All my experience here, yes.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me a bit about it.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like for you?</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, here the children had pocket money.</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d buy crisp and things like that.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But we never ever had pocket money, never.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and they&#039;d all have crisp.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d give me, you know, one always offer you.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But I never had no money to go and buy sweets or anything like that.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all did, you know, every day same old.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they felt sorry for, you know, that&#039;s what they&#039;d offer.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So your parents were very, very strict.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you, did your brothers and sisters come as well,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> or was it just you?</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How, how many siblings do you have?</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nine.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the eldest of nine.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The eldest of nine.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They were strict.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They were strict.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They, they didn&#039;t have pocket money at all either.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Did everybody come over at the same time or?</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> No, towards the time.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It was towards the time.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you one of the first ones to come over or were you later on?</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the later ones was Wingrove.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I was the second one.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I should have been the first, but I said no at the time, I think.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Why did you say no?</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I think my grandmother wanted me as well.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t want you to go.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> No, she said they wanted me to come.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said stay, I wouldn&#039;t be the first.</div><div id="00:11:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you like, so did you like school?</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy school?</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t like learning, but yes, I was in school.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you want to be when you grew up?</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any dreams?</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I wanted to be, yes, I wanted to be a typist.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the type in Italian?</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so when my husband died, I was in John Ford Square in Newport,</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and this blonde lady came up to me and said, excuse me, I said yeah.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, are you working?</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, do you have a job?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, would you like one?</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I said yes, please.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, what qualifications have you got?</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I said nothing.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes nothing.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I goes absolutely nothing.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;ve got no qualifications whatsoever.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes nothing.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes try.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, I do have pitman&#039;s.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I done pitman&#039;s.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember, everywhere there&#039;s pitman&#039;s.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s typing.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was typing and shortened in those days.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s called qualification.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes pitman&#039;s.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes, of course you got qualifications, you know.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And she goes because I&#039;m looking, I mean, they&#039;re looking for people to work at the business,</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> the Texas office.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you heard of it?</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You passed it coming up here.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for 25 years.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There I had, you know, a lot of racism there because it wasn&#039;t blatant.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all nice to me and they&#039;re friendly.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But when they were marking my report, it was always, I didn&#039;t realize it was different.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Rather than get me fitted, it was always likely to be fitted, likely.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the supervisors, she had an accident and broke her leg and she couldn&#039;t attend.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So the one who was next in line, they asked him to go into the computer room to learn that.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> No one wanted to do it because if you make a mistake, the whole thing would crash if you miss out a comma or anything like that.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first two refused, so I was next in line, I was the third in line.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So they asked if I wanted to do it, I said yes.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I went in there, I remember, you know, the speed was very fast.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> My feet was 19,000.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We all very fast, you know.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought to myself, I&#039;ll go fast, stop, and I&#039;ll check twice before I press it.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I did.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And the overall boss, she saw me go and I stopped and checked.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She goes, Gwen, if they saw you there like that, you won&#039;t look very professional.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to be a bit quicker.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> She just wanted me to, I know what she was up to, but I just totally ignored and I just carried on because they all wanted me to make a mistake.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I know they didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, they did call me and they said to me I was doing very good, you know, in there, because I was in there for six months and no accident at all.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And they didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You could see they didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I had my report, they still put likely to be fitted.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> What does likely to be fitted mean?</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It means you&#039;re not good enough for promotion.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Likely means either you&#039;re good, likely, or you&#039;re no good.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they always gave me the middle.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, I wanted to go in for, I wanted to graduate higher, the next level.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And to the next level, I put in for it.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When I put in for it, it happened when I was walking through the corridor, one of their bosses stopped me and said to me, when I hear you&#039;re going for the...</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s my camera?</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he said to me, I hear that you&#039;re going for the position.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I said yes, because I&#039;m one of the bosses who will be interviewing you.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I&#039;ll give you a tip.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, first they look at your shoes.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If the heat is scuff, it goes against you.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And if it&#039;s worn down, you know.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So he gave me those tips.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, and he said, when the question be on drugs.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And then going down to the meeting for my interview, I had the radio on.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And guess what?</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They were talking about drugs.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Someone&#039;s been interviewed.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I remembered everything they said.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used all that and they told me.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they wrote, I pass, I pass.</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was going for the next level.</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But then he said to me, Gwen, we couldn&#039;t give it to you because they put likely to be defeated.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I don&#039;t have to tell you.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you did well.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I just smile.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, but we couldn&#039;t give you it because they put likely to be defeated.</div><div id="00:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So why do you have likely to be defeated?</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, they always give you likely to be defeated.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They always give me likely to be defeated.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, well, if they feel you&#039;re not good enough, you know, to go on.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, what does it take to get you up to that level?</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> They should have brought you up to that level.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They thought, you know, and then they would try.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So then, you know what happened next, the union men on my side.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I knew some of the union men, they were so good, you know, helped me.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And they sort of took it up with them.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, later on, one thing you know, in hindsight, you know, you could have done push it further, but I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he said, had we given it to you, there was a question why we gave it to you who had likely to be fitted.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And those, there was someone done just as well as you who had fitted.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So they caused a lot of problems, you know.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, when I went back, they called me to the office to say, Gwen, they&#039;ve got an excellent write-up on you,</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> how well you did at the interview and how you&#039;d pass.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But they couldn&#039;t give it to you because they, because I only had likely to be fitted, you know.</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> All that was there, you know.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And all that experience was terrible.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You were there for 20 something years.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> For over 25 years, yes.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And never got promoted?</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That is disgusting.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It is, but God is good though because when that lady said to you that blonde woman and they got the job,</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> they only needed, I think it was on their vacancy, permanent vacancy for when.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And they called me, I was one of them from, I think I think about a dozen.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was the only one who got the job.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got the job anyway, I skipped it, but never no promotion, but never mind, you know.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> There we go.</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s lots of things, you know.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So you got your dream job then because you wanted to be a typist as a child.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I was doing, yeah, but you know what?</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> How I done it, when it wasn&#039;t just quite typing, it was like, when it was typing,</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> it was all holes like braids, holes in the paper and you had to read them, the holes.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I got them here somewhere, I can&#039;t find it.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think, how on earth did I learn to, how could I read just all holes,</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, punching holes?</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How I, how I couldn&#039;t understand, how did I manage to learn all those?</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were taught how to do it, you know, and I think of all that.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So you left, when you left, I&#039;m going back a bit.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you left primary school.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We went up to Bishop and Under, that&#039;s high school, at 11.</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I was 11 years old and Lord Snow, Princess Marilyn, Lord Snow opened the school at the time.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big thing.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me a bit about 11 plus.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you had to have your exams at that time, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> To get into, you know, school like that, you had to pass the 11 plus.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I saw a lot of people, a lot of people failed the 11 plus at the time.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But I failed it, but.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you want to drink it?</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you want to have one?</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You failed it the first time?</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I passed it after.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s only through, like I said, studying.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I surprised myself, what I did, I was, because those, in those days,</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> you have to memorize the things, do you remember?</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re doing your exams, I used to have the paper all the time,</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just writing to myself, you know, all the time and studying.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I memorized, so it proves that I could do it.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So I managed that.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you got to Bishop of like that.</div><div id="00:20:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Bishop of Landerfie school, yeah.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a prefect there as well.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you would, how come you were doing so well in school</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and then said that you had no qualifications at the end of it?</div><div id="00:20:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I said, I didn&#039;t realize that I didn&#039;t have,</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought I didn&#039;t have no qualifications, but with that I did, you know.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you left Bishop of Landerfie, you did exams okay after that, to leave?</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, but at Bishop of Landerfie, it was time to leave school then.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We were fifteen, you left school at fifteen then.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they just brought in the change that you could stay till you&#039;re sixteen.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But they want to stay till you&#039;re sixteen, I wanted to leave.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And most people would have gotten a trade or something at that point.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> What would people normally do?</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because fifteen is very young to leave school.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s my father said, oh my friend came and she got me a job.</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just in the factory, just packing peanuts, that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, she goes, do you want to?</div><div id="00:21:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yes.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I told my father and he said, no.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re too young to go to work.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, my friend&#039;s working, I want to go with her.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember, I came with my first wage, it was eight pounds.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Eight pounds a month, so I came home and I said to my mother,</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> because my friend told me she was giving her mother a keep in a boarding lot.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said to my mother, here&#039;s two pounds for my boarding lodge.</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told my father, I gave my mother two pounds for my boarding lodge.</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Instead, I go to her and ask her to give me the two pounds back</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m still paying your keep for everyone.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I haven&#039;t reduced the money, so ask her for your back.</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said to her father, you&#039;ve got to give me the money back.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, but I don&#039;t really want it because that&#039;s your keep anyway.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So let her keep it.</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, I&#039;ll tell you what.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I said to him, I had two pounds for my bus fare.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, with that two pounds, you go to the bank and you save two pounds.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Every month I&#039;d do with that two pounds.</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, two pounds for my bus fare, two pounds to save for my clothes,</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> two pounds to buy clothes, and two pounds for savings, two for six.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And the two pounds was for, I don&#039;t know, it was all worked out.</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Saving, two pounds for buying clothes, two pounds for my mother, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I still gave her two pounds, but I didn&#039;t know him, you know,</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> because I thought she was two pounds.</div><div id="00:22:53.000" class="transcript_line"> My friends were payers, so I should have to pay as well.</div><div id="00:22:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Did your father have the same philosophy as your grandmother</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> about saving from what you have?</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but he wasn&#039;t the same.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother was a saver.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was my mother, when they were over here, she was either to save</div><div id="00:23:11.000" class="transcript_line"> so they can buy a house, so they bought a house, looking, they bought it, you know.</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He went for my mother because she was a saver.</div><div id="00:23:17.000" class="transcript_line"> My father wasn&#039;t a saver.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything, I mean, you were lucky to have your big family,</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> to have the experience of your grandmother,</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> to come to the country with your father and your mother there,</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and all of your siblings,</div><div id="00:23:32.000" class="transcript_line"> was there anything in the house that reminded you of home,</div><div id="00:23:36.000" class="transcript_line"> or reminded you of some kids, even though you left when you were so young?</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s get to what I can remember is that they used to have a gramophone,</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d have them playing the records all the time, you know,</div><div id="00:23:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and the French room, which,</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> you heard about the French room, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The French room experience, the French room is where,</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> in the French room, you had all brand new,</div><div id="00:24:04.000" class="transcript_line"> you go into that, all brand new fitted carpets,</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> three piece suites, you know, it was for when the minister comes,</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> you go in there, and it teaches anyone like that,</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> but the children went aloud.</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d keep a lock, lock, specification there.</div><div id="00:24:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a program on the TV about the French room.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, they&#039;d done a play of it.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the French room, you had the gramophone.</div><div id="00:24:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was the best room then, if the best, you know, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You had your gramophone, your new gramophone, TV,</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> everything was all nice, but the children wasn&#039;t allowed in that room.</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Only guests, you know.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d take them in there, you know,</div><div id="00:24:43.000" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d give them a cup of tea on the tray with biscuits or whatever, you know.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d treat them nice.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the food? Did your mother cook?</div><div id="00:24:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Western Indian food, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Every Sunday we&#039;d have red beans and rice with the meat.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> On a Saturday, it was always soup.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like, what&#039;s the, I&#039;m trying to think, was it shoulder?</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I forgot the name of the meat.</div><div id="00:25:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I might have used to buy it on a Friday fish.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that is familiar for me as well.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> At home, we always, on Saturdays, always soup.</div><div id="00:25:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Where part of Africa are you from?</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m from Trinidad.</div><div id="00:25:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you from Trinidad, is it?</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The name is African, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my name is African.</div><div id="00:25:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you a husband, is it?</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that a surname of?</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Adiola is the first name.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The name my parents gave me, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how to say it.</div><div id="00:25:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s from Trinidad.</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I spent a lot of my holidays in Syracuse.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So growing up here, was there anything that made you feel different?</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You talked about being at work and not being promoted.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the experience of school?</div><div id="00:26:14.000" class="transcript_line"> A school experience for them.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what happened in order to grow up with this school.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> She called me and she went into a black beauty.</div><div id="00:26:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:26:41.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the way of bringing color into it to really work there.</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from that, doing nothing.</div><div id="00:26:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We were friends after anyway, obviously.</div><div id="00:26:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t find racism in Canada, if I found it in Newport.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> When did you come to Newport?</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you?</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When I got married.</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So, seventeen.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Seventeen.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that?</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So how different was the experience?</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I found the people very, very different.</div><div id="00:27:19.000" class="transcript_line"> In what way?</div><div id="00:27:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Like my friend.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> When she went to church, they&#039;d move her to her seat.</div><div id="00:27:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:27:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re called, in Canada.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The reason why the Westinians had their own church, because they weren&#039;t welcoming the churches anyway.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> In this country.</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a film on telly, it was called.</div><div id="00:28:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you saw it, another film.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> A series.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Where the chap said to the girl.</div><div id="00:28:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, she was black, he called her.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He called her.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Exotic.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, anyway, this is in the church, preaching to them all.</div><div id="00:28:33.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I see we have here an exotic, you know, people in our midst.</div><div id="00:28:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, but it doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:28:39.000" class="transcript_line"> God will allow you in as well.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the mentality.</div><div id="00:28:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, oh, they do not see you as equal.</div><div id="00:28:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even see you as a human being.</div><div id="00:28:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t see you equal to them.</div><div id="00:28:52.000" class="transcript_line"> On a Newport, they&#039;re like that.</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any personal experiences of feeling like that?</div><div id="00:28:58.000" class="transcript_line"> In Newport, when you just came?</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Very much so.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember.</div><div id="00:29:08.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was at my.</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> My fiance&#039;s house, the other time he was marrying.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> One of his mother&#039;s friends came in and she said to me.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t mind having one of you.</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d give one of you a room in my house.</div><div id="00:29:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what she meant by then.</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in Newport, I said to you, her race is the way they have people.</div><div id="00:29:32.000" class="transcript_line"> What did she mean?</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Was she talking about to help her cook and clean?</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> To give me a rent.</div><div id="00:29:41.000" class="transcript_line"> To rent me a room.</div><div id="00:29:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I said that to Tony, he knew what she meant.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to me, I can remember when he was little.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one of his mother&#039;s friends said to him.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I have one like you.</div><div id="00:29:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And then mixed race child, she was saying.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was mixed race, but in school they called him Coco.</div><div id="00:30:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That was his name.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they thought he was really black, you know.</div><div id="00:30:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to think half castes, the blackest you can get them.</div><div id="00:30:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t see, you know, really darker skin.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he was like, see my granddaughter down there.</div><div id="00:30:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you see her there with me?</div><div id="00:30:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was like that, but they called him white love.</div><div id="00:30:26.000" class="transcript_line"> What I think, knowing what I know now.</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That when they&#039;re born, they&#039;re like white in there.</div><div id="00:30:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she told her that it was a hot day and she forgot about it in the sun.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;ve heard them describe mixed race child as black as night, you know.</div><div id="00:30:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that that mentality is still like that today?</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Or things have changed?</div><div id="00:30:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No, the end occurrence is still there now to this day.</div><div id="00:31:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They think they&#039;re more superior.</div><div id="00:31:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t think that.</div><div id="00:31:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And especially when they&#039;re showing all this program all the time.</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> With them, they show you Africa with the children, with the war and all that.</div><div id="00:31:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Always showing all that.</div><div id="00:31:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to say to them, they keep showing that all the time.</div><div id="00:31:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But who&#039;s putting all these images and who&#039;s profiting from it?</div><div id="00:31:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And they keep saying, oh, in Africa, it&#039;s very corrupt.</div><div id="00:31:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what they all say.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And you put, they&#039;re so corrupt.</div><div
