    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Liz</div><div id="00:00:08.660" class="transcript_line"> Dutton, the venue Swicker Office and the date is Sunday the 16th of November 2015. Liz,</div><div id="00:00:16.320" class="transcript_line"> would you be kind enough to spell your name for us for the record?</div><div id="00:00:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Liz Dutton. Thank you much indeed. Can you tell us when and how did you first get involved or hear</div><div id="00:00:31.680" class="transcript_line"> about the Cardiff Carnival? Well in my work as a youth worker part of my role was to organize play</div><div id="00:00:39.760" class="transcript_line"> schemes and one year I decided that I didn&#039;t want to actually organize and run a play scheme that I</div><div id="00:00:47.400" class="transcript_line"> just wanted to be part of and just be a play worker. So during that time somebody mentioned</div><div id="00:00:56.840" class="transcript_line"> to me that there was carnival going on at Fitzhallen School so I was a bit curious so I went along to</div><div id="00:01:07.160" class="transcript_line"> see you know what was going on and basically you know didn&#039;t leave. So that would have been back in</div><div id="00:01:16.080" class="transcript_line"> the distant past 1991. Yeah. And I remember you saying that you remember what you did I mean you</div><div id="00:01:23.680" class="transcript_line"> were dancing on the day itself were you in a dance group? Yeah. What kind of costume did you have the very first time round?</div><div id="00:01:30.480" class="transcript_line"> Gosh it was I think the basis of it was the skirt was I think was purple I knew I know</div><div id="00:01:39.360" class="transcript_line"> there was a multi-colored sash there was a headdress and there were bobbles on shoes and things.</div><div id="00:01:47.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a tribute to indigenous people I seem to remember. I think that was it. Which indigenous people I couldn&#039;t tell you</div><div id="00:01:53.440" class="transcript_line"> not off the top of my head by frankly. And that very first time that you got involved</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> did your children get involved at that point or did you bring them on on board the carnival bus</div><div id="00:02:02.960" class="transcript_line"> No no they got involved at that point my daughter actually was in the dance group with me and she had a costume</div><div id="00:02:11.840" class="transcript_line"> and my son was more or less Stuart he got involved in like the Stuart because he didn&#039;t want to like</div><div id="00:02:18.800" class="transcript_line"> dress up in carnival costume. But he supported the carnival every year you know those people in the yellow bibs are absolutely vital to it.</div><div id="00:02:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah most definitely but yeah my daughter was in the dance group same as me and she really enjoyed it that first time.</div><div id="00:02:32.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic. So whenever I think of your role in carnival I always refer to you as a carnival queen</div><div id="00:02:42.080" class="transcript_line"> because you always wore to my mind except for this possibly this first year</div><div id="00:02:46.480" class="transcript_line"> you always wore a large backpack costume which meant that you know you were what can I say</div><div id="00:02:53.840" class="transcript_line"> brilliant to look at you know big big costumes. So how did that come about was it was it working with Amaru or?</div><div id="00:03:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes it was actually. You always seem to design a costume that was like really large</div><div id="00:03:10.160" class="transcript_line"> but with a backpack so yeah yeah yeah. With a backpack quite dynamic really. Yes. It was fun wearing them</div><div id="00:03:16.720" class="transcript_line"> yeah it was you know it was really. Did the design get was it ever too what was it like I mean you</div><div id="00:03:21.840" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re having to rehearse in these things you&#039;re having to add to them you come the big day of the</div><div id="00:03:27.600" class="transcript_line"> big parade you know you can take an hour or two with getting ready and all the rest of it. How comfortable</div><div id="00:03:33.920" class="transcript_line"> were they or did it change over time? It did change over time I mean in the beginning they were a bit</div><div id="00:03:39.200" class="transcript_line"> uncomfortable and you know adjustments were always being made and stuff but you know over</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> a course of time the backpacks got lighter so they were easier to move around in and yes I see</div><div id="00:03:51.520" class="transcript_line"> it seems to me to think yeah eventually we found tubular steel and that&#039;s right a joy of foam rubber</div><div id="00:03:58.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah that&#039;s right yeah so I can remember the early ones seem to virtually cripple people and</div><div id="00:04:03.040" class="transcript_line"> slowly but surely we yeah as a group we improved in what we were doing definitely yeah but um</div><div id="00:04:09.120" class="transcript_line"> you know with the carnival it was the whole thing of on the day you know watching people&#039;s faces</div><div id="00:04:16.480" class="transcript_line"> especially the little children you know in awe of what they were seeing you know because it was so</div><div id="00:04:20.960" class="transcript_line"> colorful and dynamic and they&#039;d want to come up and touch you and you know and that kind of thing</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> and you know that part of it you know it was it was really good it was and the build-up to it as</div><div id="00:04:33.440" class="transcript_line"> well you know the whole carnival camp um I mean my son and daughter I mean they they met so many</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> people and they&#039;ve grown up with so many um people of their their own age and and yet they only used</div><div id="00:04:49.360" class="transcript_line"> to meet them once a year a carnival camp but it was like they&#039;d spoken to them yesterday</div><div id="00:04:55.440" class="transcript_line"> do you know what I mean and they&#039;ve made lifelong friends and not only that it enabled my children</div><div id="00:05:00.480" class="transcript_line"> as well to learn to work alongside adults you know to work alongside adults and not only that</div><div id="00:05:11.280" class="transcript_line"> to work alongside lots of different people because my son and daughter they&#039;re grown up now and they</div><div id="00:05:17.280" class="transcript_line"> can they can relate to anybody you know whether they&#039;re old young you know you know any background</div><div id="00:05:24.320" class="transcript_line"> any background at all any walk of life at all yes and you know carnival you know played a</div><div id="00:05:29.520" class="transcript_line"> part in that to be honest you know it did yeah without without a doubt but you must have a fairly</div><div id="00:05:34.720" class="transcript_line"> amazing skills base now I mean uh again when I think of you I think of you sticking stuff on and</div><div id="00:05:41.840" class="transcript_line"> certainly with a glue gun and not necessarily going ouch ouch ouch every time that uh yeah you</div><div id="00:05:46.880" class="transcript_line"> push it and the rest of it so yes I mean tell me about the carnival camp and the skills that you</div><div id="00:05:51.600" class="transcript_line"> learned or what was that like it was quite amazing really um you know being part of a team of people</div><div id="00:06:01.680" class="transcript_line"> that that were you know putting together costumes I mean you have um you know particular tables that</div><div id="00:06:09.360" class="transcript_line"> were specific in certain parts of costumes and you know even just by watching other people you</div><div id="00:06:16.160" class="transcript_line"> were able to pick up skills that you could use again yourself I mean especially in my work um</div><div id="00:06:22.160" class="transcript_line"> like working with young people yeah you know I could take those skills that I was actually</div><div id="00:06:26.640" class="transcript_line"> doing and actually observing back to you know my work as a youth worker and a play worker I think</div><div id="00:06:32.720" class="transcript_line"> you also you mentioned you also did this in terms of some of the percussion and the rhythm and yeah</div><div id="00:06:36.800" class="transcript_line"> yes yeah um when I ran play schemes um I actually took the skills that I&#039;d learned in carnival and</div><div id="00:06:43.920" class="transcript_line"> put them to use within the play schemes carnival theme every time I did a play scheme there was</div><div id="00:06:48.960" class="transcript_line"> always a carnival theme used to do tie-dye make headdresses I purchased instruments so they could</div><div id="00:06:56.240" class="transcript_line"> have a little percussion band and also um one year within my community um I organized</div><div id="00:07:04.720" class="transcript_line"> a carnival theme where Splot is the community I live in yeah and um we did a procession with</div><div id="00:07:11.440" class="transcript_line"> young people dressed up made costumes and doing percussion around Splot and that was part of um</div><div id="00:07:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Splot carnival uh it seemed to recall as well that um yeah obviously carnival the carnival camp ends</div><div id="00:07:26.480" class="transcript_line"> with a big carnival day in the parade but carnival art sort of as you say permanates into youth work</div><div id="00:07:31.920" class="transcript_line"> it certainly happened in schools and uh you reminded me earlier that uh there was an instance</div><div id="00:07:37.600" class="transcript_line"> where some of your group performed on stage at the Sherman theater is that right yeah that was</div><div id="00:07:43.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what year that was but um obviously because I had a passion for carnival</div><div id="00:07:49.040" class="transcript_line"> in my work as a youth work I tried to encourage some of the young people that I work with to take</div><div id="00:07:53.520" class="transcript_line"> part and managed to also get some parents to take part as well and following the big carnival parade</div><div id="00:08:03.280" class="transcript_line"> um we um the young people performed their routine in the Sherman theater which was really</div><div id="00:08:10.720" class="transcript_line"> really lovely was absolutely fantastic but because you&#039;ve got besides being a carnival queen of some</div><div id="00:08:17.280" class="transcript_line"> renown um you are a long-standing member of Samba Galez the college school Samba yeah yeah uh I</div><div id="00:08:24.880" class="transcript_line"> think you&#039;re sort of actually born born with a go-go bell in

avon carnival so I would organize for the group to go</div><div id="00:08:54.160" class="transcript_line"> to Glastonbury yeah and I&#039;d do blind avons such was my dedication to the job so
