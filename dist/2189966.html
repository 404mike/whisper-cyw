    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Vicki MacDonald speaking from Holy Trinity Church, Flandersnow, during</div><div id="00:00:06.040" class="transcript_line"> the longest yarn and I&#039;m with Linda Wainwright who&#039;s going to tell us about</div><div id="00:00:10.720" class="transcript_line"> her family during the war. Sorry about the noise, thank you Linda, let&#039;s go.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything you want to tell me?</div><div id="00:00:18.760" class="transcript_line"> My parents, my grandparents, were actually killed during the war.</div><div id="00:00:25.120" class="transcript_line"> They lived in Ancoats in Manchester and a bomb, a stray bomb, was dropped and went into the garden</div><div id="00:00:34.160" class="transcript_line"> of their house and under the floor of the house and exploded. My grandmother and grandfather who were</div><div id="00:00:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Harriet and Edward Walton were killed outright. My aunt who was Miriam Walton and was about 18,</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> had the fire, she was sat by the fire, the fire blew out onto her and badly burned her from the</div><div id="00:01:04.600" class="transcript_line"> waist down. She survived two weeks in hospital. My dad, Edward Walton, he was mending his bike</div><div id="00:01:13.680" class="transcript_line"> and the bike fell on top of him and stopped the rubble from crushing him. He spent a good six</div><div id="00:01:20.960" class="transcript_line"> weeks in hospital and ever afterwards his toes were all crunched up because they&#039;d obviously been</div><div id="00:01:28.600" class="transcript_line"> affected by the rubble falling on him. He also, he then went to live with his grandmother,</div><div id="00:01:36.840" class="transcript_line"> his grandmother, so my great-grandma, who was Miriam Smith. She had been staying with the family</div><div id="00:01:44.360" class="transcript_line"> for a while but decided to move on because she felt it wasn&#039;t safe. How she managed that I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:51.160" class="transcript_line"> know. I did know Miriam, she was a very old lady when I knew her and she died when I was about six.</div><div id="00:02:01.480" class="transcript_line"> My father also then later on, he was a messenger for the fire service, for the firefighters at night,</div><div id="00:02:12.120" class="transcript_line"> so he rode his bike around Manchester delivering messages and things like that and he also worked</div><div id="00:02:19.480" class="transcript_line"> on the Lancaster bombers for Afros Hawker Sidley and he told us a story one day about</div><div id="00:02:29.320" class="transcript_line"> going up to Woodford aerodrome in Woodford, Cheshire and he was, they had to clean out the</div><div id="00:02:41.720" class="transcript_line"> remains of whatever was in the aircraft that had been attacked and had been brought back,</div><div id="00:02:48.760" class="transcript_line"> which was a horrible job for somebody of his age. He must have had really quite a traumatic time</div><div id="00:02:54.280" class="transcript_line"> during the war. He did. With both his parents being killed, his aunt being injured, he being injured</div><div id="00:02:59.640" class="transcript_line"> and then the job of clearing the bombers after they came back. Did he, at the end of the war,</div><div id="00:03:06.200" class="transcript_line"> did he talk about it to you? How do you know about it? No, he didn&#039;t. I then later on went to speak to</div><div id="00:03:15.080" class="transcript_line"> his uncle, who we called Uncle Fred because we lived with them for a while, and he said,</div><div id="00:03:23.480" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t mention this to your dad. So, and every time he watched the Royal Festival Halls of</div><div id="00:03:32.920" class="transcript_line"> Remembrance service, he would always get up and leave the room at some point. He was upset,</div><div id="00:03:39.960" class="transcript_line"> he was emotional about it. But this, when I said to my mum, I&#039;ve been told not to talk to dad about</div><div id="00:03:48.360" class="transcript_line"> it, she said, oh, it&#039;s all right, you won&#039;t mind. So that was how we came to get these stories about</div><div id="00:03:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Avros. He was also very angry about the Avros because they kept on apprentices and then once</div><div id="00:04:02.680" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d finished their apprenticeship, they sacked them and took on new apprentices, money-wise,</div><div id="00:04:08.920" class="transcript_line"> financial scheme for them. So he wasn&#039;t very pleased with them at all. So you were brought</div><div id="00:04:16.280" class="transcript_line"> up in a household where he was trying very hard, wasn&#039;t he, too, perhaps? Oh, yes, he was. Yes.</div><div id="00:04:22.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And it only appeared after he died that he actually couldn&#039;t read properly. So all that stuff</div><div id="00:04:31.400" class="transcript_line"> affected him really badly. If he needed to write anything, my mum had</div><div id="00:04:38.520" class="transcript_line"> write it for him and then he copied it out. He had lovely handwriting,</div><div id="00:04:42.840" class="transcript_line"> but he never read books. He was always... Such a complex life he must have led. Yes, very.</div><div id="00:04:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for sharing that with me. It&#039;s a lovely, sad story.</div><div id="00:04:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Thank you and I hope you enjoy the exhibition.</div></div></p>
