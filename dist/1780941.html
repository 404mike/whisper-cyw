    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m just switching this on now Sue, so this is running.</div><div id="00:00:04.320" class="transcript_line"> This is running.</div><div id="00:00:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Are you OK there?</div><div id="00:00:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Mm hmm.</div><div id="00:00:10.520" class="transcript_line"> It ended up though.</div><div id="00:00:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Erm, erm, yeah just talking about the erm, the, did you ever go fishing in the reens</div><div id="00:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> or anything like that?</div><div id="00:00:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:00:26.560" class="transcript_line"> From time, about four or five of you always had a jam jar with a string on it and went</div><div id="00:00:32.040" class="transcript_line"> for tadpoles because once the frogspawn was out, yes I used to do it with my children</div><div id="00:00:37.480" class="transcript_line"> and my grandchildren and er, yeah there were always things in the reen.</div><div id="00:00:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And here, er David growing up, they had flatfish, they had eels, er they even caught place in</div><div id="00:00:50.600" class="transcript_line"> the stream, amongst itch and children used to come out of town to fish on our bridges</div><div id="00:00:58.400" class="transcript_line"> and oh yeah, it was quite the thing.</div><div id="00:01:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So you, you, as a young girl, you know entering your teenage years, I&#039;ve heard that erm,</div><div id="00:01:10.800" class="transcript_line"> the young farmers clubs around here was erm, like a marriage bureau in many ways.</div><div id="00:01:16.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;re all guilty of using it.</div><div id="00:01:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s very quiet.</div><div id="00:01:21.960" class="transcript_line"> What did you do as a teenager here?</div><div id="00:01:23.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean where was the focus?</div><div id="00:01:25.480" class="transcript_line"> Was it Newport?</div><div id="00:01:26.480" class="transcript_line"> Was it Chepstow?</div><div id="00:01:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Was it Nash?</div><div id="00:01:28.480" class="transcript_line"> No, erm, you see there wasn&#039;t a local young farmers club.</div><div id="00:01:33.640" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go into Newport to join the Beyslic and Hentless young farmers club and erm, we depended</div><div id="00:01:42.560" class="transcript_line"> on erm, David&#039;s cousins who had vehicles, er, who were quite a bit older than me and</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> they would take us.</div><div id="00:01:53.400" class="transcript_line"> The only other club was Maga and there was no way of getting there.</div><div id="00:01:56.880" class="transcript_line"> David, my husband, belonged to Maga.</div><div id="00:02:00.840" class="transcript_line"> And I spoke our lives to really, erm, we went to, erm, to Trudiga House to the convent to</div><div id="00:02:08.120" class="transcript_line"> And all our friends there were farmers daughters, so we would join young farmers and still be</div><div id="00:02:16.440" class="transcript_line"> all together.</div><div id="00:02:18.440" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, 70 years later we&#039;re all still together.</div><div id="00:02:22.800" class="transcript_line"> Same girls we were at school with, young farmers and all our lives.</div><div id="00:02:27.760" class="transcript_line"> So yes, it was erm, it got us out.</div><div id="00:02:32.640" class="transcript_line"> We took part in competitions all over the county, erm, there were the rallies, there</div><div id="00:02:37.880" class="transcript_line"> was drama, erm, public speaking quizzes and then you got to know young farmers from all</div><div id="00:02:47.520" class="transcript_line"> over Monmouthshire.</div><div id="00:02:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Erm, and there was always a dance every week somewhere or other.</div><div id="00:02:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Only this week there was a picture of the ballroom in the Westgate Hotel in Newport</div><div id="00:03:03.720" class="transcript_line"> and David and I were looking at it and saying, we went to balls there in our black ties and</div><div id="00:03:08.960" class="transcript_line"> sequin dresses and, erm, it was a wonderful organisation.</div><div id="00:03:17.200" class="transcript_line"> We went to hunt balls at the King&#039;s Head Hotel in Newport.</div><div id="00:03:21.720" class="transcript_line"> In those days when everything was, I suppose, totally different as we know it now, as a</div><div id="00:03:29.760" class="transcript_line"> child, erm, you see in 1950, oh, 53, 54, they decided to send the children from Nash School</div><div id="00:03:47.840" class="transcript_line"> to a newly opened Langstone Primary School.</div><div id="00:03:52.400" class="transcript_line"> So I was nine at the time and I was sent, and we were picked up by bus in the village,</div><div id="00:03:59.360" class="transcript_line"> all of us children at that age, sent to Langstone School.</div><div id="00:04:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, we started making friends over there and most of those were rural families.</div><div id="00:04:09.160" class="transcript_line"> So you got to know people there and I even moved on to the convent with one friend.</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Erm, so it just seemed quite a small, although it was a large area physically, it didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:04:27.120" class="transcript_line"> appear to be to us as children because our parents knew most of the farming families</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and we were all drawn in together and young farmers just seemed to be a culmination of</div><div id="00:04:39.600" class="transcript_line"> us all still being together.</div><div id="00:04:44.760" class="transcript_line"> And yes, I met David there at Magy Young Farmers, we had a, there was a dance, I believe</div><div id="00:04:51.120" class="transcript_line"> it was Redwick Hall when I first met him, and although we lived in the same villages,</div><div id="00:04:58.400" class="transcript_line"> Nash never seemed to come to Whitsun and Goldcliffe and vice versa.</div><div id="00:05:03.120" class="transcript_line"> You see, we had our own vicar at Nash and Whitsun and Goldcliffe had their vicar who</div><div id="00:05:07.840" class="transcript_line"> lived in the vicarage here and it wasn&#039;t until 1953 that Nash was taken in.</div><div id="00:05:16.800" class="transcript_line"> Excuse the phone, it&#039;s just ringing.</div><div id="00:05:23.280" class="transcript_line"> So yes, and then things changed because the churches were brought together, people, we</div><div id="00:05:32.240" class="transcript_line"> formed social committees and so forth.</div><div id="00:05:35.680" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t know him even though we only lived three miles apart.</div><div id="00:05:43.320" class="transcript_line"> So it just didn&#039;t really mix with the other villages on the levels?</div><div id="00:05:46.920" class="transcript_line"> So you were saying for Redwick as well?</div><div id="00:05:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Well yes, we had family out in Redwick and we would, you see, only my father and Donald</div><div id="00:06:00.240" class="transcript_line"> and Dorothy Waters had a car in our village in Nash, they were only two cars.</div><div id="00:06:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Well you can&#039;t imagine life like that.</div><div id="00:06:09.360" class="transcript_line"> And yes, so people didn&#039;t drive around the villages.</div><div id="00:06:15.160" class="transcript_line"> So you said you had to finish policemen, did you have a, I&#039;d like to know a bit more about</div><div id="00:06:21.760" class="transcript_line"> him, did you have a Finnish midwife?</div><div id="00:06:24.160" class="transcript_line"> No, no, but we had a lady who was a district nurse, not for this area, we had two in the</div><div id="00:06:32.480" class="transcript_line"> village, one on Broad Street Common, Nurse Griffiths, and one at Burned House in Nash,</div><div id="00:06:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Margaret Waters, but she was a district nurse in another area.</div><div id="00:06:48.720" class="transcript_line"> But there was a story that when Nurse Griffiths, when David was born, it was the winter of 1939</div><div id="00:06:57.520" class="transcript_line"> and it was one of the coldest winters apparently, and when he was born his mother brought him</div><div id="00:07:06.960" class="transcript_line"> home from the nursing home and he was very sickly and they didn&#039;t quite know what to do.</div><div id="00:07:12.240" class="transcript_line"> So Nurse Griffiths, now there were no cars, there was nothing, Nurse Griffiths came over</div><div id="00:07:20.160" class="transcript_line"> and they would have walked across fields in those days and she said to my mother and father</div><div id="00:07:26.240" class="transcript_line"> in law, you give me the baby, you bring him down, I&#039;ll look after him, otherwise he&#039;ll</div><div id="00:07:35.200" class="transcript_line"> die.</div><div id="00:07:37.520" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what happened and she kept him for several weeks and kept him alive.</div><div id="00:07:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t quite know what was wrong and every night David&#039;s father, after he had milked,</div><div id="00:07:48.920" class="transcript_line"> put a sack around himself and he&#039;d walk down to the common, which would be a little way</div><div id="00:07:56.840" class="transcript_line"> across the fields or round the road, whichever, and he said that he could hear the icicles</div><div id="00:08:04.920" class="transcript_line"> banging on the trees.</div><div id="00:08:08.920" class="transcript_line"> Anyway a couple of weeks later they brought the baby back.</div><div id="00:08:12.720" class="transcript_line"> So that was one experience that we know of where a district nurse kept her eye on everything.</div><div id="00:08:21.480" class="transcript_line"> But I remember my mother in law saying before her time even, they always had a midwife or</div><div id="00:08:27.960" class="transcript_line"> nurse to come and live in the farmhouses when the baby was due.</div><div id="00:08:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:08:34.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:35.120" class="transcript_line"> She remembers her mother having for her siblings and obviously could remember being told all</div><div id="00:08:43.320" class="transcript_line"> that, told me.</div><div id="00:08:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:08:46.320" class="transcript_line"> So you said you went to the convent in Tredegar.</div><div id="00:08:49.520" class="transcript_line"> House, yes.</div><div id="00:08:50.520" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m imagining it was a Catholic convent.</div><div id="00:08:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:54.520" class="transcript_line"> So are you a Catholic?</div><div id="00:08:56.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:08:57.520" class="transcript_line"> So why would you have gone there?</div><div id="00:09:01.680" class="transcript_line"> In those days we had a system of you had to pass your 11 plus exam to go to a grammar</div><div id="00:09:06.320" class="transcript_line"> school.</div><div id="00:09:07.560" class="transcript_line"> If you didn&#039;t you went to a secondary modern school.</div><div id="00:09:11.640" class="transcript_line"> And I guess my parents felt it might benefit me not going to a secondary school.</div><div id="00:09:19.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was a fee-paying school.</div><div id="00:09:22.960" class="transcript_line"> It was private.</div><div id="00:09:25.480" class="transcript_line"> They had a system that they would take Catholic children if they passed the 11 plus without</div><div id="00:09:31.080" class="transcript_line"> fees.</div><div id="00:09:32.960" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of families had the chance to go there who couldn&#039;t probably afford it otherwise.</div><div id="00:09:40.760" class="transcript_line"> I passed the entrance exam to go.</div><div id="00:09:42.840" class="transcript_line"> My father paid the fees.</div><div id="00:09:45.120" class="transcript_line"> I went along with, as I say, quite a few other farmers&#039; daughters.</div><div id="00:09:49.960" class="transcript_line"> If you weren&#039;t clever that&#039;s what you did.</div><div id="00:09:54.640" class="transcript_line"> So what was it like?</div><div id="00:09:55.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh absolutely, absolutely brilliant.</div><div id="00:09:58.520" class="transcript_line"> Looking back how lucky we were.</div><div id="00:10:01.600" class="transcript_line"> There were only three, just under 300 children altogether.</div><div id="00:10:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever been to Tredegar House, the National Trust place now.</div><div id="00:10:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Most of the school was open, all the rooms, I mean they&#039;ve closed a lot off and you don&#039;t</div><div id="00:10:16.360" class="transcript_line"> see those these days.</div><div id="00:10:18.640" class="transcript_line"> But there were borders there.</div><div id="00:10:20.320" class="transcript_line"> I think there must have been 40 or 50 borders.</div><div id="00:10:23.440" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have service families sending their children there from abroad or, well they were</div><div id="00:10:29.120" class="transcript_line"> out in services.</div><div id="00:10:32.440" class="transcript_line"> And yes it&#039;s hard to describe.</div><div id="00:10:38.960" class="transcript_line"> The rooms were as they are.</div><div id="00:10:43.160" class="transcript_line"> They were in good condition and the nuns took it over.</div><div id="00:10:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a uniform?</div><div id="00:10:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:51.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, navy blue and blue, dark blue.</div><div id="00:10:57.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not long ago I gave my school scarf to the exhibition in the house.</div><div id="00:11:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:11:02.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, us old girls put an exhibition on in one of the classrooms of life as it was when</div><div id="00:11:09.160" class="transcript_line"> we were there.</div><div id="00:11:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had nuns for most of the lessons but there were other teachers there besides.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing we couldn&#039;t do.</div><div id="00:11:20.440" class="transcript_line"> We had tennis courts, hockey pitches.</div><div id="00:11:24.840" class="transcript_line"> We used to have art classes in the gardens in the summer.</div><div id="00:11:27.920" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d sit on the wall by the lake and draw the lilies or sit in the garden and draw Sir</div><div id="00:11:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Briggs&#039; memorial.</div><div id="00:11:37.240" class="transcript_line"> The Orangery as they call it now was our gym.</div><div id="00:11:41.520" class="transcript_line"> The gilt room was our art room.</div><div id="00:11:46.360" class="transcript_line"> All the nuns were pretty nice.</div><div id="00:11:48.680" class="transcript_line"> We had one or two that perhaps weren&#039;t so kind.</div><div id="00:11:54.080" class="transcript_line"> We had the brown room where all the carvings were.</div><div id="00:11:56.920" class="transcript_line"> We were told at the time it was by Gryndle and Gibbons but they say it might have been</div><div id="00:12:01.320" class="transcript_line"> his school but not him.</div><div id="00:12:03.360" class="transcript_line"> That was our music room and we had several grand pianos in there.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We would have music every week, theory of music.</div><div id="00:12:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful library underneath the stairs.</div><div id="00:12:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Which is no...</div><div id="00:12:18.080" class="transcript_line"> So why you received your schooling there?</div><div id="00:12:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you also schooled in the connections of Tredegar House and the estate with the</div><div id="00:12:28.440" class="transcript_line"> levels or was that something you learned after?</div><div id="00:12:32.360" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we grew up knowing that most of the farms in this area were owned by the Tredegar</div><div id="00:12:36.280" class="transcript_line"> estate and it was in the 50s that they had to sell them off because of what Evan had</div><div id="00:12:41.680" class="transcript_line"> done with the money and all the farmers round and about bought them at a very reasonable</div><div id="00:12:49.480" class="transcript_line"> price I understand.</div><div id="00:12:52.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think the nuns went into any great detail about it.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I do remember and I&#039;ve said this to some of the guides and I&#039;m not sure they believe me</div><div id="00:13:04.960" class="transcript_line"> that I remember in the late 50s Olga, the French countess, coming to the school.</div><div id="00:13:17.680" class="transcript_line"> We were told to be on good behaviour and she came in a car, a chauffeur driven car, very</div><div id="00:13:25.440" class="transcript_line"> tall elegant woman and I often wondered if I dreamt it because nobody else seems to remember.</div><div id="00:13:33.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m curious.</div><div id="00:13:36.080" class="transcript_line"> But I remember her coming up the steps you see into the front hall, whether I happened</div><div id="00:13:40.200" class="transcript_line"> to be in the vicinity at the time I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:13:45.800" class="transcript_line"> But as you come into the house and you&#039;ve got this big hall that was where we had our</div><div id="00:13:50.720" class="transcript_line"> assembly every day and Sister St. Brendan would stand on a big tall seat so she could</div><div id="00:13:57.640" class="transcript_line"> see over the top of us and we&#039;d sing all the Catholic hymns before we went into our classes</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and have prayers and pray for everybody that needed help or you know prayers for that morning</div><div id="00:14:10.960" class="transcript_line"> and we would disperse to our classrooms and before every lesson we said Hail Mary.</div><div id="00:14:18.640" class="transcript_line"> I can recite it now as quick as lightning.</div><div id="00:14:23.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:14:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what order they were, the nuns?</div><div id="00:14:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, St. Joseph&#039;s.</div><div id="00:14:29.280" class="transcript_line"> St. Joseph&#039;s?</div><div id="00:14:30.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes because as it happened during that period my grandma owned Tearshift Farm which is the</div><div id="00:14:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Abbey Farm belonging to St. Joseph&#039;s at Lentarnham.</div><div id="00:14:46.920" class="transcript_line"> And our farm was on the same drive as theirs and when I was a little girl I spent all my</div><div id="00:14:52.160" class="transcript_line"> summers back and forth with my grandmothers and then of course when I went to the convent</div><div id="00:14:57.880" class="transcript_line"> they used our butcher shop for their all-in-meat because we were right against them.</div><div id="00:15:03.440" class="transcript_line"> So yes and I had a cousin who was head girl when I started the convent and she became</div><div id="00:15:10.400" class="transcript_line"> a nun there.</div><div id="00:15:11.800" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:15:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:15:14.800" class="transcript_line"> So yes, St. Joseph&#039;s.</div><div id="00:15:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And of course they opened a nursing home there at Lentarnham and at that time my mother had</div><div id="00:15:26.560" class="transcript_line"> poor health and she used the nursing home quite frequently so I got to know the nuns</div><div id="00:15:32.280" class="transcript_line"> over there quite well.</div><div id="00:15:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:15:34.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:35.280" class="transcript_line"> So presumably when you were going there were you going by bus or bike?</div><div id="00:15:39.480" class="transcript_line"> To the convent?</div><div id="00:15:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:41.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes we&#039;d catch the bus at Nash Arch just after eight o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:15:47.640" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d get into Newport and the bus station was in the centre opposite the market in those</div><div id="00:15:52.520" class="transcript_line"> days and we had three double-deckers all lined up with our name on it which we got on and</div><div id="00:16:01.440" class="transcript_line"> went to school and they parked in the driveway, not the front drive where the lodges are,</div><div id="00:16:09.200" class="transcript_line"> and we had a back drive and the buses pulled in and we would have to walk the whole end</div><div id="00:16:14.520" class="transcript_line"> of that drive to school then, no matter what the weather was like.</div><div id="00:16:19.360" class="transcript_line"> And I do remember once it had all been flooded that both lakes came over, the Red Lake and</div><div id="00:16:24.240" class="transcript_line"> the Big Lake, they met in the middle and we all had to walk through it.</div><div id="00:16:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember that.</div><div id="00:16:31.400" class="transcript_line"> So we started school then at twenty to ten, so it took us from, I don&#039;t know, twenty</div><div id="00:16:39.480" class="transcript_line"> to nine to twenty to ten to get from there and walk and assemble.</div><div id="00:16:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:45.400" class="transcript_line"> So, and then the same thing, we finished school at quarter to four, got back into Newport</div><div id="00:16:50.760" class="transcript_line"> about half past four after you.</div><div id="00:16:52.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes to walk up the drive.</div><div id="00:16:55.960" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s quite a bit, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but it was, I suppose at the time we probably didn&#039;t enjoy school that much, but</div><div id="00:17:08.240" class="transcript_line"> it depended how good you were at things.</div><div id="00:17:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Looking back, I think we were very privileged, very privileged.</div><div id="00:17:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, as a child growing up in Nash, were you, do you remember what the wildlife</div><div id="00:17:23.080" class="transcript_line"> was like or were you aware of wildlife?</div><div id="00:17:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, very much so.</div><div id="00:17:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because, you know, it was all under the, you know, under the farmer&#039;s jurisdiction,</div><div id="00:17:37.560" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:17:38.560" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t have nitrogen and fertilizers and such.</div><div id="00:17:43.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember, perhaps, we didn&#039;t have rabbits in the village, you see, whereas now we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:17:52.760" class="transcript_line"> got some leopards outside the door virtually every morning.</div><div id="00:17:56.200" class="transcript_line"> My daughter sees them feeding.</div><div id="00:17:58.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a lot more wildlife here than there used to be when we were farming intensively.</div><div id="00:18:06.120" class="transcript_line"> But as a child, yes, we used to go looking for bird&#039;s nests.</div><div id="00:18:14.520" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t used to take the eggs, but we knew where all the bird&#039;s nests were.</div><div id="00:18:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And if you were down the field, there&#039;d be wasps and bees&#039; nests and we had adders.</div><div id="00:18:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And my father used to, we had long grass in one of the orchards.</div><div id="00:18:32.080" class="transcript_line"> Father used to say, now don&#039;t you go down there, the snakes will bite you.</div><div id="00:18:35.880" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t used to listen.</div><div id="00:18:37.800" class="transcript_line"> So we got up one Sunday morning and there was this adder.</div><div id="00:18:41.560" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d, obviously it had been killed or dead or some reason or other, and he&#039;d wormed</div><div id="00:18:47.280" class="transcript_line"> it round the plum tree as a warning to us.</div><div id="00:18:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:18:50.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:53.960" class="transcript_line"> But mind you, I&#039;m never quite sure if it was a real adder or whether it was a grass snake</div><div id="00:18:58.120" class="transcript_line"> because we couldn&#039;t tell the difference as kids.</div><div id="00:19:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, owls, you always had owls hooting.</div><div id="00:19:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can&#039;t explain really.</div><div id="00:19:11.400" class="transcript_line"> But you were always aware of it.</div><div id="00:19:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever do things like fruit picking or...</div><div id="00:19:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:21.160" class="transcript_line"> ...things like that?</div><div id="00:19:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, when they were building the power station, we had this couple of orchards on the farm.</div><div id="00:19:30.400" class="transcript_line"> So my brother and I would pick all the plums and we&#039;d set a stall up on the road outside</div><div id="00:19:36.240" class="transcript_line"> the, what you call it, the hedge.</div><div id="00:19:42.320" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d put plums, tuppence a pound, and we&#039;d sell every plum we could get.</div><div id="00:19:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:19:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:19:50.280" class="transcript_line"> It was brilliant.</div><div id="00:19:51.280" class="transcript_line"> How lovely.</div><div id="00:19:52.280" class="transcript_line"> You know, tuppence in those days was quite a lot for children.</div><div id="00:19:54.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:55.280" class="transcript_line"> And then in the autumn I used to pick loads of blackberries and we&#039;d take them into the</div><div id="00:20:01.120" class="transcript_line"> butcher shop and they&#039;d sell them for me.</div><div id="00:20:03.920" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:20:04.920" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d get sixpence a pound.</div><div id="00:20:05.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, the butcher shop in Newport.</div><div id="00:20:08.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:09.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you did things like that and all local farmers would sell their apples.</div><div id="00:20:15.880" class="transcript_line"> You could only keep so many.</div><div id="00:20:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Did your farm make cider or anything like that?</div><div id="00:20:22.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:23.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:24.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:25.600" class="transcript_line"> Quite a few of the Waters family used to make cider.</div><div id="00:20:29.160" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:20:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s lots of stories about the cider.</div><div id="00:20:34.880" class="transcript_line"> For another day perhaps.</div><div id="00:20:35.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:20:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:39.880" class="transcript_line"> Because you see it was such an industry down here.</div><div id="00:20:42.720" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean cider?</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Cider, the villages were plastered with orchards all along the Severn.</div><div id="00:20:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:52.120" class="transcript_line"> And cider was a, you see, when you had men working for you back in the 1900s, you paid</div><div id="00:21:01.360" class="transcript_line"> them with cider and bread and cheese.</div><div id="00:21:04.040" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t expect wages, a lot of them, if they just had food and shelter.</div><div id="00:21:09.840" class="transcript_line"> So cider was the drink.</div><div id="00:21:11.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you&#039;ve got to imagine now there was no fresh water going back in the 1800s, haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:16.520" class="transcript_line"> you?</div><div id="00:21:17.520" class="transcript_line"> And everything was ale and cider.</div><div id="00:21:19.840" class="transcript_line"> And I assume that&#039;s why all the orchards were.</div><div id="00:21:22.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we had an orchard full of peri-pears.</div><div id="00:21:25.200" class="transcript_line"> So they were obviously making the peri-drink or the champagne or whatever they used them</div><div id="00:21:29.560" class="transcript_line"> for.</div><div id="00:21:30.560" class="transcript_line"> So lots of the orchards have gone?</div><div id="00:21:33.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:21:34.880" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this, where you&#039;ve parked the car, opposite there&#039;s a big tract of land.</div><div id="00:21:39.640" class="transcript_line"> When I came here, that was a huge orchard, it&#039;s an acre and a half almost.</div><div id="00:21:47.160" class="transcript_line"> And the cows ruined that.</div><div id="00:21:49.880" class="transcript_line"> And we had four orchards here, all quite large.</div><div id="00:21:53.080" class="transcript_line"> So we had a couple of acres.</div><div id="00:21:55.200" class="transcript_line"> And did you have a press here?</div><div id="00:21:56.920" class="transcript_line"> Cider press?</div><div id="00:21:57.920" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:21:59.080" class="transcript_line"> They used to, you see this cider press of Duthies used to travel around the village</div><div id="00:22:04.520" class="transcript_line"> and do it.</div><div id="00:22:06.640" class="transcript_line"> After that, when tractors and trailers came into being, they used to take them up to us</div><div id="00:22:11.400" class="transcript_line"> college and have the cider pressed up there.</div><div id="00:22:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:22:16.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:17.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not aware of anybody having a stone cider press in this area, except the one at Redwick</div><div id="00:22:23.880" class="transcript_line"> in the, that Hubert Jones renovated.</div><div id="00:22:29.400" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve got a mill wheel in the back garden.</div><div id="00:22:34.960" class="transcript_line"> And that obviously from a local mill, I would think.</div><div id="00:22:39.040" class="transcript_line"> But no, everybody had cellars with their cider barrels in them.</div><div id="00:22:43.440" class="transcript_line"> I can remember as a child.</div><div id="00:22:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:22:46.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever try it?</div><div id="00:22:50.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:51.440" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t meant to, but you did.</div><div id="00:22:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Elizabeth, my friend, we&#039;d be sent down the cellar.</div><div id="00:22:59.160" class="transcript_line"> And these cellars were above ground mined.</div><div id="00:23:01.280" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be sent and they built onto the house.</div><div id="00:23:04.240" class="transcript_line"> We were sent down the cellar to collect the cider for supper.</div><div id="00:23:08.840" class="transcript_line"> In what?</div><div id="00:23:09.840" class="transcript_line"> What would you collect?</div><div id="00:23:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Jugs.</div><div id="00:23:11.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d take a jug and they&#039;d have a tap on the barrels.</div><div id="00:23:15.960" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, you&#039;d have a little sample before you got to the back of the house.</div><div id="00:23:20.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a horrible mind when you&#039;re a child.</div><div id="00:23:22.400" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t enjoy it.</div><div id="00:23:23.400" class="transcript_line"> So that was normal.</div><div id="00:23:24.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:23:25.400" class="transcript_line"> Cider with supper.</div><div id="00:23:26.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:23:27.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:28.400" class="transcript_line"> I can remember going to houses and having cider with supper.</div><div id="00:23:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:23:33.400" class="transcript_line"> And what, are there any other cider stories you alluded to that?</div><div id="00:23:39.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, you see, you always sort of gave the men cider.</div><div id="00:23:46.400" class="transcript_line"> I remember my mother, when we were children, and you&#039;d always have a lot of people come</div><div id="00:23:51.800" class="transcript_line"> for haymaking look.</div><div id="00:23:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Every farmer did.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And she would have, we had what we called the tea basket.</div><div id="00:23:58.720" class="transcript_line"> And it was like this, really big.</div><div id="00:24:02.360" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d fill it with food.</div><div id="00:24:04.520" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d have cider or something to take down for them to drink with it.</div><div id="00:24:10.400" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have orange squash in those days.</div><div id="00:24:11.920" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have pop, nothing.</div><div id="00:24:14.200" class="transcript_line"> And it was difficult taking tea because you didn&#039;t even have flasks, probably.</div><div id="00:24:18.360" class="transcript_line"> So cider was the answer to everybody&#039;s needs.</div><div id="00:24:23.080" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d walk down the fields.</div><div id="00:24:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose we used to have to help her carry things that she didn&#039;t want on her arm.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you have much, I know we talked about this earlier, but so you growing up and living</div><div id="00:24:43.720" class="transcript_line"> on the levels or the moors, what&#039;s special about it?</div><div id="00:24:50.440" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s different about it to somebody who&#039;s not from the area?</div><div id="00:24:54.040" class="transcript_line"> What could you say?</div><div id="00:24:55.800" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:24:57.720" class="transcript_line"> That what you could say specifically.</div><div id="00:25:01.600" class="transcript_line"> I used to spend a lot of time with my friends at their farms as I was growing up in my teens</div><div id="00:25:07.560" class="transcript_line"> now, late teens, mid teens.</div><div id="00:25:12.760" class="transcript_line"> And it would be very difficult to pinpoint.</div><div id="00:25:17.440" class="transcript_line"> If you lived in a village, a village life was different, wasn&#039;t it, to living in a town.</div><div id="00:25:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we took everything for granted, you see, living on the levels.</div><div id="00:25:31.640" class="transcript_line"> That was just where you were.</div><div id="00:25:34.320" class="transcript_line"> I found it very funny because my friend lived at Deustoe House in Caldecott.</div><div id="00:25:41.640" class="transcript_line"> When I went up there, I was constantly ploughing up hills.</div><div id="00:25:44.800" class="transcript_line"> I used to think, oh, this is not so easy as living on the levels.</div><div id="00:25:52.120" class="transcript_line"> So I do remember that.</div><div id="00:25:54.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s funny.</div><div id="00:25:56.560" class="transcript_line"> And they had a lot more trees up there.</div><div id="00:26:01.520" class="transcript_line"> I think there weren&#039;t that many trees down here of various varieties.</div><div id="00:26:07.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, there was ash everywhere.</div><div id="00:26:09.760" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where, as you know, Nash got its name from.</div><div id="00:26:12.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I...</div><div id="00:26:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Was the ash used for anything in particular?</div><div id="00:26:21.280" class="transcript_line"> Was it a crop in any way?</div><div id="00:26:23.760" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve read where they used to feed the cattle in the winter, holly and ash.</div><div id="00:26:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But I suppose there would still be the ash keys still on the trees in the winter.</div><div id="00:26:39.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t...</div><div id="00:26:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Not specifically.</div><div id="00:26:44.720" class="transcript_line"> It was just the grove of ash trees, wasn&#039;t it, Nash, was?</div><div id="00:26:49.080" class="transcript_line"> So on your land, say, now, when they was a child, would you know what reams and water</div><div id="00:26:54.560" class="transcript_line"> courses run through your land?</div><div id="00:26:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Would you know the names of them?</div><div id="00:26:57.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:26:59.600" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I&#039;ve mapped most of the area with the reams, marked on them.</div><div id="00:27:07.400" class="transcript_line"> For future generations, that is, who...</div><div id="00:27:10.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one thing looking at a big map where you can barely read what&#039;s on there.</div><div id="00:27:15.960" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve detailed absolutely everything.</div><div id="00:27:18.040" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m in the process of...</div><div id="00:27:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there are dozens to do, and I&#039;ve only done perhaps four or five.</div><div id="00:27:25.360" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s still in the process.</div><div id="00:27:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Of the whole area?</div><div id="00:27:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, Goldcliff, Whitsun and parts of Nash.</div><div id="00:27:33.480" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:27:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Has there been any surprises for you?</div><div id="00:27:37.080" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any favourites, any names you like?</div><div id="00:27:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Um, they all...</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a reason why they&#039;re all called what they are, like Monkscroft just above us.</div><div id="00:27:49.080" class="transcript_line"> And Windmill Ream, as you can imagine.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I know Tony Pickup said something to me about Windmill Ream, and I said, which one do you mean?</div><div id="00:27:58.480" class="transcript_line"> Because there are several, you see.</div><div id="00:28:00.920" class="transcript_line"> All close to where the windmills were originally.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Elver Pill, a lot of them are self-explanatory.</div><div id="00:28:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Ah...</div><div id="00:28:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when you&#039;re farming, you see, you&#039;ve got to be able to know the names,</div><div id="00:28:16.880" class="transcript_line"> so that when you&#039;re talking to the drainage or the riverborders, as it once was,</div><div id="00:28:21.240" class="transcript_line"> you can tell them the name of the ream that you want cast, or something done to it.</div><div id="00:28:28.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no good just saying, I want that ream down there.</div><div id="00:28:31.960" class="transcript_line"> And do you know where the water runs, which direction it goes?</div><div id="00:28:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:28:36.480" class="transcript_line"> Like Parish Ream goes basically right round the parish.</div><div id="00:28:40.320" class="transcript_line"> And then we know where the outlets are, the gouts,</div><div id="00:28:46.280" class="transcript_line"> all the things that farmers should know,</div><div id="00:28:50.160" class="transcript_line"> where the intake of water comes out of the pill into our farm,</div><div id="00:28:54.600" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got sluices, and we know if we need to cast a ream,</div><div id="00:29:00.080" class="transcript_line"> the water isn&#039;t getting down to a certain part of the farm.</div><div id="00:29:03.040" class="transcript_line"> When you say cast a ream, what do you mean?</div><div id="00:29:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, clean it out.</div><div id="00:29:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, OK.</div><div id="00:29:07.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:08.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember most of my younger life, before they had the ditches and machinery,</div><div id="00:29:17.240" class="transcript_line"> there were a couple of old gentlemen who used to clean the reams out</div><div id="00:29:21.200" class="transcript_line"> with their billocks and their various named instruments,</div><div id="00:29:28.080" class="transcript_line"> and they spent the entire summer doing that, well, under winter,</div><div id="00:29:32.040" class="transcript_line"> but you saw the difference in the summer.</div><div id="00:29:34.040" class="transcript_line"> I can see them out here now.</div><div id="00:29:35.520" class="transcript_line"> You can?</div><div id="00:29:37.080" class="transcript_line"> And they cut my Witson boss tree off one year and I was very cross.</div><div id="00:29:42.080" class="transcript_line"> Bill England, Alv Stevens, oh, Hubert Jones was another one,</div><div id="00:29:49.360" class="transcript_line"> and they would keep those reams as clear,</div><div id="00:29:54.080" class="transcript_line"> far better than they do with the machinery today.</div><div id="00:29:57.400" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s...</div><div id="00:29:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Who were they paid by?</div><div id="00:29:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Were they paid by...?</div><div id="00:30:00.680" class="transcript_line"> It was the river board in those days.</div><div id="00:30:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we pay a levy, you see.</div><div id="00:30:07.840" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve just paid about £280 for natural resource whales now, it is,</div><div id="00:30:17.120" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s towards maintenance of our drainage system.</div><div id="00:30:23.560" class="transcript_line"> So, if they&#039;re managing that for you as farmers,</div><div id="00:30:27.400" class="transcript_line"> do you still have to keep an eye on it?</div><div id="00:30:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, because last year, for instance,</div><div id="00:30:32.720" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got a main ring called Wainbridge ring going right up through our farm.</div><div id="00:30:38.040" class="transcript_line"> They come with the ditcher, they cast it,</div><div id="00:30:43.520" class="transcript_line"> so then you&#039;ve got, oh, 20, at least 20, 25 feet of spoil all over your grass,</div><div id="00:30:53.560" class="transcript_line"> just when you want to make silage or hay.</div><div id="00:30:57.400" class="transcript_line"> And that, if you take it right through the farm, adds up to several acres.</div><div id="00:31:02.280" class="transcript_line"> They go away, and we then have to get somebody to spread it, which costs.</div><div id="00:31:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Then you have to...</div><div id="00:31:11.600" class="transcript_line"> This year, our tractor went on fire.</div><div id="00:31:14.800" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t do what we normally do by rotivating it and breaking it down</div><div id="00:31:23.560" class="transcript_line"> and sowing the grass.</div><div id="00:31:25.080" class="transcript_line"> So we then have to pay for all that.</div><div id="00:31:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And this happens every other year that some ream or ditch needs to be done out,</div><div id="00:31:33.680" class="transcript_line"> and we have to bear the cost of it.</div><div id="00:31:35.600" class="transcript_line"> So they all, of the maintenance then, they pay for the ditcher to clean it out.</div><div id="00:31:42.080" class="transcript_line"> After that, it&#039;s our problem.</div><div id="00:31:44.200" class="transcript_line"> So when it was the internal drainage board, did a farmer have more of a voice?</div><div id="00:31:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, because the farmers were on there to represent the farmers.</div><div id="00:31:53.760" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:31:54.520" class="transcript_line"> And they knew exactly what should be done and how it should be done.</div><div id="00:31:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Since then, we have people who have no knowledge of our area.</div><div id="00:32:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:03.280" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t understand what we&#039;re talking about.</div><div id="00:32:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re having to put up with what we consider may eventually end up with floods,</div><div id="00:32:13.160" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;re not taking any notice of the farmers.</div><div id="00:32:16.520" class="transcript_line"> So even though there is an advisory board now, that doesn&#039;t have as much...</div><div id="00:32:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Cloud, no, no.</div><div id="00:32:22.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Neville Water was... our cousin was on it.</div><div id="00:32:26.840" class="transcript_line"> And whilst he was on it, we knew that things were done according to spec as they should be.</div><div id="00:32:35.400" class="transcript_line"> And then when you lose people like that, who&#039;ve also passed this knowledge down to others,</div><div id="00:32:42.960" class="transcript_line"> when you lose that, yeah, I think it&#039;s the end of an era personally.</div><div id="00:32:48.800" class="transcript_line"> See, that&#039;s what interests me, is this knowledge that&#039;s embedded within...</div><div id="00:32:55.160" class="transcript_line"> The local community, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:32:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Because this whole water network is so curious to me that...</div><div id="00:33:05.160" class="transcript_line"> How do you pass that knowledge on?</div><div id="00:33:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, this is the sad part about it, because we had no sons.</div><div id="00:33:11.920" class="transcript_line"> And our daughters don&#039;t know what we know.</div><div id="00:33:15.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s never interested them.</div><div id="00:33:18.160" class="transcript_line"> I shall leave my maps, and I hope one day they may be interested to look at them.</div><div id="00:33:24.800" class="transcript_line"> But I wasn&#039;t interested until latter years, I guess.</div><div id="00:33:30.640" class="transcript_line"> And suddenly you think, oh, well, we&#039;ve told them where the feeding areas are,</div><div id="00:33:35.640" class="transcript_line"> and they must make sure how to feed the land from the pill.</div><div id="00:33:42.040" class="transcript_line"> Rick Turner was amazed when we showed him our noggle.</div><div id="00:33:47.120" class="transcript_line"> A noggle, it&#039;s a key we turn to let the water in from the pill to feed our farm.</div><div id="00:33:54.400" class="transcript_line"> Because if you don&#039;t turn it on here, on our bridge, there&#039;s hundreds of acres it feeds.</div><div id="00:34:02.160" class="transcript_line"> So you have to be so acutely aware of the conditions.</div><div id="00:34:05.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so if we don&#039;t teach our girls after our days,</div><div id="00:34:09.720" class="transcript_line"> they won&#039;t be able to tell anybody else, will they?</div><div id="00:34:13.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what&#039;s so special about this area, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:34:16.160" class="transcript_line"> This part of its specialness is this water drainage system.</div><div id="00:34:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:34:21.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very...</div><div id="00:34:23.560" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it would be terribly complicated for a new person moving in, needing to know.</div><div id="00:34:29.200" class="transcript_line"> But you see, most of these farms are passed down.</div><div id="00:34:32.560" class="transcript_line"> People don&#039;t come in and buy these farms.</div><div id="00:34:35.240" class="transcript_line"> They just keep going.</div><div id="00:34:37.360" class="transcript_line"> So would you say most of the farms are several generations strong?</div><div id="00:34:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:34:43.400" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of any that aren&#039;t, really.</div><div id="00:34:46.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you get people who come in and buy a few acres, perhaps 12 acres with a house.</div><div id="00:34:50.800" class="transcript_line"> That doesn&#039;t really count in my book.</div><div id="00:34:55.280" class="transcript_line"> What about the, you know, the putcher ranks that used to be out there?</div><div id="00:35:00.360" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember them?</div><div id="00:35:01.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:35:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Which ones do you recall?</div><div id="00:35:06.080" class="transcript_line"> Well, mostly the ones at Goldcliff Point, and there were some at Porton.</div><div id="00:35:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember those.</div><div id="00:35:14.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when we were children, we&#039;d come down...</div><div id="00:35:18.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:35:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just wondering how we did come down.</div><div id="00:35:24.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d walk from Nash very often along the Seaball Bank.</div><div id="00:35:30.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did that on many occasions.</div><div id="00:35:32.240" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d have to come in and buy the pill and then get back out.</div><div id="00:35:35.560" class="transcript_line"> It was difficult, but we did it.</div><div id="00:35:39.720" class="transcript_line"> I suppose as we were growing up, I used to hear stories from my mother-in-law, who was</div><div id="00:35:46.240" class="transcript_line"> born at the hill, and they had a house there, not as it is today, obviously.</div><div id="00:35:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And Mr. Fennell owned the house, and he owned the fisheries.</div><div id="00:36:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And every summer, they would decamp from Newport.</div><div id="00:36:02.880" class="transcript_line"> They were quite wealthy people, and they would decamp to this house, bring the servants</div><div id="00:36:07.960" class="transcript_line"> as well.</div><div id="00:36:09.960" class="transcript_line"> And my mother and Nora, who lived with her family there, would...</div><div id="00:36:17.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, they were really good friends, and mother said they got that they were so fed</div><div id="00:36:23.920" class="transcript_line"> up with salmon by the end of the summer, because they had it for most meals.</div><div id="00:36:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:36:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and then there were stories about Eaton College having the salmon being sent up to</div><div id="00:36:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Eaton College once a year on the train for a big supper.</div><div id="00:36:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Did they own some land here?</div><div id="00:36:44.080" class="transcript_line"> Eaton College owned all the land around here after the Reformation and all of that period</div><div id="00:36:50.720" class="transcript_line"> in time.</div><div id="00:36:51.720" class="transcript_line"> Did they?</div><div id="00:36:52.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they owned all this land until the squires came in and bought...</div><div id="00:36:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Because it had been owned by monks?</div><div id="00:36:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Of course it was taken over, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:37:02.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:37:04.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:37:05.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got loads on that in my book.</div><div id="00:37:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, goodness.</div><div id="00:37:08.640" class="transcript_line"> So, the putches, yes, we...</div><div id="00:37:11.240" class="transcript_line"> And then as we were here farming and so forth, you always went down and got several salmon</div><div id="00:37:17.480" class="transcript_line"> in a summer.</div><div id="00:37:18.480" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:37:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:37:20.480" class="transcript_line"> And there was nothing.</div><div id="00:37:21.480" class="transcript_line"> The taste of a seven salmon, there is nothing like it.</div><div id="00:37:28.360" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d cook whole salmon and...</div><div id="00:37:30.360" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:37:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a fishing kettle?</div><div id="00:37:32.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got one, yes, on my shelf.</div><div id="00:37:34.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:37:35.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it was absolutely amazing.</div><div id="00:37:39.160" class="transcript_line"> This went on right up until the late 90s, 96, 97, when Adrian Williams&#039; family bought</div><div id="00:37:47.320" class="transcript_line"> the fishery some while before...</div><div id="00:37:52.080" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what year.</div><div id="00:37:54.880" class="transcript_line"> And yes, I&#039;ve got pictures of him with the putches.</div><div id="00:37:59.880" class="transcript_line"> And of course, the Howells used to work for the fishing, whoever owned it.</div><div id="00:38:12.520" class="transcript_line"> I can remember old Mr. Howells making the putches even.</div><div id="00:38:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:38:16.520" class="transcript_line"> If I went down, sometimes you&#039;d see him out on the shingle or in front of the shed, there,</div><div id="00:38:25.800" class="transcript_line"> making the putches.</div><div id="00:38:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Monica will tell you more about that.</div><div id="00:38:29.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got lots of pictures of him doing it.</div><div id="00:38:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was part of, again, part of our village life, that everybody in the village had salmon,</div><div id="00:38:41.880" class="transcript_line"> if you could afford to buy it.</div><div id="00:38:44.640" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a problem.</div><div id="00:38:45.640" class="transcript_line"> So you call it the Moors to you, Sue?</div><div id="00:38:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you live on the Moors.</div><div id="00:38:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Live on the Moors.</div><div id="00:38:53.640" class="transcript_line"> So we have the Caldecott and the Wentlewg levels.</div><div id="00:38:57.640" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel a connection with the Wentlewg side at all?</div><div id="00:39:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Only because we know some of the farmers through young farmers.</div><div id="00:39:09.360" class="transcript_line"> And again, we went to school with some of the farmers&#039; daughters because they were just</div><div id="00:39:14.520" class="transcript_line"> close to the convent.</div><div id="00:39:15.520" class="transcript_line"> And again, they&#039;d all come there if they failed the lemblers.</div><div id="00:39:18.920" class="transcript_line"> I think, I don&#039;t know what there was about farmers&#039; daughters.</div><div id="00:39:22.280" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s what happened.</div><div id="00:39:24.280" class="transcript_line"> So we knew them through that, probably through markets and things like that.</div><div id="00:39:30.280" class="transcript_line"> But no, there&#039;s no real connection.</div><div id="00:39:32.280" class="transcript_line"> And when we did Flood 400 in 2007, we got together with St. Bride&#039;s Church and sort</div><div id="00:39:42.800" class="transcript_line"> visited and encouraged the commitment between us to do exhibitions.</div><div id="00:39:52.800" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s about where it finishes.</div><div id="00:39:56.800" class="transcript_line"> So you married.</div><div id="00:40:00.800" class="transcript_line"> When did you marry?</div><div id="00:40:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Did you get married at Nush?</div><div id="00:40:05.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And so then you started your married life here at Whipson.</div><div id="00:40:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:11.320" class="transcript_line"> So your husband&#039;s family at Longtime Whipson, Bessargeant, is that right?</div><div id="00:40:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:19.320" class="transcript_line"> And so are you able to tell me some of their stories?</div><div id="00:40:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;re pretty sure this house, the barn especially, was built by the monks because</div><div id="00:40:33.320" class="transcript_line"> they had a grange and a moor barn, which is over on the common.</div><div id="00:40:39.840" class="transcript_line"> And these were the two biggest barns built down here.</div><div id="00:40:43.840" class="transcript_line"> And we know the monks owned all this area when they settled.</div><div id="00:40:51.840" class="transcript_line"> So the next thing we know for sure is that in the 1600s, David&#039;s mother&#039;s family were</div><div id="00:41:02.840" class="transcript_line"> living here.</div><div id="00:41:04.840" class="transcript_line"> And their name was Keane.</div><div id="00:41:09.360" class="transcript_line"> And we have their wills, copies of their wills, to prove where they were.</div><div id="00:41:17.360" class="transcript_line"> And they also owned land, which was extraordinary at that time.</div><div id="00:41:22.360" class="transcript_line"> They were yeoman farmers.</div><div id="00:41:25.360" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t just this place.</div><div id="00:41:28.360" class="transcript_line"> They lived in, they were a huge family, and they lived in most of the farm houses in the</div><div id="00:41:34.360" class="transcript_line"> villages.</div><div id="00:41:35.880" class="transcript_line"> And I can trace exactly where.</div><div id="00:41:38.880" class="transcript_line"> Now, we know the Wartyces were here, I think it&#039;s 1500.</div><div id="00:41:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Neville&#039;s daughter, Catherine, she and I worked together on family history.</div><div id="00:41:55.880" class="transcript_line"> And there is something that tells us they were here at that time.</div><div id="00:42:03.400" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s quite likely when people&#039;s surnames were given them from the area and their livelihood,</div><div id="00:42:12.400" class="transcript_line"> that they were connected with the water somehow or other.</div><div id="00:42:19.400" class="transcript_line"> Then, looking back, the Wartyces originally, David&#039;s great, great, great, great, great,</div><div id="00:42:32.920" class="transcript_line"> great, great, great, great&#039;s grandfather lived at Castle Farm in Bishden.</div><div id="00:42:37.920" class="transcript_line"> And this was in the 1700s.</div><div id="00:42:40.920" class="transcript_line"> I must have put my other book.</div><div id="00:42:43.920" class="transcript_line"> He, he&#039;d been to market to sell cattle.</div><div id="00:42:47.920" class="transcript_line"> On his way back to Castle Farm at Bishden, he was killed by a highwayman, and his money</div><div id="00:42:54.920" class="transcript_line"> was all stolen.</div><div id="00:42:58.440" class="transcript_line"> So, we know that, again, they were in this area, and then they moved into Nash.</div><div id="00:43:06.440" class="transcript_line"> But the other side of the family were Joneses of Tatton, and they&#039;d been here again for</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> many hundreds of years.</div><div id="00:43:13.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got, you know, in the church registers, we can only go back to about 1750, 1760, and</div><div id="00:43:21.520" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re all in there.</div><div id="00:43:24.920" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve done a family tree, which tells me who, who&#039;s descended from whom, where, and</div><div id="00:43:31.920" class="transcript_line"> when.</div><div id="00:43:32.920" class="transcript_line"> And that is encompassing the three parishes, which would make sense because they had no</div><div id="00:43:38.880" class="transcript_line"> transport.</div><div id="00:43:41.600" class="transcript_line"> But they had a lot of links.</div><div id="00:43:44.200" class="transcript_line"> You can see the Morgans of Tridiga have signed some of their marriage things in the registers.</div><div id="00:43:54.520" class="transcript_line"> There were the Baptisms, and there was another family, the Arneys and the Seys.</div><div id="00:44:04.640" class="transcript_line"> They were all people who had land and could write, you see.</div><div id="00:44:11.440" class="transcript_line"> This is where you learn a little bit about them because you see where there&#039;s a cross.</div><div id="00:44:15.720" class="transcript_line"> You know that they haven&#039;t had the education that some of the families where they&#039;ve signed</div><div id="00:44:20.200" class="transcript_line"> their names.</div><div id="00:44:23.840" class="transcript_line"> And then I guess they had to move out of the villages if they wanted farms before their</div><div id="00:44:31.840" class="transcript_line"> fathers had given up.</div><div id="00:44:35.120" class="transcript_line"> And that happened with David&#039;s grandfather.</div><div id="00:44:39.360" class="transcript_line"> He went to St. Brides up at Magher.</div><div id="00:44:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And when he got married and his children were born up there, and he was farming 600 and</div><div id="00:44:51.880" class="transcript_line"> something acres in the 1880s and 90s.</div><div id="00:44:58.880" class="transcript_line"> It was tremendous.</div><div id="00:45:01.160" class="transcript_line"> And then eventually when they were able to, they came back down to this village.</div><div id="00:45:06.960" class="transcript_line"> So they just waited their time to come back to the village.</div><div id="00:45:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And then they moved back here.</div><div id="00:45:14.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure about the 17, 1800s exactly who was here.</div><div id="00:45:22.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on my list to do.</div><div id="00:45:24.600" class="transcript_line"> But they came back here in 1907.</div><div id="00:45:29.800" class="transcript_line"> And then the family, I think there was a slight gap.</div><div id="00:45:37.920" class="transcript_line"> During the First World War, David&#039;s father and his brother went to war and left Neville&#039;s</div><div id="00:45:45.840" class="transcript_line"> father, his brother.</div><div id="00:45:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And one brother died.</div><div id="00:45:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And I think grandmother had an awful job to run the farm while the men were at war.</div><div id="00:45:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t that unusual?</div><div id="00:45:58.600" class="transcript_line"> Because we&#039;re in the reserved occupation.</div><div id="00:46:00.880" class="transcript_line"> In the Second World War.</div><div id="00:46:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but no, this is the First World War.</div><div id="00:46:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:46:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yes.</div><div id="00:46:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And they didn&#039;t have the sufficient men to run the place.</div><div id="00:46:11.280" class="transcript_line"> So in 1919, just as the war came to a close, she sold up and went to a house they owned</div><div id="00:46:19.240" class="transcript_line"> down the bottom of the village, the Molens.</div><div id="00:46:22.720" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t then David&#039;s father came out of the war and he had no farm.</div><div id="00:46:31.800" class="transcript_line"> So what happened then?</div><div id="00:46:34.400" class="transcript_line"> Monmouthshire County Council decided they&#039;d let the soldiers have small holdings.</div><div id="00:46:42.500" class="transcript_line"> So he managed to get a small holding up at Crick as an ex-soldier.</div><div id="00:46:48.880" class="transcript_line"> I read my mother-in-law in Irene Green in 1924 and they farmed there for 10 years.</div><div id="00:47:00.360" class="transcript_line"> And this place came back on the market.</div><div id="00:47:05.600" class="transcript_line"> So they came back home because he&#039;d lived here for 25 or 20 something years as a young</div><div id="00:47:14.000" class="transcript_line"> man.</div><div id="00:47:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:47:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes.</div><div id="00:47:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So what year did they return?</div><div id="00:47:21.560" class="transcript_line"> 1934 they came back here.</div><div id="00:47:25.120" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t until 1942 they could buy it when it went for sale because the Agricultural</div><div id="00:47:32.840" class="transcript_line"> Mortgage Corporation had received it from a farmer who went into liquidation and they</div><div id="00:47:40.080" class="transcript_line"> owned it for 10 years, I think.</div><div id="00:47:44.200" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, it was bought back and we&#039;ve been here ever since.</div><div id="00:47:50.480" class="transcript_line"> So I get a feeling sometimes about it.</div><div id="00:47:56.640" class="transcript_line"> David&#039;s grandmother living here with all her children and they only had one daughter and</div><div id="00:48:02.320" class="transcript_line"> five sons.</div><div id="00:48:04.120" class="transcript_line"> And I knew Auntie Kathleen quite well and she lived here as a child.</div><div id="00:48:09.640" class="transcript_line"> And I still almost feel a presence in the house of a kind of warmth.</div><div id="00:48:17.200" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s an awful lot of people who have come in this house and have felt how welcoming</div><div id="00:48:25.240" class="transcript_line"> it can be.</div><div id="00:48:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for that.</div><div id="00:48:27.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really welcoming.</div><div id="00:48:28.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like coming home in the way.</div><div id="00:48:30.320" class="transcript_line"> And I like that feeling and it gives me great comfort.</div><div id="00:48:34.240" class="transcript_line"> And David said he never wants to move.</div><div id="00:48:37.500" class="transcript_line"> And I can understand why because I love it as much as he does.</div><div id="00:48:41.140" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;re very welcoming too though, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:48:44.900" class="transcript_line"> And I love the idea that coming in and tea and biscuits done properly.</div><div id="00:48:49.300" class="transcript_line"> I love all that.</div><div id="00:48:51.820" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:48:52.820" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s almost like a ceremonial.</div><div id="00:48:55.660" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s how we grew up, you see.</div><div id="00:48:57.500" class="transcript_line"> My mother was like it.</div><div id="00:48:59.540" class="transcript_line"> And it came through a lot, I think.</div><div id="00:49:02.140" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and David&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:49:05.260" class="transcript_line"> This is something about the village people.</div><div id="00:49:11.060" class="transcript_line"> They were always pleased to see somebody come.</div><div id="00:49:14.220" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember my mother used to feed the tramps and the people used to be in the</div><div id="00:49:19.100" class="transcript_line"> village who had very little.</div><div id="00:49:21.180" class="transcript_line"> She always helped people.</div><div id="00:49:23.660" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose it stays with you, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:49:26.460" class="transcript_line"> I think it does.</div><div id="00:49:27.460" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s ingrained, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:49:29.460" class="transcript_line"> So is this one of the oldest houses on the level?</div><div id="00:49:32.860" class="transcript_line"> We think so.</div><div id="00:49:33.980" class="transcript_line"> I have seen it in a history book when it was called G-R-A-I-N-G-E, which would have been</div><div id="00:49:40.980" class="transcript_line"> the Monks&#039; Grange, you see.</div><div id="00:49:45.660" class="transcript_line"> And of course they built it in stages.</div><div id="00:49:47.900" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t like this.</div><div id="00:49:49.900" class="transcript_line"> I mean it was a long house.</div><div id="00:49:52.340" class="transcript_line"> And the barn was obviously the first built.</div><div id="00:49:56.420" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a stable attached to it with a living quarters above.</div><div id="00:50:06.780" class="transcript_line"> And the little room, we think the back of the house was attached to it, a single, probably</div><div id="00:50:12.140" class="transcript_line"> a single story to start with.</div><div id="00:50:14.460" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s three stories now.</div><div id="00:50:16.340" class="transcript_line"> And when we had a new roof put on the house you could see where it had been hired and</div><div id="00:50:19.940" class="transcript_line"> hired.</div><div id="00:50:20.940" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:50:21.940" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why we&#039;ve got three stories at the back.</div><div id="00:50:25.340" class="transcript_line"> And two in the front.</div><div id="00:50:27.340" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever found anything while being on the farm, anything that indicates its age?</div><div id="00:50:31.340" class="transcript_line"> No, well the only thing that I was looking back, there were gravestones in the barn where</div><div id="00:50:43.300" class="transcript_line"> they used to do the winnowing.</div><div id="00:50:47.020" class="transcript_line"> And also a squint window within.</div><div id="00:50:50.660" class="transcript_line"> And I wondered if there was some sort of chapel.</div><div id="00:50:55.420" class="transcript_line"> And when we converted the barn I meant to rub the gravestones.</div><div id="00:51:01.380" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t do it and the builders had the stones up and gone before I could.</div><div id="00:51:05.980" class="transcript_line"> And oh I regret that so badly.</div><div id="00:51:08.700" class="transcript_line"> A number of times I said I must go out.</div><div id="00:51:13.060" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a yew tree in the garden.</div><div id="00:51:14.900" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no other yew trees in this village except in Whitsun Churchyard.</div><div id="00:51:18.100" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:51:19.100" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s curious isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:51:21.140" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d love to know how old it is.</div><div id="00:51:24.700" class="transcript_line"> And I wondered if there was a single cell here for a monk.</div><div id="00:51:30.140" class="transcript_line"> Or a hermitage I&#039;m thinking.</div><div id="00:51:32.140" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:51:33.140" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:51:35.140" class="transcript_line"> It does make me wonder.</div><div id="00:51:38.060" class="transcript_line"> And as time went on of course they built the house bigger and more impressive I guess than</div><div id="00:51:44.220" class="transcript_line"> a longhouse.</div><div id="00:51:47.180" class="transcript_line"> My father-in-law told us that, or told David, that the back of the house was the front originally</div><div id="00:51:54.860" class="transcript_line"> facing the sea, facing the sun.</div><div id="00:51:58.980" class="transcript_line"> And this garden here where the cedar tree was the orchard.</div><div id="00:52:03.780" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s still a pear tree on the back drive.</div><div id="00:52:05.820" class="transcript_line"> Is there really?</div><div id="00:52:06.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:52:07.820" class="transcript_line"> So would it have the drive sweeping round maybe?</div><div id="00:52:13.020" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know because we think the building, our dairy and old kitchen, are built on what</div><div id="00:52:18.700" class="transcript_line"> was originally Wainbridge Lane.</div><div id="00:52:20.820" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:52:21.820" class="transcript_line"> Wainbridge Lane was there.</div><div id="00:52:23.420" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s still part of it down there and still part up there.</div><div id="00:52:26.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:27.660" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve still got the old stones where the bridges would have been.</div><div id="00:52:30.940" class="transcript_line"> So where did it go?</div><div id="00:52:31.940" class="transcript_line"> Well it would have gone from the monastery you see up to Llanwerne.</div><div id="00:52:35.420" class="transcript_line"> Oh goodness.</div><div id="00:52:36.420" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a direct...</div><div id="00:52:37.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:38.420" class="transcript_line"> Let me show you on the map.</div><div id="00:52:39.420" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:52:43.420" class="transcript_line"> Now, if we&#039;re here...</div><div id="00:52:46.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:47.180" class="transcript_line"> It started...</div><div id="00:52:48.180" class="transcript_line"> Well there&#039;s the monastery.</div><div id="00:52:49.860" class="transcript_line"> It would have come up.</div><div id="00:52:51.740" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the lane, look.</div><div id="00:52:54.060" class="transcript_line"> And it goes behind Pilfarm.</div><div id="00:52:57.420" class="transcript_line"> Up here, past...</div><div id="00:53:00.420" class="transcript_line"> Where am I now?</div><div id="00:53:04.340" class="transcript_line"> Past us.</div><div id="00:53:05.340" class="transcript_line"> So it comes up here and it went past our house.</div><div id="00:53:10.020" class="transcript_line"> Up here.</div><div id="00:53:11.820" class="transcript_line"> And we built that house there.</div><div id="00:53:13.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:14.380" class="transcript_line"> And it comes out the other side of it.</div><div id="00:53:16.060" class="transcript_line"> And then that road went straight on up to Llanwerne Lane.</div><div id="00:53:19.420" class="transcript_line"> Well has there ever been any work done on it?</div><div id="00:53:21.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean archaeological work on it, on the lane?</div><div id="00:53:23.780" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:53:24.780" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:53:25.780" class="transcript_line"> Well where&#039;s Monk Stitch?</div><div id="00:53:26.780" class="transcript_line"> Right along it.</div><div id="00:53:27.780" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s curious, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:53:29.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:30.780" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:53:31.780" class="transcript_line"> People don&#039;t seem to understand how important these green lanes once were.</div><div id="00:53:37.740" class="transcript_line"> They were the original routes.</div><div id="00:53:39.220" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:53:40.420" class="transcript_line"> The road here.</div><div id="00:53:41.420" class="transcript_line"> David&#039;s father in his lifetime remembers them making this road.</div><div id="00:53:45.900" class="transcript_line"> Putting the...</div><div id="00:53:46.900" class="transcript_line"> The one outside?</div><div id="00:53:47.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:48.900" class="transcript_line"> Putting the... breaking the rocks up to make it.</div><div id="00:53:51.340" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:53:52.340" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:53:53.820" class="transcript_line"> So they would have mostly used green lanes to travel around the village and footpaths.</div><div id="00:53:59.260" class="transcript_line"> Footpaths everywhere.</div><div id="00:54:00.260" class="transcript_line"> What about footpaths?</div><div id="00:54:01.260" class="transcript_line"> There are lots of footpaths.</div><div id="00:54:02.260" class="transcript_line"> Oh, tremendous lot.</div><div id="00:54:03.260" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got a couple going through here.</div><div id="00:54:06.100" class="transcript_line"> Do they have names?</div><div id="00:54:08.380" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:54:09.540" class="transcript_line"> Not specific names.</div><div id="00:54:11.620" class="transcript_line"> So yes, so going back to the family, as they all had a lot of sons, so whenever a farm</div><div id="00:54:21.660" class="transcript_line"> was available they normally bought it or got tenancy of it, whichever.</div><div id="00:54:27.980" class="transcript_line"> And I could pinpoint on here, they lived at nearly every one.</div><div id="00:54:34.660" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:54:35.660" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:54:36.660" class="transcript_line"> And the Patton Farm was David&#039;s other part of the family on his grandmother&#039;s side.</div><div id="00:54:43.420" class="transcript_line"> And they lived farm field and then the waters lived here, there, there, there.</div><div id="00:54:52.740" class="transcript_line"> You know, and you virtually looked at them all and knew family were there.</div><div id="00:54:56.860" class="transcript_line"> Do you have names of fields at all?</div><div id="00:54:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:55:00.300" class="transcript_line"> Now this is another project I started in my book.</div><div id="00:55:04.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah?</div><div id="00:55:05.460" class="transcript_line"> Yes, all our fields and I&#039;ve taught the children and the grandchildren the names of all the</div><div id="00:55:10.060" class="transcript_line"> fields here.</div><div id="00:55:11.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:12.060" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them are obvious.</div><div id="00:55:13.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:14.060" class="transcript_line"> But the one that interested me most was reading about the history of villages.</div><div id="00:55:21.780" class="transcript_line"> Every village had a north field, which was north of the church.</div><div id="00:55:27.820" class="transcript_line"> And we own a north field, which is north of the church.</div><div id="00:55:33.180" class="transcript_line"> And that fascinated me.</div><div id="00:55:34.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:35.780" class="transcript_line"> So, ours are basically mundane, but at home we had the Crowners field.</div><div id="00:55:43.620" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why it was called the Crowners.</div><div id="00:55:45.780" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you had a pylon field and you had a shed field.</div><div id="00:55:52.460" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:53.460" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got a moutpen.</div><div id="00:55:55.300" class="transcript_line"> Now that&#039;s called the moutpen because they used to have the mows in there, the hay mows.</div><div id="00:56:00.980" class="transcript_line"> The hay mows?</div><div id="00:56:02.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, M-O-W-S, mow.</div><div id="00:56:04.580" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:56:05.580" class="transcript_line"> A rick.</div><div id="00:56:06.580" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never heard it called that before.</div><div id="00:56:09.580" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:56:10.580" class="transcript_line"> Well, they used to make ricks of hay when you gathered it in loose, long before balers</div><div id="00:56:18.060" class="transcript_line"> obviously.</div><div id="00:56:19.060" class="transcript_line"> And make it into that sort of shape.</div><div id="00:56:22.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and you&#039;d thatch the top virtually and you&#039;d have perhaps six or eight of those and</div><div id="00:56:27.780" class="transcript_line"> we call them the mows.</div><div id="00:56:28.780" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know who it was of mine.</div><div id="00:56:29.780" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:56:30.780" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps this local.</div><div id="00:56:32.580" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:56:33.580" class="transcript_line"> So did you thatch the top with, how did you thatch the top?</div><div id="00:56:38.580" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:56:39.580" class="transcript_line"> Because somebody was telling me that they used to go off on this bike to buy bundles.</div><div id="00:56:45.780" class="transcript_line"> Oh, bundles of reeds.</div><div id="00:56:47.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, to thatch the top of the rick.</div><div id="00:56:49.780" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well there&#039;s reeds growing all around here.</div><div id="00:56:52.780" class="transcript_line"> Has there always been reeds growing in the reeds here?</div><div id="00:56:57.780" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember them when I was a child and David says they&#039;ve colonised the place.</div><div id="00:57:02.780" class="transcript_line"> So we don&#039;t quite know where they&#039;ve colonised us from.</div><div id="00:57:05.660" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t have the trouble casting the reams that we have now because they&#039;ve certainly</div><div id="00:57:10.940" class="transcript_line"> increased over, whether it&#039;s because we&#039;ve stopped using fertilisers, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:57:17.460" class="transcript_line"> Could be.</div><div id="00:57:18.460" class="transcript_line"> So do you as a farmer down here Sue, what are the challenges or the delights?</div><div id="00:57:25.780" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, I think that the drainage, the grips, that sort of thing that maybe a farmer</div><div id="00:57:31.780" class="transcript_line"> elsewhere wouldn&#039;t have to deal with.</div><div id="00:57:33.780" class="transcript_line"> Well, over my life for farming, 55 years now, when I came here, yes, there were grips in</div><div id="00:57:46.780" class="transcript_line"> all the fields.</div><div id="00:57:48.980" class="transcript_line"> And then you had to consider the cost of draining your land to get rid of these grips.</div><div id="00:57:56.980" class="transcript_line"> So, we put under drainage in, we ploughed and we reseeded nearly the entire farm.</div><div id="00:58:04.980" class="transcript_line"> Why did you get rid of the grips?</div><div id="00:58:06.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, when you&#039;re farming and you&#039;ve got, the machinery was improving and if you were</div><div id="00:58:13.980" class="transcript_line"> mowing a field, the difficulty of mowing these grips was incredible.</div><div id="00:58:18.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have to go and rake back as David was mowing and they would break the machinery</div><div id="00:58:25.980" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;d go down and there were verus, you see, all the fields had verus.</div><div id="00:58:33.980" class="transcript_line"> So, you just needed to have flat fields for all your crops.</div><div id="00:58:39.980" class="transcript_line"> It made it easier for harvesting, made it easier for everything.</div><div id="00:58:44.980" class="transcript_line"> We filled in blind ditches.</div><div id="00:58:47.980" class="transcript_line"> There were often blind ditches where nothing had been done for centuries, you see.</div><div id="00:58:54.980" class="transcript_line"> And that mean you were then by flattening the fields?</div><div id="00:59:01.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:59:02.980" class="transcript_line"> What did you have to do a lot then with making alternative drainage?</div><div id="00:59:06.980" class="transcript_line"> No, because you put an under drainage system in.</div><div id="00:59:09.980" class="transcript_line"> That must have been massive.</div><div id="00:59:11.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was because they would come with loads of gravel and then put the pipes.</div><div id="00:59:17.980" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:59:18.980" class="transcript_line"> And then, yes, it cost us a great deal of money, but in those days they also gave you</div><div id="00:59:23.980" class="transcript_line"> grants towards it.</div><div id="00:59:26.980" class="transcript_line"> In the 60s they were handing grants out because they were so short of food.</div><div id="00:59:30.980" class="transcript_line"> They wanted us to become efficient.</div><div id="00:59:33.980" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we did.</div><div id="00:59:35.980" class="transcript_line"> And we were building our dairy herd up, which was very necessary to be as efficient</div><div id="00:59:40.980" class="transcript_line"> as you possibly could.</div><div id="00:59:42.980" class="transcript_line"> And so, are there farms down here that still use that sort of system, the grip system?</div><div id="00:59:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Very few, very few.</div><div id="00:59:49.980" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a couple I know of, but most farmers had to do exactly the same as us</div><div id="00:59:55.980" class="transcript_line"> and get rid of them.</div><div id="00:59:57.980" class="transcript_line"> And this was the one thing that happened during the takeover for the wetlands.</div><div id="01:00:03.980" class="transcript_line"> Neville and some of the other farmers, John Waters and a few of them, they&#039;d</div><div id="01:00:10.980" class="transcript_line"> under drained all their land and they were growing wheat, which is not so usual for</div><div id="01:00:18.980" class="transcript_line"> this part of the world because of the dampness.</div><div id="01:00:20.980" class="transcript_line"> But once you&#039;ve drained, you see you can grow any crop.</div><div id="01:00:23.980" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d done, oh, acres and acres of land down that way.</div><div id="01:00:29.980" class="transcript_line"> And when it was compulsory purchased and he saw them breaking up the drainage system</div><div id="01:00:35.980" class="transcript_line"> that he&#039;d put in, it&#039;s enough to break your heart.</div><div id="01:00:38.980" class="transcript_line"> But of course, that didn&#039;t matter to them, did it?</div><div id="01:00:42.980" class="transcript_line"> And I think that was one of the heartbreaking things about everything coming to our</div><div id="01:00:48.980" class="transcript_line"> village.</div><div id="01:00:50.980" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t matter what any farmer did, it was taken off them.</div><div id="01:00:54.980" class="transcript_line"> The steelworks took, what, 1500, 1800 acres?</div><div id="01:00:58.980" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a big piece of land.</div><div id="01:01:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Was that a shock when that came and the size of it and the scale of it?</div><div id="01:01:05.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think what really made us sit up after was in 1953, Electric came to</div><div id="01:01:17.980" class="transcript_line"> Whitsun and Goldcliffe.</div><div id="01:01:19.980" class="transcript_line"> 1953?</div><div id="01:01:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Whitsun, Goldcliffe and Nash.</div><div id="01:01:23.980" class="transcript_line"> But there were several houses that weren&#039;t offered it, like Newhouse, Greencourt,</div><div id="01:01:29.980" class="transcript_line"> Tatton, quite a few of them.</div><div id="01:01:33.980" class="transcript_line"> And that was in 1953.</div><div id="01:01:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, 1958, they announced the steelworks was coming.</div><div id="01:01:39.980" class="transcript_line"> And of course, it made sense because they were being bulldozed down anyway.</div><div id="01:01:44.980" class="transcript_line"> So they knew six years in advance of us that it was going to, it was earmarked.</div><div id="01:01:50.980" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, we had before that been told that Whitsun was going to build</div><div id="01:01:56.980" class="transcript_line"> factories here.</div><div id="01:01:58.980" class="transcript_line"> But because it was very, very poor land, it was virtually bogged because it was</div><div id="01:02:06.980" class="transcript_line"> the area where what we call the bottoms, where before the wall was built for the</div><div id="01:02:11.980" class="transcript_line"> sea, the water would come over, run down into the bottoms, as we called it,</div><div id="01:02:17.980" class="transcript_line"> fill it up, and of course it couldn&#039;t get back out.</div><div id="01:02:19.980" class="transcript_line"> So it was just full of old rush.</div><div id="01:02:22.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:02:23.980" class="transcript_line"> Whether it could have been with modern farming methods made more productive, we</div><div id="01:02:28.980" class="transcript_line"> do not know.</div><div id="01:02:29.980" class="transcript_line"> But it was an ideal site for them.</div><div id="01:02:31.980" class="transcript_line"> But what we didn&#039;t realize how far it would encroach into our village and take</div><div id="01:02:36.980" class="transcript_line"> away railway stations, our lanes, our roads, our access to other villages.</div><div id="01:02:43.980" class="transcript_line"> So which station did it take away?</div><div id="01:02:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Clan Wern was the main one because it was one mile from here.</div><div id="01:02:51.980" class="transcript_line"> And David always rode his bike there to catch his train to school in Newport.</div><div id="01:02:56.980" class="transcript_line"> And all the, during the First World War and previous to that, the trains would draw</div><div id="01:03:03.980" class="transcript_line"> up there and all the feed for the animals would come into the village.</div><div id="01:03:07.980" class="transcript_line"> The coal would come into the village.</div><div id="01:03:09.980" class="transcript_line"> David said his father would take his horse and cart up and collect all the coal for</div><div id="01:03:17.980" class="transcript_line"> the winter.</div><div id="01:03:19.980" class="transcript_line"> They sent all the fodder for the ponies in the First World War out by train.</div><div id="01:03:24.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:03:25.980" class="transcript_line"> From here?</div><div id="01:03:26.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, from the whole of the villages.</div><div id="01:03:28.980" class="transcript_line"> So it was very, very important.</div><div id="01:03:30.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:03:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And was it just a small village as well, Clan Wern, was it?</div><div id="01:03:36.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="01:03:37.980" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got it on there.</div><div id="01:03:39.980" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I mean, it&#039;s not, it wasn&#039;t a lot bigger than what it is now, but of course</div><div id="01:03:44.980" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re expanding it.</div><div id="01:03:46.980" class="transcript_line"> But it was a main archery for this area.</div><div id="01:03:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Because we people didn&#039;t want to go to Newport if you had one one mile up the road.</div><div id="01:03:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:03:55.980" class="transcript_line"> So they went.</div><div id="01:03:56.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:03:57.980" class="transcript_line"> There was a mile of road and they just took it away, built all sorts of things over it</div><div id="01:04:04.980" class="transcript_line"> and then took the end of the village off.</div><div id="01:04:08.980" class="transcript_line"> They took all the green name system out, the whole lot where we&#039;d, you know, have gone</div><div id="01:04:13.980" class="transcript_line"> from one area to another.</div><div id="01:04:15.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:04:16.980" class="transcript_line"> And knocked some of the most beautiful farm houses down in the process.</div><div id="01:04:22.980" class="transcript_line"> So yes.</div><div id="01:04:23.980" class="transcript_line"> And people wonder when we are protective of our area.</div><div id="01:04:27.980" class="transcript_line"> This is why this living levels is suddenly bringing, it&#039;s almost 50 years too late.</div><div id="01:04:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I&#039;m saying?</div><div id="01:04:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Why, oh why did they constantly want our villages when it was such a beautiful little area?</div><div id="01:04:46.980" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t beauty by the standards of the Cotswold villages or anything like that.</div><div id="01:04:51.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got its own beauty though, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:04:53.980" class="transcript_line"> It had something special about it.</div><div id="01:04:55.980" class="transcript_line"> But the minute they started putting dozens of modern houses into it, it lost its character</div><div id="01:05:00.980" class="transcript_line"> as far as I was concerned.</div><div id="01:05:03.980" class="transcript_line"> So was there was a mixed feeling towards Langwurming because it bought work, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:05:08.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:09.980" class="transcript_line"> But of course then, although it brought work, it doubled Newport, the size of Newport.</div><div id="01:05:16.980" class="transcript_line"> It made it less of an attractive town.</div><div id="01:05:20.980" class="transcript_line"> We had caravan sites put, our schools filled up and they were plonked in the centre of</div><div id="01:05:27.980" class="transcript_line"> the village.</div><div id="01:05:28.980" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember the school was overwhelmed.</div><div id="01:05:31.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:05:32.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they had to put another part of the school into being.</div><div id="01:05:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Which is Nash School?</div><div id="01:05:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:38.980" class="transcript_line"> They had to bring in what you call portable buildings.</div><div id="01:05:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="01:05:41.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:42.980" class="transcript_line"> Because somebody told me that at High Cornwall there was a camp there for Irish Navvies.</div><div id="01:05:49.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="01:05:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they all came over and looked to work.</div><div id="01:05:52.980" class="transcript_line"> But they had to have a place to send their children to school.</div><div id="01:05:56.980" class="transcript_line"> So we got it.</div><div id="01:05:57.980" class="transcript_line"> And then there was another camp put there for experimental something or other to do</div><div id="01:06:04.980" class="transcript_line"> the steelworks.</div><div id="01:06:05.980" class="transcript_line"> I forgot what they called it.</div><div id="01:06:06.980" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s just an overgrown field now.</div><div id="01:06:11.980" class="transcript_line"> Nobody could even get in there, I doubt.</div><div id="01:06:13.980" class="transcript_line"> So did you feel the effects here?</div><div id="01:06:16.980" class="transcript_line"> What sort of changes did you feel?</div><div id="01:06:18.980" class="transcript_line"> The worst was going to school.</div><div id="01:06:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And we would catch the bus to go to school.</div><div id="01:06:27.980" class="transcript_line"> And within ten minutes of being on the bus, the bus would be stationary and crawling</div><div id="01:06:34.980" class="transcript_line"> for an hour and we would miss our convent bus.</div><div id="01:06:38.980" class="transcript_line"> So you got out of the bus after three miles and you walked the other two to get your bus.</div><div id="01:06:45.980" class="transcript_line"> Because there were so many shale lorries and we only had one bridge in Newport.</div><div id="01:06:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="01:06:51.980" class="transcript_line"> The main bridge next to the railway bridge.</div><div id="01:06:54.980" class="transcript_line"> And it was totally snarled up.</div><div id="01:06:59.980" class="transcript_line"> So they decided they&#039;d built George Street Bridge.</div><div id="01:07:02.980" class="transcript_line"> But of course it was too late for the use of the ship, you know, to stop all this happening.</div><div id="01:07:08.980" class="transcript_line"> And that was a horrible feeling that everything started to change.</div><div id="01:07:17.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had no control whatsoever.</div><div id="01:07:19.980" class="transcript_line"> And there was no previous thought of the infrastructure at all.</div><div id="01:07:25.980" class="transcript_line"> So you must have been delighted with the news of the implore coming through?</div><div id="01:07:30.980" class="transcript_line"> This time?</div><div id="01:07:32.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it made a lot of difference to us.</div><div id="01:07:34.980" class="transcript_line"> Obviously it would have been half a mile or more away and we wouldn&#039;t have wanted it.</div><div id="01:07:41.980" class="transcript_line"> But I do think Newport needs help.</div><div id="01:07:44.980" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t think people fully realize what a problem Newport has.</div><div id="01:07:52.980" class="transcript_line"> I wish they&#039;d find some solution to it.</div><div id="01:07:56.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think also that the people who were against it coming for the habitat and so forth</div><div id="01:08:04.980" class="transcript_line"> fully realize that we have had this happen so many times.</div><div id="01:08:09.980" class="transcript_line"> With the power station, with the ash ponds, Llanwerne.</div><div id="01:08:15.980" class="transcript_line"> The habitat has been eroded in those areas.</div><div id="01:08:19.980" class="transcript_line"> But the wildlife will move around and they will, you know, thrive wherever.</div><div id="01:08:26.980" class="transcript_line"> Because we have found that with the fact that we had, from farming very intensively</div><div id="01:08:34.980" class="transcript_line"> and all the slurry we used to put on the land.</div><div id="01:08:37.980" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have a lot of wildlife at that time.</div><div id="01:08:40.980" class="transcript_line"> But since, we have got far more wildlife here than you ever see down the wetlands.</div><div id="01:08:46.980" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s curious really.</div><div id="01:08:49.980" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="01:08:51.980" class="transcript_line"> We always had a heronry on the farm.</div><div id="01:08:55.980" class="transcript_line"> Herons, swans, ducks, owls, every type of bird.</div><div id="01:09:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Hairs.</div><div id="01:09:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And you know, they&#039;re thriving.</div><div id="01:09:05.980" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had fields of lapwings and the swans are with us and have them young every year.</div><div id="01:09:13.980" class="transcript_line"> But then they&#039;ve been here for the last, you know, ever since I came.</div><div id="01:09:17.980" class="transcript_line"> Because you read some stories, people compare this to the Amazon for its, you know, diversity.</div><div id="01:09:24.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:09:25.980" class="transcript_line"> But I can&#039;t see, as far as I&#039;m concerned, everything has come back that once didn&#039;t thrive perhaps</div><div id="01:09:35.980" class="transcript_line"> where we were farming intensively.</div><div id="01:09:38.980" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s all come back.</div><div id="01:09:40.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, how many people can hear the owls in their trees at night?</div><div id="01:09:44.980" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got them on the farm.</div><div id="01:09:47.980" class="transcript_line"> No, there&#039;s nothing, you know, I&#039;ve got wild ducks that come in the garden.</div><div id="01:09:54.980" class="transcript_line"> And every year you see the swans teaching the signets to fly up our orchard.</div><div id="01:09:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Delight.</div><div id="01:10:00.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="01:10:02.980" class="transcript_line"> So, no, I find it difficult to believe that it&#039;s the same when they lock the gates at the wetlands.</div><div id="01:10:13.980" class="transcript_line"> You mustn&#039;t walk through there whilst the birds are breeding.</div><div id="01:10:16.980" class="transcript_line"> How do they think farming works when we are making haze, silage?</div><div id="01:10:22.980" class="transcript_line"> I can walk through one of the fields and you&#039;ll hear the birds singing and they&#039;ll go quiet.</div><div id="01:10:27.980" class="transcript_line"> But you know they&#039;ve got young or eggs in there or whatever.</div><div id="01:10:31.980" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ll fly back in as soon as you&#039;ve gone.</div><div id="01:10:35.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that must seem kind of strange, people around here, to be told it&#039;s almost as if you don&#039;t know your land or how nature works.</div><div id="01:10:44.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:10:45.980" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got some experts coming in saying you&#039;d better listen to us.</div><div id="01:10:48.980" class="transcript_line"> That must be a bit frustrating.</div><div id="01:10:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it is terribly frustrating.</div><div id="01:10:52.980" class="transcript_line"> And I found that really, really hard down the seawall where we&#039;ve gone all our lives to walk where we wanted to go and suddenly you&#039;ve got padlocks.</div><div id="01:11:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And I would get over the gates and take no notice because I was thinking I know more about it than what they do.</div><div id="01:11:10.980" class="transcript_line"> But then they put barbed wire and you can&#039;t do that.</div><div id="01:11:13.980" class="transcript_line"> And you think this is absolutely dreadful.</div><div id="01:11:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Do they think that wildlife takes any notice of human beings?</div><div id="01:11:24.980" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t.</div><div id="01:11:25.980" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve coexisted for so long, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="01:11:27.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:11:28.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s respecting one group over another, isn&#039;t it, really?</div><div id="01:11:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And perhaps you&#039;ve been able to glean a picture a little bit of how anxious I have felt through my life that they&#039;re going to take more and more of us.</div><div id="01:11:42.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:11:43.980" class="transcript_line"> And destroy what was here.</div><div id="01:11:45.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:11:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it&#039;s obvious why you would be anxious about that because so much has been taken, hasn&#039;t it, really?</div><div id="01:11:52.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very anti-development.</div><div id="01:11:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;ve seen enough of it to be anti-it, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:11:57.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:11:58.980" class="transcript_line"> Yet there is an idyll here still, isn&#039;t there, I feel, when I come to...</div><div id="01:12:02.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, I find it more in Whitsun than I do in Nash because I lost that idyll a long time ago when they built all around our house.</div><div id="01:12:11.980" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m already incredibly aware that you&#039;re a very modest woman, but you&#039;ve done some fantastic work recording history locally.</div><div id="01:12:24.980" class="transcript_line"> Why have you taken it upon yourself to do that?</div><div id="01:12:27.980" class="transcript_line"> And what things have you learnt and researched that have thrilled you or amazed you or whatever?</div><div id="01:12:35.980" class="transcript_line"> I... It&#039;s a job to define.</div><div id="01:12:39.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why I suddenly became... I used to always listen to the old people.</div><div id="01:12:47.980" class="transcript_line"> I used to like sitting quiet and taking it all in, so to speak.</div><div id="01:12:52.980" class="transcript_line"> My father used to say, oh, she&#039;s got her ears flapping again.</div><div id="01:12:56.980" class="transcript_line"> And they were right.</div><div id="01:13:00.980" class="transcript_line"> We had an old gentleman who used to come to the house.</div><div id="01:13:03.980" class="transcript_line"> He lived up the road, Mr. Lamprey.</div><div id="01:13:07.980" class="transcript_line"> And he was bristly and he used to ride his bike down.</div><div id="01:13:12.980" class="transcript_line"> And he loved coming to see my mother and he&#039;d sit in the rocking chair while she was cooking or doing something.</div><div id="01:13:18.980" class="transcript_line"> And he was a herbalist.</div><div id="01:13:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Herbalist?</div><div id="01:13:21.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:13:22.980" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come and he&#039;d say now, I think...</div><div id="01:13:26.980" class="transcript_line"> And in those days everybody called Mrs. This or Mr. That.</div><div id="01:13:30.980" class="transcript_line"> Now Mrs. Collymore.</div><div id="01:13:32.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve brought you some nettles today and perhaps if I tell you how we&#039;ll make some nettle soup.</div><div id="01:13:38.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where my mother wished him to.</div><div id="01:13:41.980" class="transcript_line"> But he never stopped coming and he always had some ideas about...</div><div id="01:13:47.980" class="transcript_line"> That used to fascinate me.</div><div id="01:13:51.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:13:52.980" class="transcript_line"> There was things I used to take on board, I guess.</div><div id="01:13:57.980" class="transcript_line"> And then suddenly I thought, well, I used to say to the old people, will you tell me or will you talk?</div><div id="01:14:06.980" class="transcript_line"> Like Mr. German, who was the local blacksmith.</div><div id="01:14:10.980" class="transcript_line"> His memories went way back, probably to the beginning of the century.</div><div id="01:14:16.980" class="transcript_line"> I think he must have been born about 1912 or something like that.</div><div id="01:14:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And now what do you want to know, my dear?</div><div id="01:14:26.980" class="transcript_line"> Things like that used to happen and I didn&#039;t record it.</div><div id="01:14:31.980" class="transcript_line"> I just remember some of it.</div><div id="01:14:34.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had an old gentleman, Andrew Greenhouse, who lived opposite us here.</div><div id="01:14:38.980" class="transcript_line"> He knew everything and I didn&#039;t record it.</div><div id="01:14:41.980" class="transcript_line"> So at one stage I thought, you see, when I was farming I had an awfully busy life.</div><div id="01:14:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Running this place, I had children.</div><div id="01:14:50.980" class="transcript_line"> I used to work for Cruz Bereavement Care, 20 hours a week.</div><div id="01:14:54.980" class="transcript_line"> And that was voluntary.</div><div id="01:14:56.980" class="transcript_line"> I used to help run the church.</div><div id="01:15:01.980" class="transcript_line"> And we were a big family, always visiting somebody in the family who needed something or other.</div><div id="01:15:09.980" class="transcript_line"> My mother became very ill and I had to look after her.</div><div id="01:15:13.980" class="transcript_line"> There was an awful lot going on.</div><div id="01:15:16.980" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t probably until 2000.</div><div id="01:15:20.980" class="transcript_line"> I used to help my girls run their businesses because one was a ceramicist and the other made clothes and whatever.</div><div id="01:15:30.980" class="transcript_line"> So there was all that going on and the cows, which took most of our life up.</div><div id="01:15:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And I started writing my book of my life story, thinking, well, this would be nice for the grandchildren</div><div id="01:15:46.980" class="transcript_line"> to know a little bit about when I used to say we had no hot water in the house.</div><div id="01:15:52.980" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have a bathroom. We didn&#039;t have electric.</div><div id="01:15:56.980" class="transcript_line"> And this was our life.</div><div id="01:15:57.980" class="transcript_line"> And my word, we were happy.</div><div id="01:15:59.980" class="transcript_line"> It never made any difference to us.</div><div id="01:16:01.980" class="transcript_line"> My mother created a wonderful home with very little.</div><div id="01:16:05.980" class="transcript_line"> My father and mother worked hard with the business to afford to pay for the four of us to go to private school,</div><div id="01:16:13.980" class="transcript_line"> which must, looking back, have been a great sacrifice for them.</div><div id="01:16:19.980" class="transcript_line"> But they thought maybe it would do us good.</div><div id="01:16:22.980" class="transcript_line"> There was all sorts of things that made me realize that we had a different life to other people.</div><div id="01:16:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And I guess I started writing it down because my own family, it was such a large family,</div><div id="01:16:41.980" class="transcript_line"> all very interesting people who did things that you didn&#039;t hear about other people doing.</div><div id="01:16:49.980" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve written that, have you Sue?</div><div id="01:16:51.980" class="transcript_line"> Not all of it. No, no, nothing like.</div><div id="01:16:53.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got quite a few chapters under my belt.</div><div id="01:16:56.980" class="transcript_line"> But I want to do the detail, you see, and that&#039;s what takes the time.</div><div id="01:17:01.980" class="transcript_line"> And then as soon as you think of something, then you&#039;re reminded of something else, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="01:17:06.980" class="transcript_line"> You just can&#039;t encompass it all.</div><div id="01:17:09.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in exhaustive, isn&#039;t it, just trying to get it all done.</div><div id="01:17:13.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And then we&#039;re coming from generation to generation.</div><div id="01:17:17.980" class="transcript_line"> But mostly I wanted to write about my farming life and how it evolved</div><div id="01:17:23.980" class="transcript_line"> because it saw huge differences from beginning to end like my father did.</div><div id="01:17:28.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So you have taken it upon yourself to maybe record your community.</div><div id="01:17:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. My community is in my book.</div><div id="01:17:40.980" class="transcript_line"> All the people, who they were, what they did and how we lived.</div><div id="01:17:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Who was Hubert Jones?</div><div id="01:17:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Hubert Jones. Well, you see, his family, the Joneses, I don&#039;t know how far they go back,</div><div id="01:17:56.980" class="transcript_line"> but I know it&#039;s hundreds of years.</div><div id="01:17:59.980" class="transcript_line"> And again, they had their own land.</div><div id="01:18:08.980" class="transcript_line"> So if people had their own land, they stayed.</div><div id="01:18:12.980" class="transcript_line"> He was one of several boys.</div><div id="01:18:17.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t quite know how many.</div><div id="01:18:20.980" class="transcript_line"> His daughter, Lynn, lives in Redwick,</div><div id="01:18:23.980" class="transcript_line"> and she gave me access to all his papers that he&#039;d written.</div><div id="01:18:27.980" class="transcript_line"> And he had been writing his history since I would think he was about 30 or 40.</div><div id="01:18:35.980" class="transcript_line"> So his memories went right back to the beginning of the 1900s.</div><div id="01:18:40.980" class="transcript_line"> And he sketched. He would go.</div><div id="01:18:45.980" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t drive, but he would go by bus into the library and he would order books.</div><div id="01:18:52.980" class="transcript_line"> And they always sent them by post so that he would read his book</div><div id="01:18:57.980" class="transcript_line"> and then correspond with the head librarian, send them back.</div><div id="01:19:01.980" class="transcript_line"> So everything he wrote or copied, rather, to do with the history was factual.</div><div id="01:19:09.980" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t do a bibliography as such,</div><div id="01:19:13.980" class="transcript_line"> but he wrote down which book it had come out of so that I know that it&#039;s not fiction.</div><div id="01:19:20.980" class="transcript_line"> And then he was writing, and I can show you.</div><div id="01:19:24.980" class="transcript_line"> I have written stuff myself, which has copied down a lot of his memories.</div><div id="01:19:36.980" class="transcript_line"> This is what&#039;s fascinated me, what he can tell us.</div><div id="01:19:45.980" class="transcript_line"> You see, there&#039;s Broad Street Common in the parish of Goukli,</div><div id="01:19:53.980" class="transcript_line"> and the land was once part of the estate of the College of Eden.</div><div id="01:19:57.980" class="transcript_line"> Now, his diction wasn&#039;t terribly good.</div><div id="01:20:01.980" class="transcript_line"> He was not terribly good at putting words into sentences, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="01:20:09.980" class="transcript_line"> And he was very clever, but I&#039;ve sort of rewritten what he had done</div><div id="01:20:19.980" class="transcript_line"> so that it makes perhaps a little more sense to people listening these days.</div><div id="01:20:24.980" class="transcript_line"> It would have made more sense to him at the time when he was writing it.</div><div id="01:20:28.980" class="transcript_line"> And here he&#039;s like, I remember.</div><div id="01:20:32.980" class="transcript_line"> So everything&#039;s I remember.</div><div id="01:20:37.980" class="transcript_line"> And this was the fascinating bit.</div><div id="01:20:39.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll just read the first bit.</div><div id="01:20:42.980" class="transcript_line"> I remember there had been talk of a large docks being built on the Nash side of the River Usk.</div><div id="01:20:50.980" class="transcript_line"> However, it did not materialize as the 1914-18 War changed everything,</div><div id="01:20:57.980" class="transcript_line"> putting an end to all the dreams of new prosperity.</div><div id="01:21:01.980" class="transcript_line"> And there had long been speculation before of another railway line from Seven Tunnel</div><div id="01:21:07.980" class="transcript_line"> across the Caldecott levels to the mouth of the Usk.</div><div id="01:21:11.980" class="transcript_line"> However, this idea did not come to fruition,</div><div id="01:21:14.980" class="transcript_line"> and many people who had speculated on the project burnt their fingers.</div><div id="01:21:19.980" class="transcript_line"> And it goes on then to explain who it was and how they&#039;d got it.</div><div id="01:21:25.980" class="transcript_line"> What a fantastic document.</div><div id="01:21:28.980" class="transcript_line"> And then, yes, and there are names like the Brewer Williams,</div><div id="01:21:33.980" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re connected to David&#039;s family.</div><div id="01:21:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And I know where they fit into the history in Newport.</div><div id="01:21:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="01:21:42.980" class="transcript_line"> And yes, there&#039;s all these names.</div><div id="01:21:47.980" class="transcript_line"> And the thing is, I knew these people.</div><div id="01:21:49.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can make the connections, can&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:21:51.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:21:52.980" class="transcript_line"> And you can also give them context.</div><div id="01:21:54.980" class="transcript_line"> I know who they married, who their families were.</div><div id="01:21:59.980" class="transcript_line"> And if that...</div><div id="01:22:00.980" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to have to do a huge wall chart, aren&#039;t you,</div><div id="01:22:03.980" class="transcript_line"> with all these, you know, locations and then family trees associated with them.</div><div id="01:22:08.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:22:09.980" class="transcript_line"> The interesting thing was when I was doing the soldiers,</div><div id="01:22:13.980" class="transcript_line"> and I think there were 70 or more or less, for the exhibition,</div><div id="01:22:19.980" class="transcript_line"> I found it fascinating when I looked back into their past,</div><div id="01:22:23.980" class="transcript_line"> how this went round and round in circles,</div><div id="01:22:29.980" class="transcript_line"> all the intermarrying, because they couldn&#039;t go out of the village.</div><div id="01:22:32.980" class="transcript_line"> They had kind of married into their community.</div><div id="01:22:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yeah.</div><div id="01:22:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And very often they were first or second cousins.</div><div id="01:22:39.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s just a wonder there weren&#039;t more problems locally.</div><div id="01:22:43.980" class="transcript_line"> So what did Hubert do? Was he a farmer?</div><div id="01:22:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, his father was, and some of his brothers were,</div><div id="01:22:51.980" class="transcript_line"> but he chose to work for the river board, you see.</div><div id="01:22:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:22:55.980" class="transcript_line"> So he was maintaining a lot of the waterways.</div><div id="01:22:59.980" class="transcript_line"> So he knew virtually everything that was going on locally.</div><div id="01:23:04.980" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever meet him?</div><div id="01:23:05.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, I knew him. Not a lot.</div><div id="01:23:09.980" class="transcript_line"> But I remember him going round giving talks,</div><div id="01:23:12.980" class="transcript_line"> and people used to call him the local historian.</div><div id="01:23:14.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:23:15.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:23:16.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s almost like he&#039;s passed on the mantle to you.</div><div id="01:23:18.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, I feel that he and I would have got on really well.</div><div id="01:23:22.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:23:23.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I mean, this is a little bit about down on the wharf.</div><div id="01:23:30.980" class="transcript_line"> Who built the tavern? And this is the windbound.</div><div id="01:23:35.980" class="transcript_line"> We do not know, as like its owners, it is lost in history and forgotten.</div><div id="01:23:42.980" class="transcript_line"> It was a very old house. Now, I have a drawing of it.</div><div id="01:23:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Nobody else has, but I&#039;ve drawn it from a sketch he did.</div><div id="01:23:52.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:23:53.980" class="transcript_line"> When I knew it, yes, it was a very old house when I knew it,</div><div id="01:23:57.980" class="transcript_line"> and was built possibly about 1700.</div><div id="01:24:00.980" class="transcript_line"> It was fairly isolated and was on its own,</div><div id="01:24:04.980" class="transcript_line"> but there would possibly have been a group of old fishermen&#039;s huts</div><div id="01:24:09.980" class="transcript_line"> there sometime previously.</div><div id="01:24:11.980" class="transcript_line"> It appeared to be in fairly good condition when I remember it.</div><div id="01:24:14.980" class="transcript_line"> Whitewashed with four largest rooms downstairs</div><div id="01:24:18.980" class="transcript_line"> and two large bedrooms in the front, looking out across the river.</div><div id="01:24:23.980" class="transcript_line"> And so it goes on.</div><div id="01:24:26.980" class="transcript_line"> And Lyn Jones from Nash, her family lived there.</div><div id="01:24:31.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:24:32.980" class="transcript_line"> So why?</div><div id="01:24:34.980" class="transcript_line"> So, and she didn&#039;t even know a lot of what I read at the meeting.</div><div id="01:24:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:24:41.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:24:43.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just fantastic document to have, but you have transcribed it.</div><div id="01:24:48.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s there for the record now, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:24:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:24:51.980" class="transcript_line"> While it&#039;s being lost and thrown into some stick.</div><div id="01:24:53.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was just wondering where I got to in the end.</div><div id="01:24:58.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:24:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Every, everything I&#039;ve written is, and again,</div><div id="01:25:04.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve heard of Dr. William Price.</div><div id="01:25:07.980" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:25:08.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was the one that introduced cremation in this country.</div><div id="01:25:12.980" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:25:13.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my word, you don&#039;t know anything if you don&#039;t know about Dr. William Price.</div><div id="01:25:16.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div id="01:25:18.980" class="transcript_line"> But he was very, I wrote the history of the farmer&#039;s arms in Goldil.</div><div id="01:25:22.980" class="transcript_line"> And he was very much connected to that.</div><div id="01:25:24.980" class="transcript_line"> How was he connected to that?</div><div id="01:25:26.980" class="transcript_line"> He used to come to the village and stay and he used to, he was a doctor.</div><div id="01:25:30.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:25:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And he used to heal people and treat them free because they were poor.</div><div id="01:25:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And he would stay in the farmer&#039;s arms.</div><div id="01:25:39.980" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="01:25:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:25:41.980" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, I&#039;ve written bits and pieces.</div><div id="01:25:44.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness me.</div><div id="01:25:46.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:25:48.980" class="transcript_line"> Extraordinary stuff, Sue.</div><div id="01:25:50.980" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="01:25:51.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my God.</div><div id="01:25:52.980" class="transcript_line"> Look how lovely I&#039;ve written.</div><div id="01:25:54.980" class="transcript_line"> What gorgeous writing.</div><div id="01:25:55.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="01:25:56.980" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t write at all like that.</div><div id="01:25:58.980" class="transcript_line"> When I&#039;m writing, I just do, you know, free fall, as we call it,</div><div id="01:26:04.980" class="transcript_line"> and trying to write the history of Whitsun, the Philipses of Whitsun House.</div><div id="01:26:09.980" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go there with the zoo?</div><div id="01:26:11.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="01:26:12.980" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go there with your children?</div><div id="01:26:15.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I was friendly with Mrs. Mabry.</div><div id="01:26:16.980" class="transcript_line"> I used to spend a lot of time with her.</div><div id="01:26:18.980" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="01:26:19.980" class="transcript_line"> She and I struck up a lovely friendship.</div><div id="01:26:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:26:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And she, yes, when the children were little, she had the zoo.</div><div id="01:26:29.980" class="transcript_line"> So I would push them over in the push chair.</div><div id="01:26:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And I obviously sit by her and talk to her.</div><div id="01:26:36.980" class="transcript_line"> She was interesting.</div><div id="01:26:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:26:38.980" class="transcript_line"> And she, we could set up a conversation, again, a little bit about history.</div><div id="01:26:43.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:26:44.980" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, we used to talk for a little.</div><div id="01:26:47.980" class="transcript_line"> And as the children grew up, she used to say, well, you come over whenever you want and bring your friends.</div><div id="01:26:52.980" class="transcript_line"> So they never had to pay.</div><div id="01:26:53.980" class="transcript_line"> And then as time went on, I would go and sit with her afternoons and keep her company.</div><div id="01:26:59.980" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d make sure we had a lovely tea on the front or something.</div><div id="01:27:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And, of course, she was a bit of a benefactress.</div><div id="01:27:07.980" class="transcript_line"> So we used to have fundraising events for the church there.</div><div id="01:27:13.980" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d say, right, you can have the house as long as you clean it before and after.</div><div id="01:27:18.980" class="transcript_line"> So we did.</div><div id="01:27:19.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had beautiful events there.</div><div id="01:27:23.980" class="transcript_line"> And what was the motivation behind the zoo?</div><div id="01:27:28.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, somebody gave her one or two things to look after.</div><div id="01:27:33.980" class="transcript_line"> And it just seemed to grow.</div><div id="01:27:34.980" class="transcript_line"> People were always giving her things.</div><div id="01:27:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And then eventually, I suppose she thought, well, I might just as well have a bit of a zoo.</div><div id="01:27:44.980" class="transcript_line"> And she had local people who made cages and so forth.</div><div id="01:27:50.980" class="transcript_line"> And it just grew.</div><div id="01:27:52.980" class="transcript_line"> I can remember one night we had a church meeting there.</div><div id="01:27:56.980" class="transcript_line"> And the lion was on the settee.</div><div id="01:27:59.980" class="transcript_line"> And she said, well, will you wait a minute while I put the lion back in its cage?</div><div id="01:28:06.980" class="transcript_line"> That was quite funny.</div><div id="01:28:08.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s hello.</div><div id="01:28:09.980" class="transcript_line"> Stopped by and she said, oh, she said, I&#039;ve lost a snake.</div><div id="01:28:14.980" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen it anywhere?</div><div id="01:28:17.980" class="transcript_line"> I looked at her and I said, well, no, is it poisonous?</div><div id="01:28:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, she said, it crushes you to death.</div><div id="01:28:25.980" class="transcript_line"> That made us laugh.</div><div id="01:28:27.980" class="transcript_line"> Thankfully, I don&#039;t know what, I&#039;m sure they recaptured it or something.</div><div id="01:28:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Could you hear the lions roaring?</div><div id="01:28:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, especially in the summer.</div><div id="01:28:36.980" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have our windows up because we sleep in the front.</div><div id="01:28:39.980" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d have this roaring through the night because they didn&#039;t like the discomfort of the heat.</div><div id="01:28:45.980" class="transcript_line"> But I would have thought they would be bred into that.</div><div id="01:28:49.980" class="transcript_line"> And peacocks.</div><div id="01:28:50.980" class="transcript_line"> She always had peacocks and they&#039;d scream as well.</div><div id="01:28:53.980" class="transcript_line"> And monkeys as well.</div><div id="01:28:55.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but we didn&#039;t hear the monkeys.</div><div id="01:28:57.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hilarious, really.</div><div id="01:28:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:29:00.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very conscious.</div><div id="01:29:02.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been here a long time.</div><div id="01:29:03.980" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, Sue. You&#039;re just so fascinating.</div><div id="01:29:05.980" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="01:29:06.980" class="transcript_line"> Are you too young to remember the war?</div><div id="01:29:08.980" class="transcript_line"> The war.</div><div id="01:29:10.980" class="transcript_line"> Second World War.</div><div id="01:29:11.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah. I wasn&#039;t born till after it finished in 1945.</div><div id="01:29:14.980" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember the winter of 63?</div><div id="01:29:18.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, yes.</div><div id="01:29:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:29:20.980" class="transcript_line"> What was it like here?</div><div id="01:29:21.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, horrendous.</div><div id="01:29:22.980" class="transcript_line"> Horrendous.</div><div id="01:29:23.980" class="transcript_line"> Here, well, and I remember especially the 83 one, and I took pictures and film of the 83 one here.</div><div id="01:29:35.980" class="transcript_line"> But 63, people couldn&#039;t move around.</div><div id="01:29:39.980" class="transcript_line"> And it stayed from Boxing Day until March almost.</div><div id="01:29:44.980" class="transcript_line"> And here especially, all the water froze.</div><div id="01:29:48.980" class="transcript_line"> And they were trying to get specialist people to come and unfreeze the water under the pill and came in under the pill.</div><div id="01:29:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Because that would have been particularly here.</div><div id="01:30:03.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes. The only water supply in the house, we had a huge water tank in the attic.</div><div id="01:30:08.980" class="transcript_line"> And they would carry churns of water up there every day to fill it.</div><div id="01:30:14.980" class="transcript_line"> And I think David had probably 50 head of cattle in the sheds.</div><div id="01:30:20.980" class="transcript_line"> And they drink, I don&#039;t know how many, 25 gallons a day.</div><div id="01:30:24.980" class="transcript_line"> And they had to carry water from the pill, because it was a running stream, up to the sheds every day.</div><div id="01:30:33.980" class="transcript_line"> There was an Italian man working here at the time.</div><div id="01:30:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And most of their day was taken up between milkings and just hauling water.</div><div id="01:30:45.980" class="transcript_line"> And it was cruel, you know.</div><div id="01:30:48.980" class="transcript_line"> There was ice on every reen.</div><div id="01:30:50.980" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="01:30:51.980" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t turn the cattle out anyway, which you wouldn&#039;t have done.</div><div id="01:30:57.980" class="transcript_line"> So, oh no.</div><div id="01:31:00.980" class="transcript_line"> David, he could talk for ages on that.</div><div id="01:31:04.980" class="transcript_line"> It was horrendous.</div><div id="01:31:05.980" class="transcript_line"> And the drought of 76, was that equally as bad?</div><div id="01:31:08.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, terrible for us. Terrible.</div><div id="01:31:10.980" class="transcript_line"> We always reared all our heifers, because heifers were very expensive to buy in 76.</div><div id="01:31:18.980" class="transcript_line"> So we had about 23.</div><div id="01:31:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Now, we would have had 70 or 80 cows at the time.</div><div id="01:31:26.980" class="transcript_line"> And there was no fodder in the winter.</div><div id="01:31:28.980" class="transcript_line"> In the summer there was no grass for them.</div><div id="01:31:30.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had to feed straw, because it was the only thing we had.</div><div id="01:31:34.980" class="transcript_line"> We had to keep what hay we had for the winter feed.</div><div id="01:31:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Was straw not a good thing to feed, Kathy?</div><div id="01:31:40.980" class="transcript_line"> No, it hurts their mouths.</div><div id="01:31:42.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really? Yeah.</div><div id="01:31:43.980" class="transcript_line"> So we went into silage in those days.</div><div id="01:31:46.980" class="transcript_line"> It hadn&#039;t taken off.</div><div id="01:31:48.980" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d taken land all over the place.</div><div id="01:31:52.980" class="transcript_line"> We always had to buy 100 acres, very nearly, of grass keep, as we call it.</div><div id="01:31:58.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had some at Katzash, up at Harry Ross&#039;s.</div><div id="01:32:06.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know where else.</div><div id="01:32:08.980" class="transcript_line"> We had some at Wilcric.</div><div id="01:32:09.980" class="transcript_line"> We had some at Redwick.</div><div id="01:32:12.980" class="transcript_line"> And our cattle were starving.</div><div id="01:32:14.980" class="transcript_line"> We had to feed them straw.</div><div id="01:32:16.980" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have to go all over the place with your trailer full of straw to feed these every day.</div><div id="01:32:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And when it came to the time we had nothing left, we had to sell our heifers.</div><div id="01:32:27.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God. It was that desperate?</div><div id="01:32:29.980" class="transcript_line"> It was desperate.</div><div id="01:32:30.980" class="transcript_line"> And I think our neighbor bought most of them in market.</div><div id="01:32:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And that set us back farming-wise for years.</div><div id="01:32:40.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="01:32:41.980" class="transcript_line"> You know, because you have a three-year cycle with your heifer to cow.</div><div id="01:32:44.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:32:45.980" class="transcript_line"> We lost a lot of money.</div><div id="01:32:47.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:32:48.980" class="transcript_line"> But there was no recompense for farmers who had lost money in any circumstances.</div><div id="01:32:55.980" class="transcript_line"> So, yes.</div><div id="01:32:57.980" class="transcript_line"> Foot and mouth were different crises then.</div><div id="01:32:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, foot and mouth didn&#039;t affect us here.</div><div id="01:33:02.980" class="transcript_line"> I can remember we had all the signs up and we had disinfectant.</div><div id="01:33:06.980" class="transcript_line"> There was one in 1966 we had.</div><div id="01:33:10.980" class="transcript_line"> And that was a bit closer to us.</div><div id="01:33:13.980" class="transcript_line"> But the 90 whatever one didn&#039;t affect us.</div><div id="01:33:17.980" class="transcript_line"> At all.</div><div id="01:33:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, Sue. I&#039;ll bring it to an end very soon.</div><div id="01:33:23.980" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll be delighted to hear.</div><div id="01:33:24.980" class="transcript_line"> I just wondered about...</div><div id="01:33:25.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m loving it.</div><div id="01:33:26.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, are you?</div><div id="01:33:27.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, good, because I am too.</div><div id="01:33:29.980" class="transcript_line"> Newport. Would you consider Newport to be part of the levels?</div><div id="01:33:34.980" class="transcript_line"> No, not from Liswery onwards.</div><div id="01:33:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Once the land starts to rise at Liswery towards Summerton, towards Chepster Road, the land rises.</div><div id="01:33:45.980" class="transcript_line"> No. Up as far as Summerton.</div><div id="01:33:49.980" class="transcript_line"> And you can imagine it&#039;s got its name from the fact that it was the summer grazing grounds.</div><div id="01:33:55.980" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t look like spelling the same.</div><div id="01:33:59.980" class="transcript_line"> But David will tell you his father remembers that farmed right up as far as what we call Corporation Road where the bridges are.</div><div id="01:34:11.980" class="transcript_line"> And they go over.</div><div id="01:34:12.980" class="transcript_line"> And that would have been flat up to there.</div><div id="01:34:15.980" class="transcript_line"> And that would have been levels going back 150 years.</div><div id="01:34:22.980" class="transcript_line"> So no, we wouldn&#039;t consider...</div><div id="01:34:29.980" class="transcript_line"> Once we get up through Liswery, we don&#039;t think of it any longer as being part of the Moors as we called it.</div><div id="01:34:35.980" class="transcript_line"> So was Newport the place where you would go shopping or livestock market?</div><div id="01:34:39.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="01:34:41.980" class="transcript_line"> The fresh fruit and veg market?</div><div id="01:34:45.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, definitely. On a Wednesday, the farmers would go to market.</div><div id="01:34:51.980" class="transcript_line"> Their wives didn&#039;t drive, so the wives went.</div><div id="01:34:54.980" class="transcript_line"> And I remember all my aunts who were farmers&#039; wives who had all meeting Newport.</div><div id="01:35:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Every shop, every building was a shop with something that people needed.</div><div id="01:35:06.980" class="transcript_line"> And the market was a hive of industry.</div><div id="01:35:10.980" class="transcript_line"> Griffin Street, where our shop was, was alive with shops.</div><div id="01:35:14.980" class="transcript_line"> And people could park anywhere.</div><div id="01:35:17.980" class="transcript_line"> I remember we used to park outside the town hall where the clock was because the bank was next door.</div><div id="01:35:23.980" class="transcript_line"> I remember feeding the babies in the car.</div><div id="01:35:26.980" class="transcript_line"> We used to take hot water flasks to feed.</div><div id="01:35:30.980" class="transcript_line"> And you met everybody. You bumped into people.</div><div id="01:35:34.980" class="transcript_line"> There was every type of business you could imagine.</div><div id="01:35:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Expensive jewellery shops, beautiful cafes, all with different character of their own.</div><div id="01:35:47.980" class="transcript_line"> And you always had a second story like the Cardoma where you could look down into the street and see what&#039;s around.</div><div id="01:35:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful dress shops, lovely stores.</div><div id="01:35:59.980" class="transcript_line"> I can remember one shop EG Taylor where they had a machine that took your money and it flew right across the shop on a chain.</div><div id="01:36:08.980" class="transcript_line"> And it came out the other end and then you had to change back and unscrew these little pots and your money would be in it.</div><div id="01:36:16.980" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, beautiful shoe shops, wonderful tailors, bespoke tailors as well.</div><div id="01:36:24.980" class="transcript_line"> I can remember my father having his coats made with this bespoke tailor and his shoes.</div><div id="01:36:30.980" class="transcript_line"> He used to wear britches up to his knees.</div><div id="01:36:34.980" class="transcript_line"> Britches, no, what do you call them?</div><div id="01:36:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Leggings.</div><div id="01:36:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Leggings up to the top of his britches.</div><div id="01:36:40.980" class="transcript_line"> That wood button.</div><div id="01:36:41.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="01:36:42.980" class="transcript_line"> He used to wear those and sports coats he&#039;d have made.</div><div id="01:36:45.980" class="transcript_line"> Yellow waistcoats.</div><div id="01:36:48.980" class="transcript_line"> And my mother used to have her suits tailored.</div><div id="01:36:52.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, Newport was alive and gorgeous properties like the town hall and the library and everything.</div><div id="01:37:00.980" class="transcript_line"> And they just knocked it all down.</div><div id="01:37:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And the Lyceum Theatre with these wonderful structure with all these pillars, a bit like Covent Garden, the Opera House.</div><div id="01:37:10.980" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember my mother taking me to pantomimes there and seeing ice skating on ice in those days.</div><div id="01:37:19.980" class="transcript_line"> There were music halls, there were dance places.</div><div id="01:37:24.980" class="transcript_line"> It was just wonderful.</div><div id="01:37:28.980" class="transcript_line"> And we used to have a carnival and we&#039;d be taken in and you&#039;d sit on the windows of the bank or something and wait for the carnival to go past.</div><div id="01:37:38.980" class="transcript_line"> It was huge.</div><div id="01:37:40.980" class="transcript_line"> But the population of Newport wouldn&#039;t have been any more than about 25,000 in those days, maybe 30.</div><div id="01:37:47.980" class="transcript_line"> And now we&#039;re looking at 100 and not 1000.</div><div id="01:37:49.980" class="transcript_line"> It sounds like it was a thriving place.</div><div id="01:37:51.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh it was.</div><div id="01:37:52.980" class="transcript_line"> But you had lots of industry and the docks were huge then too, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:37:56.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was industry down there and of course there was Lysats and all the other places, all of that.</div><div id="01:38:03.980" class="transcript_line"> But the farmers would stand market Fridays and Saturdays and the market, at the top of the market you had this huge floor</div><div id="01:38:13.980" class="transcript_line"> where all the farmers would have their chicken and their produce, their butter and their cream all the way round.</div><div id="01:38:19.980" class="transcript_line"> And our shop was absolutely thriving in Griffin Street because people could pull up outside the market opposite the shop.</div><div id="01:38:27.980" class="transcript_line"> We had mobile shops that used to go around the villages on a Tuesday.</div><div id="01:38:31.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="01:38:32.980" class="transcript_line"> They would deliver all the meat on a Saturday for people&#039;s roasts in all the villages.</div><div id="01:38:39.980" class="transcript_line"> So all my aunts and uncles worked in this business.</div><div id="01:38:43.980" class="transcript_line"> So it was one of the bigger butchers&#039; shops in Newport.</div><div id="01:38:48.980" class="transcript_line"> And yes, and I was told many stories by many people that during the war,</div><div id="01:38:57.980" class="transcript_line"> my grandfather used to supply an awful lot of businesses with meat.</div><div id="01:39:04.980" class="transcript_line"> But on a Saturday night, there were a lot of people down the pill area and the poorer areas of Newport who didn&#039;t have money</div><div id="01:39:12.980" class="transcript_line"> and the kids would be without shoes and so forth.</div><div id="01:39:16.980" class="transcript_line"> And my grandfather would hold an auction on a Saturday night because they had no cold stores you see.</div><div id="01:39:22.980" class="transcript_line"> So all the meat that was killed had to be got rid of.</div><div id="01:39:25.980" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d auction off this meat and he used to make sure he&#039;d auction it off to people for nothing.</div><div id="01:39:32.980" class="transcript_line"> So they had meat for Sundays.</div><div id="01:39:34.980" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="01:39:35.980" class="transcript_line"> If anybody came up with, looked a bit poor, he would make sure they had.</div><div id="01:39:43.980" class="transcript_line"> And one day I was with the NFU doing a stand-up job in Newport Square</div><div id="01:39:51.980" class="transcript_line"> trying to present to people what farmers could produce.</div><div id="01:39:59.980" class="transcript_line"> So we wanted them to know that we were still around producing their food.</div><div id="01:40:04.980" class="transcript_line"> And a little old lady came along and we got talking.</div><div id="01:40:08.980" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, I&#039;ve always bought my stuff in the market and I liked fresh food.</div><div id="01:40:15.980" class="transcript_line"> And she said, and there was an old gentleman, Mr. Collymore, when we were children, we couldn&#039;t afford meat.</div><div id="01:40:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And my mother used to come and take us children down there and we&#039;d always have something for Sunday.</div><div id="01:40:28.980" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, oh, well, that story was true.</div><div id="01:40:30.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s lovely, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:40:32.980" class="transcript_line"> It was nice to hear.</div><div id="01:40:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, to have it confirmed by a third party as well.</div><div id="01:40:36.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because a lot of people used to talk about it and I never knew for sure until this lady.</div><div id="01:40:42.980" class="transcript_line"> I thought, what a coincidence that I should talk to her.</div><div id="01:40:48.980" class="transcript_line"> Do you know places like Redwick and Furtherfield, Mega and Rocket?</div><div id="01:40:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Do you consider them, they consider themselves to be the Moors?</div><div id="01:40:59.980" class="transcript_line"> They talk about the Moors.</div><div id="01:41:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:41:01.980" class="transcript_line"> Do you from here consider them to be the Moors?</div><div id="01:41:03.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="01:41:04.980" class="transcript_line"> And so is there any relation to them or are all the villages here quite separate?</div><div id="01:41:12.980" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve become more related of latter years since the children have been going to Mega school from this area.</div><div id="01:41:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, OK.</div><div id="01:41:20.980" class="transcript_line"> And you get to know all the mums and whatever.</div><div id="01:41:23.980" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve always connected from the farming point of view because a lot of my relatives and a lot of David&#039;s relatives live in those areas, in all those villages.</div><div id="01:41:33.980" class="transcript_line"> When I was at school and my friends lived over that area, I was often staying up there.</div><div id="01:41:41.980" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the hunt coming into the square at Mega.</div><div id="01:41:44.980" class="transcript_line"> And it was just a tiny little village, Mega was, when we were children.</div><div id="01:41:49.980" class="transcript_line"> That you&#039;d walk down to from whoever&#039;s home you were staying at.</div><div id="01:41:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:41:55.980" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose we&#039;ve seen that grow into almost a town size.</div><div id="01:42:00.980" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s strange.</div><div id="01:42:01.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s changed everything.</div><div id="01:42:03.980" class="transcript_line"> And the road system round.</div><div id="01:42:05.980" class="transcript_line"> When they came and put Tesco&#039;s there, that change started to change Mega and the brewery and all of that.</div><div id="01:42:14.980" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, we still feel relatively.</div><div id="01:42:16.980" class="transcript_line"> And of latter years we&#039;ve become a ministry area, a benefits area.</div><div id="01:42:22.980" class="transcript_line"> But through the churches, for the last 30, perhaps 35 years, I&#039;ve been connected with all the churches out there through my work.</div><div id="01:42:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:42:34.980" class="transcript_line"> And you get to know more people.</div><div id="01:42:36.980" class="transcript_line"> So, I have felt connected for a very long time.</div><div id="01:42:40.980" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m sure there are other people like me.</div><div id="01:42:42.980" class="transcript_line"> Maybe not many, but some of us have been involved with church life in that particular area.</div><div id="01:42:52.980" class="transcript_line"> Would you say it&#039;s still strong here, too, church life?</div><div id="01:42:55.980" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing like it was.</div><div id="01:42:57.980" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:42:58.980" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s quite sad.</div><div id="01:43:00.980" class="transcript_line"> Our congregation has dwindled with age.</div><div id="01:43:04.980" class="transcript_line"> And, yes, it is a huge change.</div><div id="01:43:10.980" class="transcript_line"> So, perhaps we could talk about that again sometime.</div><div id="01:43:15.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:43:16.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just very excited about the time because...</div><div id="01:43:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Do you have other appointments now?</div><div id="01:43:21.980" class="transcript_line"> No, for you.</div><div id="01:43:22.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what time is it, Sue?</div><div id="01:43:24.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s 25 to 2.</div><div id="01:43:25.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:43:26.980" class="transcript_line"> So, I&#039;ve got one at 2.30.</div><div id="01:43:27.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:43:28.980" class="transcript_line"> So, is there anything else you&#039;d like to add?</div><div id="01:43:30.980" class="transcript_line"> I have so much I&#039;d like to add, but perhaps we could do more another time.</div><div id="01:43:34.980" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:43:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Should I turn this off now?</div><div id="01:43:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div></div></p>
