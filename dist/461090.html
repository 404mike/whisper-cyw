    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, we still discuss that even now when we watch the games now because there really is a 50-50 on it.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You definitely see far more of the game on television, but you see far more of the game watching it live.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You get the overall picture of the field, which television doesn&#039;t capture,</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and when that ball comes out in the field, you sense, oh, there&#039;s an overlap, there&#039;s a try on here and you know there&#039;s expectation.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> On television, even though the camera work I think is very, very good, you don&#039;t see that.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It develops as the passing goes along and you think, all of a sudden, oh, there&#039;s an overlap, which you&#039;re not aware of prior to the camera&#039;s self-moving.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no pan back. I do feel occasionally when watching matches, they would benefit from having a quick camera back to give us an overall picture of the field.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think it&#039;s quite often, you can&#039;t see in the field who puts a hand on the ball to bring it back.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t see on the field who&#039;s doing a bit of the dirty nonsense. On television, it&#039;s very, very clear.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d say the balance is 50-50.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think being at the game, of course, you do get that hoi, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And it generates a little bit more of that excitement, the noise and everything else.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But having said that, as I&#039;m getting older, I feel that watching it in the rugby club, the hoi and the noise we get there, it generates.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always a big crowd there. It&#039;s satisfying my knees now, but not in the centre as well.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, it was glory days. We had a fluke. We had seven or eight of the world&#039;s best players in the same team.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just a sheer joy to watch them play.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, several of them, because of the age thing, you knew. You knew some of the players as well. You knew them personally. So that attitude as well.</div></div></p>
