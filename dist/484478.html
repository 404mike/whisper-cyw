    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interdueur Steve Fletcher, interviewee Alice</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Chapman-Viersma. The date today is Sunday the 25th January 2015. The venue for the interview</div><div id="00:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> is the Swicker office. Alice, for the record, would you be kind enough to spell your name</div><div id="00:00:28.440" class="transcript_line"> in full please? Absolutely, now married Alice Wearsma-Jones. A-L-I-C-E-W-I-E-R-S-M-A-</div><div id="00:00:36.840" class="transcript_line"> hyphen J-O-N-E-S. That&#039;s very kind of you. Sorry for getting you. It&#039;s fine. Sorry if we&#039;re not</div><div id="00:00:43.240" class="transcript_line"> married. We recently married. No absolutely. I&#039;ve known you for a long time. It&#039;s magic. So how did</div><div id="00:00:48.520" class="transcript_line"> you first come across the Cardiff Carnival? Okay, wow, my first experience with Carnival.</div><div id="00:00:55.880" class="transcript_line"> I think that it can be put into three categories. First as a consumer, second as a participator,</div><div id="00:01:04.600" class="transcript_line"> and then third as a facilitator. So, consumer, very young child, on the shoulders of my father,</div><div id="00:01:15.640" class="transcript_line"> perhaps in Butetown, perhaps in the town centre, probably in Butetown actually considering how</div><div id="00:01:19.880" class="transcript_line"> long it was ago. I can remember big jangly glittery sparkly things coming past me and lots of</div><div id="00:01:27.320" class="transcript_line"> jemming and lots of exciting sunny happy shiny memories. Second as a participator, I think I&#039;m</div><div id="00:01:38.200" class="transcript_line"> gonna have to start with my memories of Jab Jab. So being perhaps 14, 15 years old and coming down</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> to the Chapter Art Centre, obviously leading up to this sort of lots of making and sequins sticking</div><div id="00:01:53.880" class="transcript_line"> and glittering and all of that sort of stuff. But then I remember a very sunny afternoon,</div><div id="00:02:00.760" class="transcript_line"> sort of packing up all of the costumes, helping to pack up all the costumes and then coming back down</div><div id="00:02:07.160" class="transcript_line"> a really, really sunny evening, being instructed to wear as little as possible.</div><div id="00:02:13.160" class="transcript_line"> So coming in a pair of hot pants and a bikini top and covering ourselves from head to foot in mud,</div><div id="00:02:20.600" class="transcript_line"> so mud on our legs, mud on our arms, mud on our bellies, mud stripes on our faces,</div><div id="00:02:26.040" class="transcript_line"> and being given two sticks and banging them together and marching through the town centre</div><div id="00:02:31.880" class="transcript_line"> saying you know me well Jab Jab I come from hell Jab Jab you know me well Jab Jab I come from hell</div><div id="00:02:39.560" class="transcript_line"> obviously with all the Jemmas and what have you. And yeah being only sort of I must have been about</div><div id="00:02:45.720" class="transcript_line"> 14, 15, perhaps 16 and then ending up in the Welsh Club and just having the best night of my life,</div><div id="00:02:54.600" class="transcript_line"> ridiculously underage. But they&#039;re not going to be able to tell and I&#039;m covering myself in mud</div><div id="00:03:00.840" class="transcript_line"> and obviously with lots of different people and yeah just having a great time and meeting</div><div id="00:03:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Melissa, Carnival Jem dancer, Melissa for the first time. She was seeing a school friend of</div><div id="00:03:11.880" class="transcript_line"> mine Sam at the time and yeah just having a great time dancing with her and enjoying life, loving</div><div id="00:03:19.160" class="transcript_line"> life, really loving the Carnival. And then must have been the next day or the day after that</div><div id="00:03:25.320" class="transcript_line"> doing the Carnival Parade with my friend Zoe Hewitt who&#039;s also a Carnival artist.</div><div id="00:03:30.280" class="transcript_line"> So yeah really fond memories of that sort of first getting involved experience in the Carnival.</div><div id="00:03:37.160" class="transcript_line"> And then a bit later on in life obviously through the teenage years having such a great time myself</div><div id="00:03:44.840" class="transcript_line"> wanting to pass that experience on to children that I work with as a teacher, educator. I wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:51.800" class="transcript_line"> actually a qualified teacher at the time I was a learning support assistant working in a school in</div><div id="00:03:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Trowbridge and I got a little carnival group together in school and we did lots of face painting</div><div id="00:04:06.760" class="transcript_line"> and we made our own costumes, we tie-dyed some clothes that the kids brought in actually,</div><div id="00:04:15.480" class="transcript_line"> I just asked them to bring in some white clothes and we tie-dyed them into tiger colours</div><div id="00:04:21.480" class="transcript_line"> and for the parade itself we painted our bodies in tiger paints and we danced in front of Rocco</div><div id="00:04:30.120" class="transcript_line"> and his in steel pans and I think that for me was the the most rewarding carnival experience I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:04:37.720" class="transcript_line"> had for the first time bringing a bunch of kids down. Obviously Trowbridge at the time was a very</div><div id="00:04:43.960" class="transcript_line"> very white area, not so much now because we&#039;ve got lots of refugee communities that have moved</div><div id="00:04:49.080" class="transcript_line"> into the area with the whole the government&#039;s dispersion ideas and what have you but at the</div><div id="00:04:54.680" class="transcript_line"> time it would have been our kids&#039; only sort of exposure to Caribbean culture and they absolutely</div><div id="00:05:02.280" class="transcript_line"> loved it coming down and getting involved in mass and then the actual parade itself,</div><div id="00:05:08.280" class="transcript_line"> it was just really really wonderful for them and obviously my experiences growing up of carnival</div><div id="00:05:14.520" class="transcript_line"> loving it myself but then being able to work with young people and get them involved in a project</div><div id="00:05:21.720" class="transcript_line"> that they would otherwise not have the possibility to access, just really really rewarding,</div><div id="00:05:30.520" class="transcript_line"> really rewarding and just great for them as well to have that experience. The area that I&#039;m teaching</div><div id="00:05:39.080" class="transcript_line"> is socially deprived and economically deprived but also culturally deprived,</div><div id="00:05:43.320" class="transcript_line"> not like you know your classic schools down the bay or in Grangetown or whatever. Obviously there&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:49.240" class="transcript_line"> lots of culture and colour and life and things happening in those areas, there&#039;s lots going on</div><div id="00:05:56.520" class="transcript_line"> all the time but in Trowbridge it&#039;s right on the edge of the city. When the shops burnt down it</div><div id="00:06:03.960" class="transcript_line"> took them three years to rebuild them so you&#039;re looking at the poorest people in Cardiff having</div><div id="00:06:08.520" class="transcript_line"> to catch a bus to go and buy a packet of cigarettes so you know there&#039;s nowhere for</div><div id="00:06:13.320" class="transcript_line"> them to go shopping let alone for them to go and dance and sing and sort of experience a</div><div id="00:06:21.160" class="transcript_line"> cultural event as it were so being able to provide that experience for those children</div><div id="00:06:28.040" class="transcript_line"> has just been fantastic. That&#039;s brilliant, you yourself personally have played a number of</div><div id="00:06:33.960" class="transcript_line"> different costumes when you&#039;re not entirely covered in mud. Any of them spring to mind for</div><div id="00:06:42.120" class="transcript_line"> reasons good bad or good bad or ugly? I think straight away the first thing that comes to mind</div><div id="00:06:49.160" class="transcript_line"> is that tiger costume that I was talking about earlier having got these kids who have very little</div><div id="00:06:54.680" class="transcript_line"> to go and buy their own white clothes for them we witch tie dyed and then painting them from head to</div><div id="00:07:02.200" class="transcript_line"> foot in tiger coloured paint and then that year actually pissed down with rain. Is that a technical</div><div id="00:07:10.840" class="transcript_line"> term? I sort of promised them holiday clothes that they could wear and they were really quite</div><div id="00:07:18.520" class="transcript_line"> excited to have these new little skirts and whatnot that were tie dyed so they were looking</div><div id="00:07:22.680" class="transcript_line"> forward to taking them camping and what have you and then of course it rained and I think if I just</div><div id="00:07:28.760" class="transcript_line"> stuck to the yellow and orange it would have been fine but I put black tiger stripes over the top</div><div id="00:07:35.160" class="transcript_line"> of the yellow and orange dapples and their face paint ran all over their costumes and they were</div><div id="00:07:41.480" class="transcript_line"> completely ruined. The kids seemed absolutely fine about it. Isn&#039;t it weird what&#039;s your attitude</div><div id="00:07:47.160" class="transcript_line"> with rain and carnival because it doesn&#039;t we&#039;ve worked so hard and such a feeling of wanting to</div><div id="00:07:52.280" class="transcript_line"> you know the gun is loaded and come the day you really want to go down that road and do your thing.</div><div id="00:07:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it hasn&#039;t that wasn&#039;t the only rainy year I can remember the the second year I took a bunch</div><div id="00:08:01.960" class="transcript_line"> of kids I deliberately designed umbrellas with that group. I&#039;d been to the pound shop in town</div><div id="00:08:09.480" class="transcript_line"> and I bought seven or eight or twelve or however many kids I had that year matching umbrellas and</div><div id="00:08:14.200" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d spent the week decorating them with sequins and putting sort of jewels around the edges and</div><div id="00:08:20.520" class="transcript_line"> sparkles hanging bits even and it was they were really really pretty but I think after about a</div><div id="00:08:26.600" class="transcript_line"> mile or less than that even we dumped them and we were just dancing in the rain having a great time</div><div id="00:08:32.680" class="transcript_line"> so I really you know I think that obviously the sun shining it&#039;s beautiful I think maybe the people</div><div id="00:08:40.520" class="transcript_line"> watching the carnival have a better time but in terms of us lot getting involved in dancing away</div><div id="00:08:47.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think the weather really matters at all. Well your enthusiasm and passion for carnival has</div><div id="00:08:52.120" class="transcript_line"> been some self-evidence and as you say you&#039;ve gone through these three different stages but</div><div id="00:08:58.120" class="transcript_line"> besides the carnival I mean you&#039;ve even raised money and attracted swicker to do a carnival project</div><div id="00:09:05.240" class="transcript_line"> at your school taking us back to the source as it were so I&#039;d just say a few words about</div><div id="00:09:11.880" class="transcript_line"> carnival Europa because it was a great experience. Yeah well I think that the there&#039;s two projects</div><div id="00:09:17.960" class="transcript_line"> really sticking my mind there and the first one being the lantern parade that you guys did for us</div><div id="00:09:23.400" class="transcript_line"> which was initially supposed to be a summer carnival but of course the funding didn&#039;t come</div><div id="00:09:27.800" class="transcript_line"> through in time so then hoping to save that money for the following summer and then realising that</div><div id="00:09:33.640" class="transcript_line"> the money had to be spent in this within a certain time frame as well so we ended up doing after your</div><div id="00:09:40.120" class="transcript_line"> your advice and ideas we did a winter lantern parade and that was magical for me having never</div><div id="00:09:46.680" class="transcript_line"> experienced or got involved in any of your lantern parades in the past. It was children</div><div id="00:09:53.800" class="transcript_line"> using willow and paper to make these sort of fantastic structures which we then were able</div><div id="00:09:59.800" class="transcript_line"> to light up. Fabulous for the kids I think lots of the parents assumed that we were making those</div><div id="00:10:06.360" class="transcript_line"> Chinese lanterns that you let off up into the sky so when I told them that we&#039;d be sort of carrying</div><div id="00:10:12.520" class="transcript_line"> these lanterns on sticks and they get to actually take them home at the end of the day they were</div><div id="00:10:16.920" class="transcript_line"> just they were absolutely loving it and for months we had these incredible structures sort</div><div id="00:10:21.880" class="transcript_line"> of hanging all over the school which were just beautiful that sort of rainbow colours and white</div><div id="00:10:26.680" class="transcript_line"> and yeah that was really magical so you know my first experience of making something much more</div><div id="00:10:32.280" class="transcript_line"> three-dimensional than a headdress or a costume that was really fantastic and seeing you know</div><div id="00:10:37.880" class="transcript_line"> a carnival in the middle of winter as well I think we called it light up the streets with</div><div id="00:10:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Trowbridge or something and that was really great seeing the people out on the streets</div><div id="00:10:46.360" class="transcript_line"> seeing the kids dancing and having that sort of carnival fever feeling in the middle of January</div><div id="00:10:51.880" class="transcript_line"> that was really fab. Carnival Europa I think that was more towards the summer it&#039;s been so many I</div><div id="00:10:58.920" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t remember now but yeah again going back to the the real real fact that there is no cultural</div><div id="00:11:08.120" class="transcript_line"> experiences in that part of Cardiff there was nothing for kids to get involved in</div><div id="00:11:13.640" class="transcript_line"> just seeing that area come alive with colour and costumes and music and people out in the park</div><div id="00:11:20.360" class="transcript_line"> watching us dance and the children&#039;s involvement just absolutely magical really really special</div><div id="00:11:26.120" class="transcript_line"> experience for the kids and for the staff involved. And for team Swicker they came</div><div id="00:11:30.120" class="transcript_line"> plus I remember the French Cockerel was a big thing a French Cockerel I mean they they come back</div><div id="00:11:35.240" class="transcript_line"> every day and sort of talk about that and yeah it was like yeah we had European students absolutely</div><div id="00:11:41.080" class="transcript_line"> yeah they were great really nice bunch of bunch of students um yeah we all were European worked</div><div id="00:11:46.360" class="transcript_line"> really well with the kids and it was quite nice to have you know yes they sort of worked on their</div><div id="00:11:50.680" class="transcript_line"> sections of the parade one of the fab things as well um you guys gave all the teachers a costume</div><div id="00:11:56.600" class="transcript_line"> and they sort of naturally as teachers do formed their own group in the carnival parade so we had</div><div id="00:12:04.040" class="transcript_line"> the French section the Spanish section and then the teachers section</div><div id="00:12:07.320" class="transcript_line"> somewhere near the back it was fab and then we all were and obviously I was running around but the</div><div id="00:12:13.560" class="transcript_line"> rest of them were all there and they were dragon wings and giant headdresses and whatnot just</div><div id="00:12:18.120" class="transcript_line"> looking absolutely fantastic that was one of the things that Adrian carnival organiser really liked</div><div id="00:12:23.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah he was like I love the way your teachers formed a section and there was a teacher&#039;s section</div><div id="00:12:27.720" class="transcript_line"> going on the back with a head teacher and everything and a beautiful headdress</div><div id="00:12:31.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah it&#039;s absolutely fab and at this point I&#039;d like to award you the completely valueless but</div><div id="00:12:38.200" class="transcript_line"> invaluable accolade of a Cardiff carnival hero for your longevity for the three different ways in</div><div id="00:12:47.160" class="transcript_line"> which you have contributed and enjoyed Cardiff carnival but I think the one that becomes most</div><div id="00:12:53.320" class="transcript_line"> important uh I&#039;d like to just underline is as a facilitator a gatekeeper who</div><div id="00:13:00.200" class="transcript_line"> who has no doubts is the value of carnival and constantly has you know gone an above and above</div><div id="00:13:07.320" class="transcript_line"> and beyond the call of any kind of duty to make sure that other people and young people in</div><div id="00:13:12.280" class="transcript_line"> particular can have an opportunity so Alice you are hereby officially dubbed Cardiff carnival hero</div><div id="00:13:17.880" class="transcript_line"> thank you very much that&#039;s really kind</div></div></p>
