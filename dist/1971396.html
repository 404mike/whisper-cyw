I mean, obviously some are more memorable than others.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we were really nervous, obviously, because it was the first kind of live event and we&#039;d been planning for months.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d had to do it from scratch. We had to come up with a logo, the name, all the branding, the material, the promotion and the kind of guidelines to the ship.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the volunteer group of friendly faces, you know, we had to recruit and train and all of that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So it had been a really busy, hectic kind of four months. And then all of a sudden, the day was the day sort of thing.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just one of the smaller ships, the Corinthian, who comes back about 10 times through the season each year.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They were our first and which was probably just as well because there&#039;s only 100 passengers on there.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, everything went off as we planned. You know, in fact, it better really. They were really pleased.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We were really chuffed. It was a very exciting and tiring day. At that point, we did a welcome and a farewell for the smaller ship.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was literally all day for us. But that&#039;s evolved into just welcomes for the smaller ships now.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we had musicians, we had I couldn&#039;t tell you which entertainment then because that was a while ago.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had quite a lot of them since. But yeah, we had a good little team because obviously it was early start of the friendly faces.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was fun.</div></div></p>
