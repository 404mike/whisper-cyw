    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In 1919, one of the major issues was the world climate, the global environment.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> At a local level, you wouldn&#039;t have seen that in the UK and in Wales during the race riots,</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> but it was very important to the politicians.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the race riots were a shameful part of that year,</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and when revolution across Europe seemed possible to the politicians, they were afraid.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And you understand the way they acted, you&#039;ve got to understand what happened in 1919 across the UK.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then maybe we can grasp why it seems black and minority people were used to ease tensions.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Straight fact is the fear was communism and the fear was revolution.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Most people believed that the war simply ended, but that was not true.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in December 1917, during the Bolshevik uprising, when the Red Army of Lenin, etc. were removing the monarchy in Russia,</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> France, Italy and Britain signed an agreement to help the White Army, the monarchy army, fight against the Red Army.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Churchill in particular felt very, very angry at underestimating it.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a part of a ruling class that was removed in Russia.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He was part of the British equivalent.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Now he wanted to slow down demobilization, not remove conscription, so that Britain could go to war in Russia.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The problem is the troops were tired. They&#039;d signed up to fight Germany, not to carry on fighting forever.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So David Lord George, the Prime Minister and his Minister of War decided the answer was to stop any revolution in Britain.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were afraid there would be one.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it must be understood if people read Simon Webb&#039;s book on 1919, they realize we came very, very close to a revolution.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is a simple timeline. There will be things that are missing on it.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> To understand why the race riots were easy to happen and the state of mind of the white mob,</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> you need to understand the riot strikes, uprisings and racial violence that occurred as part of that year.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> In January 1919, on the 3rd of January in Folkestone, thousands of soldiers blockaded the harbour and marched on the town hall.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> When they heard a rumour saying they were being sent back to France.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The same happened in Dover. And in Dover they formed a soldiers&#039; union.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s mutiny. On the 7th in January, barely reported, 7,000 soldiers marched from Shoreham to Brighton Town Hall demanding demobilization.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 9th, 1,500 soldiers marched on Downing Street to confront Lloyd George.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He did not meet them, one of his brigadiers did.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 13th in Milford Haven, there was a mutiny aboard the HMS Kilbride and the Navy ensign was taken down and replaced by the red flag.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> 15th of January in Southampton, 20,000 soldiers went on strike.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And that had to be broken up after about six days by bringing in a brigadier.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 21st, not a soldier strike, but much more serious in a lot of ways in Dublin.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Sinn Fein, after getting MPs elected in the 2018 general election, said they would not go to parliament to take up their seats and they declared an independent island in Dublin.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> 23rd, Glasgow Harbour riot.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> 26th, Calais. The British army in Calais, there was a mutiny.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The men wanted to come home. They were told they weren&#039;t going to, or at least that&#039;s what they heard.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So men from the Val de L&#039;Eve camp and the Vendrew camp actually mutinied.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were supported by the women of the Queen Mary&#039;s Army Auxiliary.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 27th, trade union action started.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And in Glasgow, trade unions called a general strike.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Similarly in Belfast, the trade unions called a general strike.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 30th, back in France, in Calais, the army suppressed the mutiny.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were afraid of reprisals and not one person was charged with riot or mutiny.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 31st, in Glasgow, the Battle of George Square, Churchill sent tanks in to break up the strike, which was for a 40-hour week.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Then in February and April.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 3rd of February, in Lincoln, the Sinn Fein leader, Aamon de Valera, was removed.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He escaped from Lincoln prison.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 4th, the race riot started in South Shields.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And on that same day, 4th and 5th, in North Wales, the Canadian soldiers based at Kenmore Army Camp rioted.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They demanded to be repatriated back home.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> 78 were arrested, 25 sent to prison, 3 of the rioters and 2 guards were killed.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 11th of March, in London, was the Battle of Bow Street.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The riot involved an estimated 2,000 Australian, American and Canadian servicemen fighting against 50 Metropolitan police officers.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 12th of March, there was the race riot in Salford, in the Green Gate area.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 15th of March, in Wales, the teachers strike in the Rhondda.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Then 17th of April, Limerick, they declared a Soviet...</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important to understand that the word Soviet actually meant a council.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So effectively in Limerick, they decided Limerick would become a Soviet council led by the people and an independent republic.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They even printed their own money.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 5th of June, in Liverpool, the race riot started.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> 8th of June, in Newport.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> 11th of June, in Cardiff and in Barry.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 14th of June, in Stepney, East London, an Arab coffee shop in Cable Street was attacked by the white mob.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And Chinese and Caribbean people were attacked.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 15th of June, Surrey, the Canadian troops rioted in Epsom.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And a police sergeant was killed.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 16th of June, in Poplar in East London, the Chinese were attacked.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And later that day, groups of West Indians.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> July 1919 was no quieter.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite the contrary.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 3rd of July, the first coal miner strike.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That was in Derbyshire, then Yorkshire, and then in Merthyr.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 23rd of July, in Luton, the town hall was burned down by soldiers.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And the statement made by the town clerk says, grievances mentioned were of more serious importance.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> More serious, unquote, than their annoyance at a Remembrance Day ceremony they were proposing.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> More serious importance, such as alleged unsatisfactory allowances to discharge soldiers and their dependents.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The 23rd of July, Bilston, near Wolverhampton, rioting by soldiers.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> 25th of July, Swindon, rioting by soldiers.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> 25th of July again, in Coventry, and this lasted a few days, soldiers rioting, but general looting.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Moving on to August, and on the 5th, there was a National Baker strike.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Now national strikes were uncommon.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 7th of September, in London, the police went on strike for union recognition.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Same day in Liverpool.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The reaction of the government to that was 3,000 police officers were dismissed nationally.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And they introduced legislation that stopped them striking.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> 27th of September, the National Union of Rail Women held a 10-day strike nationally.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> 30th of September, staff at the Daily Sketch in London refused to print criticism of the railway strikers.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the 7th of November, in Cork, soldiers were rioting again.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Two police officers at least were shot over a 10-day period.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, the press has always handled these things, and government responded in their own way.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So, some quotes from the period, the Times stated,</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re asked to publish, but have no intention of publishing, a great many letters on the subject of demobilization,</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> which show a deplorable lack of responsibility on the part of writers.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Fanning and agitation, which is already mischievous and may become dangerous.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> These demonstrations by soldiers have gone far enough.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Should be mentioned, although this wouldn&#039;t affect the right-wing press,</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> There were still restrictions on press reporting. War restrictions were still in place.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Churchill later wrote that in 1919, he strove with all his energy against communism.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Because at that time, I considered communism with its idea of world revolution the greatest danger to the British Empire.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The strikes, riots, mutinies were all seen as being part of a communist uprising.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So, all across Britain in 1919, there were tumultuous events, mutinies, strikes and race riots.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a year of revolt. It was also a year when working people and members of the military felt betrayed by their newly elected government.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a government elected on a massive majority.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We will next look at the global picture.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important to understand that although not even the press were reporting the picture of the world all over,</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Downing Street would have been in touch with all of the world leaders, all of its representatives across the British Empire,</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and would have seen a bigger, more frightening picture.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> A picture that was to lead to such things in the Empire as over 300 people dying in the Punjab as they were massacred at Amritsar.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Jamie Bacon. This is HDA Cardiff.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The Racial Riots Project 1919, which is supported by Heritage Lottery in Wales.</div></div></p>
