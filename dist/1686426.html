the docks.</div><div id="00:00:25.240" class="transcript_line"> This is the first of three parts which are conversation with Peter Phillips, well known</div><div id="00:00:34.840" class="transcript_line"> resident of Tiger Bay, musician, legendary for leading the funerals in a New Orleans</div><div id="00:00:44.800" class="transcript_line"> style.</div><div id="00:00:47.800" class="transcript_line"> This is the first episode from Peter Phillips.</div><div id="00:00:52.240" class="transcript_line"> So tell me tell me about childhood, early days.</div><div id="00:01:02.240" class="transcript_line"> I had a wonderful upbringing.</div><div id="00:01:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Born in 45 Christina Street Tiger Bay, 5th to 12th 1940.</div><div id="00:01:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Got a twin brother called Roy and I am one of a family of seven.</div><div id="00:01:24.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a small family for the Bay isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:29.240" class="transcript_line"> It all depends what family you&#039;re in.</div><div id="00:01:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah but you know what I mean some of the families were huge man, huge.</div><div id="00:01:36.240" class="transcript_line"> When you say huge how you calculating that?</div><div id="00:01:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Well some people had eight or nine kids and others had you know less but some families</div><div id="00:01:48.240" class="transcript_line"> were really big.</div><div id="00:01:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Well growing up in the area like Tiger Bay you never noticed the amount of families.</div><div id="00:01:54.240" class="transcript_line"> We were all one family.</div><div id="00:01:56.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one of the things that I always found interesting as you know I come from Barry</div><div id="00:02:01.240" class="transcript_line"> all merchant seamen families as well and that&#039;s the way families mixed in.</div><div id="00:02:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Kids went to people&#039;s houses and had food and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:02:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Well I keep on telling my grandchildren, said Grampy was 30 before I realized everybody</div><div id="00:02:18.240" class="transcript_line"> in the ducks wasn&#039;t my auntie.</div><div id="00:02:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I know exactly what you mean and how many cousins as some people define them as</div><div id="00:02:26.240" class="transcript_line"> blood but otherwise how many cousins do we all have?</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Well yeah you said it earlier we&#039;re all family I mean you would go and this is the problem</div><div id="00:02:37.240" class="transcript_line"> today when they killed the bay and knocked it down and moved everybody out you took the</div><div id="00:02:44.240" class="transcript_line"> society away you took family away because you move people out whereas you could pop</div><div id="00:02:50.240" class="transcript_line"> around the corner and see your auntie and uncle and your cousins go across the road</div><div id="00:02:55.240" class="transcript_line"> and see your granny or go around the corner and see your grandparents.</div><div id="00:02:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Now you don&#039;t see that it&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:03:02.240" class="transcript_line"> By the time the children think about coming down to visit and getting the bus and getting</div><div id="00:03:07.240" class="transcript_line"> this and getting that they still would give it a miss and that&#039;s a sad sad fact about</div><div id="00:03:13.240" class="transcript_line"> the bay being crushed and that&#039;s what they did they crushed the bay.</div><div id="00:03:18.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean even that thing about kids that feeling as a kid of feeling safe but at the same time</div><div id="00:03:28.240" class="transcript_line"> everybody every adult knowing what you were doing so your parents knew what you were</div><div id="00:03:32.240" class="transcript_line"> doing but you were safe weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah I mean for example if I was around another street in the docks and a lady come</div><div id="00:03:44.240" class="transcript_line"> out and said do your mother know you&#039;re here and you say yes Mrs. Sorenso or yes auntie</div><div id="00:03:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Sorenso she&#039;d say they&#039;d say well make sure you&#039;re home by five o&#039;clock and you&#039;ll be</div><div id="00:03:55.240" class="transcript_line"> gone.</div><div id="00:03:56.240" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t back chat you&#039;d be gone because by the time you got home your mother and there</div><div id="00:04:01.240" class="transcript_line"> was no more by then but your parents would know where you were but that&#039;s community for</div><div id="00:04:06.240" class="transcript_line"> you that is community everybody cared about everybody.</div><div id="00:04:11.240" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s it it was people talk about villages but it was a village within Cardiff a total</div><div id="00:04:20.240" class="transcript_line"> village.</div><div id="00:04:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh it was fabulous if you come if you go down to Bute now there&#039;s only two ways to get in</div><div id="00:04:27.240" class="transcript_line"> and get out.</div><div id="00:04:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Mariah Street and Loudoun Square.</div><div id="00:04:30.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s only two ways in and out.</div><div id="00:04:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Whereas before you could walk and operate at the top you can get out to Sapphire Street</div><div id="00:04:38.240" class="transcript_line"> you can get out to Loudoun Square you can get out to Tuck Church Street you can get</div><div id="00:04:42.240" class="transcript_line"> out to North Church Street it&#039;s all gone all gone.</div><div id="00:04:46.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two ways to get in and to get out Mariah Street and Loudoun Square and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:51.240" class="transcript_line"> it.</div><div id="00:04:52.240" class="transcript_line"> It feels a bit like cutting people off from the rest of the world.</div><div id="00:04:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s their intention that&#039;s their intention what they would love to do is have everybody</div><div id="00:05:02.240" class="transcript_line"> out.</div><div id="00:05:03.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean when they start knocking down houses and putting us all in them skyspapers what</div><div id="00:05:08.240" class="transcript_line"> should have happened is what happened in in Splott because in Loudoun Square if you if</div><div id="00:05:15.240" class="transcript_line"> as you said you&#039;ve been to the docks in Loudoun Square you could have made beautiful beautiful</div><div id="00:05:21.240" class="transcript_line"> flats out of them big big houses.</div><div id="00:05:24.240" class="transcript_line"> You could have made four flats in each house but no they knocked them down knocked them</div><div id="00:05:28.240" class="transcript_line"> down.</div><div id="00:05:29.240" class="transcript_line"> And what they did they killed the community because they put people into flats myself</div><div id="00:05:34.240" class="transcript_line"> my mother and everyone and they took away the fact that you had a garden where you had</div><div id="00:05:39.240" class="transcript_line"> chickens and you kept your people happy but they killed all up they killed all the poor</div><div id="00:05:44.240" class="transcript_line"> houses and everybody had nowhere to go.</div><div id="00:05:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and that and that thing the simple thing I can remember from my Nan in Barry that simple</div><div id="00:05:54.240" class="transcript_line"> thing of being on the doorstep.</div><div id="00:05:57.240" class="transcript_line"> Gone.</div><div id="00:05:58.240" class="transcript_line"> And the world going by and conversations.</div><div id="00:06:03.240" class="transcript_line"> Yep you could always tell when it was summertime because everybody was out on the door.</div><div id="00:06:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was up on the door and and you would check for everybody.</div><div id="00:06:14.240" class="transcript_line"> But the sad sad thing about it as I say to you was that the people who crippled the day</div><div id="00:06:20.240" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t even live here.</div><div id="00:06:21.240" class="transcript_line"> No they don&#039;t even live here unless as you were saying earlier I told you in in the late</div><div id="00:06:29.240" class="transcript_line"> 40s early 50s my mom&#039;s house was it quarter so Gala hands where they do all the pamphlets</div><div id="00:06:35.240" class="transcript_line"> and the leaflets because you Tiger Bay had a strong strong labor with a strong one.</div><div id="00:06:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Now you don&#039;t even know your who your candidate is you don&#039;t see him.</div><div id="00:06:48.240" class="transcript_line"> It was a melting pot that was beautiful.</div><div id="00:06:51.240" class="transcript_line"> It never over bubbled.</div><div id="00:06:53.240" class="transcript_line"> It was a melting pot and they whoever whoever it may be they just wanted to crush it.</div><div id="00:07:01.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I want to do was crush it and they achieved that.</div><div id="00:07:07.240" class="transcript_line"> For no good reason they achieved it.</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Well you know you know Barry as I do and and and also the Bay much better than I ever will.</div><div id="00:07:18.240" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s funny isn&#039;t it.</div><div id="00:07:21.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re the you&#039;re the people who generate the money that makes a place what it is.</div><div id="00:07:28.240" class="transcript_line"> What would Cardiff be without the dogs.</div><div id="00:07:31.240" class="transcript_line"> It wouldn&#039;t even be the capital of Wales.</div><div id="00:07:33.240" class="transcript_line"> No no no and as I said to you that the sad thing about it is that the youngsters today</div><div id="00:07:42.240" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t even know much about Cardiff because they don&#039;t even know what the court exchange means.</div><div id="00:07:48.240" class="transcript_line"> They haven&#039;t got a clue.</div><div id="00:07:49.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even know when they walked on James Street and passed the piece of grass</div><div id="00:07:54.240" class="transcript_line"> past the police station that was the River Tuff coming through.</div><div id="00:07:58.240" class="transcript_line"> They haven&#039;t got a clue.</div><div id="00:07:59.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even know about the badges coming through bringing the cold down.</div><div id="00:08:03.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and the canal.</div><div id="00:08:04.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even know.</div><div id="00:08:05.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even know that that where they call Cardiff Bay ships would come all the way right the way up</div><div id="00:08:12.240" class="transcript_line"> to the top of Bute Street and unload spuds from Ireland for Edward England.</div><div id="00:08:17.240" class="transcript_line"> They just think oh it&#039;s Cardiff Bay.</div><div id="00:08:19.240" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t even know it&#039;s a basin.</div><div id="00:08:21.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sad.</div><div id="00:08:22.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sad.</div><div id="00:08:23.240" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:08:24.240" class="transcript_line"> It is because when all is said and done it&#039;s that legacy the sweat of real working people</div><div id="00:08:30.240" class="transcript_line"> and their families the women that brought us all up.</div><div id="00:08:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:36.240" class="transcript_line"> You know while the men were away or whatever.</div><div id="00:08:39.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the minute that money stopped coming in like you know the dogs cold stopped at it.</div><div id="00:08:49.240" class="transcript_line"> They knocked it all down.</div><div id="00:08:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Well you just mentioned something there about being brought up.</div><div id="00:08:56.240" class="transcript_line"> I cringe when I hear these people crying about single parents as you know.</div><div id="00:09:01.240" class="transcript_line"> Our fathers were the way of seeing them.</div><div id="00:09:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Catch an 18 month trip you never seen.</div><div id="00:09:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Your mother brought you up and you got on with it.</div><div id="00:09:09.240" class="transcript_line"> They went to work.</div><div id="00:09:10.240" class="transcript_line"> They read this and now you hear them crying.</div><div id="00:09:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh single parents single parents.</div><div id="00:09:14.240" class="transcript_line"> But we were all brought up by single parents.</div><div id="00:09:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And as you say your granny was involved making sure that you got the school clean and tidy.</div><div id="00:09:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and if something happened if something happened so that a woman you know the mother of the family something happened to her.</div><div id="00:09:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Those kids would end up in a different house.</div><div id="00:09:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Someone would bring them up an auntie or whatever.</div><div id="00:09:39.240" class="transcript_line"> Her best friend or an auntie.</div><div id="00:09:42.240" class="transcript_line"> Well you must have you must have added in Barry like we did in the in the docs.</div><div id="00:09:46.240" class="transcript_line"> You would see somebody who had been working with somebody and the next thing you know they&#039;ve gone and moved in.</div><div id="00:09:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And like you said they&#039;re like auntie they&#039;re like family.</div><div id="00:09:55.240" class="transcript_line"> There was no discrimination no discrimination.</div><div id="00:09:59.240" class="transcript_line"> I went to I went to South Church Street School and we had a young girl in our class who was a Jewish family.</div><div id="00:10:12.240" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t say prayer.</div><div id="00:10:13.240" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t go to to break in the in the in the school break in the playground.</div><div id="00:10:19.240" class="transcript_line"> She used to come to school dressed as if she was in the private school.</div><div id="00:10:24.240" class="transcript_line"> She used to wear a bowtie in the summer.</div><div id="00:10:25.240" class="transcript_line"> She wore a bowtie hat and she was just accepted.</div><div id="00:10:30.240" class="transcript_line"> As far as we knew she was our friend in school in the class.</div><div id="00:10:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:35.240" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you she was she was the niece of Mrs.</div><div id="00:10:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Balford who got murdered.</div><div id="00:10:40.240" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:10:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:42.240" class="transcript_line"> But she used to come to school.</div><div id="00:10:43.240" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t go to private school but she was dressed immaculate.</div><div id="00:10:47.240" class="transcript_line"> And as I said you used to wear a bowtie a bowtie hat a bowtie hat.</div><div id="00:10:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And in the summer she wear a summer hat.</div><div id="00:10:54.240" class="transcript_line"> But as I said nobody passed no comment.</div><div id="00:11:00.240" class="transcript_line"> And even even within families you could have you could have a Muslim and a Christian parent.</div><div id="00:11:06.240" class="transcript_line"> People you know people it was as far as they were concerned like I both do what they wanted to do.</div><div id="00:11:12.240" class="transcript_line"> They were family and that was it.</div><div id="00:11:15.240" class="transcript_line"> And you might end up I mean I&#039;ve been I&#039;ve been down the mosque many times when I was a kid in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:11:21.240" class="transcript_line"> You know you know my uncle was involved.</div><div id="00:11:24.240" class="transcript_line"> You know I&#039;m a Christian I was a Christian got nothing to do with it.</div><div id="00:11:28.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean come in and how many young Christian boys ended up in places like the the back room of the Cairo cafe where there were Muslim lessons going on because they might win in.</div><div id="00:11:46.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:49.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:50.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s loads went to Arab school just to learn.</div><div id="00:11:53.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s it&#039;s a it&#039;s a fact.</div><div id="00:11:55.240" class="transcript_line"> But like I&#039;m saying to you it was a beautiful melting pot.</div><div id="00:11:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Everybody knew everybody.</div><div id="00:12:00.240" class="transcript_line"> I I&#039;ll give you an example.</div><div id="00:12:04.240" class="transcript_line"> I had to attend the hospital the other month.</div><div id="00:12:07.240" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what happened.</div><div id="00:12:08.240" class="transcript_line"> You know they come and take particulars of your name and address and everything.</div><div id="00:12:12.240" class="transcript_line"> So this young nurse said to me did you ever live in the docks.</div><div id="00:12:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it was born and bred in the docks.</div><div id="00:12:19.240" class="transcript_line"> So she said oh I wonder if you would know my grandfather.</div><div id="00:12:24.240" class="transcript_line"> So I said what&#039;s his name.</div><div id="00:12:26.240" class="transcript_line"> She said so and so and so.</div><div id="00:12:28.240" class="transcript_line"> I said yeah.</div><div id="00:12:30.240" class="transcript_line"> I said and when you go home tell your mother that you was talking to Peter Phillips.</div><div id="00:12:36.240" class="transcript_line"> She looked at me she said pardon.</div><div id="00:12:39.240" class="transcript_line"> I said tell your mother that you was talking to Peter Phillips.</div><div id="00:12:43.240" class="transcript_line"> She said my mother said your mother was in the same class as me.</div><div id="00:12:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Your auntie was in a class higher because she&#039;s older than me.</div><div id="00:12:51.240" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:12:53.240" class="transcript_line"> She said I always wanted to know about my grandfather.</div><div id="00:12:57.240" class="transcript_line"> So what you must remember is when we were growing up the only photos that the parents had was the father on his passport going to sea.</div><div id="00:13:06.240" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t like this mobile.</div><div id="00:13:08.240" class="transcript_line"> So she was on the phone.</div><div id="00:13:10.240" class="transcript_line"> On the phone she texted her mother and her mother said give him my love.</div><div id="00:13:14.240" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t seen him for years.</div><div id="00:13:16.240" class="transcript_line"> So I started to tell her everybody who lived in Christina Street that&#039;s where we lived.</div><div id="00:13:23.240" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:13:25.240" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:13:27.240" class="transcript_line"> I told her who lived next door to her mother and the left side the right side and where I lived.</div><div id="00:13:32.240" class="transcript_line"> God she said.</div><div id="00:13:34.240" class="transcript_line"> I said where do you live.</div><div id="00:13:35.240" class="transcript_line"> She said Pentribane.</div><div id="00:13:37.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where are the people in the street.</div><div id="00:13:39.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the
