class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Williams, T-Mine, appeal.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Guadu, we hang, go back to them.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have the new one, T-Mine, and appeal.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, right, we show the Domingo.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We go with the little pearl, and a ray.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And we pray for it, the first time.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> In the first chapter of the Bible, we pray for the Eucharist.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And, in the last year, the Jews lived in Morwa House near the bond.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, Morwa House, right here in the first house,</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> in the middle of the city of Gorren, near the town of Llywynor.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the first Jews in the bond.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> At the beginning of the year, we had to move the T-Mine,</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> where the other one was, to the old town of Dje.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were, in Morwa House, a town near Llywynor,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to the first street in the bond.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, do you know what the T-Mine is?</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a small bond.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s in India.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you know, but it&#039;s in America.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you know.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I

Matthew Jorreit, you know, to agree.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I bought a big, small boat,</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and I carried it to the U.S.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went with it to the city of Berlin,</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Ollerburt, in Lland.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I saw Mrs. Matthews,</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> the small boat,</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I went down to the ground,</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and I saw that the boat didn&#039;t reach the ground,</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and I went down to the sea.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boat didn&#039;t reach America.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember, I told people,</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a small bond,</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and I went to the city of Lodeo,</div><div id="00:02:47.000"

going to help him.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a little bit of an Arab,</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I told him,</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to make a big bond,</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> and I told him,</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to make a big bond with the U.S.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was a great job,</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> a great job for me,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to have a bond with the U.S.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to tell you about it.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And the way he did it,</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> he was cutting every piece of wood,</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and he saw the wood,</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and he went down to the sea,</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and he saw a big rock,</div><div id="00:03:30.000"

them in the box.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big job.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said,</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> he said,</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> the box is a big one,</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said,</div><div
