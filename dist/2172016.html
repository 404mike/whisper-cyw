    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Photo Search This particular episode in our life illustrates</div><div id="00:00:06.280" class="transcript_line"> the strange forces of coincidence that seems to centre on the island of Crete. One winter</div><div id="00:00:12.160" class="transcript_line"> evening in Greek school at home in Sussex, Christina, one of our class members, handed</div><div id="00:00:18.200" class="transcript_line"> us a large A3 black and white photo. It showed a typical small Cretan fishing boat complete</div><div id="00:00:25.600" class="transcript_line"> moored close to the shore, with a corner of a stone building in the background. My husband</div><div id="00:00:32.280" class="transcript_line"> took this when we were staying in Crete in the 1970s. He thinks it&#039;s your village. We</div><div id="00:00:38.120" class="transcript_line"> thanked her for the photo and took it home. Later in the year, when sorting stuff out</div><div id="00:00:42.920" class="transcript_line"> in the house, the photo resurfaced and we thought we should bring it with us to the</div><div id="00:00:47.240" class="transcript_line"> island to see if we could identify the location or the fisherman, although this seemed quite</div><div id="00:00:52.840" class="transcript_line"> unlikely after all this time. A few days into our next stay, we remembered to take the</div><div id="00:00:57.840" class="transcript_line"> photograph into town with us and tried to tie down the location. We didn&#039;t know whether</div><div id="00:01:03.480" class="transcript_line"> the places that were used for moorings had changed over time, but there were a couple</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> of likely places where stone buildings were near to the shore. A brief discussion in the</div><div id="00:01:12.960" class="transcript_line"> first cafe suggested the road towards the causeway by the old carob factory. We knew</div><div id="00:01:19.440" class="transcript_line"> this location as it had recently been opened as a lovely restaurant and had quickly become</div><div id="00:01:24.840" class="transcript_line"> one of our favourites to eat at. When we arrived there, Dimitri, one of the co-owners, became</div><div id="00:01:30.080" class="transcript_line"> very excited and took a photo over to the edge of the building that butted onto his</div><div id="00:01:34.760" class="transcript_line"> restaurant and pointed out to us that the wall shown in it was the same as in the photo.</div><div id="00:01:41.120" class="transcript_line"> He asked if he could borrow it and copy or scan it to display on the wall of the restaurant.</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> We readily agreed and said we would collect the original the following week, but asked</div><div id="00:01:50.680" class="transcript_line"> him if he knew or could find out who the person was in the photo. A few days later Dimitri</div><div id="00:01:55.960" class="transcript_line"> called to us as we were walking past and returned the photo, but admitted he had not been able</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> to find out the identity of the mystery fisherman, perhaps he was no longer in town or even no</div><div id="00:02:06.880" class="transcript_line"> longer alive. It was hard to exactly put an age on the fisherman, he appeared to have</div><div id="00:02:12.480" class="transcript_line"> a good head of black curls and was probably between mid-20s and mid-30s, so if the photo</div><div id="00:02:18.320" class="transcript_line"> was taken in 1975 we were looking for a 60-70 year old. We walked back to the town square</div><div id="00:02:25.480" class="transcript_line"> and settled down to an iced coffee in our favourite bar. The owner was a local lad,</div><div id="00:02:30.480" class="transcript_line"> like so many in the town, but probably far too young to recognise the mystery fisherman,</div><div id="00:02:35.800" class="transcript_line"> but when we told him the story he quickly entered into the spirit of the quest. I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> readily recognise him, but my father might, we&#039;ll ask him shortly when he calls by.</div><div id="00:02:46.720" class="transcript_line"> When his father arrived there was a close scrutiny of the photo, with the necessary</div><div id="00:02:50.960" class="transcript_line"> swapping of reading glasses from distance ones. It could be George, he normally walks</div><div id="00:02:56.120" class="transcript_line"> this way most mornings. In a moment of pure coincidence George was spotted on the other</div><div id="00:03:01.560" class="transcript_line"> side of the road carrying his shopping and walking next to the harbour. Nictalius ran</div><div id="00:03:06.920" class="transcript_line"> towards him carrying the photo, followed at a more sedate pace by his dad. As he approached</div><div id="00:03:12.960" class="transcript_line"> the suspect he slowed and after a short conversation over the photo they returned to the bar. No,</div><div id="00:03:18.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not him, but there is Manolis who is the right age and has curly hair, maybe we</div><div id="00:03:24.240" class="transcript_line"> should ask him the Caffeineon. This was a good suggestion, but a little intimidating</div><div id="00:03:29.920" class="transcript_line"> as the most popular Caffeineon in town was certainly full of potential suspects on a</div><div id="00:03:34.760" class="transcript_line"> daily basis. Although we used the Caffeineons in the village, the two in town had always</div><div id="00:03:40.280" class="transcript_line"> looked too Cretan and full of local men, smoking, playing backgammon and drinking their thick</div><div id="00:03:45.960" class="transcript_line"> black Greek coffees and rackies. Also conversation was conducted at high speed and high volume</div><div id="00:03:53.600" class="transcript_line"> with gesticulation bordering on violence. It was still rare to see obvious non-Greeks</div><div id="00:04:00.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure we would have been made welcome. The idea of trying to identify a stranger</div><div id="00:04:05.440" class="transcript_line"> from 30 plus years ago with the help of 20 plus Cretan pensioners fuelled on nicotine,</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> strong alcohol and caffeine was not an immediately attractive prospect. Wisdom suggested we would</div><div id="00:04:18.080" class="transcript_line"> defer the task for another day. A few days later our curiosity again got the better of</div><div id="00:04:24.160" class="transcript_line"> us and we tried another approach. The shop next to the most popular Caffeineon is owned</div><div id="00:04:29.920" class="transcript_line"> and run by a couple that we have chatted with over the years that we have visited their</div><div id="00:04:35.360" class="transcript_line"> town. They are English as far superior to our Greek and we wondered if George would</div><div id="00:04:39.560" class="transcript_line"> be a good interpreter to attempt the extension of search of the Caffeineon. After exchanging</div><div id="00:04:45.600" class="transcript_line"> the use of pleasantries and inquiring about families, business and progress on our house,</div><div id="00:04:51.280" class="transcript_line"> I produced the photo. After a short scrutiny there was a feeling that he was familiar.</div><div id="00:04:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Eleni suggested that her mother may have a better idea so she was summoned from her chair</div><div id="00:05:02.040" class="transcript_line"> outside for her opinion. This suggestion provided something of a breakthrough. Eleni&#039;s mum</div><div id="00:05:08.680" class="transcript_line"> took one look at the photo, laughed and said, Michalis Mathiakis and something else which</div><div id="00:05:14.080" class="transcript_line"> George translated for us. She says it&#039;s not a recent photo. So he was still alive,</div><div id="00:05:20.320" class="transcript_line"> still in town? Where? It was suggested that he lived somewhere off the main road south</div><div id="00:05:25.240" class="transcript_line"> of the town, opposite the Causeway Road and in a house somewhere behind the restaurant</div><div id="00:05:30.800" class="transcript_line"> with a pizza oven. Pretty specific directions then. We would follow them up before any other</div><div id="00:05:36.640" class="transcript_line"> theories on identity were offered. That afternoon we drove to the south end of town, parked</div><div id="00:05:42.960" class="transcript_line"> by the nearest restaurant opposite the Causeway junction and went inside looking for a pizza</div><div id="00:05:47.760" class="transcript_line"> oven. Once we established that one of the three staff appeared to be decorating the restaurant,</div><div id="00:05:53.040" class="transcript_line"> that we were not actually in the market for a mid-afternoon pizza, in fact looking for someone,</div><div id="00:05:58.240" class="transcript_line"> the now familiar photo scrutiny ritual began. After a few moments the trio broke into laughter,</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> eventually explaining that yes it was Michalis, he lived nearby, the last house up the hill at</div><div id="00:06:10.720" class="transcript_line"> the side of the restaurant. No need to drive, it&#039;s nearby. Again the comment was added,</div><div id="00:06:16.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not a recent picture, followed by more laughter. We walked up the hill and around</div><div id="00:06:21.680" class="transcript_line"> two corners and came to a large two-storey traditional style house with a wraparound balcony</div><div id="00:06:27.200" class="transcript_line"> and blue shutters behind a metal gate and high railings. This must be it, so we opened the gate</div><div id="00:06:33.600" class="transcript_line"> and walked through a beautiful garden full of vegetables, flowers and fruit trees.</div><div id="00:06:38.400" class="transcript_line"> We rang the doorbell and waited but there was no answer. Some brick steps led around the side and</div><div id="00:06:44.400" class="transcript_line"> upstairs to another door with a bell but again there was no response. Disappointed we left,</div><div id="00:06:50.160" class="transcript_line"> was it the right house? As we came out a woman walked by who we recognised as someone who led</div><div id="00:06:55.920" class="transcript_line"> her sheep past Maria&#039;s apartment when we used to stay there. They were taken to graze up on the</div><div id="00:07:01.040" class="transcript_line"> hillside and brought back in the evening. We asked if this was the house of Michalis Mathiakis,</div><div id="00:07:06.640" class="transcript_line"> yes of course, we planned to return and try again. It took two more visits before the evening that</div><div id="00:07:14.320" class="transcript_line"> the door was answered by a man with a smiling but puzzled face and receding curly grey hair.</div><div id="00:07:20.880" class="transcript_line"> The brief conversation was curtailed by Michalis laughing out loud at the image of a very much</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> younger self in the photo. His wife was called and introductions were made with some confusion</div><div id="00:07:31.600" class="transcript_line"> caused by our very haunting Greek and their virtually non-existent English. Nevertheless,</div><div id="00:07:37.520" class="transcript_line"> we were ushered within. Please sit down, what would you like to drink? We settled on orange juice,</div><div id="00:07:43.360" class="transcript_line"> partly because we knew the word for it in Greek but also because clear heads would be needed for</div><div id="00:07:48.320" class="transcript_line"> the conversation. The house was large and cool with a polished marble floor and comfortable</div><div id="00:07:53.920" class="transcript_line"> furnishings in a typical Greek style. We explained that a friend in England had given us the picture</div><div id="00:08:00.080" class="transcript_line"> and we believe it was taken over 30 years ago in Elunda. He pointed out the window to the part of</div><div id="00:08:06.560" class="transcript_line"> the coast where the photo was taken. It was the building next to the old carer factory and we</div><div id="00:08:11.680" class="transcript_line"> think he said that he still had the boat. The conversation was interrupted by Mrs Mathiakis</div><div id="00:08:17.600" class="transcript_line"> who was stocking up the coffee table with methesdas in between laughing again at the photo.</div><div id="00:08:23.120" class="transcript_line"> These included chopped cucumbers, olives, daikos with tomatoes and peppers and it wasn&#039;t long</div><div id="00:08:29.280" class="transcript_line"> before the inevitable carafe of Raki and a tray of small shot glasses appeared,</div><div id="00:08:34.560" class="transcript_line"> so much for keeping a clear head. The conversation slowly arrived at where we lived and after a</div><div id="00:08:40.320" class="transcript_line"> diversion to England we explained about the small holiday home in the village above the town.</div><div id="00:08:46.160" class="transcript_line"> I have a house there as well, explained a surprised Michaelius. Where is yours?</div><div id="00:08:51.440" class="transcript_line"> This part always proved difficult as we had to give directions to a house without a number</div><div id="00:08:56.160" class="transcript_line"> or a name in a street with no name. We gave our normal description of the turning between the two</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> cavernions and down. More surprise. Mine is also there, much laughter. We appear to be neighbours.</div><div id="00:09:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Conversations continued in a combination of our halting Greek and hand signals supplemented by</div><div id="00:09:16.400" class="transcript_line"> photos on my iPod. All the time Michaelius and his wife, both of whom had beautifully open faces and</div><div id="00:09:22.720" class="transcript_line"> ready smiles, asked the usual questions that are quickly asked in creep to the surprise of more</div><div id="00:09:28.560" class="transcript_line"> reserved northern Europeans. How old are you? Do you have children? How old are they? What do you do?</div><div id="00:09:34.640" class="transcript_line"> This revealed that Michaelius was 65 and he reckoned he was 30 when the photo was taken.</div><div id="00:09:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Eventually our Greek vocabulary exhausted and our stomachs full we attempted to leave.</div><div id="00:09:46.800" class="transcript_line"> You must come up and see our house in the village. We believed his reply was positive but were</div><div id="00:09:52.800" class="transcript_line"> surprised to hear that they were visiting in one hour&#039;s time. We must leave and prepare some food</div><div id="00:09:58.400" class="transcript_line"> to welcome them and tidy up. This was easier said than done. Eleni disappeared into the kitchen and</div><div id="00:10:04.880" class="transcript_line"> quickly re-emerged carrying two bags. One was full of fresh lemons from the garden and the other</div><div id="00:10:10.720" class="transcript_line"> full of large brown eggs. As we left the house we made the mistake of admiring the flowers in the</div><div id="00:10:17.360" class="transcript_line"> garden and our leaving was interrupted by the cutting of a huge bunch of flowers to take.</div><div id="00:10:22.560" class="transcript_line"> They were pink and white amaryllis, the sort that had grown at home one at a time indoors in a pot</div><div id="00:10:28.320" class="transcript_line"> at Christmas. Here they filled a flower border. As we left through the gate laden with gifts and</div><div id="00:10:34.480" class="transcript_line"> said our goodbyes a young man got out of his car and walked towards the gates. Michaelius called</div><div id="00:10:40.160" class="transcript_line"> him over and introduced him as their nephew who turned out to be a civil engineer working at one</div><div id="00:10:45.200" class="transcript_line"> of the large new hotel developments just up the coast. To our relief he spoke perfect English</div><div id="00:10:51.280" class="transcript_line"> and understood about the photo and his uncle coming to see us. He also corrected our understanding of</div><div id="00:10:57.120" class="transcript_line"> the return visit. It would be tomorrow at nine o&#039;clock not tonight. So much for our Greek what</div><div id="00:11:03.200" class="transcript_line"> else had we got wrong? The next morning we were up early and tidied the little house after our</div><div id="00:11:09.120" class="transcript_line"> breakfast on the roof terrace. The flowers were in our largest jug. We&#039;d yet to acquire a frown of</div><div id="00:11:14.880" class="transcript_line"> ours and we were ready to receive a visit from our new friends. They were on time and also not</div><div id="00:11:21.120" class="transcript_line"> empty handed carrying a large bottle of olive oil, their own pressing so we believed. There was more</div><div id="00:11:26.560" class="transcript_line"> laughter and pointing by Michaelius to the other side of the street across the two metre wide</div><div id="00:11:31.760" class="transcript_line"> alleyway. Eventually the penny dropped. The house opposite was his. While the building work went on</div><div id="00:11:38.400" class="transcript_line"> the architect had arranged the use of a store room for building materials in the house opposite,</div><div id="00:11:43.360" class="transcript_line"> a sort of basement room. It wasn&#039;t clear to us where the front door of the house was and whether</div><div id="00:11:48.240" class="transcript_line"> it was part of the occupied house that backed onto it. We knew that house lived in by yet another</div><div id="00:11:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Maria. Some time ago we&#039;d asked the architect whether it was possible for us to continue to use</div><div id="00:11:59.520" class="transcript_line"> this room which seemed separate from any other house. It would be useful for storage which given</div><div id="00:12:05.280" class="transcript_line"> the size of our house would be a great help. It appeared that through a distant coincidence we&#039;d</div><div id="00:12:10.320" class="transcript_line"> blundered upon the owner ourselves and he was our new friend. Coffee and orange juice was offered</div><div id="00:12:16.400" class="transcript_line"> round with biscuits and we showed our new friends around the house. The bathroom tiling and the glass</div><div id="00:12:21.600" class="transcript_line"> floor caused the usual surprise but all in all the house was judged as au rea, as beautiful.</div><div id="00:12:29.520" class="transcript_line"> The view from the roof terrace with the panoramic distant views was enthused over and we tried to</div><div id="00:12:35.200" class="transcript_line"> explain that this has provided the design stimulus for the house with the need for access coupled</div><div id="00:12:40.480" class="transcript_line"> with the requirement to get light down into the house. Having shown them around our house it was</div><div id="00:12:45.840" class="transcript_line"> indicated that we should look around the house opposite so finishing our drinks we followed</div><div id="00:12:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Michalis around the corner where he climbed a small set of stone steps and produced a key unlocking</div><div id="00:12:56.720" class="transcript_line"> the door into the upstairs of the house opposite. The house was still furnished though the cobwebs</div><div id="00:13:02.800" class="transcript_line"> suggested that any occupation was not recent. It was a series of upstairs rooms leading one from the</div><div id="00:13:08.880" class="transcript_line"> other, four in all with the window that was blocked in the third one that would face our house.</div><div id="00:13:14.400" class="transcript_line"> The last one, the kitchen, had a window towards the sea and a door onto a small balcony. Furniture</div><div id="00:13:21.120" class="transcript_line"> was the traditional creedner style including a tablecloth still on the table. The second room</div><div id="00:13:26.800" class="transcript_line"> had a round brick wall in it that was apparently a well. It was an education and strange to think</div><div id="00:13:32.240" class="transcript_line"> that our own house was the other side of the wall across the narrow street. Our grief recovery</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t allow extensive discussion of interior design details so after hopefully showing the</div><div id="00:13:43.520" class="transcript_line"> right amount of polite enthusiasm we all came back out into the street but the house view was not yet</div><div id="00:13:50.080" class="transcript_line"> over. Eleni led us back up the street towards the church and after exchanging greetings with</div><div id="00:13:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Zambia outside her caffinier and I think a promise to return she directed us up a set of stone stairs</div><div id="00:14:02.960" class="transcript_line"> and unlocked the first story door. We believe she said this has been a house that was used to belong</div><div id="00:14:08.800" class="transcript_line"> to her aunt but wrestling with verb tenses was proving one of the greater grammatical challenges</div><div id="00:14:14.480" class="transcript_line"> of the Greek language. She opened up and we went in. It was a large room and once she opened the</div><div id="00:14:20.320" class="transcript_line"> shutters we could see a table and chairs, a 50s style kitchen unit, several large trunks and a full</div><div id="00:14:26.720" class="transcript_line"> size weaving loom. The electricity was still connected and she said it was for sale but before</div><div id="00:14:33.360" class="transcript_line"> we got into negotiations or worse any commitment to buy we quickly explained that our one Greek</div><div id="00:14:39.520" class="transcript_line"> house was plenty for us. There have been moments in the previous years when that seems a surplus</div><div id="00:14:44.560" class="transcript_line"> to be honest. Stephanie was particularly taken by the contents of the trunks that had been opened to</div><div id="00:14:49.600" class="transcript_line"> show rolls of fabric and pieces of embroidery. This was the second house in the village that had been</div><div id="00:14:56.400" class="transcript_line"> found to have a loom in it. Perhaps this was typical or were we in some textile centre of the</div><div id="00:15:02.160" class="transcript_line"> island. We were also shown up downstairs and a throwaway remark was made that seemed to suggest</div><div id="00:15:07.760" class="transcript_line"> the ownership of several other village houses. We suggested beating a retreat back to the safety</div><div id="00:15:13.440" class="transcript_line"> of the cavernion but concluded that the sales pattern was very low key and almost incidental.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We were also selfishly thinking of a way to bring up the subject of the storeroom opposite</div><div id="00:15:24.800" class="transcript_line"> but felt it wasn&#039;t the right time and concluded it should be left until a later visit as currently</div><div id="00:15:30.720" class="transcript_line"> we only had the pithery, one old wooden box and a few old wooden shutters that needed storing</div><div id="00:15:36.480" class="transcript_line"> and thought we would probably leave them out in the alleyway until our next visit.</div><div id="00:15:41.440" class="transcript_line"> A few days into the next visit we were walking out from the house to the hire car to drive out for</div><div id="00:15:46.720" class="transcript_line"> the day when we were called with the cheery calimera and it was Michaelis and Eleni getting</div><div id="00:15:52.400" class="transcript_line"> out of their car near the church. We explained in our best Greek that we were back again for a few</div><div id="00:15:58.160" class="transcript_line"> weeks and agreed that we would meet them again. Come to my house again when you&#039;re next in town.</div><div id="00:16:03.920" class="transcript_line"> We agreed that we would with some slight trepidation at the thought of trying to</div><div id="00:16:07.600" class="transcript_line"> discuss rent in the storeroom and wondering if our phrasebook or dictionary covered the</div><div id="00:16:12.400" class="transcript_line"> correct terms for storage and old junk and other useful terms. Later that same week,</div><div id="00:16:19.440" class="transcript_line"> after a few hours resting with the Greek dictionary and our phrasebook, Stephanie announced that she</div><div id="00:16:24.240" class="transcript_line"> prepared a letter in Greek to explain our request to rent this small room having discovered the</div><div id="00:16:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Greek word for a storeroom, an apotheke. Fortified with this new information and bearing gifts of</div><div id="00:16:36.640" class="transcript_line"> wine and biscuits, we paid an early evening call on Michaelis and Eleni. The welcome was warm and</div><div id="00:16:43.040" class="transcript_line"> chairs and tables were pulled out onto their large balcony, whereas the sunset we engaged in</div><div id="00:16:48.720" class="transcript_line"> mutual misunderstandings in Greek and broken English. Less naive friends had already instructed</div><div id="00:16:54.880" class="transcript_line"> us in the art of Greek negotiating and we&#039;d been given clear advice on not settling on the</div><div id="00:17:00.160" class="transcript_line"> first price offered and to be tenacious including the need for essential hand and head gestures.</div><div id="00:17:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course this became less clear once the wine had been opened and poured along with the inevitable</div><div id="00:17:11.440" class="transcript_line"> raki in the veritable freest of Ms. Eddard&#039;s. Michaelis was invited to read the letter which</div><div id="00:17:17.600" class="transcript_line"> he did accompanied by some smiles and chuckles. We awaited the response while we tried to summon</div><div id="00:17:23.040" class="transcript_line"> up the Greek negotiating secrets that had been supplied to us earlier. They proved completely</div><div id="00:17:28.400" class="transcript_line"> unnecessary. If we understood Michaelis correctly he was saying we must just use the space</div><div id="00:17:34.000" class="transcript_line"> for free. We were friends and no rent was expected. This was very generous and completely</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> undermined our negotiating strategy. Our only concern was whether we&#039;d completely misinterpreted</div><div id="00:17:45.600" class="transcript_line"> the response but concluded this would have to be cleared up another time as the wine and the raki</div><div id="00:17:51.600" class="transcript_line"> were already conspiring to make clearing anything up a bit tricky. After several hours our Greek</div><div id="00:17:58.160" class="transcript_line"> and drinking capacities were exhausted and we made our goodbyes and headed home but not before</div><div id="00:18:03.840" class="transcript_line"> a date was made for morning coffee in the village Cafferney on the following Sunday morning. Perhaps</div><div id="00:18:09.200" class="transcript_line"> this would be an opportunity to confirm our storage arrangements. Who knows? We walked off</div><div id="00:18:14.800" class="transcript_line"> towards our house not entirely clear whether we were Greek shed owners or not. Things were</div><div id="00:18:20.160" class="transcript_line"> never straightforward or predictable here. Maybe that&#039;s what we liked. We decided to avoid moving</div><div id="00:18:26.320" class="transcript_line"> any items into the neighbouring stone shed until the arrangements were possibly confirmed</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and hoped to do that on Sunday over coffee. When Sunday came we made our way up into the centre</div><div id="00:18:38.880" class="transcript_line"> of the village which is only two minutes from our house. There seemed to be a hubbub of conversation</div><div id="00:18:43.760" class="transcript_line"> coming from inside Zambia&#039;s Cafferney so we went inside. The single room was packed and as our eyes</div><div id="00:18:50.560" class="transcript_line"> adjusted to the more subdued light compared with the bright light outside we were hailed across the</div><div id="00:18:56.080" class="transcript_line"> room. Jeff, Stephanie, Parmé. It was Michaelis and as we squeezed across the room towards him</div><div id="00:19:02.960" class="transcript_line"> others greeted us. Calamara, Calamara. It seemed that knowing Michaelis was an instant popularity</div><div id="00:19:09.440" class="transcript_line"> ticket. Zambia came over in a newly laundered pinafore and took our orders, a coffee and a juice.</div><div id="00:19:15.920" class="transcript_line"> Cheeks were kissed, hands shaken and shoulders patted. Biscuits and cakes were offered by Michaelis</div><div id="00:19:21.600" class="transcript_line"> as we squeezed onto the table next to him. Introductions were made but we arrived in the</div><div id="00:19:26.560" class="transcript_line"> middle of a number of quick fire Greek conversations and they were far too rapid and complex for us to</div><div id="00:19:32.160" class="transcript_line"> follow so we just sat and enjoyed the hospitality, drank our drinks, ate our biscuits and smiled</div><div id="00:19:39.440" class="transcript_line"> probably idiotically at anyone who looked at us. Occasionally we heard Michaelis mentioning Greek,</div><div id="00:19:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Maria&#039;s house and the word for English and new friends but mostly the talk was more sombre</div><div id="00:19:52.240" class="transcript_line"> and as people slowly left they came and shook Michaelis&#039;s hand. Shortly afterwards Michaelis</div><div id="00:19:57.760" class="transcript_line"> rose and pulled some notes out of his pocket and handed them to Zambia. Then he said goodbye to us.</div><div id="00:20:03.360" class="transcript_line"> The words apothecy and okay were used again but we&#039;d still failed to confirm the arrangements</div><div id="00:20:08.720" class="transcript_line"> completely to our satisfaction. Another time perhaps and later we understood a little more</div><div id="00:20:15.360" class="transcript_line"> as the same afternoon or one of the obituary notices posted at points around the town we</div><div id="00:20:20.880" class="transcript_line"> noticed the name of Matthiakis. Did this mean that Michaelis was marking the funeral or anniversary</div><div id="00:20:26.640" class="transcript_line"> of a relative when entertaining people to food and drink at the Caffe Neon? We felt guilty that we&#039;d</div><div id="00:20:32.080" class="transcript_line"> not understood the situation so that we could at least pass on our condolences. In the village a</div><div id="00:20:38.560" class="transcript_line"> day or two later we thought of a new tactic. One of the neighbours, a Belgian lady, was something of</div><div id="00:20:43.600" class="transcript_line"> a linguist speaking enough Greek to work in one of the hotels. Over a conversation in the Caffe</div><div id="00:20:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Neon we explained our dilemma and how we wanted to be certain that the arrangements were all right</div><div id="00:20:54.480" class="transcript_line"> before we started moving stuff into the room. It transpired that she already knew Michaelis from</div><div id="00:21:00.240" class="transcript_line"> the church and the Caffe Neon and it was agreed she would ring him up on our behalf. That same</div><div id="00:21:05.920" class="transcript_line"> evening we were walking down to town through the olive groves and stopped to admire an old net at</div><div id="00:21:10.880" class="transcript_line"> the side of the path all bundled up but complete with the little cork floats that we&#039;d started</div><div id="00:21:15.840" class="transcript_line"> collecting when we found them washed up on the beach. I was just lamenting the fact that my</div><div id="00:21:20.800" class="transcript_line"> pocket knife was not with me when we were hailed in Greek by a woman&#039;s voice. A woman wearing an</div><div id="00:21:26.720" class="transcript_line"> apron emerged from a gateway in the stone wall bordering the olive trees. To our surprise it was</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Eleni, Michaelis&#039;s wife. Our pleasure at seeing her again was tempered by the memory that she spoke</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> no English at all and that our attempts at limited Greek conversation convinced her on</div><div id="00:21:42.960" class="transcript_line"> past experience that we could understand her Greek especially if she spoke to us at 80 miles an hour.</div><div id="00:21:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Once we&#039;d got beyond good evening and established that all of us and absent Michaelis were well and</div><div id="00:21:55.040" class="transcript_line"> that the weather was still good we were lost. Whatever she was saying was completely lost on us.</div><div id="00:22:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Was she relaying the content of its discussion that had taken place with Katerina? Who knows?</div><div id="00:22:06.640" class="transcript_line"> We shrugged and apologized and tried to leave but she became more agitated and gestured at the land</div><div id="00:22:12.320" class="transcript_line"> beyond the walls under the trees and spoke more rapid, dense and sadly unintelligible to us</div><div id="00:22:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Greek reminding us again how much work was needed on our language classes. We finally said our</div><div id="00:22:25.120" class="transcript_line"> goodbyes and beat a retreat into town for a welcome evening drink. The next development was</div><div id="00:22:31.440" class="transcript_line"> when Katerina called to say that she&#039;d spoken to Michaelis and as we&#039;d first thought he was</div><div id="00:22:36.560" class="transcript_line"> happy to let us use the apotheke for free we thanked her and mentioned that we&#039;d encountered</div><div id="00:22:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Delaney and not understood what she said. Well he may have a chance to clear this up as Michaelis</div><div id="00:22:47.520" class="transcript_line"> has suggested that you call round their house in town one afternoon or evening as he&#039;s worried.</div><div id="00:22:53.120" class="transcript_line"> What about? We asked a little angrily. Apparently he&#039;d expressed concern to Katerina that our</div><div id="00:22:58.880" class="transcript_line"> belongings may suffer damage from damp or mice if left in store and he would like us to use the</div><div id="00:23:04.960" class="transcript_line"> empty house upstairs and give us a key for us to use as it&#039;s a safer and more secure store.</div><div id="00:23:11.920" class="transcript_line"> This presented us with something of a dilemma as we wanted to store some old shutters and original</div><div id="00:23:17.200" class="transcript_line"> wood from the building works as well as some outside chairs recently rescued from the municipal</div><div id="00:23:22.640" class="transcript_line"> tip. Being concerned that we would be reintroducing rot or woodworm back into our house and damage the</div><div id="00:23:28.640" class="transcript_line"> new timber in it but we certainly weren&#039;t planning to damage Michaelis&#039;s house. The subject would</div><div id="00:23:34.080" class="transcript_line"> need delicate discussion. Later that week we were due to leave the island to return to England.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We knew that we must meet Michaelis and Delaney before we left and before we placed our treasures</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> in the storeroom or infested his house with them. We couldn&#039;t delay any longer so we found ourselves</div><div id="00:23:53.520" class="transcript_line"> early one evening climbing up the hill to his house and walking through his well-stocked garden.</div><div id="00:23:58.560" class="transcript_line"> There was no need to knock as Michaelis was sitting on his veranda reading the paper.</div><div id="00:24:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Calamera, hello my friends. We joined him and admired the view of the bay,</div><div id="00:24:08.080" class="transcript_line"> glimpsed through some gaps in the neighbouring houses, entered each other and exchanged</div><div id="00:24:12.880" class="transcript_line"> embraces and Delaney disappeared into the house as we sat down and braced ourselves for our Greek</div><div id="00:24:17.760" class="transcript_line"> language workout. We&#039;d come prepared having researched with a dictionary and a phrasebook</div><div id="00:24:22.800" class="transcript_line"> a prepared statement. It was along the lines of we thank you for your kind offer of the use of your</div><div id="00:24:28.480" class="transcript_line"> house for our possessions but they will only be old things and items such as paint ladders and</div><div id="00:24:34.080" class="transcript_line"> outside furniture that we have no room for in our small house. Are you sure you don&#039;t want to be</div><div id="00:24:40.720" class="transcript_line"> paid any rent? We skirted around the fact that we were worried about introducing Greek woodworm</div><div id="00:24:46.480" class="transcript_line"> into either of our houses and felt that this had not been an issue in the storeroom as we&#039;d already</div><div id="00:24:51.520" class="transcript_line"> noticed an abundance of existing woodworm and my strop is there. Michaelis laughed and as far as</div><div id="00:24:57.760" class="transcript_line"> we could tell after putting on his reading glasses and examining the note carefully he seemed to</div><div id="00:25:03.280" class="transcript_line"> confirm it was okay to use the apotheke as we were his new friends. Now we will eat.</div><div id="00:25:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Alaney reappeared and introduced a range of delicious medettas, salads, tomatoes, garlic paste</div><div id="00:25:16.880" class="transcript_line"> on rusks, calamari, hard cheeses and boiled eggs. This was accompanied by raki for Michaelis and me</div><div id="00:25:24.080" class="transcript_line"> and more gentle wine for the ladies. We sat eating smiling at one another and admiring the</div><div id="00:25:29.840" class="transcript_line"> garden and the evening view of the bay and the mountains. Suddenly Alaney became very vocal and</div><div id="00:25:36.160" class="transcript_line"> said something that made Michaelis laugh. We didn&#039;t understand any of it apart from what sounded like</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> the word for eggs. Slowly Michaelis asked us whether we liked eggs. As we&#039;d already eaten some that</div><div id="00:25:49.200" class="transcript_line"> evening with him we confirmed that we did and said that these were very good. He explained they were</div><div id="00:25:54.960" class="transcript_line"> eggs from their garden in the hills and he and Alaney laughed again. After several wrong turns</div><div id="00:26:00.800" class="transcript_line"> we eventually understood that the earlier encounter with Alaney was when she was up at the small</div><div id="00:26:05.360" class="transcript_line"> holding feeding the chickens and we had unbeknown to us refused her offer of some eggs. We could</div><div id="00:26:12.080" class="transcript_line"> only apologise both for our rude rebuttal to her kindness and for our poor Greek. Michaelis explained</div><div id="00:26:18.640" class="transcript_line"> it was of no consequence and all was okay now. So now we were not only homeowners but also enjoyed</div><div id="00:26:25.040" class="transcript_line"> storage rights in a Greek shed. Life was good.</div></div></p>
