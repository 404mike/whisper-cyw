    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Press record.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Not by my phone, that would be bad.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So today is Wednesday the 31st of May 2023.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Paul Hunt from Man Cap Cymru and could you introduce yourself please?</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my name is Janet Kensch and I&#039;m a committee member and a volunteer with Man Cap Cymru.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you get started with Man Cap Cymru again?</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It was when we moved back here to West Wales.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born and bred in West Wales, well actually where I live now is about five minutes from where I was brought up in Sanderville.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved to Cardiff to do some work and then oh gosh I was there for, I had my two children and came back here with the whole family.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Back in 2001, because we were always looking for services for my daughter&#039;s school or any discipline.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We were looking at different organisations and got involved with Man Cap Ceredigion.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That was 22, 23 years ago.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> On the basis of knowing what was available.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I found out that Man Cap Ceredigion didn&#039;t really do anything for children.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They were basically concentrated adults, which would have meant me walking away from them really because it didn&#039;t benefit Beth.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was talked into staying and getting involved with committee work and was on that committee then for a while.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So how old is Beth?</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s now 30 this year. She was born in 92, so she&#039;ll be 31 this year.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So you spent some time in Cardiff?</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> She was born in 92, I lived in Bathy. She was born in Llandoc Hospital.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It took us a few years to get some, well actually we&#039;ve never had a diagnosis, a proper one.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But obviously we knew she had a learning disability when she was about two.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d looked at Swansea at that time, then we had Alcanson, Dylan, her brother.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So we pretty much knew when she was about two or three that she would have some difficulties.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And how easy was it to find services there compared to Ceredigion?</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Just as difficult really. I can remember the time where the nurse, the district nurse, whatever you want to call her,</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> in the doctor&#039;s surgery saying, we haven&#039;t assessed, but yeah, it sounds like she&#039;ll need help.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember thinking, right, let&#039;s see what help is out there.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And sat in, we had a little library place in the house with a phone and desk.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, right, let&#039;s start, darling. And started bringing people up.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they then would pass me on to somebody else, to another organization, so I did that.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suddenly realized that it was going to be very difficult to find support or help or advice,</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> because during that hour, I followed all the places I was led to and came back to the first person I spoke to.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was a lot of agencies out there, but no concrete support in any way.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is in Swansea now, all well-meaning and everything, but nothing with practical support.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we got social services involved, and that meant loads of assessments.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean loads, and they&#039;d be coming to the house, a social worker, a nurse, a psychologist or something else.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d come to the house and they&#039;d be asking you the same questions.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d think, oh, God, can you read the file before you came?</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt like somebody said, well, what you should do is record, like we&#039;re recording today,</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> record everything and just say to them, look, I&#039;ll go make the coffee while you listen to the recording.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, it was just repeating itself.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, it was very little support, really.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you don&#039;t know often what support you need either.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, that&#039;s what I found difficult.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were there then for a few years and then we decided we...</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She started a little school in Townhill, which was really lovely, Townhill School.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people very snobbish about that.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We tried to get into a Welsh school and they said, I&#039;ll never forget this Dr Tanimie in Singleth Hospital.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, you&#039;d probably best stick to just teaching her English because, you know, when she grows up,</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> there won&#039;t be many people speaking Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;ll be able to support herself.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was best to...</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I regret that, really regret it, because, you know, she could have handled two languages easily.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, she went to Townhill School, lovely school.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we decided to come back home.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And it meant going through the whole process again, if you like.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was a difference, really.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a really good children&#039;s department or whatever you want to call it.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was in Pembroke.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the person who led it was Errol Bray.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s retired now, but I think she&#039;s still involved with a lot of stuff in the area.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had this unit there.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were really, really good.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a good record.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They set up a good respite system, although we never used it ourselves.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were involved with DASH, which was a parent led organisation that did holiday things.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They took over these schools and you could come along.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, kids and the siblings as well, you know, would be in little groups and stuff.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They did some respites in Teetlin, in Ketting near Aberaerhe.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Where people could, again, Bethan didn&#039;t take part in that.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, your child could go there for a week and enjoy just being with other people.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> For the purposes of the tape, I should probably just say there&#039;s a gigantic dog sniffing around.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is not mine, by the way.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So as a unit, they were really, really good.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But again, it was limited what they could do as well, really.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But going back to my captain together, it&#039;s very limited what they could do because they were only really looking at adults.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I always used to think, well, I&#039;m glad I did get in contact with them because, you know,</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> while your child is a child with a learning disability up until 18 to 25, you know,</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a duty for supporting them, you know, educationally and social services wise.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And getting involved in that kind of thing highlighted how different it was basically as an adult with disabilities,</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> because that duty goes out through the window, really.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What you&#039;re entitled to as an adult with an disability is totally different to the child.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was as much a shock to me then.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I sort of planned ahead for Bethan as being an adult, knowing there wouldn&#039;t be anything really for her.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Far, far less than the support and services that she had as a child.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up in Kheriteekyon as a child with disabilities was great for Bethan.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> She was lucky to be in Chandisil Primary School.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very, very good.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She went to an excellent secondary school in Newcastle Emily,</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> even if they&#039;re headed by Helen Ling.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, her childhood and her upbringing was good compared to a lot of people I know.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a tough time with her, really.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we might have to pause and get the dog out because I think the breathing is going to be coming on the recording.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, pause it. No, no, no, no. Pause it.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re recording again just to get rid of the dog.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you feel when you first found out that Bethan had a learning disability?</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve had to confuse her more than anything.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The thing was that Bethan was born and a lot of my friends are having kids at the same time.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So she looked healthy. She looked beautiful, you know, to look at.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were milestones that she wasn&#039;t compared to my friend&#039;s kids.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So she would be walking at the same time as them, not talking at the same time as them.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember thinking, saying, well, you know, your child should have a hundred words, you know, for that.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was nowhere near that.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main thing we noticed was her socialization, you know, where the other kids were starting to after about six months,</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> noticing other children and getting involved or playing with things. Bethan wasn&#039;t like that, really.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it took a while to convince doctors and nurses that I thought there was something wrong, you know.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d say, oh, well, you know, children, they take a while.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, she&#039;ll catch her, you know, in all this business. And she didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think once I was told, yeah, you might be right here, I thought, no, thank God I&#039;ve got something right.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s, you know, and I think there was a sense of or a mixture of relief or, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> just the sense of that, you know, now we can get on with doing something about it.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But as a parent, you will always have these feelings of great sadness and grief.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, depending on how severe that disability is, you know,</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> they will be doing other things that your friends&#039; kids will be doing, like, you know,</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> going to university or getting married or having children.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think those milestones still hit you and you get quite emotional about it.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m lucky that, you know, I&#039;m quite positive about Beth.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s quite an unique girl in her ways.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And because of that, I&#039;d always be positive that she&#039;s beautiful and I can&#039;t think of her in any other way.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I, you know, I can&#039;t say I was upset, might be the wrong word, or hurt or whatever.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But with me, it was a battle just getting on with it and making sure that she was happy, content and safe.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it changed my view of how to be a parent and how what I wanted for my children,</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> because I think if Beth hadn&#039;t been around, I would have been one of these pushy parents,</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, quite ambitious for them and push them to do this.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas I&#039;m far more relaxed and I&#039;m certainly more relaxed with Dylan about, you know,</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> what he&#039;s wanted to do in his life and that, you know, the mantra is as long as they&#039;re happy and safe.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, you know, and that&#039;s all I want for them.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, so that&#039;s that was basically how I felt.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the Mencap groups were set up to provide social opportunities for people with a disability.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Having had a son without a disability to start with, what were the differences in terms of those opportunities?</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What? Between Beth and Dylan?</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Massive, massive.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We suddenly found out with Dylan how easy it was to bring up a child and go through those milestones.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Having with Dylan, you know, he potty trained himself really, basically.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d go to sleep at normal times. He&#039;d eat what, you know, there wasn&#039;t any issues about feeding or anything.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d socialize with other children, go off and play and stuff.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a massive difference between Beth and the other.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But what was lucky about us having Dylan as a second child was that Bethan seemed to speed up on her progression.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She started speaking a lot faster and, you know, her mind stones were a bit faster getting through,</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> knowing that Dylan basically was forcing her to catch up.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean Dylan would, you know, whereas with us, it would take us a little time to coach Bethan to say things and whatever.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Dylan would demand it, you know, come on Bethan, let&#039;s go, you know.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been like that through the night really.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And to today now, he&#039;s a great support with her, very defensive.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we&#039;ll look after her forever, I believe.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But what it&#039;s also done for Dylan is that he&#039;s been a better person for it, I think,</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> because I know headmaster was telling me about him in primary school.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> One thing about Dylan is if there&#039;s a child who starts is new, starting,</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> or there&#039;s a child who&#039;s sad or being bullied or finding it difficult,</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Dylan&#039;s always the one to suss it all out or to go towards the child and support them in a way, be friendly and comfort them and so forth.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is because he&#039;s been Bethan&#039;s brother, you know.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And because of that, I think that&#039;s why he&#039;s gone into the field of supporting Mencap Ceredigion himself, you know.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He supports us with all the social stuff that we do and all the workshops and stuff like that, and they love him.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, he treats them as equals.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He treats them as friends and, you know, lives them dearly.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But the other thing is, I think, that he&#039;s gone into teaching now is again because he&#039;s the type that wants to support and help.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And that I truly believe that&#039;s because, you know, he&#039;s had a system of him, just probably.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So back to Mencap Ceredigion, how did you first become aware of them?</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, again, by ringing when we came back to West Wales, we had all these organizations, you know, getting a list of stuff and just ringing.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got to meet the chair who&#039;s an amazing man, Bill Thompson, who&#039;d been a chair.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s now passed away.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mencap in those days were a bit different to what Mencap Ceredigion was different to what it is today.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And those Mencap Ceredigion in those days were far more involved with the provision of services and supported housing.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They owned a few houses in the county and they employed, trained, you know, they were, you know, ran those supported housing issue.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bill Thompson was a great one for, I think he was ex service.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he was either Navy or, you know, one of these God through the war titles, you know, Sergeant Major, but such a gentle, lovely gentleman, you know.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d kept the ship together and sort of set up all of these things, respite, supported housing, services, social clubs and all of that.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was all very, very well set up and everything when I got involved.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very well respected by the professionals as well, by the authorities, you know, and well liked by the members.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think one of the nicest letters, I have a few letters that have been given to me in my life from, you know, people I&#039;ve worked with when I&#039;ve left, they&#039;ve sent me a nice letter to see it by, you know.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one I treasure the most is from him that he sent because I had to leave Mencap Ceredigion for some reason.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was concentrating on some work issues and I said to him, look, you know, I won&#039;t be able to do so much.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the letters I treasure the most is the letter he sent me.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s there and I often now read a bit when you know you think, oh God, you know, it&#039;s getting too much.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you get your bad days and you read that letter and it makes you feel really good, you know.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> He was he was an amazing man and he was the lead of a big, you know, quite a set of quite strong committee members made up of parents.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And they ran everything really basically until Mencap, Cymru came along or Mencap National.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the name. Sintje.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Clive. No, that&#039;s the guy who came down to do the transitional bit of Mencap Ceredigion, giving the houses.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard. Howard Sintje. Yes. Clive is the guy that invented the seat, the bikes.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard Sintje. And I remember he came to the Feathers Hotel to have a meeting with us and to reassure us that we were doing the right thing, really.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t get involved with that so much.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the transition was quite small because the authorities helped it a lot.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was some housing associations as well.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have today supported housing in the county that are managed out by Mencap and by MIRAS.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But they wouldn&#039;t be what they are without Bill Thompson and that committee.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They set it up. It was like fine.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, really well looked after, well managed.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite easy to just pick it up and go.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the reason that they transferred over to?</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what it was. I think I don&#039;t know because I wasn&#039;t involved with it at the time.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it was because the parents were getting quite elderly now and it was a lot for them.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, every organization will find this. It&#039;s hard to get people on board committees and being trustees.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of responsibility nowadays for that, whether it was that or whether and this is my guess,</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it was the legislations and so forth and the amount of liability the authorities had,</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it was better for them to get involved with it really.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And so Mencap then was involved with the whole thing of support and services and education and living accommodation and everything.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> To what we are today, which is something totally different and is run totally differently as well.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was an amazing man and we were very, very lucky to have him in Ceredigion.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We were very lucky to have the committee as well.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve mentioned that when you joined Mencap Ceredigion didn&#039;t do much with younger people.</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there any other young people of members or were the parents similar age to you when you first joined?</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No, they were a lot older than me, the parents, because obviously their kids were adults.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> My child was a child. But the great thing about it was though, better than getting involved with all the activities.</div><div id="00:21:33.000" class="transcript_line"> If we had a disco, I&#039;d bring the kids along. So the committee got to know them very, very early on.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But what was really great is that my child, my children were getting to know the adults with their disabilities.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was learning what it was going to be like in the future. And so did Beth and Dylan.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And now Beth and Dylan are friends with these adults who are now obviously in their 50s and 60s.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So they know them as friends now. It is literally like a family.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We know them all. We know their parents. We know what they had for breakfast, what their favorite things are.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the one thing that with Mencap Ceredigion is, and they&#039;re probably the same with other branches in Wales,</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and something that people don&#039;t realize or need to realize and need not to forget is that with Mencap Ceredigion,</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> we are the only constant in their lives from the time they come on board as adults when they&#039;re 18, 29, to the time they die.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they will have support workers coming and going. Social workers will come and go. Doctors, nurses, teachers, you name it, whatever.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll come and go. But with Mencap Ceredigion, we&#039;re pretty much there because we don&#039;t change in any way.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re the same committee, we&#039;re the same parents, we&#039;re the same members. Nothing changes.</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think that&#039;s quite a good thing about our organization.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And for Beth and until then, they&#039;ve got people that they&#039;ve known, like the members I know, that we see coming to Gateway and to all the events that we hold.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known them for nearly 25 years. So there&#039;s a certain element of trust and knowledge, which in effect is really, really important when you&#039;re planning on what we do as a service now.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re able to listen to them and understand them more than anybody really, besides their own family and friends, obviously.</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But certainly we know them more than a social worker. And that&#039;s not being disrespectful to the social worker, but that&#039;s just being practically honest.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not going to know what people are like after knowing them for 25 years compared to knowing them from a file for five minutes.</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you gradually, your role with Mencap Cairdigan gradually change over the years? Because you&#039;re the chair now, is that?</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I wasn&#039;t the chair. I was going, you know, the lead of that.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My half-goals are out to chairs, you know, deputy chairs, secretaries, treasurers, I don&#039;t know if all we say.</div><div id="00:24:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I came on board really with another lady who was involved with Mencap Cairdigan then, and that was Karen Blower.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> We were both the same age, the same. We like the same thing, we got quite friendly.</div><div id="00:24:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And our job really was to organize all the discos.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were new onto that committee and much as I loved all the committee members, oh, they were all fashioned about their attitude to people with learning disabilities.</div><div id="00:25:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we had to bring them up to the 20th century.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, a lot of stuff had happened since, you know, 1983 with the new legislation and, you know, the turn of the century with education and, you know, the Education Act.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But they seemed to rule so back in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And although we lived them to bits, Karen and I had to work really hard.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we used to give money out to organizations.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the things that I think was Kenal and Stiff and the Day Center in Lampeter for people with disabilities wanted a computer.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So they sent us a letter to the committee and we then had a discussion.</div><div id="00:25:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of the committee members were aghast with a computer.</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean a computer? People with disabilities don&#039;t use computers.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But what do you do? They&#039;re silly, ridiculous.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to really fight hard to convince our committee that actually, yeah, you know, and of course today with phones,</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had members come to me and I&#039;ll say, because I&#039;m not technical, as you know, and I&#039;ll give them the phone saying, well, how do I do this, actually?</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Or, you know, you surf or whoever it is.</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ll take the phone off me and they&#039;ll sort they&#039;ve sorted it out.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So technically, our members are really up there, especially with social media, perhaps there&#039;s a bit too much in social media.</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was difficult. I can remember one instance.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We were organizing it.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was our first goal at organizing Christmas Disco in TGN.</div><div id="00:26:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was at Lampeter University.</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t remember either one.</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were dealing with the menu.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And we decided that we&#039;ll have chicken and, you know, and these chicken, they can&#039;t have chicken.</div><div id="00:26:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They just have sausage and chips.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Why? Well, it&#039;s easy to cut it up for them.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I would look at each other and this is from another era, you know.</div><div id="00:27:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So but we won that time.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We got them chicken and, you know, proper dinner that they could cut themselves.</div><div id="00:27:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think so.</div><div id="00:27:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We were in it.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was you could see the generation gap there.</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Really big time.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I think Bill Thompson was with us, you know, he said, Oh, yeah, I get you.</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I get you.</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of the committee members were really stuck in, you know, the the the old fashioned way of looking after all the awareness of people in those days.</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:27:49.000" class="transcript_line"> How they pushed back on some of those things and definitely.</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember talking to them about the development of cardiac and other have a gateway and that what has that started back 60 years ago again through Mencap.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, these tech gateways, so they still do.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We still do.</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But in those days, it was if you walked into a room, it would be the children and talking children in their 40s, 50s with the mums, the mums were knitting and the children do the jigsaws.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That was his social life.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to call it the knitting club because the mums would bring their knitting along.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Those attitudes have totally changed now.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, our social clubs now, whereas they used to be run and many of them still do in day centers, we purposely took them out to the day centers because we wanted them to be in the community.</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So our I know that our business is a bit difficult because I&#039;ve been running separate to us and they have it in a football club or whatever.</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Not in a running club because there&#039;s a lot of security in the way.</div><div id="00:29:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But the ones that we&#039;ve set up in.</div><div id="00:29:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s our South.</div><div id="00:29:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like Cardigan.</div><div id="00:29:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now is a Cardigan Castle Cafe.</div><div id="00:29:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, with the community, the one in Upper Vyland.</div><div id="00:29:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That one is a bit difficult.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re in a hole for that one.</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one in Newcastle, Emlyn is in a pub.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The one we&#039;re going to be setting up soon in Fentasil.</div><div id="00:29:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s going to be a pub.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Purposely because we&#039;re in the community and what we found is that the community are now getting involved with us.</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Last Saturday, we had a meeting in the Three Compasses Net here in Newcastle, Emlyn and they did a buffet for us and we brought our music system with us, which is the best thing we&#039;ve ever bought.</div><div id="00:29:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We had microphones and we were all listening to music in the beer garden, dancing and everything.</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And all of a sudden the locals are coming out and joining in.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a video of them all dancing with us and a group had come up for the weekend from Swansea and they joined in.</div><div id="00:30:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We had the microphones and we were all singing like karaoke and we were getting raffles because of the fundraiser.</div><div id="00:30:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it was 20 or 30 but they said, no, keep it clear.</div><div id="00:30:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a fortune on it.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But what was good was that the community was involved with us and we were involved with the community in front of you.</div><div id="00:30:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s, if you&#039;re asking for the difference between what it was like and what it is now, that&#039;s a very big positive as far as our members can see.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> All the different communities being with the groups that you take into cafes.</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. Well, think of it this way.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> People want to be kind.</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There are more good people than bad people as Ros Angus said.</div><div id="00:31:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There are more people there who want to help you than want to turn their backs.</div><div id="00:31:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So you want to take advantage of that really.</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But on the business side of it, can you imagine when we went to Newcastle Ebelin, the Cardigan one, the Aberyne one was getting too full.</div><div id="00:31:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to Cardigan to decant to some of the world and we opened one in Cardigan.</div><div id="00:31:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That was getting too full.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So we then opened one in Newcastle Ebelin.</div><div id="00:31:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going through Newcastle Ebelin, which in its day was a pub town really.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We had about 26 pubs in it in those days.</div><div id="00:31:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not so much that now.</div><div id="00:31:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But going around with pubs to see whether we could open some sort of...</div><div id="00:31:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody was really, yeah, yeah, yeah, they&#039;d love it.</div><div id="00:31:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But what we went for, we went there on a Wednesday night, I&#039;ll never forget, and the pub was empty midweek.</div><div id="00:32:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing happens in midweek.</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were fewer locals in there, I think very much.</div><div id="00:32:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the three campuses and we looked and it was ideal.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It had a snooker table. Great.</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> It was an area to dance.</div><div id="00:32:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a place to eat.</div><div id="00:32:19.000" class="transcript_line"> A beautiful beer garden.</div><div id="00:32:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And Wednesday was a quiet night.</div><div id="00:32:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a word with Pete and Jill.</div><div id="00:32:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They said, yeah, great.</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> If you want, we&#039;ll do some food and we&#039;ll welcome them.</div><div id="00:32:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a problem.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So now tonight, there&#039;s going to be a gateway there.</div><div id="00:32:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s going to be about 30, 40 people there.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Every one of them will be eating.</div><div id="00:32:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll probably spend a good tenner with drinks and everything.</div><div id="00:32:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s gone from a pub with a couple of locals down on a Wednesday night to a pub that&#039;s heaving.</div><div id="00:32:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s good about it is that the locals knowing there&#039;ll be a disco,</div><div id="00:33:00.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;ll be something on during the night.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a pop pool. It&#039;s a busy pub, precise pub.</div><div id="00:33:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll go there.</div><div id="00:33:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So the locals, we&#039;re actually helping commercially as well.</div><div id="00:33:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And that goes for all the other gateways that we&#039;ve got in the community.</div><div id="00:33:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So it benefits the town as well, really.</div><div id="00:33:19.000" class="transcript_line"> The Premier Shop next door tells me they make a bomb on a Wednesday night.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I say, why is that?</div><div id="00:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, we do a Rathford, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:33:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re all in there, our lot, buying sweets.</div><div id="00:33:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been told off about that before now that we shouldn&#039;t be raffling off sweets.</div><div id="00:33:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, that&#039;s what the members want.</div><div id="00:33:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they make a bomb on these sweets they buy and bring the bars of chocolates or box of chocolates.</div><div id="00:33:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They make a mark in an increase in profits.</div><div id="00:33:50.000" class="transcript_line"> What would have happened if you&#039;d suggested taking people to the pub when you first joined Bank of Carid again?</div><div id="00:33:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I think they would have been concerned.</div><div id="00:34:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because with their gateway, you know, bingo.</div><div id="00:34:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We do bingo. They love the bingo.</div><div id="00:34:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But only one game takes about 10 minutes, not the whole night.</div><div id="00:34:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they go to a restaurant once a month or something.</div><div id="00:34:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing wrong with that. But our members now, people with disabilities, they&#039;re expecting more out of us.</div><div id="00:34:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they want to work. Some don&#039;t want to work, but some do.</div><div id="00:34:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Some want to study more. Some want to socialize more.</div><div id="00:34:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Some want to travel. Some want to have a romantic relationship.</div><div id="00:34:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Some want to get married.</div><div id="00:34:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;re, they&#039;re what they want nowadays is a lot more than what it was, I mean, you know, 30, 40 years ago.</div><div id="00:34:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So you as an ACORUS then, as a charity, you&#039;ve got to, you know, it&#039;s member led.</div><div id="00:34:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They are the ones that tell us what to do.</div><div id="00:35:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Like tonight, this morning it was on Facebook.</div><div id="00:35:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what are we doing tonight, Jan? I don&#039;t know. What do you want to do?</div><div id="00:35:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s not we&#039;ll do this or any other.</div><div id="00:35:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So then we spend a fortune on pub, garden games, you know, like Giant Connect 4s and Giants.</div><div id="00:35:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Games and the garden. So we&#039;re, we&#039;re, I danced like, but outside.</div><div id="00:35:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And it&#039;s their choice. It&#039;s their side, you know.</div><div id="00:35:32.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the difference. Big difference. When you joined, would you say?</div><div id="00:35:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was. No.</div><div id="00:35:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think things have changed, not as a main category, but things have changed because of the different acts.</div><div id="00:35:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Like advocacy, self-advocacy, we&#039;re teaching our members now to have a voice.</div><div id="00:35:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re teaching people to listen to those voices.</div><div id="00:36:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing without us, to take gratitude. It&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:36:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That makes it a lot easier for us because they can, we&#039;ll organize it for them, but we don&#039;t have to think about what to do.</div><div id="00:36:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll tell us what to do.</div><div id="00:36:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think as long as they listen, people listen to them, then, then, you know, we&#039;ll be okay.</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s still a lot of people out there whose attitude is, you know, for them.</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it something that happened gradually becoming member led or was it just happened over time?</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a gradual thing as we were concerned.</div><div id="00:36:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We still had people who didn&#039;t quite understand, were not very peace-tee about things.</div><div id="00:36:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So it took a while. And there&#039;s still a battle sometimes.</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I often think with the situation we&#039;re in at the moment with a lot of cuts and the service has been cut back and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:37:04.000" class="transcript_line"> that we are getting back to that.</div><div id="00:37:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a big, big danger of getting back to the old days where, you know,</div><div id="00:37:13.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s whatever money you&#039;ve got, that&#039;s what you get.</div><div id="00:37:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re not listening to other people as much as to looking at money, vice versa.</div><div id="00:37:27.000" class="transcript_line"> How easy has it been for your members of the learning disability to get used to leading the organization and making decisions?</div><div id="00:37:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a hard one, really.</div><div id="00:37:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we had a self-applicacy group in Kennedy, Cuncone, Kennedy Dump People&#039;s Fellows, and that finished.</div><div id="00:37:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were left to know with no advocacy service, self-application, because there wasn&#039;t any advocacy service.</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But legislation has changed, not for the better, I&#039;m afraid.</div><div id="00:38:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So Mencak Kennedy decided that we&#039;d set up our own self-advocacy group.</div><div id="00:38:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was called, the members called it our voice, our choice.</div><div id="00:38:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we helped it for a while, facilitated it, helped them with meetings, administrations, stuff like that, until they were set up.</div><div id="00:38:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And we consciously then let them go.</div><div id="00:38:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Because one thing with self-advocacy, it has to be independent of any other organization, any other service, because otherwise it won&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:38:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were really, really big on that.</div><div id="00:38:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is difficult to get them to run the meeting effectively.</div><div id="00:38:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So you still need to support them.</div><div id="00:38:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But it has to be that it&#039;s supporting them and not doing it for them.</div><div id="00:38:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s been a really difficult transition, especially if you&#039;re somebody like me.</div><div id="00:39:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I like to be in control of stuff.</div><div id="00:39:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I, you know, I blame myself a lot where I&#039;d be in the meeting and I&#039;d say, oh, you don&#039;t do it that way.</div><div id="00:39:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You do it this way, you know, and then I&#039;m trying to have the hands off.</div><div id="00:39:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more my problem, I think, than their problem.</div><div id="00:39:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because on Saturday they had a meeting and I would stick myself out of the chair and I&#039;d be like, I&#039;m not saying a word and keep your mouth.</div><div id="00:39:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know what? They ran it fine.</div><div id="00:39:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think there&#039;s a bit of confidence in letting them get on with it, but be there to be supportive and not be doing it.</div><div id="00:39:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So Mencap-Carradiguan is separate to Mencap-Cumbria.</div><div id="00:39:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that relationship been like in the last 20 years?</div><div id="00:39:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been an odd one, really, to be honest with you, because first of all, it&#039;s difficult for people outside that don&#039;t know us to differentiate the two.</div><div id="00:40:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think they have to, to be honest, because we do two different things, as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Mencap-Carradiguan is a branch, very small branch, of volunteers.</div><div id="00:40:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Mencap-Cumbria is a charity and it&#039;s throughout Wales.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re not the same in as much. We have the same ideals.</div><div id="00:40:25.000" class="transcript_line"> We have the same hopes and so forth for our members.</div><div id="00:40:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We support them in the same way, but we do two different things.</div><div id="00:40:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was difficult for me because I.</div><div id="00:40:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought of them as two separate things in as much one fighting the other for the same thought, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was hard for me, especially funding wise.</div><div id="00:40:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a couple of issues that really I wasn&#039;t happy about where, for instance, if somebody did a will.</div><div id="00:41:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was somebody died and it was somebody in Cairnicuon.</div><div id="00:41:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The money that that will was going to was going to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:41:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So we we didn&#039;t get a look in. So there&#039;s a lot of that going on.</div><div id="00:41:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know. And we work really, really closely now.</div><div id="00:41:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve got a really good positive relationship.</div><div id="00:41:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Wayne is very supportive of the work that we do.</div><div id="00:41:31.000" class="transcript_line"> As is he&#039;s supportive of all the other branches and you yourself, Paul and all the other staff always at the end of the phone.</div><div id="00:41:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The the the head office, you know, in Kidaminsters, where the main office is.</div><div id="00:41:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Peter Brands. There&#039;s another.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s there&#039;s nothing.</div><div id="00:41:51.000" class="transcript_line"> That they won&#039;t do for you if you want to get free T-shirts or you want some advice on, you know, volunteering at shows or</div><div id="00:41:59.000" class="transcript_line"> insurance or stuff like that. They&#039;re there.</div><div id="00:42:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think as a small branch, you need that big brother support.</div><div id="00:42:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I mean? But at the same time, Wayne&#039;s really good in letting us get on with this as well.</div><div id="00:42:14.000" class="transcript_line"> As long as what we do is legal. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s bothered.</div><div id="00:42:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, he&#039;s really, really supportive.</div><div id="00:42:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And it seems like, you know, one of the things I do find with being in West Wales,</div><div id="00:42:30.000" class="transcript_line"> big gripe with me is everything is happening in Cardiff, you know.</div><div id="00:42:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if if if a charity is an all Wales charity, they should be covering all of Wales.</div><div id="00:42:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they get the funding to support all of Wales.</div><div id="00:42:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But you often find all of these charities are based in Cardiff and all the money is drifted over to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:42:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas we make a pit with Medcap. They very much I feel and I see anyway that they spread their resources across Wales.</div><div id="00:43:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They spread their funding, if possible, across Wales and all their projects and all their people.</div><div id="00:43:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, now we&#039;ve got a development officer, Rod Drews, who lives in Llandronddol that comes westward.</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never had that before.</div><div id="00:43:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I think I think we&#039;re quite lucky as a branch to be associated with Medcap as a whole.</div><div id="00:43:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, to recognize, well, respect and charity.</div><div id="00:43:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Plus, we&#039;ve got our supported housing as well here, half of which are covered by Medcap as well.</div><div id="00:43:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, we&#039;ve got a strong base in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:43:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I know a lot of other counties don&#039;t even have a branch.</div><div id="00:43:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, we&#039;re I think it&#039;s quite a good outfit where the national, regional and branch works really, really well together.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell me a little bit about the Comic Con?</div><div id="00:43:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Comic Con, we as a branch, the fingers in lots of pies, you know, we have a gateway, we have a swimming swimming group,</div><div id="00:44:03.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got gardening, artwork, Sunday lunch clubs, all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:44:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But my daughter was really, really interested in a lot of our members in animation, anime, Disney and other Japanese stuff.</div><div id="00:44:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to love dressing up and going to what you call them Comic Cons, you know, conventions where you dress up and so forth.</div><div id="00:44:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish I&#039;d taken her to London and stuff. I remember taking her to one in The Hex article, one of these big places anyway.</div><div id="00:44:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Excel Center.</div><div id="00:44:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Excel Center.</div><div id="00:44:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Excel Center. And I can remember going in there and she was dressed up, I wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:44:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt really, really standing out, you know, I was in normal clothes and everybody else was dressed up.</div><div id="00:44:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a massive place. And there&#039;s this big room in there.</div><div id="00:44:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were all collecting something or other, bits, thousands.</div><div id="00:45:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And somebody said to me, there&#039;s 80,000 people in this room, all dressed up.</div><div id="00:45:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know that there&#039;s only 75,000 living in Keredikyo. We could have filled the whole of Keredikyo.</div><div id="00:45:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a massive, massive different things to do with animation.</div><div id="00:45:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I noticed was an awful lot of people with learning disabilities and autism were really keen.</div><div id="00:45:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Why, I don&#039;t know, but there&#039;s a massive following.</div><div id="00:45:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bethan used to go to all these places.</div><div id="00:45:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve said there&#039;s only two places that I have seen Bethan, which I would say she fits in.</div><div id="00:45:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s like a normal person, if there&#039;s such a word as normal.</div><div id="00:45:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s Disneyland Paris, Disneyland in Florida and any convention.</div><div id="00:45:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And they fit in.</div><div id="00:45:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember Bethan, we were driving back from London and she said to all these journeys,</div><div id="00:46:03.000" class="transcript_line"> can we not have one in Wales? Can we not have one in Keredikyo?</div><div id="00:46:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what? A convention? Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, yeah, I suppose we could.</div><div id="00:46:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And we said, yeah, that&#039;d be a great idea.</div><div id="00:46:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing ever happened.</div><div id="00:46:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s this one particular like, we were in Cardigan, I&#039;ll never forget, Cardigan Gateway.</div><div id="00:46:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a support worker there, it was new and I&#039;d never seen her before.</div><div id="00:46:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bethan hooked up to this support worker and there was disco and dancing and they were talking together.</div><div id="00:46:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were really into each other type of thing.</div><div id="00:46:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I spoke to her and her name was Rowan.</div><div id="00:46:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, oh, Bethan&#039;s fascinating. I love anime, she said.</div><div id="00:46:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she and Bethan had this t-shirt on with some anime remark that any serious, serious anime person,</div><div id="00:46:56.000" class="transcript_line"> no one else knew about it but an anime person.</div><div id="00:46:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was attracted to that t-shirt.</div><div id="00:47:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it turned out that Rowan, not only had she been to Japan, where Bethan would love to go to,</div><div id="00:47:09.000" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;d actually gone to university in Japan to study animation.</div><div id="00:47:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was actually involved with wild films on a part-time basis as well.</div><div id="00:47:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So she was doing a bit of support work and she was involved in that.</div><div id="00:47:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And what developed out of that was Rowan and Bethan, Hannah, who was another support worker,</div><div id="00:47:33.000" class="transcript_line"> who was a brilliant artist and animator, and Jake, who is a well-known,</div><div id="00:47:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Jake Wittaker is a well-known filmmaker in County, teamed up, the four of them,</div><div id="00:47:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and they set up Kennedy County Animation Group.</div><div id="00:47:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And with that group, they meet up on a regular basis and they&#039;ve made good three, four, five films, animated films.</div><div id="00:47:56.000" class="transcript_line"> During Covid, they were having Zoom meetings every week.</div><div id="00:48:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And not only are members in Kennedy County, but people from Cardiff, Bridgend, Pembrokeshire,</div><div id="00:48:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and they meet up on Zoom and they&#039;re brilliant artists as well.</div><div id="00:48:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And they do an awful lot of work together. And they&#039;ve had some awareness days.</div><div id="00:48:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve had some workshops in Cardigan, Small World Theatre and everything.</div><div id="00:48:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And we got some money from Wild Films and Film Company to actually have a convention.</div><div id="00:48:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we had the first convention and about three or four hundred people came along to it.</div><div id="00:48:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d made two films for it. We&#039;re actually in the Aberystwyth Arts Centre.</div><div id="00:48:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We had the next one then on the 28th of March. I&#039;ll never forget it. 2020 or 2019. When was Covid? 2020.</div><div id="00:48:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the week that Kennedy had decided to do a lockdown. We did it a week before, actually.</div><div id="00:48:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d bethoned on the computer telling everybody that we had to cancel.</div><div id="00:49:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But we had ours about two months ago. We&#039;ve got loads of people coming along.</div><div id="00:49:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re now determined, unless we&#039;ve got another Covid, to do it on a manual basis.</div><div id="00:49:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it just people with a learning disability coming to the convention?</div><div id="00:49:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Most are, yeah. But no, there are people there as well who are just interested in animation.</div><div id="00:49:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s working with universities and other agencies.</div><div id="00:49:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can see it being a lot, lot bigger than what it is. But it&#039;s just getting there slowly.</div><div id="00:49:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the impact of Covid on the organisation?</div><div id="00:49:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Crikey. That was a big shock to us because everything came to a stop. It wasn&#039;t a gradual stop. It was a stop.</div><div id="00:50:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So all our social clubs couldn&#039;t meet.</div><div id="00:50:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So we, within a week, decided, and we were probably one of the first, to use social media.</div><div id="00:50:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I found out about Zoom. Never heard of Zoom before. Still don&#039;t quite understand how it works, but anyway.</div><div id="00:50:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And very, very quickly, we were using FaceTime. We got a lot of volunteers along.</div><div id="00:50:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And we did things with our members. Things like Monday night was a quiz night.</div><div id="00:50:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Wednesday, Saturday, comedy nights. Everyone had to come along with a joke.</div><div id="00:50:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Marks had a ten. We had Friday coffee morning. Then we had things like Keep Fit.</div><div id="00:50:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We could have volunteers that did Keep Fit with them. We did some cooking. We didn&#039;t do much cooking actually. We could have done more.</div><div id="00:51:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We had Tom, Tom Evans, who is a writer. He&#039;s got a relative with learning disabilities.</div><div id="00:51:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wrote a whole book, if you like. And he read, he wrote it and read it every single day of the lockdowns.</div><div id="00:51:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Every day. And other people did, I mean, Rihanna, for instance, she used to do the competition of the week where she&#039;d take a photo of a jar with jelly beans in it.</div><div id="00:51:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had to guess how many. So on a Monday, you&#039;d have the picture and then people would be sending in their guessing, you know.</div><div id="00:51:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And the next week would be a box of pencils. How many pencils? Things like that.</div><div id="00:51:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They would get involved with that sort of thing. And then we got a pop group Dunlom was friends with.</div><div id="00:52:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And the lead singer did a Nightwake, sang all the songs from the group.</div><div id="00:52:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had George from Captain Entertainment having discos.</div><div id="00:52:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were really, we were fat, I used to say, and busy an hour with them when we were before Covid.</div><div id="00:52:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But the other thing that we did as well was we were on the other side of the phone.</div><div id="00:52:29.000" class="transcript_line"> If people were in need of any help, and we would refer, like if people couldn&#039;t get to a shop or something like that, we could ring the authorities and get them to a food bank or whatever.</div><div id="00:52:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was that link. But what we were conscious of was that not many people, people who weren&#039;t on social media, how were they coping?</div><div id="00:52:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We were disappointed, I have to say, with some of the supported housing organizations not being supportive and getting their members on social media.</div><div id="00:53:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Every house has got a computer stuck in their office. That&#039;s a problem.</div><div id="00:53:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was nobody, I can remember one support worker telling me, I don&#039;t agree with social media.</div><div id="00:53:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s terrible that they can, you know, can all sort of problems. I don&#039;t really care what you think.</div><div id="00:53:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I want that person on Facebook. He&#039;s able to do it. I want you to support it. And as it was, you have to.</div><div id="00:53:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think the worst thing about Covid for certain people who weren&#039;t in contact with us through social media or Zoom was they missed their friends.</div><div id="00:53:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, a lot of people think people with disabilities, you know, they&#039;re not really good at communicating or socializing or, you know, they don&#039;t have eye contact.</div><div id="00:53:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So how can they make friends and have, you know, all of this business?</div><div id="00:53:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But actually, they are the most social people in the world and they really, really missed Gateway.</div><div id="00:54:02.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one person who used to ring me every week. I know what he said to me on the other side of the phone was,</div><div id="00:54:11.000" class="transcript_line"> When is the Christmas disc of? When is the Gateway? When is, when am I going to see my friends and stuff?</div><div id="00:54:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were breaking their hearts because they could, they just didn&#039;t have a social life.</div><div id="00:54:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always think, and I see these policies coming from the World Trade Assembly, you know, supporting people to go to work,</div><div id="00:54:33.000" class="transcript_line"> whether they like it or not, they&#039;re going to be supposed to go to work or supporting people to live independently, to cook, to pay their bills.</div><div id="00:54:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s a different things, but there&#039;s very, very little.</div><div id="00:54:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I was hoping they&#039;d learn from the Covid situation, fairly little about social life.</div><div id="00:54:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they are allowed, they have a right to have a social life.</div><div id="00:54:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s very little provision out there for a social life, supporting people to go out, not just go to the pub.</div><div id="00:55:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen support workers taking people for a coffee. Going for a coffee seems to be a big thing.</div><div id="00:55:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But the thing about socialising, helping them to get to know other people, for instance, that&#039;s what we aim to do with our gateways.</div><div id="00:55:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And we, you know, a social worker who sits next to a person in one of our gateways and they don&#039;t get involved with their client or other people.</div><div id="00:55:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re there on their phones. We take a photo of them and we show them it.</div><div id="00:55:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is not the way to support people. So we encourage our social workers and support workers.</div><div id="00:55:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And they do to not only get involved with the clients, but also get involved with the whole group so the client can get to know people, be friendly, you know, socialise.</div><div id="00:56:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they get a lot more out of their social events by doing that, really.</div><div id="00:56:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They missed it over coffee.</div><div id="00:56:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I think we&#039;re getting really upset.</div><div id="00:56:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But I tell you, the first gateway part of the plant, I mean, there were tears, you know, there were just hugs.</div><div id="00:56:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Although we weren&#039;t supposed to hug, we were.</div><div id="00:56:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the first time we had was really emotional, which just goes to show that people with disabilities can, you know, have certain relationships that are really important to them.</div><div id="00:56:42.000" class="transcript_line"> When lockdown ended and things got back to normal, did things for Mencap Cairdegon get back to normal straight away or?</div><div id="00:56:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We really wanted to get back straight away into normality.</div><div id="00:56:57.000" class="transcript_line"> There were legislations that stopped us to do it as fast as we could do, I suppose.</div><div id="00:57:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we had to have our meetings outside instead of inside and all of this business.</div><div id="00:57:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to have masks. We had to do this, we had that, which, you know, made life a little bit difficult.</div><div id="00:57:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But I would say within a month we were back to normal.</div><div id="00:57:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Were the members back to normal?</div><div id="00:57:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, to a certain degree, I think.</div><div id="00:57:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it took them a bit of time, you know, with wearing the masks and the worry of COVID and, oh, we can&#039;t touch or, you know, things like that.</div><div id="00:57:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And especially support workers who worked for agencies who were very strict about, you know, wearing the mask for a lot longer than they needed to or couldn&#039;t sit next to people.</div><div id="00:57:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Their regulations were quite strict, really.</div><div id="00:57:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas we were more laid back, I suppose, more maverick, more in your face, which makes it more disappointing that a lot of agencies now, certainly the authorities, are still not back to normal.</div><div id="00:58:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The day centres are still not open.</div><div id="00:58:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re talking three years now.</div><div id="00:58:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The offices are still not manned.</div><div id="00:58:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, now if I want to get in contact with somebody in social services, I&#039;ve got to go through the reception area.</div><div id="00:58:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They take my telephone number or my email address and then that person will come back to me.</div><div id="00:58:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know that person is working from home, which often means the baby&#039;s crying in the background or the dog is barking.</div><div id="00:58:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, my computer&#039;s down, my computer&#039;s next door, I can&#039;t, oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.</div><div id="00:58:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, things have not gone back to normal and it&#039;ll take a while, I think.</div><div id="00:58:48.000" class="transcript_line"> People have been given choices of working from home, which I think is good because, you know, environmentally it&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:58:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But they need to be making sure that the service doesn&#039;t change and the people that are working from home are actually working in a place that can be adapted into a working area.</div><div id="00:59:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think that&#039;s been done.</div><div id="00:59:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we&#039;re missing out on services certainly because of that and the way services are run at the moment.</div><div id="00:59:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re far, far slower to get back to normal.</div><div id="00:59:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But as far as we&#039;re concerned, as if COVID never happened really.</div><div id="00:59:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So finally, been at Mencap Coyote again 20, 23 years.</div><div id="00:59:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any new Jans joining?</div><div id="00:59:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I hope so.</div><div id="00:59:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to get volunteers, really hard, especially nowadays because, you know, people are working one, two jobs.</div><div id="00:59:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, things are harder nowadays, really.</div><div id="01:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a couple of people coming along.</div><div id="01:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s more mindful than anything in trying to let things go.</div><div id="01:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the worst one to delegate.</div><div id="01:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I give somebody a job to do.</div><div id="01:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;re not doing it properly.</div><div id="01:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Give it to me, I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="01:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll finish it all, I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="01:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But we have started, we have to do one again, where we had a friends&#039; tea, where it&#039;s a mixture of interested friends and parents.</div><div id="01:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we need to work and persevere on that because otherwise, you know, no, there won&#039;t be another Jan.</div><div id="01:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got to have another journal, you know, to have a pool of volunteers, you know, to take over for the future.</div><div id="01:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think we&#039;ll finish there.</div><div id="01:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="01:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Lost it.</div></div></p>
