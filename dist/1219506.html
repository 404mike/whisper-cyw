think that&#039;s going.</div><div id="00:00:10.520" class="transcript_line"> This is Jim Barrett interviewing Danny Thomas at his house on the 9th of April 2018.</div><div id="00:00:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Danny signed the project consent form.</div><div id="00:00:23.700" class="transcript_line"> This interview has been recorded for Wunderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.</div><div id="00:00:32.700" class="transcript_line"> OK, off we go.</div><div id="00:00:35.500" class="transcript_line"> So when did you actually join Wunderbras, Danny, do you know?</div><div id="00:00:40.060" class="transcript_line"> I think it must have been about at least 15 years ago.</div><div id="00:00:46.700" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the date exactly.</div><div id="00:00:52.620" class="transcript_line"> It was, I just tried to start a blues group a little bit before and that hadn&#039;t been successful.</div><div id="00:01:00.620" class="transcript_line"> And I happened to notice a poster, I think it was in the station saying Taff Ely Street Band, anyone can join and sing where the practices were.</div><div id="00:01:15.620" class="transcript_line"> And so I put my guitar and went over to see.</div><div id="00:01:21.620" class="transcript_line"> Taff Ely Street Band, so it&#039;s probably more than 15 years, probably more like 20 I should think.</div><div id="00:01:28.620" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure when it turned from Taff Ely to Wunderbras.</div><div id="00:01:32.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the poster said Taff Ely, I think it had just changed.</div><div id="00:01:38.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, by the time I joined.</div><div id="00:01:40.620" class="transcript_line"> You are one of the very early members.</div><div id="00:01:44.620" class="transcript_line"> Not the very, very early.</div><div id="00:01:46.620" class="transcript_line"> I think, well I was told they started with about nine people, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:01:51.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:52.620" class="transcript_line"> It had grown a bit by then to about 20.</div><div id="00:01:55.620" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:01:56.620" class="transcript_line"> And you started, you were playing tenor saxophone?</div><div id="00:02:01.620" class="transcript_line"> Not to start with.</div><div id="00:02:04.620" class="transcript_line"> I took my acoustic guitar the first time.</div><div id="00:02:08.620" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:02:09.620" class="transcript_line"> And they found out that it was, acoustic guitar was impossibly too quiet.</div><div id="00:02:18.620" class="transcript_line"> So I broke the electric the following week.</div><div id="00:02:22.620" class="transcript_line"> And I played that for I think two years before I started getting interested in saxophone and stuff.</div><div id="00:02:35.620" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:02:36.620" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember you playing guitar with Wunderbras.</div><div id="00:02:40.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:42.620" class="transcript_line"> If you remember, I was playing guitar when we went to Vienna.</div><div id="00:02:47.620" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:02:48.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:49.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:50.620" class="transcript_line"> It was a later stage.</div><div id="00:02:52.620" class="transcript_line"> I picked up the saxophone.</div><div id="00:02:54.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was meeting all kind of people playing brass instruments really, Wunderbras encouraged me to.</div><div id="00:03:02.620" class="transcript_line"> To start playing.</div><div id="00:03:05.620" class="transcript_line"> Start playing saxophone.</div><div id="00:03:07.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:08.620" class="transcript_line"> So did you get lessons then on the saxophone?</div><div id="00:03:11.620" class="transcript_line"> Not to start with.</div><div id="00:03:15.620" class="transcript_line"> I have since then occasionally.</div><div id="00:03:20.620" class="transcript_line"> Mostly taught myself.</div><div id="00:03:24.620" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s impressive.</div><div id="00:03:26.620" class="transcript_line"> Was guitar your first instrument?</div><div id="00:03:28.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:29.620" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:03:30.620" class="transcript_line"> And how long had you been playing the guitar when you joined?</div><div id="00:03:34.620" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been, well, quite a long time really.</div><div id="00:03:39.620" class="transcript_line"> I started playing guitar when I was about 12 or 13 years old.</div><div id="00:03:47.620" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, and I pretty much taught myself again.</div><div id="00:03:52.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:54.620" class="transcript_line"> What I first sort of found joining Wunderbras, it was like it did different kind of worlds.</div><div id="00:04:00.620" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been used to kind of rock bands and blues bands.</div><div id="00:04:05.620" class="transcript_line"> And it was a completely different genre really in which people were talking about sevenths and ninths.</div><div id="00:04:14.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:15.620" class="transcript_line"> All kinds of things like that.</div><div id="00:04:17.620" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of people could read music and I was not really able to do that.</div><div id="00:04:23.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:26.620" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why you went over to saxophone?</div><div id="00:04:30.620" class="transcript_line"> Partly, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:33.620" class="transcript_line"> I was playing the kind of chords and I was not really understanding a lot about the melodies and soloing and stuff.</div><div id="00:04:49.620" class="transcript_line"> And one of the reasons going over to saxophone was to get a more of a grasp of that.</div><div id="00:04:55.620" class="transcript_line"> I felt that it was there in the background, but I couldn&#039;t articulate it and actually play it.</div><div id="00:05:06.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:07.620" class="transcript_line"> And what was Wunderbras like when you joined it with those people?</div><div id="00:05:17.620" class="transcript_line"> In sort of what way?</div><div id="00:05:19.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, was it what you expected when you actually saw the notes and went along?</div><div id="00:05:25.620" class="transcript_line"> No, not really.</div><div id="00:05:27.620" class="transcript_line"> But because people were talking about things, sort of musical things that I didn&#039;t really, jazz things.</div><div id="00:05:40.620" class="transcript_line"> And lots of people knew about people like Miles Davis and John Coltrane and I never heard of him.</div><div id="00:05:49.620" class="transcript_line"> So he was like a bit of a shock really to the system.</div><div id="00:05:54.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:05:55.620" class="transcript_line"> And also musically, I realised things like timing wasn&#039;t good.</div><div id="00:06:05.620" class="transcript_line"> There were lots of things that made me like punching the stomach really to start with.</div><div id="00:06:15.620" class="transcript_line"> But it made me think, well, you know, did give me a challenge to, you know.</div><div id="00:06:22.620" class="transcript_line"> And also like playing in keys that, you know, guitarists don&#039;t normally do like E flat and E flat.</div><div id="00:06:33.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:35.620" class="transcript_line"> Challenging. But did you feel comfortable with the band?</div><div id="00:06:43.620" class="transcript_line"> I think so, half and half really, a little bit overwhelming in one way.</div><div id="00:06:49.620" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, there were some good people there.</div><div id="00:06:53.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And Vienne, that&#039;s a trip that I didn&#039;t do.</div><div id="00:06:59.620" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember why I didn&#039;t do Vienne.</div><div id="00:07:02.620" class="transcript_line"> I sort of came and went a bit with One Debrass because I was up in London a bit higher.</div><div id="00:07:08.620" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re actually recording the moment, but never mind.</div><div id="00:07:11.620" class="transcript_line"> Is that right?</div><div id="00:07:13.620" class="transcript_line"> I thought you&#039;d recorded the moment.</div><div id="00:07:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I don&#039;t remember you from that period when I started, but then you did, I remember you coming back into One Debrass, I think, around the time of Breck and Jazz.</div><div id="00:07:35.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:39.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was probably playing double bass then, was I?</div><div id="00:07:43.620" class="transcript_line"> What were you playing? No, I don&#039;t think you were.</div><div id="00:07:48.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, then it must have been bass clarinet.</div><div id="00:07:51.620" class="transcript_line"> I think it was bass clarinet because, what were they called?</div><div id="00:07:56.620" class="transcript_line"> They were two women, one young girl.</div><div id="00:08:01.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Joanna.</div><div id="00:08:02.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s it. And then there was, I think that&#039;s someone else, another woman, which I can&#039;t remember her name.</div><div id="00:08:12.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I should know her name.</div><div id="00:08:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Anyway.</div><div id="00:08:22.620" class="transcript_line"> So how did you like going to Vienne? What did you think about that?</div><div id="00:08:26.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was great, really.</div><div id="00:08:29.620" class="transcript_line"> It was a new kind of experience again.</div><div id="00:08:36.620" class="transcript_line"> And the end itself was spectacular, the stadium and all that.</div><div id="00:08:46.620" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it was great.</div><div id="00:08:55.620" class="transcript_line"> Are there any other sort of standout gigs or events with One Debrass?</div><div id="00:09:04.620" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll try to think. Some of the other festivals.</div><div id="00:09:09.620" class="transcript_line"> Breck and Jazz could always, was good quite often, I think.</div><div id="00:09:17.620" class="transcript_line"> The times when you went down really well, it seemed to suit that kind of street thing.</div><div id="00:09:29.620" class="transcript_line"> We did, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:32.620" class="transcript_line"> That I&#039;m trying to think of.</div><div id="00:09:40.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we went down to Denise&#039;s Wedding. That was great.</div><div id="00:09:50.620" class="transcript_line"> I just, the location was really...</div><div id="00:09:55.620" class="transcript_line"> The Druidstone Hotel.</div><div id="00:09:57.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:09:58.620" class="transcript_line"> Out in West Wales.</div><div id="00:09:59.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Have you been out there many times or, because there was a sort of habit of One Debrass going out there quite often.</div><div id="00:10:08.620" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t go again with One Debrass.</div><div id="00:10:12.620" class="transcript_line"> Right. Okay. There is another One Debrass wedding coming up.</div><div id="00:10:19.620" class="transcript_line"> The Druidstone Short actually.</div><div id="00:10:23.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So yeah.</div><div id="00:10:26.620" class="transcript_line"> Anything else that you sort of remember about the band or your experiences in it?</div><div id="00:10:37.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, it, another kind of thing was the Ponti Jazz Club, which was closely associated with One Debrass.</div><div id="00:10:52.620" class="transcript_line"> And that has kind of kept going.</div><div id="00:10:55.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:56.620" class="transcript_line"> Even though One Debrass moved down to Cardiff now.</div><div id="00:11:01.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:02.620" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, I still, there&#039;s something to do, I&#039;ve got friends with a lot of people that were One Debrass people, like Charles.</div><div id="00:11:14.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:16.620" class="transcript_line"> And Dave Moroe.</div><div id="00:11:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:20.620" class="transcript_line"> And Derek and stuff.</div><div id="00:11:23.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, Derek and Charles are still playing with the band.</div><div id="00:11:27.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:28.620" class="transcript_line"> Dave Moroe, no, he&#039;s off doing other stuff.</div><div id="00:11:34.620" class="transcript_line"> Have you been doing other stuff yourself since One Debrass?</div><div id="00:11:39.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I kind of was involved with a band that started in work, which started off as a soul band, then drifted more into kind of Latin and soul.</div><div id="00:12:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Which I did that for about four years, but it&#039;s difficult to keep a band together, really, personalities and stuff.</div><div id="00:12:11.620" class="transcript_line"> Were you playing saxophone or guitar?</div><div id="00:12:14.620" class="transcript_line"> I was playing both, actually, depending on the song.</div><div id="00:12:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:19.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was very enjoyable.</div><div id="00:12:25.620" class="transcript_line"> Is that something that&#039;s, I mean, do you think if you had not been in One Debrass that that&#039;s something you would have done?</div><div id="00:12:37.620" class="transcript_line"> I think, well, I wouldn&#039;t have started playing the saxophone without being in One Debrass.</div><div id="00:12:47.620" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve always had the urge to be doing something in music.</div><div id="00:12:53.620" class="transcript_line"> So I probably would be doing some kind of a band or maybe trying or maybe dreaming of being in a band.</div><div id="00:13:00.620" class="transcript_line"> But, yeah, it, but One Debrass did have a big influence on some styles of music and, you know, and playing the saxophone and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:13:21.620" class="transcript_line"> So why did you actually cease being part of One Debrass?</div><div id="00:13:26.620" class="transcript_line"> I think, well, a number of reasons.</div><div id="00:13:31.620" class="transcript_line"> I think I slightly got fed up at times with it.</div><div id="00:13:38.620" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s inevitable, really.</div><div id="00:13:40.620" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose I wanted to do something more like write my own tunes and have more control over my own band, really.</div><div id="00:13:57.620" class="transcript_line"> To move towards doing that, really.</div><div id="00:14:04.620" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:14:08.620" class="transcript_line"> And we got this project 25 when we&#039;re getting quite a few old or ex-members, I should say, oldies of the press, the long term, ex-members, because nobody&#039;s as old as me, ex-members, sort of coming back, not necessarily to rejoin as much as to just do a bit of One Debrass and meet up.</div><div id="00:14:30.620" class="transcript_line"> Would you be interested in getting involved?</div><div id="00:14:33.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:34.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay, we&#039;ll have to talk about what might be possible.</div><div id="00:14:38.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thanks a lot, Danny.</div></div></p>
