    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So my first question to you is can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as you know, I was born and raised in Guyana. I initially came to the United Kingdom in 2021 to work in the NHS.</div><div id="00:00:17.920" class="transcript_line"> When I landed I</div><div id="00:00:20.720" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t meant to come to Wales.</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> I started out in Liverpool, but I met my husband and</div><div id="00:00:28.960" class="transcript_line"> I moved to Wales. We got married and then I moved to Wales.</div><div id="00:00:34.440" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how I ended up in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:50.400" class="transcript_line"> Take your time, take your time. I&#039;ll just give you, you know, some time to zoom back in.</div><div id="00:00:56.560" class="transcript_line"> As I would have mentioned when we had the workshop, I learned about Wales</div><div id="00:01:05.240" class="transcript_line"> through my granddad because he had a slate with the Welsh dragon on it.</div><div id="00:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I learned about Wales. So when I moved to Wales, you know, I was quite happy.</div><div id="00:01:16.160" class="transcript_line"> I remembered, you know, that little</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> moment we had when I was a child about Wales.</div><div id="00:01:21.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:23.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think it&#039;s really interesting that you had that slate.</div><div id="00:01:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:29.720" class="transcript_line"> Why he had that or how he had that?</div><div id="00:01:31.720" class="transcript_line"> Because Guyana was once a British colony.</div><div id="00:01:35.720" class="transcript_line"> They did a lot of trade in between the Caribbean, South America and the UK.</div><div id="00:01:40.720" class="transcript_line"> So</div><div id="00:01:42.720" class="transcript_line"> back then they weren&#039;t any</div><div id="00:01:44.720" class="transcript_line"> white boards or chalk boards. They used slates to</div><div id="00:01:48.720" class="transcript_line"> write, to take notes in school.</div><div id="00:01:50.720" class="transcript_line"> So I would assume that it came from this part, this part of the world for them to use there in schools because</div><div id="00:01:58.720" class="transcript_line"> he went to a Catholic school and I think it was run by some missionaries from the UK.</div><div id="00:02:04.720" class="transcript_line"> So I guess that&#039;s where he got it from.</div><div id="00:02:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Were they still using those slates when you were in school or was it something different?</div><div id="00:02:14.720" class="transcript_line"> No, it was totally different.</div><div id="00:02:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I think they got rid of them sometime in the early 80s.</div><div id="00:02:22.720" class="transcript_line"> No, when I went to school, they were books.</div><div id="00:02:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, books.</div><div id="00:02:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Did he tell you much about how it was to use the slate or did you just inherit it sort of without any stories attached to it?</div><div id="00:02:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Just a little story.</div><div id="00:02:40.720" class="transcript_line"> He just mentioned that he used it in the early 80s.</div><div id="00:02:44.720" class="transcript_line"> He just mentioned that he used it in school and the school that he went to, it was under like a house</div><div id="00:02:52.720" class="transcript_line"> because the house was high but there was no enclosure at the bottom because I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re familiar with</div><div id="00:03:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Caribbean houses but what they were like in the 70s, 80s, 90s, it was just the upper part but the lower part, it was completely open.</div><div id="00:03:11.720" class="transcript_line"> It was mostly like that to hold functions like schools, church and any other function.</div><div id="00:03:20.720" class="transcript_line"> He just mentioned that there was an organization that had a little school under a house and that&#039;s what they used to take notes.</div><div id="00:03:29.720" class="transcript_line"> He was quite a bit of a hoarder so he had loads of bits and pieces from his early life.</div><div id="00:03:42.720" class="transcript_line"> And then you said that when you had it, you turned it out round and it was the Welsh Dragon on the back.</div><div id="00:03:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was the Welsh Dragon on the back.</div><div id="00:03:52.720" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what it was and then he told me, you know, that&#039;s from the United Kingdom, maybe one day you&#039;ll get there.</div><div id="00:04:03.720" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t quite understand what he meant by that at that time because I was just about six years old and here I am today.</div><div id="00:04:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Was that an aspiration for people, do you think, getting to?</div><div id="00:04:18.720" class="transcript_line"> It is. It still is in all fairness.</div><div id="00:04:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Especially if you grew up the way I did with very little opportunities, it&#039;s kind of your benchmark for your career, your professional life,</div><div id="00:04:35.720" class="transcript_line"> to eventually study and migrate so that you can, in hopes that you can give your family a better life because there are not much opportunities</div><div id="00:04:44.720" class="transcript_line"> even though we&#039;re still a developing country and you would think that things are better.</div><div id="00:04:50.720" class="transcript_line"> Things are, in a sense, better from the eight seventies and the eighties and the nineties.</div><div id="00:04:55.720" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, it&#039;s still the benchmark. You go to secondary school, you go to university and then you migrate.</div><div id="00:05:04.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s interesting, isn&#039;t it, about how, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:09.720" class="transcript_line"> It is. It is quite interesting.</div><div id="00:05:12.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s part of the story of success, I think.</div><div id="00:05:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:19.720" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if you could or if you&#039;d feel comfortable telling me about what home means to you now.</div><div id="00:05:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Going back home is not an option for me.</div><div id="00:05:29.720" class="transcript_line"> Home, it&#039;s really where my heart is, but in reality I don&#039;t think that I can return.</div><div id="00:05:37.720" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s just not a life there for me anymore.</div><div id="00:05:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Like I would have mentioned, the benchmark, you know, we go to school and we strive to leave.</div><div id="00:05:47.720" class="transcript_line"> As early as possible.</div><div id="00:05:48.720" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a case whereby going back home for me will mean that I&#039;m regressing.</div><div id="00:05:54.720" class="transcript_line"> And I think for me, it&#039;ll feel like I&#039;m, like I failed.</div><div id="00:06:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything more you can tell me about that?</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I, let me put it this way, I am the first in my family to have a tertiary education.</div><div id="00:06:16.720" class="transcript_line"> And there is a, you know, I&#039;m not the only one who has a degree in the university.</div><div id="00:06:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the only one who has a degree in the university.</div><div id="00:06:30.720" class="transcript_line"> I am the first in my family to have a tertiary education.</div><div id="00:06:33.720" class="transcript_line"> And there is a, there are high expectations for me.</div><div id="00:06:41.720" class="transcript_line"> So if I go back home, it will, I&#039;ll be disappointing a lot of people.</div><div id="00:06:51.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have, I don&#039;t have the option of going back home.</div><div id="00:06:57.720" class="transcript_line"> To start my life there again.</div><div id="00:07:00.720" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s me being honest, because they&#039;ve my, I lost my dad when I was eight.</div><div id="00:07:07.720" class="transcript_line"> And my mom, she didn&#039;t have a tertiary education.</div><div id="00:07:11.720" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t, she didn&#039;t even have a secondary education.</div><div id="00:07:14.720" class="transcript_line"> She just went up to primary school because of her life, you know, and my grandparents, they were quite poor.</div><div id="00:07:20.720" class="transcript_line"> She had to quit school quite early to help with the family.</div><div id="00:07:23.720" class="transcript_line"> And she never got the opportunity to go back.</div><div id="00:07:26.720" class="transcript_line"> So she made sure that I got a proper education so that I can look after the family.</div><div id="00:07:31.720" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m basically looking after my family back home.</div><div id="00:07:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So home, well, it would mean a lot to me to go back and continue my life there.</div><div id="00:07:40.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s simply not possible.</div><div id="00:07:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing that.</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s important to hear those kind of complex reasons, you know,</div><div id="00:07:51.720" class="transcript_line"> and complex kind of stories and pressures that, you know, you&#039;re carrying.</div><div id="00:07:57.720" class="transcript_line"> So thank you for sharing a bit more about that.</div><div id="00:08:01.720" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if you can describe a place or a time in your life that&#039;s important to you.</div><div id="00:08:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was the day I finished, finished nursing school, finished university</div><div id="00:08:15.720" class="transcript_line"> and found out that I&#039;d passed my state finals to get my license because I struggled through uni when I was doing my degree to become a nurse.</div><div id="00:08:29.720" class="transcript_line"> And there were all sorts of challenges financially.</div><div id="00:08:33.720" class="transcript_line"> You know, I had just gotten out of a really abusive relationship as well.</div><div id="00:08:38.720" class="transcript_line"> And I was, you know, getting myself together, you know, healing from that.</div><div id="00:08:43.720" class="transcript_line"> So I really struggled.</div><div id="00:08:45.720" class="transcript_line"> And at one point, I thought, you know, I would make it out, you know, be another statistic.</div><div id="00:08:51.720" class="transcript_line"> And I, I, I found out that I passed.</div><div id="00:09:00.720" class="transcript_line"> It was the 14th of February 2014.</div><div id="00:09:06.720" class="transcript_line"> I found out I had that bit of information.</div><div id="00:09:10.720" class="transcript_line"> And I was really happy because I know that would have been my turning point.</div><div id="00:09:16.720" class="transcript_line"> So I would have been, I would be able to provide for my family and subsequently be able to move.</div><div id="00:09:25.720" class="transcript_line"> So that that really, really stands out to me.</div><div id="00:09:29.720" class="transcript_line"> I always carry that in my heart.</div><div id="00:09:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a big achievement.</div><div id="00:09:37.720" class="transcript_line"> It has been very proud.</div><div id="00:09:39.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> How long after that did you move to Liverpool?</div><div id="00:09:46.720" class="transcript_line"> 2021, quite a few years after, because part of my training, it was funded by the government.</div><div id="00:09:53.720" class="transcript_line"> And I was contractually obligated to them for five years.</div><div id="00:09:57.720" class="transcript_line"> So I had to start my contract.</div><div id="00:09:59.720" class="transcript_line"> And then I was free.</div><div id="00:10:01.720" class="transcript_line"> As soon as I was free, I was out.</div><div id="00:10:05.720" class="transcript_line"> How old were you when you, when you came here?</div><div id="00:10:09.720" class="transcript_line"> I was just turned 30 in June.</div><div id="00:10:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, 30.</div><div id="00:10:17.720" class="transcript_line"> So not very old at all.</div><div id="00:10:18.720" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:10:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Speaking of age, I wonder if you feel comfortable telling me a bit about your childhood.</div><div id="00:10:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sure.</div><div id="00:10:31.720" class="transcript_line"> I grew up in a really small rural community, just outside of the capital city of Georgetown.</div><div id="00:10:37.720" class="transcript_line"> I am the only child for my mom and dad.</div><div id="00:10:41.720" class="transcript_line"> My dad had two other kids that were older than me.</div><div id="00:10:44.720" class="transcript_line"> I have two sisters.</div><div id="00:10:47.720" class="transcript_line"> I really had a simple childhood.</div><div id="00:10:50.720" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t rich.</div><div id="00:10:51.720" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:10:52.720" class="transcript_line"> We were quite poor.</div><div id="00:10:53.720" class="transcript_line"> And my dad, he was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go to university.</div><div id="00:10:58.720" class="transcript_line"> He was a civil engineer, but he passed early.</div><div id="00:11:01.720" class="transcript_line"> He died of leukemia.</div><div id="00:11:04.720" class="transcript_line"> So it was just my mom and I for a really, really long time.</div><div id="00:11:08.720" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite simple, even though we didn&#039;t have much.</div><div id="00:11:12.720" class="transcript_line"> It was, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:11:15.720" class="transcript_line"> I had lots of friends.</div><div id="00:11:18.720" class="transcript_line"> I had a roof over my head.</div><div id="00:11:20.720" class="transcript_line"> I had food and I went to school and I did exceptionally well in school, not to brag.</div><div id="00:11:29.720" class="transcript_line"> I did really well in school.</div><div id="00:11:31.720" class="transcript_line"> So that was a plus.</div><div id="00:11:32.720" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, and I read a lot when I was four years old.</div><div id="00:11:38.720" class="transcript_line"> The first my first memory of my dad is him getting me a book when I was four years old.</div><div id="00:11:44.720" class="transcript_line"> And I still have it to this day.</div><div id="00:11:47.720" class="transcript_line"> So I read early.</div><div id="00:11:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I was one of those children that read really early.</div><div id="00:11:51.720" class="transcript_line"> So I was always fond of reading.</div><div id="00:11:54.720" class="transcript_line"> So where we lived, there wasn&#039;t a library in the community.</div><div id="00:11:57.720" class="transcript_line"> So there was one in the neighboring village.</div><div id="00:12:00.720" class="transcript_line"> So my mom would allow me to walk once every other week to go get books from the library.</div><div id="00:12:06.720" class="transcript_line"> So reading kept me out of trouble.</div><div id="00:12:09.720" class="transcript_line"> It kept me grounded and it took me places, you know.</div><div id="00:12:14.720" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I had a really good childhood.</div><div id="00:12:17.720" class="transcript_line"> My teenage years weren&#039;t, you know, that that good.</div><div id="00:12:23.720" class="transcript_line"> I had a baby at 16.</div><div id="00:12:25.720" class="transcript_line"> So I have a 17 year old daughter.</div><div id="00:12:28.720" class="transcript_line"> And even though I had a child, I was still supported by my mom.</div><div id="00:12:33.720" class="transcript_line"> So I supported and encouraged to continue my education, which I did.</div><div id="00:12:40.720" class="transcript_line"> I subsequently graduated secondary school and I did exceptionally well at the Caribbean Council exams.</div><div id="00:12:47.720" class="transcript_line"> I sat nine subjects and I got all grade ones.</div><div id="00:12:51.720" class="transcript_line"> So I was able to get into sixth form.</div><div id="00:12:54.720" class="transcript_line"> So I was a statistic in every sense, but I I overcame those those hurdles.</div><div id="00:13:03.720" class="transcript_line"> I went to sixth form at one of the most prestigious secondary schools in the country.</div><div id="00:13:08.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called Queens College.</div><div id="00:13:10.720" class="transcript_line"> And I sat for subjects and I got all four A&#039;s.</div><div id="00:13:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I always wanted to be a nurse.</div><div id="00:13:19.720" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s owing to the fact that my dad spent a lot of time in the hospital.</div><div id="00:13:24.720" class="transcript_line"> And my mom used to take me every Sunday.</div><div id="00:13:27.720" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go to visit him because he spent like weeks, sometimes months in the hospital.</div><div id="00:13:31.720" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t allowed to go during the week school time.</div><div id="00:13:35.720" class="transcript_line"> So she would take me every Sunday.</div><div id="00:13:36.720" class="transcript_line"> And I quite admired the way the nurses looked after him.</div><div id="00:13:40.720" class="transcript_line"> And I said, you know what, that&#039;s what I want to do with my life when I&#039;m older.</div><div id="00:13:44.720" class="transcript_line"> So I had this in my head.</div><div id="00:13:45.720" class="transcript_line"> I want to be a nurse.</div><div id="00:13:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And in order for me to be a nurse, I need to focus.</div><div id="00:13:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I need to take my education seriously.</div><div id="00:13:50.720" class="transcript_line"> I did just that.</div><div id="00:13:51.720" class="transcript_line"> So my after I completed my sixth form, I actually started teaching.</div><div id="00:14:00.720" class="transcript_line"> I was a primary school teacher, but I didn&#039;t like it at all.</div><div id="00:14:04.720" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t something that I wanted to do.</div><div id="00:14:06.720" class="transcript_line"> It was just, you know, a way to make a bit of money at that time.</div><div id="00:14:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Because getting into university to do nursing was really hard in the early 2000s.</div><div id="00:14:17.720" class="transcript_line"> So I did encounter a few challenges while, you know, trying to get into nursing school.</div><div id="00:14:24.720" class="transcript_line"> So instead of sitting at home because I had a child to look after as well, I decided to teach.</div><div id="00:14:30.720" class="transcript_line"> I did that for quite some time and I didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:14:34.720" class="transcript_line"> And then an opportunity, a little window opened itself for me to get into nursing school.</div><div id="00:14:39.720" class="transcript_line"> And I did.</div><div id="00:14:42.720" class="transcript_line"> But I had a lovely childhood.</div><div id="00:14:44.720" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t come except for losing my dad.</div><div id="00:14:47.720" class="transcript_line"> I think my childhood was relatively normal and quite fun.</div><div id="00:14:53.720" class="transcript_line"> You said you liked reading.</div><div id="00:14:55.720" class="transcript_line"> What things did you like to read?</div><div id="00:14:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I like I do love a good mystery.</div><div id="00:15:00.720" class="transcript_line"> My dad was in my dad was fond of Western books.</div><div id="00:15:03.720" class="transcript_line"> So I did, you know, dabble a little in that.</div><div id="00:15:06.720" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t, you know, the genre that I liked.</div><div id="00:15:09.720" class="transcript_line"> So I ended up, you know, into mystery.</div><div id="00:15:12.720" class="transcript_line"> I started off, you know, as a teen, I&#039;d go read all the Nancy Drew books, Hardy Boys and the library.</div><div id="00:15:19.720" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I just loved reading.</div><div id="00:15:23.720" class="transcript_line"> I just love reading.</div><div id="00:15:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Is it something you still get to do now?</div><div id="00:15:27.720" class="transcript_line"> I, you know, honestly, haven&#039;t read much since I moved here in the UK.</div><div id="00:15:32.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been busy with work and I started my master&#039;s degree program, but I had to pause that.</div><div id="00:15:38.720" class="transcript_line"> So I haven&#039;t I&#039;ve just lost all motivation, you know, to read.</div><div id="00:15:47.720" class="transcript_line"> So now that I have another little one, another little one, I&#039;m going to I&#039;ve started reading to her again.</div><div id="00:15:54.720" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m, you know, trying to get back into the swing of reading and, you know, falling in love with it all over again.</div><div id="00:16:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Sounds great. Sounds like an important part of you.</div><div id="00:16:06.720" class="transcript_line"> It is. It is quite because it reminds me so much of my dad.</div><div id="00:16:09.720" class="transcript_line"> That because the first book that he got me, he used to work quite late and I used to wait up at night.</div><div id="00:16:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Even though my mom would send me off to bed, I&#039;d say, you know, I&#039;m waiting on my dad.</div><div id="00:16:20.720" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d come home and no matter how tired he was, he&#039;d still read me a story.</div><div id="00:16:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And I did that with my eldest. No matter how tired I was, I&#039;d get home and I&#039;d read her a story.</div><div id="00:16:32.720" class="transcript_line"> And I started reading for her from the same book and she loves reading as well.</div><div id="00:16:36.720" class="transcript_line"> So I think it&#039;s something I really want to pass on to my other child.</div><div id="00:16:41.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you will. Great role modeling with readings.</div><div id="00:16:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Anything else you&#039;d like to tell us about your childhood or growing up?</div><div id="00:16:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, like I said, it was relatively calm and simple. I had lots of fun.</div><div id="00:16:57.720" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have any siblings close by because my other two sisters lived away with their mom.</div><div id="00:17:05.720" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s basically it. It was just simple.</div><div id="00:17:10.720" class="transcript_line"> It was just a simple upbringing, simple childhood.</div><div id="00:17:16.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing about that.</div><div id="00:17:19.720" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve talked about one time or moment that was important when you got your nursing qualifications.</div><div id="00:17:27.720" class="transcript_line"> But my next question is, can you tell me about a magic moment when something changed for you?</div><div id="00:17:32.720" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if there&#039;s something else.</div><div id="00:17:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I can&#039;t think of anything.</div><div id="00:17:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I think it was coming here because it was something out of, you know, something out.</div><div id="00:17:57.720" class="transcript_line"> In my mind, it was something out of a novel because I never expected to get this far.</div><div id="00:18:06.720" class="transcript_line"> So all the while I was going through the process to get my visa and come here, I was still a bit in denial, still a bit shocked.</div><div id="00:18:18.720" class="transcript_line"> But then I got when I landed at Manchester Airport, it felt surreal.</div><div id="00:18:23.720" class="transcript_line"> It felt I would like to say magical.</div><div id="00:18:27.720" class="transcript_line"> And I felt, you know, I&#039;ve accomplished something and I was really, really proud, proud of myself.</div><div id="00:18:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can&#039;t think of anything. I really can&#039;t think of anything else.</div><div id="00:18:43.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a great moment. Like you say, that feeling of achievement and being proud of yourself.</div><div id="00:18:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:50.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s definitely a magic moment.</div><div id="00:18:52.720" class="transcript_line"> Can you can you remember anything more about about how it felt and that pride you felt about what you&#039;ve done?</div><div id="00:19:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I.</div><div id="00:19:03.720" class="transcript_line"> For me, it was while it was a magical moment for me, it was also bittersweet for my family back home because I was leaving and I left my eldest back home because I wasn&#039;t I wasn&#039;t sure what I was coming into here.</div><div id="00:19:24.720" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, that that&#039;s that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:19:28.720" class="transcript_line"> My next question is about hopes for the future.</div><div id="00:19:30.720" class="transcript_line"> She is she&#039;s she&#039;s quite accomplished as well for her age and she wants to be a doctor.</div><div id="00:19:36.720" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m looking forward to that. I know she&#039;ll do it. I am supporting her.</div><div id="00:19:41.720" class="transcript_line"> Another thing is I am I would love to complete my master&#039;s degree.</div><div id="00:19:46.720" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s one of my hope for the future. And I&#039;d like to write one of these days.</div><div id="00:19:53.720" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t shared this with anybody for a really long time.</div><div id="00:19:56.720" class="transcript_line"> But my my one of my, you know, little dream is to write to be an author and to teach but in nursing education.</div><div id="00:20:09.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my you know, one of one of the things that I&#039;m looking forward to the future.</div><div id="00:20:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Just having a nice simple life.</div><div id="00:20:17.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want a lot.</div><div id="00:20:20.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want a lot.</div><div id="00:20:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Just sound like beautiful dreams.</div><div id="00:20:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m sure you&#039;re going to achieve them.</div><div id="00:20:27.720" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;d be a great writer.</div><div id="00:20:29.720" class="transcript_line"> You have an aptitude for storytelling.</div><div id="00:20:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Just a little bit I&#039;ve I&#039;ve heard.</div><div id="00:20:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:38.720" class="transcript_line"> What when you say you&#039;d like to teach, why is that?</div><div id="00:20:42.720" class="transcript_line"> What excites you about that?</div><div id="00:20:45.720" class="transcript_line"> I think the excitement comes from the fact that I&#039;ve had loads of great teachers and they&#039;ve imparted a lot in me.</div><div id="00:20:54.720" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve supported me even when I was pregnant.</div><div id="00:20:58.720" class="transcript_line"> One particular teacher I remember in secondary school, she came to me and she said, we all know that you&#039;re pregnant.</div><div id="00:21:07.720" class="transcript_line"> We could see it even though you&#039;re trying to hide it.</div><div id="00:21:10.720" class="transcript_line"> But I just want you to know that we love you and we support you.</div><div id="00:21:13.720" class="transcript_line"> And I carry those words with me even now.</div><div id="00:21:16.720" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, sometimes when I&#039;m having a really, really rough time and I&#039;m reflecting on all that I&#039;ve been through, those words, they tend to echo.</div><div id="00:21:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d like to be able to, you know, I would like to be able to be that for somebody.</div><div id="00:21:31.720" class="transcript_line"> And I have been told that I&#039;m really, really good at teaching.</div><div id="00:21:36.720" class="transcript_line"> I can sit and explain something to somebody in, you know, in great details, you know, to get them to understand.</div><div id="00:21:43.720" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;d be beneficial to, you know, the nursing profession.</div><div id="00:21:49.720" class="transcript_line"> So since I&#039;m already in it, you know, just venture down the education path.</div><div id="00:21:57.720" class="transcript_line"> That sounds brilliant. And is it the masters that can help you to get it?</div><div id="00:22:01.720" class="transcript_line"> It is the masters that can help me.</div><div id="00:22:04.720" class="transcript_line"> That sounds like a beautiful plan.</div><div id="00:22:07.720" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;ll be a fantastic teacher.</div><div id="00:22:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:22:12.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:13.720" class="transcript_line"> Are there any other hopes or aspirations for the future that you&#039;d like to share with us before we go on to the next?</div><div id="00:22:23.720" class="transcript_line"> No, my life is a bit dull.</div><div id="00:22:29.720" class="transcript_line"> I just want the little simple things.</div><div id="00:22:33.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. And you deserve that too.</div><div id="00:22:38.720" class="transcript_line"> OK. My last question is, is there anything else, either going back to the questions we&#039;ve already been through or other things that you feel like you would like to share or that you think is important for people to know about your story?</div><div id="00:22:54.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;d just like to leave this bit of this, you know, I&#039;d like to think of myself as a positive person, looking back at all that I&#039;ve been through in my life.</div><div id="00:23:04.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always remained positive. And whomever my story might reach to, I hope that, you know, they can use my story and be inspired, be motivated to keep pressing on despite the odds.</div><div id="00:23:20.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really beautiful. Thank you.</div><div id="00:23:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:23:23.720" class="transcript_line"> OK. So is there anything else you&#039;d like to share? Otherwise we can start wrapping up and get back to you.</div><div id="00:23:29.720" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:23:31.720" class="transcript_line"> OK. It&#039;s just a beautiful interview. Thank you so much.</div></div></p>
