    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, it isn&#039;t a reading in Welsh. It is by a Welshman, however, Dylan Thomas.</div><div id="00:00:04.800" class="transcript_line"> I know a few of you have been up to Vancouver, and you&#039;ve probably heard me reading this poem before.</div><div id="00:00:09.600" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately, I&#039;m getting older and I need glasses, and I didn&#039;t bring them with me tonight,</div><div id="00:00:14.200" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s about the only poem that I know fairly well without glasses.</div><div id="00:00:18.400" class="transcript_line"> LAUGHTER</div><div id="00:00:22.800" class="transcript_line"> This poem is about a little farm in West Wales called Fernhill.</div><div id="00:00:28.400" class="transcript_line"> It was a farm where Dylan&#039;s aunt and uncle, aunt Anna, lived.</div><div id="00:00:34.800" class="transcript_line"> And as a boy, he would go to the farm and play with the cattle and the animals around the farm.</div><div id="00:00:42.400" class="transcript_line"> And this is a recollection of his childhood in Fernhill.</div><div id="00:00:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Now, as I was young and easy under the apple boughs,</div><div id="00:00:52.800" class="transcript_line"> About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,</div><div id="00:00:56.400" class="transcript_line"> The night above the dingle starry,</div><div id="00:00:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Time let me tail and climb golden in the hay days with eyes,</div><div id="00:01:04.200" class="transcript_line"> And honoured among my wagons I was prince of the apple towns,</div><div id="00:01:08.600" class="transcript_line"> And once below a time I laudly had the trees and leaves trail</div><div id="00:01:12.600" class="transcript_line"> With daisies and barley down the rivers of the windfall light.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns,</div><div id="00:01:21.400" class="transcript_line"> About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> In the sun that is young once only,</div><div id="00:01:28.400" class="transcript_line"> Time let me play and be golden in the mercy of his means,</div><div id="00:01:32.800" class="transcript_line"> And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman,</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The calf sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,</div><div id="00:01:41.800" class="transcript_line"> And the sabbath rang slowly in the pebbles of the holy streams.</div><div id="00:01:47.600" class="transcript_line"> All the sun long it was running, it was lovely,</div><div id="00:01:50.400" class="transcript_line"> The hay fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys,</div><div id="00:01:54.200" class="transcript_line"> It was air and playing lovely and watery, and fire green as grass.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And nightly under the simple stars as I rode to sleep,</div><div id="00:02:03.400" class="transcript_line"> The owls were bearing the farm away.</div><div id="00:02:06.400" class="transcript_line"> All the moon long I heard blessed among stables,</div><div id="00:02:09.800" class="transcript_line"> The night jars flying with the ricks,</div><div id="00:02:12.400" class="transcript_line"> And the horses flashing into the dark.</div><div id="00:02:16.400" class="transcript_line"> And then to awake, and the farm like a wanderer,</div><div id="00:02:19.400" class="transcript_line"> The white with the dew come back, the cock on his shoulder,</div><div id="00:02:23.400" class="transcript_line"> It was all shining, it was Adam and Maiden,</div><div id="00:02:26.800" class="transcript_line"> The sky gathered again and the sun grew round that very day.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So it must have been after the birth of the simple light</div><div id="00:02:34.800" class="transcript_line"> In the first spinning place,</div><div id="00:02:37.400" class="transcript_line"> The spellbound horses walking warm out of the winnie and green stable,</div><div id="00:02:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Onto the fields of praise.</div><div id="00:02:44.800" class="transcript_line"> And honoured among fat foxes and pheasants by the gay house</div><div id="00:02:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Under the new May clouds, and happy as the heart was long,</div><div id="00:02:51.800" class="transcript_line"> In the sun born over and over I ran my heedless ways.</div><div id="00:02:56.200" class="transcript_line"> My wishes raced through the house high hay,</div><div id="00:02:58.600" class="transcript_line"> And nothing I cared that my sky blue trades,</div><div id="00:03:02.600" class="transcript_line"> That time allows in all his tuneful turning,</div><div id="00:03:06.200" class="transcript_line"> So few and such mourning songs,</div><div id="00:03:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Before the children green and golden follow him out of grace.</div><div id="00:03:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Nothing I cared in those lamb white days</div><div id="00:03:17.200" class="transcript_line"> That time would take me up to the swallowed thronged loft</div><div id="00:03:20.600" class="transcript_line"> By the shadow of my hand in the moon that is always rising,</div><div id="00:03:25.200" class="transcript_line"> Nor that riding to sleep I should hear him fly with the high fields,</div><div id="00:03:29.600" class="transcript_line"> And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.</div><div id="00:03:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,</div><div id="00:03:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Time held me green and dying,</div><div id="00:03:43.200" class="transcript_line"> Though I sang in my chains like the sea.</div><div id="00:03:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
