    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Stephanie Cruz, ymhlithwyr ymgyrchol ym Mlyncs. Mae&#039;n 14 August 2019.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Ac rwy&#039;n ymwneud ym Mhob ym Mhob, yn Rhaedder, yn ymwneud Ã¢ Paul Carter.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Paul, mae&#039;n bwysig iawn, gyda&#039;r hyn yn ddaeth amser.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you give me a brief outline of the different stages it&#039;s been through?</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I can. It&#039;s not really brief, though, because it&#039;s been such a chequered history and it&#039;s changed its use so often.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Even the history that we have, it&#039;s a little bit blurry right back at the start, but we&#039;re now convinced that it dates back to 1803</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and is a sister building to the mill over the stream from us, the Derelict Mill.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The building as it was built had a culvert of water which was taken out of the Y.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It ran round the back of the building, through the middle of the building, and drove a water wheel right in the centre of the building.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> This one here. Right in this building.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was what was happening and we think it was driving machinery from one end of the building to the other, which is quite something.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a long building, about 30 metres long.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And the machinery was used for? Do we know that?</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not entirely sure. It&#039;s all got lost in the history because after about 35 years in use, we believe, as Woollen Mill, that&#039;s where it&#039;s a bit blurred.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> One history document says Woollen Mill, the other one doesn&#039;t have any documentation until 1837,</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> but it definitely was the Castle Leatherworks in 1837.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And what sort of work would they be doing here? Would they be doing something like scraping the hides?</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They were taking the leather from the three tanneries in town and converting it, as you say, scraping the hides.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of aprons being made, a lot of shammy leathers.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I have seen some documentation and it might be from the one that&#039;s been redone in Raglan,</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> where there were shoes and things being made in Raerdydd and I suspect they were being made here as well.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a big building, three storeys high, again going 30 metres down the length of the building.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And what had happened was, from what we can gather, the woollen industry moved out of Raerdydd,</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> went across to Newtown around 1837, which ties in with it becoming a leatherworks.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it stayed as a leatherworks until the leather industry started to have a few hiccups, which was around 1900.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Do we know who owned the building in 1837?</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no. It might be on record, but I&#039;m not sure who owned it.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But around that 1900 time, I think it&#039;s 1905, that was when the Edward Price Morgan comes in.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he bought the building as a three storey building. He had military links.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think I&#039;m right in saying he was using it as a military base already, the ground floor.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a massive fire which took out the far end of the building.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I suspect the building was falling down at that time anyway.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It was right down in the floodplain, half a storey below where we&#039;re sitting now, which is a long way down,</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> about eight foot down, right down with the flood levels of the water.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was three storeys high, so it was twice the height of what we have today.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And knowing the state of the building when we took it on, I think it was probably falling down and they didn&#039;t know what to do with it.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think the fire, at least it focused their opinion on what to do next.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It took out everything at the end, which is now a hall.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing left. You could see straight out the far side of the building from one side to the other.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The walls on the one side were pretty much gone already as well.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was rebuilt then as a drill hall.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s 1911. It was already being used as a drill hall and the fire was around that time as well.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a very quick conversion they did.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They took the whole of the top floor off.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know for a fact that most of it went down underneath our building because I&#039;ve dug up quite a bit of it.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The stones were original stones, as in the rest of the stone building.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And within two years of being opened as a drill hall, they opened it as a cinema.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s remnants of the screen still here and visible.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they started showing films and very quickly after that, I&#039;ve just shown Stephanie a photograph of a hung cinema screen.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They cut down the screen they put up and hung a screen and started putting on music events.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So there were three names at exactly the same time then.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There was the drill hall, the castle cinema and the castle ballroom.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had dances as well?</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There were dances and through both world wars they were used for dances.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s wonderful. And then what?</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I say, there&#039;s lots of stories attached to the wartime dances.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Apparently the Rehada folk used to love coming to some of the American nights.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And unbelievably, it sounds so crazy in these days, there were black nights and white nights in the hall.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Rehada people loved the black nights because the music was apparently amazing.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And a white general decided he was going to put an end to these nights and came in stamped his foot on the stage.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The band heard the beat, started playing with the beat of his feet and the whole place went into complete uproar.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody dancing, leaping around and the general had to leave.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You can imagine it, can&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, just the whole building does seem to love music.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> As soon as you start playing music in there, you can feel it sort of beating along with it.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I have got a recording which was an EP made by one of the local bands.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They recorded some music. They called themselves the Dam Busters.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Referring back to the fact that the film was filmed up here and that was where the actual Dam Buster thing was originally practiced.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They practiced the Barnes Walliser. So it was a great name for them to have.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And they released an EP, which there are still a few copies rattling around and we have a copy of a copy.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> A recording there?</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I hope so. I have warned Stephanie that playing isn&#039;t the easiest.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant, that&#039;s really good. And there are three tracks on that.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> There are six tracks on that EP. Plenty of selection.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Three of that band are still alive, still living in Rhaedau.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We lost Little Don unfortunately a couple of years back.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> He played the harmonica.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Piano accordion.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Piano accordion. You can tell I&#039;m a musician as well. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re listening.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Piano accordion that was almost as big as he was.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s Glenda joining in with the conversation.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And he played the left hand.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But we tried to get him to play in his last year of his life and he would have loved to.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But he said he just could not handle the piano accordion. It was too big.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He just couldn&#039;t handle it anymore.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the other three band members?</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s John Humphreys. He was the drummer.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> David Evans was the double bass.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always forget Mike&#039;s second name. What&#039;s Mike&#039;s second name, Glen?</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Bennett.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Mike Bennett who used to work at the water treatment plant.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, correct. He was vocals and guitar.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were two others who I never got to meet at all.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Say Little Don, I can&#039;t remember his second name either.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There was plenty of people in Rhaedau who will know them all.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, brilliant.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And so after, I guess it&#039;s almost heyday during the wars, what happened?</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It carried on as a music venue.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they&#039;re slightly different because there were so many people lost during the war, particularly the men folk.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And it stayed with us until television started to kick in and people started to stay in their homes and not go out.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a brief period when it became an engineering works.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Orbital Gears, who are still in town, started to work here.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And unfortunately for them, the culvert was still under the building and it flooded.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And their machinery was all at ground floor level and they had to lift the machinery out to get it away.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And they moved up to the other end of town away from the floodplain.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And at that point it became a supermarket.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And J&amp;B supermarket, I think, was the first.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It looks like the Morgan family were involved in running the supermarket because there&#039;s lots of pieces of paper attached to, I think it&#039;s JP Morgan.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s most commonly known as the Old Mace supermarket because that was what the supermarket was prior to us taking it on.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But I did warn you that it&#039;s not a short history unless it&#039;s had lots of use.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And the number of people who have memories of either working in here or coming to events is quite incredible.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They keep on coming down to see us at the hall and talking to us.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve obviously stirred a lot of memories.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s lovely. And a little bit about yourself. Why did you take it on? Why were you brought in? What do you want to do with it?</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m a bit silly really.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother-in-law still lives in Raerdyd. She&#039;s aged 97 now.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were visiting Raerdyd every year, every school holiday.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We knew how nice a time we had holidaying here. And that was 30 years with our children growing up.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The building was getting into a terrible state. It had lain empty for eight years.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And there wasn&#039;t a window left intact on the building. It was quite clear that the roof had gone from one end to the other.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And sadly the stonework was starting to crack on the bottom end of the hall, so the riverside end.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a building I&#039;ve always been quite fond of, quite liked. It was an interesting building from the outside.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I wondered what was going on. Why was it lying empty? It went to auction and didn&#039;t sell.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I came up with a crazy plan for a music venue and cafe.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Which eventually I talked my family into looking at.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And when was this?</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s going back to 2012 was when we first started looking at it.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> We put together what can only be described as a crazy business plan.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And started negotiating with a view to buying.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And at one point it looked like it was sold, but it came back to us.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And it seems like the hall wanted to be saved and wanted to be saved as a music venue.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how it&#039;s felt ever since. Every time we&#039;ve wondered what on earth are we going to do next, something&#039;s happened.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s carried on. And we&#039;re very proud to say we&#039;re now an award-winning cafe.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And a music venue which bands just love. It&#039;s as simple as that.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re getting some of the best bands in Britain playing here.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It certainly has a lovely atmosphere when you come in.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And very welcoming with the outdoor space that you&#039;ve got there.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> One of my colleagues at Ellen Lynx has actually played here as well. She says it&#039;s a lovely venue.</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it is a real asset to me.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The bands are coming in, we&#039;re getting top musicians coming in and they&#039;re obviously talking to one another.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first thing they&#039;re doing is clapping their hands, clicking their fingers and just going, wow.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So there is something a bit special and we&#039;re not quite sure what it is.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re terrified of doing too much work in there because we know how easy it is to spoil an acoustic.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re treading caegely on the inside of the hall.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re trying to get away with it as it is for as long as possible and get on with the rest of the building work.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve still got plenty to do then?</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;re in the process of doing the changing rooms and the backstage areas now.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So for the bands it&#039;s going to be a much nicer area for them to prepare, get ready to go so they can get straight on stage.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll have a toilet backstage so if anybody gets desperate to go to the loo,</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> they can just go and come back without interfering too much with performance.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And what we have done is reversed the direction from when Mike Bennett and Don and all the team</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> were singing in here. We actually have our stage at what I call the top end of the hall</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and our bar is where the stage was when they were playing in it.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve turned it around, but it seems like the atmosphere is exactly the same.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still...</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, we&#039;re hoping to show films. So at one time maybe we&#039;ll become the Castle Cinema, the Castle Ballroom.</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t see us becoming a drill hall again, but that&#039;s possible as well.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But where did you get the name from, The Lost Ark? What&#039;s the story behind that?</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We have lots of lost arks, but we&#039;d come up with the name Lost Ark before any of those arks actually got uncovered.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, it seems like serendipity that we actually found arks.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve called it Art Roots Cafe.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And the very sad thing is two people suggested The Lost Ark in the same week.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> A very bright student who my wife and I used to teach and my son&#039;s mother-in-law both suggested it within two days of one another.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because everybody&#039;s heard of Raiders of the Lost Ark and we&#039;re the Lost Ark of Raider.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a simple, very unfunny little thing, but it amused us all.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And to be quite fair, we&#039;d still be discussing the name of the building if we hadn&#039;t decided let&#039;s go for it.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It makes people smile, it&#039;s memorable and it&#039;s stuck.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And now people just say they&#039;re going down to the Ark. So that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s become a Raider name.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, already.</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well done to you and to the family and good luck with the future.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, Stephanie. Thank you.</div></div></p>
