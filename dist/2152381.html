    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Press record.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Not by my phone, that would be bad.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So today is Wednesday the 31st of May 2023.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Paul Hunt from Man Cap Cymru and could you introduce yourself please?</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my name is Janet Kensch and I&#039;m a committee member and a volunteer with Man Cap Cymru.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you get started with Man Cap Cymru again?</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It was when we moved back here to West Wales.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born and bred in West Wales, well actually where I live now is about five minutes from where I was brought up in Sanderville.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved to Cardiff to do some work and then oh gosh I was there for, I had my two children and came back here with the whole family.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Back in 2001, because we were always looking for services for my daughter&#039;s school or any discipline.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We were looking at different organisations and got involved with Man Cap Ceredigion.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That was 22, 23 years ago.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> On the basis of knowing what was available.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I found out that Man Cap Ceredigion didn&#039;t really do anything for children.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They were basically concentrated adults, which would have meant me walking away from them really because it didn&#039;t benefit Beth.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was talked into staying and getting involved with committee work and was on that committee then for a while.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So how old is Beth?</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s now 30 this year. She was born in 92, so she&#039;ll be 31 this year.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So you spent some time in Cardiff?</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> She was born in 92, I lived in Bathy. She was born in Llandoc Hospital.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It took us a few years to get some, well actually we&#039;ve never had a diagnosis, a proper one.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But obviously we knew she had a learning disability when she was about two.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d looked at Swansea at that time, then we had Alcanson, Dylan, her brother.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So we pretty much knew when she was about two or three that she would have some difficulties.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And how easy was it to find services there compared to Ceredigion?</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Just as difficult really. I can remember the time where the nurse, the district nurse, whatever you want to call her,</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> in the doctor&#039;s surgery saying, we haven&#039;t assessed, but yeah, it sounds like she&#039;ll need help.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember thinking, right, let&#039;s see what help is out there.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And sat in, we had a little library place in the house with a phone and desk.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, right, let&#039;s start, darling. And started bringing people up.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they then would pass me on to somebody else, to another organization, so I did that.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suddenly realized that it was going to be very difficult to find support or help or advice,</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> because during that hour, I followed all the places I was led to and came back to the first person I spoke to.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was a lot of agencies out there, but no concrete support in any way.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is in Swansea now, all well-meaning and everything, but nothing with practical support.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we got social services involved, and that meant loads of assessments.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean loads, and they&#039;d be coming to the house, a social worker, a nurse, a psychologist or something else.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d come to the house and they&#039;d be asking you the same questions.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d think, oh, God, can you read the file before you came?</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt like somebody said, well, what you should do is record, like we&#039;re recording today,</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> record everything and just say to them, look, I&#039;ll go make the coffee while you listen to the recording.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, it was just repeating itself.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, it was very little support, really.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you don&#039;t know often what support you need either.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, that&#039;s what I found difficult.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were there then for a few years and then we decided we...</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She started a little school in Townhill, which was really lovely, Townhill School.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people very snobbish about that.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We tried to get into a Welsh school and they said, I&#039;ll never forget this Dr Tanimian Singleth Hospital.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, you&#039;d probably best stick to just teaching her English because, you know, when she grows up,</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> there won&#039;t be many people speaking Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;ll be able to support herself.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was best to...</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I regret that, really regret it, because, you know, she could have handled two languages easily.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, she went to Townhill School, lovely school.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we decided to come back home.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And it meant going through the whole process again, if you like.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was a difference, really.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a really good children&#039;s department or whatever you want to call it.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was in Pembroke.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the person who led it was Errol Bray.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s retired now, but I think she&#039;s still involved with a lot of stuff in the area.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had this unit there.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were really, really good.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a good record.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They set up a good respite system, although we never used it ourselves.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were involved with DASH, which was a parent led organisation that did holiday things.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They took over these schools and you could come along.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, kids and the siblings as well, you know, would be in little groups and stuff.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They did some respites in Teetlin, in Ketting near Aberaerhe.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Where people could, again, Bethan didn&#039;t take part in that.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, your child could go there for a week and enjoy just being with other people.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> For the purposes of the tape, I should probably just say there&#039;s a gigantic dog sniffing around.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is not mine, by the way.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So as a unit, they were really, really good.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But again, it was limited what they could do as well, really.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But going back to my captain together, it&#039;s very limited what they could do because they were only really looking at adults.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I always used to think, well, I&#039;m glad I did get in contact with them because, you know,</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> while your child is a child with a learning disability up until 18 to 25, you know,</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a duty for supporting them, you know, educationally and social services wise.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And getting involved in that kind of thing highlighted how different it was basically as an adult with disabilities,</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> because that duty goes out through the window, really.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What you&#039;re entitled to as an adult with an disability is totally different to the child.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was as much a shock to me then.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I sort of planned ahead for Bethan as being an adult, knowing there wouldn&#039;t be anything really for her.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Far, far less than the support and services that she had as a child.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up in Kheriteekyon as a child with disabilities was great for Bethan.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> She was lucky to be in Chandisil Primary School.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very, very good.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She went to an excellent secondary school in Newcastle Emily,</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> even if they&#039;re headed by Helen Ling.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, her childhood and her upbringing was good compared to a lot of people I know.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a tough time with her, really.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we might have to pause and get the dog out because I think the breathing is going to be coming on the recording.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, pause it. No, no, no, no. Pause it.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re recording again just to get rid of the dog.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you feel when you first found out that Bethan had a learning disability?</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve had to confuse her more than anything.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The thing was that Bethan was born and a lot of my friends are having kids at the same time.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So she looked healthy. She looked beautiful, you know, to look at.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were milestones that she wasn&#039;t compared to my friend&#039;s kids.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So she would be walking at the same time as them, not talking at the same time as them.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember thinking, saying, well, you know, your child should have a hundred words, you know, for that.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was nowhere near that.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main thing we noticed was her socialization, you know, where the other kids were starting to after about six months,</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> noticing other children and getting involved or playing with things. Bethan wasn&#039;t like that, really.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it took a while to convince doctors and nurses that I thought there was something wrong, you know.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d say, oh, well, you know, children, they take a while.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, she&#039;ll catch her, you know, in all this business. And she didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think once I was told, yeah, you might be right here, I thought, no, thank God I&#039;ve got something right.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s, you know, and I think there was a sense of or a mixture of relief or, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> just the sense of that, you know, now we can get on with doing something about it.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But as a parent, you will always have these feelings of great sadness and grief.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, depending on how severe that disability is, you know,</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> they will be doing other things that your friends&#039; kids will be doing, like, you know,</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> going to university or getting married or having children.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think those milestones still hit you and you get quite emotional about it.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m lucky that, you know, I&#039;m quite positive about Beth.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s quite an unique girl in her ways.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And because of that, I&#039;d always be positive that she&#039;s beautiful and I can&#039;t think of her in any other way.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I, you know, I can&#039;t say I was upset, might be the wrong word, or hurt or whatever.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But with me, it was a battle just getting on with it and making sure that she was happy, content and safe.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it changed my view of how to be a parent and how what I wanted for my children,</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> because I think if Beth hadn&#039;t been around, I would have been one of these pushy parents,</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, quite ambitious for them and push them to do this.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas I&#039;m far more relaxed and I&#039;m certainly more relaxed with Dylan about, you know,</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> what he&#039;s wanted to do in his life and that, you know, the mantra is as long as they&#039;re happy and safe.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, you know, and that&#039;s all I want for them.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, so that&#039;s that was basically how I felt.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the Mencap groups were set up to provide social opportunities for people with a disability.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Having had a son without a disability to start with, what were the differences in terms of those opportunities?</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> What? Between Beth and Dylan?</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Massive, massive.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We suddenly found out with Dylan how easy it was to bring up a child and go through those milestones.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Having with Dylan, you know, he potty trained himself really, basically.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d go to sleep at normal times. He&#039;d eat what, you know, there wasn&#039;t any issues about feeding or anything.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d socialize with other children, go off and play and stuff.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a massive difference between Beth and the other.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But what was lucky about us having Dylan as a second child was that Bethan seemed to speed up on her progression.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She started speaking a lot faster and, you know, her mind stones were a bit faster getting through,</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> knowing that Dylan basically was forcing her to catch up.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean Dylan would, you know, whereas with us, it would take us a little time to coach Bethan to say things and whatever.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Dylan would demand it, you know, come on Bethan, let&#039;s go, you know.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been like that through the night really.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And to today now, he&#039;s a great support with her, very defensive.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we&#039;ll look after her forever, I believe.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But what it&#039;s also done for Dylan is that he&#039;s been a better person for it, I think,</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> because I know headmaster was telling me about him in primary school.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> One thing about Dylan is if there&#039;s a child who starts is new, starting,</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> or there&#039;s a child who&#039;s sad or being bullied or finding it difficult,</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Dylan&#039;s always the one to suss it all out or to go towards the child and support them in a way, be friendly and comfort them and so forth.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is because he&#039;s been Bethan&#039;s brother, you know.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And because of that, I think that&#039;s why he&#039;s gone into the field of supporting Mencap Ceredigion himself, you know.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He supports us with all the social stuff that we do and all the workshops and stuff like that, and they love him.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, he treats them as equals.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He treats them as friends and, you know, lives them dearly.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But the other thing is, I think, that he&#039;s gone into teaching now is again because he&#039;s the type that wants to support and help.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And that I truly believe that&#039;s because, you know, he&#039;s had a system of him, just probably.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So back to Mencap Ceredigion, how did you first become aware of them?</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, again, by ringing when we came back to West Wales, we had all these organizations, you know, getting a list of stuff and just ringing.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got to meet the chair who&#039;s an amazing man, Bill Thompson, who&#039;d been a chair.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s now passed away.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mencap in those days were a bit different to what Mencap Ceredigion was different to what it is today.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And those Mencap Ceredigion in those days were far more involved with the provision of services and supported housing.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They owned a few houses in the county and they employed, trained, you know, they were, you know, ran those supported housing issue.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bill Thompson was a great one for, I think he was ex service.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he was either Navy or, you know, one of these God through the war titles, you know, Sergeant Major, but such a gentle, lovely gentleman, you know.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d kept the ship together and sort of set up all of these things, respite, supported housing, services, social clubs and all of that.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was all very, very well set up and everything when I got involved.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very well respected by the professionals as well, by the authorities, you know, and well liked by the members.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think one of the nicest letters, I have a few letters that have been given to me in my life from, you know, people I&#039;ve worked with when I&#039;ve left, they&#039;ve sent me a nice letter to see it by, you know.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one I treasure the most is from him that he sent because I had to leave Mencap Ceredigion for some reason.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was concentrating on some work issues and I said to him, look, you know, I won&#039;t be able to do so much.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the letters I treasure the most is the letter he sent me.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s there and I often now read a bit when you know you think, oh God, you know, it&#039;s getting too much.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you get your bad days and you read that letter and it makes you feel really good, you know.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> He was he was an amazing man and he was the lead of a big, you know, quite a set of quite strong committee members made up of parents.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And they ran everything really basically until Mencap, Cymru came along or Mencap National.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the name. Sintje.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Clive. No, that&#039;s the guy who came down to do the transitional bit of Mencap Ceredigion, giving the houses.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard. Howard Sintje. Yes. Clive is the guy that invented the seat, the bikes.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard Sintje. And I remember he came to the Feathers Hotel to have a meeting with us and to reassure us that we were doing the right thing, really.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t get involved with that so much.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the transition was quite small because the authorities helped it a lot.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was some housing associations as well.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have today supported housing in the county that are managed out by Mencap and by MIRAS.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But they wouldn&#039;t be what they are without Bill Thompson and that committee.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They set it up. It was like fine.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, really well looked after, well managed.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite easy to just pick it up and go.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the reason that they transferred over to?</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what it was. I think I don&#039;t know because I wasn&#039;t involved with it at the time.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether it was because the parents were getting quite elderly now and it was a lot for them.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, every organization will find this. It&#039;s hard to get people on board committees and being trustees.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of responsibility nowadays for that, whether it was that or whether and this is my guess,</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it was the legislations and so forth and the amount of liability the authorities had,</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it was better for them to get involved with it really.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And so Mencap then was involved with the whole thing of support and services and education and living accommodation and everything.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> To what we are today, which is something totally different and is run totally differently as well.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was an amazing man and we were very, very lucky to have him in Ceredigion.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We were very lucky to have the committee as well.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve mentioned that when you joined Mencap Ceredigion didn&#039;t do much with younger people.</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there any other young people of members or were the parents similar age to you when you first joined?</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No, they were a lot older than me, the parents, because obviously their kids were adults.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> My child was a child. But the great thing about it was though, better than getting involved with all the activities.</div><div id="00:21:33.000" class="transcript_line"> If we had a disco, I&#039;d bring the kids along. So the committee got to know them very, very early on.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But what was really great is that my child, my children were getting to know the adults with their disabilities.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was learning what it was going to be like in the future. And so did Beth and Dylan.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And now Beth and Dylan are friends with these adults who are now obviously in their 50s and 60s.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So they know them as friends now. It is literally like a family.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We know them all. We know their parents. We know what they had for breakfast, what their favorite things are.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the one thing that with Mencap Ceredigion is, and they&#039;re probably the same with other branches in Wales,</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and something that people don&#039;t realize or need to realize and need not to forget is that with Mencap Ceredigion,</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> we are the only constant in their lives from the time they come on board as adults when they&#039;re 18, 29, to the time they die.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they will have support workers coming and going. Social workers will come and go. Doctors, nurses, teachers, you name it, whatever.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll come and go. But with Mencap Ceredigion, we&#039;re pretty much there because we don&#039;t change in any way.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re the same committee, we&#039;re the same parents, we&#039;re the same members. Nothing changes.</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think that&#039;s quite a good thing about our organization.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And for Beth and until then, they&#039;ve got people that they&#039;ve known, like the members I know, that we see coming to Gateway and to all the events that we hold.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known them for nearly 25 years. So there&#039;s a certain element of trust and knowledge, which in effect is really, really important when you&#039;re planning on what we do as a service now.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re able to listen to them and understand them more than anybody really, besides their own family and friends, obviously.</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But certainly we know them more than a social worker. And that&#039;s not being disrespectful to the social worker, but that&#039;s just being practically honest.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not going to know what people are like after knowing them for 25 years compared to knowing them from a file for five minutes.</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you gradually, your role with Mencap Cairdigan gradually change over the years? Because you&#039;re the chair now, is that?</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I wasn&#039;t the chair. I was going, you know, the lead of that.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My half-goals are out to chairs, you know, deputy chairs, secretaries, treasurers, I don&#039;t know if all we say.</div><div id="00:24:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I came on board really with another lady who was involved with Mencap Cairdigan then, and that was Karen Blower.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> We were both the same age, the same. We like the same thing, we got quite friendly.</div><div id="00:24:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And our job really was to organize all the discos.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were new onto that committee and much as I loved all the committee members, oh, they were all fashioned about their attitude to people with learning disabilities.</div><div id="00:25:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we had to bring them up to the 20th century.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, a lot of stuff had happened since, you know, 1983 with the new legislation and, you know, the turn of the century with education and, you know, the Education Act.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But they seemed to rule so back in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And although we lived them to bits, Karen and I had to work really hard.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we used to give money out to organizations.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the things that I think was Kenal and Stiff and the Day Center in Lampeter for people with disabilities wanted a computer.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So they sent us a letter to the committee and we then had a discussion.</div><div id="00:25:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of the committee members were aghast with a computer.</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean a computer? People with disabilities don&#039;t use computers.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But what do you do? They&#039;re silly, ridiculous.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to really fight hard to convince our committee that actually, yeah, you know.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, today with phones, I&#039;ve had members come to me and I&#039;ll say, because I&#039;m not technical, as you know,</div><div id="00:26:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ll give them the phone saying, well, how do I do this, actually?</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Or, you know, you surf or whoever it is.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ll take the phone off me and they&#039;ll sort they&#039;ve sorted it out.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So technically, our members are really up there, especially with social media.</div><div id="00:26:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps there&#039;s a bit too much in social media.</div><div id="00:26:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was difficult. I can remember one instance.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We were organizing it. It was our first goal at organizing Christmas Disco in TGN.</div><div id="00:26:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was at Lampardine University, Carambeau, either one.</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were dealing with the menu.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And we decided that we&#039;ll have chicken and, you know, and these chicken, they can&#039;t have chicken.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We always have sausage and chips.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, why? Well, it&#039;s easy to cut it up for them.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I would look at each other and this is from another era, you know.</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So but we won that time. We got them chicken and, you know, proper dinner that they could cut themselves, I think.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were in it. You know, it was you could see the generation gap there.</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Really big time.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not sure. I think Bill Thompson was with us, you know, he said, oh, yeah, I get you. I get you.</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of the committee members were really stuck in, you know, the the the old fashioned way of looking after all the awareness</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and all people in disabilities in those days.</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So how they pushed back on some of those things.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely. I can remember talking to them about the development of Cardiganabar Gaitway.</div><div id="00:28:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And that has that started back 60 years ago, again, through Mencap.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, these Gaitway clubs, they still do. We still do.</div><div id="00:28:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But in those days, it was if you walked into a room, it would be the children.</div><div id="00:28:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re talking children in their 40s, 50s with the mums.</div><div id="00:28:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The mums were knitting and the children would do the jigsaws.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the social night. And they used to call it the knitting club because the mums would bring their knitting along.</div><div id="00:28:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, those attitudes have totally changed now.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, our social clubs now, whereas they used to be run and many of them used to do in day centers.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We purposely took them out to the day centers because we wanted them to be in the community.</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So our I know that Aberystwyth is a bit difficult because Aberystwyth is run separate to us and they have it in a football club or whatever,</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> not in a running club because there&#039;s a lot of security in the way.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But the ones that we&#039;ve set up in down south, it&#039;s like Cardigan now is a Cardigan Castle Cafe.</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, with the community, the one in Abervillian, that one is a bit difficult. We&#039;re not all for that one.</div><div id="00:29:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one in Newcastle Emlyn is in a pub.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The one we&#039;re going to be setting up soon in Flintisill, that&#039;s going to be a pub.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Purposely because we&#039;re in the community and what we found is that the community are now getting involved with us.</div><div id="00:29:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Last Saturday, we had a meeting in the three campuses in Newcastle Emlyn and they did a buffet for us.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And we brought our music system with us, which is the best thing we&#039;ve ever bought.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had microphones and we were all listening to music in the beer garden, dancing and everything.</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And all of a sudden, the locals are coming out and joining in.</div><div id="00:30:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve got a video of them all dancing with us and a group had come up for the weekend from Swansea and they joined in.</div><div id="00:30:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had the microphones and we were all singing like karaoke and we were getting raffles because of the fundraising.</div><div id="00:30:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s 20, 30, but they say, no, keep it clear.</div><div id="00:30:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They did a fortune on it. But what was good was that the community was involved with us and we were involved with the community in front of you.</div><div id="00:30:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s if you&#039;re asking for the difference between what it was like and what it is now, that&#039;s a very big positive as far as our members consider.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> All the different communities being with the groups that you take into cafes.</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. Well, think of it this way.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> People want to be kind.</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> There are more good people than bad people, as Ros Angus said.</div><div id="00:31:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There are more people there who want to help you than want to turn their backs.</div><div id="00:31:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So you want to take advantage of that, really.</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But on the business side of it, can you imagine when we went to Newcastle Ebbling, the Cardigan one, the Aberyne one was getting too full.</div><div id="00:31:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to Cardigan to decant to some of the world and we opened one in Cardigan.</div><div id="00:31:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That was getting too full. So we then opened one in Newcastle Ebbling.</div><div id="00:31:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going through Newcastle Ebbling, which in its day was pup town, really.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We had about 26 pups in it in those days. It&#039;s not so much that now.</div><div id="00:31:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But going around with pups to see whether we could open some sort of...</div><div id="00:31:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody was really, yeah, yeah, yeah, they&#039;d love it.</div><div id="00:31:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But then what we went for, we went there on a Wednesday night, I&#039;ll never forget, and the pub was empty midweek.</div><div id="00:32:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing happens in midweek. And there were fewer locals in there, I think very much.</div><div id="00:32:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the three campuses and we looked and it was ideal.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It had a snooker table, great. It was an area to dance.</div><div id="00:32:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a place to eat, a beautiful beer garden.</div><div id="00:32:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And Wednesday was a quiet night.</div><div id="00:32:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a word with Pete and Jill.</div><div id="00:32:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They said, yeah, great, you know, if you want, we&#039;ll do some food and, you know, we&#039;ll welcome them.</div><div id="00:32:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a problem.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So now tonight, there&#039;s going to be a gateway there.</div><div id="00:32:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s going to be about 30, 40 people there.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Every one of them will be eating.</div><div id="00:32:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;ll probably spend a good tenner with drinks and everything.</div><div id="00:32:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so it&#039;s gone from a pub with a couple of locals on a Wednesday night to a pub that&#039;s heaving.</div><div id="00:32:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s good about it is that the locals knowing there&#039;ll be a disco, you know, there&#039;ll be something on during the night, you know.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a pop pool, it&#039;s a busy pub, it&#039;s an ice pub, you know, we&#039;ll go there.</div><div id="00:33:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So the locals, you know, we&#039;re actually helping commercially as well.</div><div id="00:33:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And that goes for all the other gateways that we&#039;ve got in the community.</div><div id="00:33:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So it benefits the town as well, really.</div><div id="00:33:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, the Premier Shop next door tells me, you know, they make a bomb on a Wednesday night.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I say, why is that? Well, of course, we do a Rathford, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:33:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re all in there, our lot, buying sweets.</div><div id="00:33:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been told off about that before now that we shouldn&#039;t be raffling off sweets.</div><div id="00:33:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, that&#039;s what the members want.</div><div id="00:33:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they make a bomb on these sweets they buy and bring the bars of chocolates or box of chocolates.</div><div id="00:33:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They make a mark in an increase in profits.</div><div id="00:33:50.000" class="transcript_line"> What would have happened if you&#039;d suggested taking people to the pub when you first joined Bank of Carid again?</div><div id="00:33:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I think they would have been concerned.</div><div id="00:34:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because with their gateway, you know, bingo.</div><div id="00:34:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We do bingo. You know, they love the bingo.</div><div id="00:34:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But only one game takes about 10 minutes, not the whole night.</div><div id="00:34:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they go to a restaurant once a month or something.</div><div id="00:34:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing wrong with that. But our members now, people with disabilities, they&#039;re expecting more out of us, you know.</div><div id="00:34:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They want to work. Some don&#039;t want to work, but some do.</div><div id="00:34:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Some want to study more. Some want to socialize more.</div><div id="00:34:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Some want to travel.

No.</div><div id="00:35:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think things have changed, not as a main category, but things have changed because of the different acts.</div><div id="00:35:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Like advocacy, self-advocacy, we&#039;re teaching our members now to have a voice.</div><div id="00:35:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re teaching people to listen to those voices.</div><div id="00:35:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing without us to take gratitude.</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s there to make it a lot easier for us because they can.</div><div id="00:36:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll organize it for them, but we don&#039;t have to think about what to do.</div><div id="00:36:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll tell us what to do.</div><div id="00:36:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think as long as they listen, people listen to them, then then, you know, we&#039;ll be OK.</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s still a lot of people out there whose attitude is or go then.</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it something that happened gradually becoming member led or just happened over time?</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a gradual thing as we were concerned.</div><div id="00:36:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We still had people who didn&#039;t quite understand, were not very peace-tee about things.</div><div id="00:36:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So it took a while. And there&#039;s still a battle sometimes.</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I often think with the situation we&#039;re in at the moment with a lot of cuts and the service has been cut back and stuff like that,</div><div id="00:37:04.000" class="transcript_line"> that we are getting back to that.</div><div id="00:37:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a big, big danger of getting back to the old days where, you know,</div><div id="00:37:13.000" class="transcript_line"> that it&#039;s whatever money you&#039;ve got, that&#039;s what you get.</div><div id="00:37:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re not listening to other people as much as to looking at money, vice versa.</div><div id="00:37:27.000" class="transcript_line"> How easy has it been for your members of the learning disability to get used to leading the organization and making decisions?</div><div id="00:37:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a hard one, really.</div><div id="00:37:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we we had a self advocacy group in Kennedy, Cuncone, Kennedy Dump People&#039;s Fellows and that finished.</div><div id="00:37:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were left to know with no advocacy service, self advocacy, there wasn&#039;t any advocacy service.</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But legislation has changed, not for the better, I&#039;m afraid.</div><div id="00:38:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So Mencak Kennedy decided that we&#039;d set up our own self advocacy group.</div><div id="00:38:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was called, the members called it our voice our choice.</div><div id="00:38:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And we helped it for a while, facilitated it, helped them with meetings, administrations, stuff like that, until they were set up.</div><div id="00:38:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And we consciously then let them go.</div><div id="00:38:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Because one thing with self advocacy, it has to be independent of any other organization, any other service, because otherwise it won&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:38:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were really, really big on that.</div><div id="00:38:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is difficult to get them to run the meeting effectively.</div><div id="00:38:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So you still need to support them.</div><div id="00:38:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But it has to be that it&#039;s supporting them and not doing it for them.</div><div id="00:38:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s been a really difficult transition, especially if you&#039;re somebody like me.</div><div id="00:39:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I like to be in control of stuff.</div><div id="00:39:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I, you know, I blame myself a lot where I&#039;d be in the meeting and I&#039;d say, oh, you don&#039;t do it that way.</div><div id="00:39:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You do this way, you know, and trying to have hands off.</div><div id="00:39:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more my problem, I think, than their problem.</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because on Saturday they had a meeting and I would stick myself on the chair and I&#039;d like, I&#039;m not saying a word and keep your mouth.</div><div id="00:39:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know what? They ran it fine.</div><div id="00:39:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think there&#039;s a bit of confidence in letting them get on with it, but be there to be supportive and not be doing it.</div><div id="00:39:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So Mencap Ceredigion is separate to Mencap Cumbria.</div><div id="00:39:44.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that relationship been like in the last 20 years?</div><div id="00:39:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been an odd one really, to be honest with you, because first of all, it&#039;s difficult for people outside that don&#039;t know us to differentiate the two.</div><div id="00:40:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think they have to, to be honest, because we do two different things, as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Mencap Ceredigion is a branch, very small branch, of volunteers.</div><div id="00:40:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Mencap Cumbria is a charity and they, you know, it&#039;s through our wails.</div><div id="00:40:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re not the same in as much. We have the same ideals.</div><div id="00:40:25.000" class="transcript_line"> We have the same hopes and so forth for our members.</div><div id="00:40:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We support them in the same way, but we do two different things.</div><div id="00:40:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was difficult for me because I.</div><div id="00:40:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought of them as two separate things in as much one fighting the other for the same thought, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was hard for me, especially funding wise.</div><div id="00:40:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a couple of issues that really I wasn&#039;t happy about where, for instance, if somebody did a will and it was somebody died and it was somebody in Ceredigion,</div><div id="00:41:09.000" class="transcript_line"> the money that that will was going to was going to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:41:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So we we didn&#039;t get a look in. So there&#039;s a lot of that going on.</div><div id="00:41:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know. And we work really, really closely now.</div><div id="00:41:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve got a really good positive relationship.</div><div id="00:41:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Wayne is very supportive of the work that we do, as is he&#039;s been supportive of all the other branches.</div><div id="00:41:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And you yourself, Paul and all the other staff always at the end of the phone.</div><div id="00:41:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The the the head office, you know, in Kidaminsters, where the main office is.</div><div id="00:41:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s another.</div><div id="00:41:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a branch. Oh, this.</div><div id="00:41:50.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing that they won&#039;t do for you if you want to get free T-shirts or you want some advice on, you know, volunteering and shares or insurance or stuff like that.</div><div id="00:42:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re there. And I think as a small branch, you need that big brother support, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:42:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But at the same time, Wayne&#039;s really good in letting us get on with this as well.</div><div id="00:42:15.000" class="transcript_line"> What we do is legal. He&#039;s bothered.</div><div id="00:42:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, he&#039;s really, really supportive of things like, you know, one thing I do find with being in West Wales,</div><div id="00:42:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Big gripe with me is everything is happening in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:42:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if if if a charity is an all Wales charity, they should be covering all of Wales.</div><div id="00:42:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they get the funding to support all of Wales.</div><div id="00:42:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But you often find all of these charities are based in Cardiff and all the money is drifted over to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:42:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas with Mencap, they very much I feel and I see anyway that they spread their resources across Wales.</div><div id="00:43:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They spread their funding, if possible, across Wales and all their projects and all their people.</div><div id="00:43:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, now we&#039;ve got a development officer, Rod Drews, who lives in Llandronddol that comes westward.</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I think I think we&#039;re quite lucky as a branch to be associated with Mencap as a whole and to recognize,</div><div id="00:43:26.000" class="transcript_line"> well, respect and charity.</div><div id="00:43:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Plus, we&#039;ve got our supported housing as well, half of which are covered by Mencap as well.</div><div id="00:43:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, we&#039;ve got a strong base in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:43:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I know a lot of other counties don&#039;t even have a branch.</div><div id="00:43:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, I think it&#039;s quite a good outfit where the national, regional and branch works really, really well together.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell me a little bit about the Comic Con?</div><div id="00:43:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Comic Con, we as a branch have the fingers in lots of pies.</div><div id="00:44:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we have a gateway.</div><div id="00:44:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We have a swimming group.</div><div id="00:44:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We have a lot of talent, artwork, all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:44:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But my daughter was really, really interested in a lot of our members in animation, anime, Disney and other Japanese stuff.</div><div id="00:44:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to love dressing up and going to comi, what you call them?</div><div id="00:44:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Comic Con conventions where you dress up and so forth.</div><div id="00:44:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish to take her to London and stuff.
