    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you talk a little bit about the work you&#039;ve been doing with the Trust this year? Because</div><div id="00:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> of Covid, it&#039;s sort of developed, hasn&#039;t it, before we went into our latest lockdown of course, but</div><div id="00:00:15.040" class="transcript_line"> your Tuesday gatherings for example? Our Tuesday groups are really the practical fieldwork groups,</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> which are trying to find evidential remains of long period of occupation here.</div><div id="00:00:34.960" class="transcript_line"> The original sites that we&#039;ve chosen to do this for one reason or another were not available to us,</div><div id="00:00:40.480" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve been very lucky to build a relationship with the landowners at Oppenheim here,</div><div id="00:00:48.720" class="transcript_line"> right up at the head of the valley, where there is huge amounts of evidence to be interpreted.</div><div id="00:00:57.520" class="transcript_line"> We were lucky there, because much of the land has largely escaped modern agricultural practice,</div><div id="00:01:04.160" class="transcript_line"> which was to deep plough, improve, fertilise, develop the grassland or crop land in some areas.</div><div id="00:01:13.840" class="transcript_line"> But by doing deep cultivation like that, any surface remains are ploughed out.</div><div id="00:01:23.840" class="transcript_line"> And we are lucky then, as I said, we have been able to find remains of boundaries, farmsteads,</div><div id="00:01:34.160" class="transcript_line"> which would certainly date back to medieval times and the time of the Abbey.</div><div id="00:01:39.920" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s a great excitement. So we&#039;re looking at long hot sites, so we&#039;re looking at</div><div id="00:01:46.720" class="transcript_line"> low banks, which indicate very early field systems. And our colleague Julian</div><div id="00:01:54.640" class="transcript_line"> Ravist is very accomplished with the drone surveys, which have revealed huge amounts of</div><div id="00:02:02.400" class="transcript_line"> um, deep landscape features, which you don&#039;t necessarily see at ground level.</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> The ideal time for doing the sort of work we&#039;re doing actually is in the winter,</div><div id="00:02:14.800" class="transcript_line"> because the bracken is gone, and the sun is at a low angle in the sky, and it will illuminate</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> the surface in a very different way. It&#039;s been fantastic how it&#039;s in the snow over the last few</div><div id="00:02:28.320" class="transcript_line"> days, but the snow too is revealing shadow patterns, which indicate relatively low</div><div id="00:02:37.600" class="transcript_line"> features in the landscape, which you don&#039;t see by eye as you&#039;re just moving around.</div><div id="00:02:42.080" class="transcript_line"> But just jump out at you. So yes, there&#039;s lots going on there. And within that, we&#039;ve been able</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> to engage a lot of interest locally, some from our team or local people, some from further away.</div><div id="00:02:56.320" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re also developing links with</div><div id="00:03:02.160" class="transcript_line"> with</div><div id="00:03:06.080" class="transcript_line"> an archaeologist, Vic Cardo, who lives over at Nantlas, who&#039;s done a lot of work</div><div id="00:03:14.240" class="transcript_line"> on the Owen Valley and the Cliovan Valley, and can bring experience, which shows a similar sort</div><div id="00:03:22.560" class="transcript_line"> of passion to the uplifts we&#039;re finding here, and all sorts of exciting things.</div><div id="00:03:29.760" class="transcript_line"> What looks like a deep ditch in the landscape is in fact was a sort of runoff of getting the</div><div id="00:03:36.800" class="transcript_line"> sheep up onto the hills, having watered them in the river. One man put the sheep in this rather deep</div><div id="00:03:44.640" class="transcript_line"> gully and just drive them straight up to the top of the hill without any other help.</div><div id="00:03:53.280" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a very interesting farming technique. And at the moment we&#039;re looking for</div><div id="00:03:59.440" class="transcript_line"> hazel sites and have also the summer farms of the farms lower down in the valley. So we would be up</div><div id="00:04:08.480" class="transcript_line"> for relatively short periods, live temporarily on the hill, milk the cattle, cattle are important</div><div id="00:04:15.600" class="transcript_line"> in medieval times, make their cheeses, send them back down, and then eventually by early September</div><div id="00:04:22.960" class="transcript_line"> maybe back down in the main farm. So yes, lots going on there and still a lot, lot to be found.</div><div id="00:04:30.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re looking at the moment at some cairns on the top of the Camilla bank, and of course it is</div><div id="00:04:38.320" class="transcript_line"> an ancient landscape. You always have to remember that there was somebody in the landscape before</div><div id="00:04:43.920" class="transcript_line"> whoever&#039;s there now. So when the monks came here there were people before them and before them and</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> before them. And the Neolithic remains just encircled from here really. If you go up onto the</div><div id="00:04:57.280" class="transcript_line"> garn, where you&#039;ve got to garn, burial mound, there are some what looked like remains of some</div><div id="00:05:05.840" class="transcript_line"> burial mounds actually on the Camilla bank and then round onto the Camilla hill. They&#039;re just</div><div id="00:05:12.800" class="transcript_line"> one after the other because they tended to bury within sight of a previous burial whatever. So</div><div id="00:05:23.200" class="transcript_line"> history over thousands of years is revealing itself and the Tuesday group has been fantastic</div><div id="00:05:30.240" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ve worked very hard at doing the donkey work associated with the period which is</div><div id="00:05:36.640" class="transcript_line"> actually revealing the footings of early farm steps at</div><div id="00:05:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Gilemon, Granacterium, which disappeared as a farm back in the 1860s when the land above it was</div><div id="00:05:51.360" class="transcript_line"> enclosed. And two sites have come on itself, one where an obvious house was until</div><div id="00:05:58.720" class="transcript_line"> probably occupied until about 1880. But just adjacent to that I&#039;ve got my eye on another</div><div id="00:06:05.520" class="transcript_line"> platform site which we haven&#039;t done much work on but to measure it. But I think that could be</div><div id="00:06:11.920" class="transcript_line"> an earlier and certainly medieval location of a farmstead and it would have been a timber</div><div id="00:06:18.320" class="transcript_line"> built house. You wouldn&#039;t find any remains of it. But under the surface there is obvious paving</div><div id="00:06:24.720" class="transcript_line"> paving, store stones laid down as paving. So what that holds remains to be seen.</div><div id="00:06:34.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always something else to find out.</div></div></p>
