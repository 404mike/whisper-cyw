So you&#039;d been up on stilts.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Pete Waldridge, a fabulous name from Community Theatre in Cardiff, obviously ran that group.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then many years later, you stumble upon the Cardiff Carnival in Cot√©&#039;s Community Centre.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m imagining the tutors, part of our carnival team who taught you and took you through your paces and helped you build up your stamina again, were Kevin and Oggy.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was it like working with them? Because of course, they were Bristol based.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They were stilt performers.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That was how they primarily made their living, you know, so they were quite expert.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> What were they like as tutors?</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what was it like to learn again?</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great fun.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I got involved with that.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I particularly remember making cardboard fashion victim clothes, actually.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great fun.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And spending hours during the carnival procession on stilts, going around town.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the fashion victims.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were the following years.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And weren&#039;t they sort of like beatboxer-y type characters with...</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So it would have been you, Oggy.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Reese, do you remember her? Reese?</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Reese and do you remember Cora?</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were like a sort of posse.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite satirical as well.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You were sort of gently taking the mickey out of your fashion, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. I had a cardboard pineapple hairdo.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember those being popular at any time.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I was not a very fashionable fashion victim.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no. But I remember all your gear was actually made primarily out of cardboard,</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> which was printed and painted and varnished.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It looked very wonderful.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were actually up on stilts above the audience during the parade.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that feel like?</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in terms of reception from the audience or even...</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Are your legs turning to jelly through striding around?</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I&#039;ve always found it kind of easier to walk on stilts than on my own feet or on high heels.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re naturally a stilt walker by birth.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It&#039;s that thing that you&#039;ve got to keep your legs moving.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t stop because if you stop, you fall over.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve just got to keep going.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you want to stop, you find a wall and lean against it.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no other way.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a bit like the shark. I think I understand.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It has to swim permanently to survive.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Stilt walkers are like the shark of the carnival world.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You don&#039;t stop until you take them off.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m right in saying you never took a tumble. I don&#039;t remember...</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No? Never came... Yes.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to watch Kevin Dennis, one of the Jumbies, the stilt performers.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the first things he used to say in a lesson was,</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> if you are going to fall, make sure you don&#039;t fall backwards because there&#039;s no control.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d practice bringing people down.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He said you come down to your knees, then you come forward onto your hands or your elbows,</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> hopefully onto skateboard pads, which would be on your knees and your elbow.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And that way it&#039;s all controlled.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve come down and it made total sense.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Rather than falling from a great height, it was like watching somebody collapse gently.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And under a very controlled manner.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It does. It goes against your instincts because you have to go forwards.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And you have to sort of bend your knees and then put your hands out.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s sort of... Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And the rest happens. Gravity does the rest for you.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So after a couple of years as a very accomplished stilt performer, I have to say,</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I can still in my mind&#039;s eye see you on parade.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You then got a taste for drumming.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a wonderful group run with a musical director, certainly Chris Gerling,</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> who was deputy musical director of Samba Galiz at the time.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was called Rundamental.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell us a bit about Rundamental.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fab.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of workshops leading up to it.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> There was like about six or eight weeks worth of, I think, two workshops a week or something leading up to it.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And lots of drumming, but lots of physical warm up as well.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember never being so fit in my life as I was at the end of that.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we ran around town for, I think, two hours or more.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Drumming and running constantly for the actual carnival.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And the troupe, I think, was probably as big as 20 or 30 people.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was huge.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was the look? Because it was a very distinctive look, I remember, as well.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all black and white, kind of tribal looking stuff at the time.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember running up to friends of mine sitting in town and they didn&#039;t even recognise us.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re on parade, you&#039;re drumming in costume, and they&#039;ve got no idea.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No idea it was me at all.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it was great fun.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we just ran and drummed for hours.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s one of the groups who really took to heart the whole, you know, yes, you can paint your face,</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but why don&#039;t we go for a total body look?</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, you know, that bit which wasn&#039;t covered with specially printed designs in black and white seemed to be...</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we were painted all over.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You were painted all over, I can remember that.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, and the whole group looked amazing.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had this frenetic energy because not only would you stop and drum, you&#039;d then, like a unit, get up and run somewhere else and do it.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was a, I mean, Run Demential was well named.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There was quite a high entry level, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a fitness regime that you had to come twice a week.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you did. You needed to.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Build up your stamina.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But Chris obviously knew what he was doing because, yes, in fact, well, he went further down that line and he&#039;s now a professional fireman.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll be glad to know, Alo, which for which you have to be very physically fit.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So Chris has kept that up.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you kept on the drumming in your next incarnation as a drummer.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t black and white.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You were...</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Blue and gold.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Blue and gold.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Blue and gold.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t do quite so much fitness regime and running this time, but it&#039;s still a lot of drumming.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember this time we went off from Cote&#039;s Community Centre again, I think.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And then over the bridge, which I thought was a nice moment because I could look back and see how big the parade was and just think, wow, all these people coming together, you know, very, very special.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was smashing.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s you as an individual, as it were.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, life intervenes and children and families emerge and you left Cardiff for a while.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So certainly we weren&#039;t as accessible as we used to be.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you&#039;re back and you&#039;re pregnant in a parade.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What were you wearing?</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> How did it feel to be carrying child whilst on a carnival parade?</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> At that point, yeah, it was probably when I was the first of my sober carnival experiences.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I was wearing some sort of jester thing.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it? Some fool&#039;s thing.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I can see the feast of fools.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> The feast of fools was the carnival theme.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We had rather colourful, not quite patchwork, but big colourful pantaloons with sort of, you know, one colour at the top and another colour on the left.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were quite... I would say they were harlequin-esque.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I like the word, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s a very long word.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But very colourful harlequins.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was fun.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the heat of summer.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Thankfully, I don&#039;t think I was too heavily pregnant at that point.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I was about to ask how.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and of course we finished down in Cardiff Bay.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the WMC, the Welshman Ames Centre was even built at that point.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was still relatively early days for Cardiff Bay as a visitor destination.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But again, a beautiful sunny day.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody enjoyed themselves.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And as a mum of three now, of course you&#039;ve still got contact with the Cardiff Carnival.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re back.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> All my kids have been in the carnival at some point in their pushchair.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> All decked out with bits of gold and whatever.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> At various different times.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And now the oldest one is 13 and the youngest one is five.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So last year she was in her pushchair.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> This year she wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> She escaped.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was all over the place.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite scary.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was rugby international so it was absolutely packed.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but yeah, it was fun.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the joys of actually being on parade with children who are perhaps a little over excited upon occasion.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been at my trial this year but it&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And my middle son particularly really got enthusiastic about it when they came along last year.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t want to join in but once they were in the parade he couldn&#039;t wait to come back this year.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you for remembering and bringing us back all your carnival memories.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s worth saying that sort of Anna, you&#039;re one of the people who I associate with theatre and special events and participation in Cardiff because your involvement, you mentioned getting involved with Moving Being Theatre Company when you were very young.</div><div id="00:11:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Being part of South Cardiff Youth Theatre.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, tell us before all that happened, Moving Being, who were very innovative theatre company undertook a project about the great storehouse of Welsh legends, the Mabinogion and that actually brought you to Cardiff initially.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell us more about that.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was about eight when the first one happened.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in all the Mabinogions.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They did four in total, I think.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was eight when the first one happened and we were living in London.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother got a part in the Mabinogion.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that brought us to Cardiff for a few months while we were performing in that.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And as one of the children of the cast I ended up sort of in the cast myself.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> As one does, there were escapes.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We were kind of gypsy kids and mice in the third branch, which was very exciting.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was your...</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a magical experience because it was in Cardiff Castle and there was...</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Open air.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, open air with a kind of medieval fare as well and people on the battlements and these massive carts.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were people on horseback, were there not?</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> People on horseback, massive huge wooden carts where the stage would roll in on carts.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was amazing.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was really magical as a kid to be there.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I think my mum had such fun in Cardiff that we moved to Cardiff after that.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, I remember the first time I met you, you would have been part of Theatre Taniest in Wales.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I only joined them for the second part of a trilogy of Indo-Celtic plays.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you have been in the first one, which I missed?</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Tristan and Asselt.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I was, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So you did Tristan and Asselt.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mum as well in the first one.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And the...</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Run by Nigel Watson and Stuart Cox.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Stuart Cox was living in our house at the time of the first one.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> He was our lodger.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s now living in Mexico, you&#039;d be glad to know.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s now living in Mexico and I&#039;m actually the treasurer for Celebrating Cultures, which he was directing.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Like that.</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, yeah, that was fun.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was multi... not so much bilingual, was it?</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But multilingual was kind of...</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, how is your do when you&#039;re pushed to...</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> We can manage in the master, is it?</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s probably...</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Something like...</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, right, right.</div><div id="00:14:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was Welsh folk dancing and Indian folk dancing and drumming and sitars and all kinds of stuff going on.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, for the second play, we brought over a group from India, the Bavayas from Gujarat, a troupe of 30 folk theatre performers, half of whom were brought up as female impersonators to play the female roles,</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because in Gujarati society and that tradition, women weren&#039;t allowed to perform.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember them at all?</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Extraordinary characters.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> My personal...</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the fairly old... he was passed on now.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Clown Ratibai, he was my favourite.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Shaved head.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had this... he was just a lovely, lovely old man.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And taking them on tours, you know, got very fond memories of them.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely bunches.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Extraordinary.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyways, my time with Tali Essin helped spawn Swicker because during that, yes, we&#039;d have the 10 weeks of rehearsals and performances at the Gujarati Samar Centre in Grangetown, but then we tried to actually expand that and we would, you know, the community orchestra would set up for the play.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d then try and see if we could keep that going, you know, through the year, etc.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it was through that that certainly I first helped introduce percussion.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we started with African drumming.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then once Tali Essin had gone to Glasgow for European City of Culture, we had set up Swicker, we introduced Samba drumming, which as a virus has managed to take over, you know, you can find it throughout the length and breadth of Wales, which is smashing, which has got to be a good thing.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Anna, thank you very much indeed for all your carnival memories.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I shall think of you on stilts, I shall think of you drumming in body paint, and I shall think of you both as a pregnant parader and a mum, marshmallow of kids, as the carnival, what can I say, madness increases.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So many thanks indeed.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to say, though it&#039;s not bankable, but it&#039;s a very worthy word.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I just say, Anna Shaw, you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div></div></p>
