    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is David Mayer and I&#039;ve been going to gigs in Newport since 1965.</div><div id="00:00:15.560" class="transcript_line"> In 1985 I became the agent for Newport West and prospective MP Paul Flynn.</div><div id="00:00:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Around that time the Red Wedge group had set up.</div><div id="00:00:27.460" class="transcript_line"> It included the Commonards, Style Council, Paul Weller, Billy Bragg, as well as loads</div><div id="00:00:34.940" class="transcript_line"> of other top bands of the period.</div><div id="00:00:39.280" class="transcript_line"> The Labour Party in London sent us a Red Wedge pack to encourage local action among young</div><div id="00:00:46.220" class="transcript_line"> voters.</div><div id="00:00:47.620" class="transcript_line"> Newport West was only formed in 1983 and at that election the Tories won by about 500</div><div id="00:00:56.980" class="transcript_line"> So we were a target seat for the 1987 election.</div><div id="00:01:01.500" class="transcript_line"> We heard that Billy Bragg was interested in playing Newport so we arranged a gig at Cullion</div><div id="00:01:06.860" class="transcript_line"> College.</div><div id="00:01:08.640" class="transcript_line"> We also organised a day of events on Saturday 1st February at the Newport Centre, which</div><div id="00:01:18.100" class="transcript_line"> mostly music related things such as guitar and drum lessons, songwriting, poetry etc.</div><div id="00:01:26.540" class="transcript_line"> A few weeks earlier Paul Flynn and I actually gate crashed the green room of the Commonards</div><div id="00:01:33.200" class="transcript_line"> gig at Newport Centre so that we could put flyers on the seats for the Billy Bragg events.</div><div id="00:01:40.140" class="transcript_line"> I designed the posters and flyers using the Red Wedge promotional material they sent.</div><div id="00:01:45.500" class="transcript_line"> I introduced Paul to Jimmy Somerville who seemed a bit distant as did all the band,</div><div id="00:01:51.740" class="transcript_line"> probably psyched up for the performance or maybe they had an argument.</div><div id="00:01:57.380" class="transcript_line"> Paul had no idea who Jimmy Somerville was of course, being from a different generation.</div><div id="00:02:03.820" class="transcript_line"> We distributed the flyers and watched the opening songs but it was too loud and alien</div><div id="00:02:08.100" class="transcript_line"> for Paul unfortunately so we left.</div><div id="00:02:13.820" class="transcript_line"> On Friday 31st January 1986 Billy played the main hall at Cullion College, then a teaching</div><div id="00:02:22.540" class="transcript_line"> college.</div><div id="00:02:23.540" class="transcript_line"> The hall was rammed.</div><div id="00:02:26.380" class="transcript_line"> Billy was supported by legendary local band The Abs and a band called Atacco di Centi,</div><div id="00:02:33.860" class="transcript_line"> an interesting percussive orientated band from Brighton that Billy endorsed around that</div><div id="00:02:39.620" class="transcript_line"> time.</div><div id="00:02:41.500" class="transcript_line"> About half way through Billy&#039;s performance some drunk Tory hecklers started shouting</div><div id="00:02:47.180" class="transcript_line"> abuse and a scuffle broke out.</div><div id="00:02:50.460" class="transcript_line"> Billy stopped playing and asked the audience to resolve it peacefully.</div><div id="00:02:55.460" class="transcript_line"> He said, if you hold your hands out, palms facing up, you can direct the troublemakers</div><div id="00:03:02.340" class="transcript_line"> out of the fire doors.</div><div id="00:03:04.500" class="transcript_line"> This happened.</div><div id="00:03:05.820" class="transcript_line"> It was unbelievable.</div><div id="00:03:07.380" class="transcript_line"> The three Tories were guided towards the side doors and out.</div><div id="00:03:11.780" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing they could do to resist.</div><div id="00:03:14.420" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never seen anything like it.</div><div id="00:03:17.380" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think Billy had, although he may have heard of it.</div><div id="00:03:21.980" class="transcript_line"> I had a great view of all this happening from the balcony on the left of the stage.</div><div id="00:03:28.220" class="transcript_line"> Afterwards Billy thanked me for organising the gig and was clearly buzzing from the performance</div><div id="00:03:35.180" class="transcript_line"> and the ejection of the troublemakers.</div><div id="00:03:38.300" class="transcript_line"> He had heard about this being done but had never seen it himself.</div><div id="00:03:43.180" class="transcript_line"> He held both of my hands and would not let go.</div><div id="00:03:46.940" class="transcript_line"> I said I have to leave as I am giving a lift to one of the young party members to Pontypool.</div><div id="00:03:53.340" class="transcript_line"> It took about five minutes to break away.</div><div id="00:03:57.260" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know it at the time but in the audience was someone who would become one of my closest</div><div id="00:04:03.020" class="transcript_line"> friends, Jane Mudd, now leader of the council, who blagged her way on stage at one point.</div><div id="00:04:10.860" class="transcript_line"> The next time I met Billy Bragg was at the Bevan Institute 60th birthday celebration for the NHS</div><div id="00:04:20.460" class="transcript_line"> in July 2008 at the Senedd.</div><div id="00:04:25.580" class="transcript_line"> I also designed the brochure and badge for this event and helped organise the front of house.</div><div id="00:04:31.180" class="transcript_line"> After his performance there I asked him if he remembered the night at Cleon</div><div id="00:04:36.300" class="transcript_line"> and he looked at me bemused.</div><div id="00:04:38.620" class="transcript_line"> I described the event with the Tories but he said he could not remember</div><div id="00:04:43.660" class="transcript_line"> a thing which I guess after 30 years of touring well.</div></div></p>
