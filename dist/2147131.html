    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic. Okay, well first things is details so can you please tell us your name and where</div><div id="00:00:10.600" class="transcript_line"> and when you were born?</div><div id="00:00:12.600" class="transcript_line"> My name is Fisela Ali and I was born in South America, Guyana. It&#039;s on the North Atlantic.</div><div id="00:00:23.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s by the Amazon rainforest.</div><div id="00:00:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that area that you grew up on?</div><div id="00:00:29.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do. Yes, because I have many lakes and the Atlantic Ocean and I was overlooking</div><div id="00:00:36.200" class="transcript_line"> the Atlantic Ocean. It&#039;s interesting. It&#039;s on the Essequible Coast of Guyana.</div><div id="00:00:44.200" class="transcript_line"> What was it like growing up there?</div><div id="00:00:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was lovely. It was very homely. The people are very laid back and happy. You know,</div><div id="00:00:57.200" class="transcript_line"> they had a good nature.</div><div id="00:01:07.200" class="transcript_line"> What was it like growing up in the house? What was the household like?</div><div id="00:01:13.200" class="transcript_line"> The house was, I had eight sisters so it was interesting. My mom and dad.</div><div id="00:01:25.200" class="transcript_line"> What was your favorite memory of your childhood? Is there one particular or is there multiple?</div><div id="00:01:34.200" class="transcript_line"> I think because I was the eldest, everyone like played a part and I used to enjoy that.</div><div id="00:01:42.200" class="transcript_line"> Everyone used to make fuss out, you know. It was a happy occasion. I used to feel happy, everyone together.</div><div id="00:01:58.200" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about the difference between the childhood there and here as well?</div><div id="00:02:07.200" class="transcript_line"> I think the childhood there is much better. It&#039;s more open and you can see people come to you.</div><div id="00:02:16.200" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t go to the people. I think it&#039;s more friendly.</div><div id="00:02:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there one event or celebration that stands out to you?</div><div id="00:02:30.200" class="transcript_line"> I used to take part in different celebrations. Not a special one.</div><div id="00:02:37.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s like whatever celebration is around, we used to take part in that.</div><div id="00:02:45.200" class="transcript_line"> Like what? I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:02:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Different cultural celebrations. Whatever is around. We used to take part in it.</div><div id="00:03:00.200" class="transcript_line"> As a child or a young person, was there anything that was really exciting about the celebration?</div><div id="00:03:13.200" class="transcript_line"> I used to like sports. Like going to look at sports. Cricket, football, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:03:26.200" class="transcript_line"> Other celebrations like the Muslim celebration, Hindus, the Christians.</div><div id="00:03:34.200" class="transcript_line"> The schools over there, when you go to the school, they take you to all these places like to the churches and the temple and the mosque.</div><div id="00:03:47.200" class="transcript_line"> So yes, we used to take part in things which is good. It&#039;s different over there from over here. I know it is.</div><div id="00:03:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Speaking over here, what made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div id="00:04:03.200" class="transcript_line"> I came for a marriage purpose.</div><div id="00:04:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any expectations of the UK?</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> No. I came as a teenager so it was difficult for me to understand what it&#039;s like.</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> I came when I was young.</div><div id="00:04:24.200" class="transcript_line"> How old were you?</div><div id="00:04:25.200" class="transcript_line"> About eighteen. I came on my own so it was different.</div><div id="00:04:34.200" class="transcript_line"> What I noticed over here is that it&#039;s like a colder country and people are more reserved.</div><div id="00:04:43.200" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s difficult to... even communication I find it a bit difficult.</div><div id="00:04:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Back home in South America it was much easier to get on with people.</div><div id="00:05:05.200" class="transcript_line"> And it makes sense with what you just said about people coming to you as well?</div><div id="00:05:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the door is open and people come to you. It&#039;s different. I don&#039;t know about now but when I was growing up.</div><div id="00:05:17.200" class="transcript_line"> It was like that. I think things are changing everywhere because of the technology.</div><div id="00:05:26.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a digital world, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:31.200" class="transcript_line"> What was the most important thing you think you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:05:36.200" class="transcript_line"> I love my family and I miss that quite a lot.</div><div id="00:05:42.200" class="transcript_line"> Because when I came here it was more like isolation and the weather wasn&#039;t great and I had to get used to people.</div><div id="00:05:52.200" class="transcript_line"> So I think I was a bit more isolated when I came here.</div><div id="00:05:58.200" class="transcript_line"> But now I&#039;m getting a bit more open to get out and to meet people.</div><div id="00:06:09.200" class="transcript_line"> How did you travel to the UK?</div><div id="00:06:13.200" class="transcript_line"> I came by air.</div><div id="00:06:18.200" class="transcript_line"> What was the best or the worst thing about that journey?</div><div id="00:06:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was hard. I was crying all the way.</div><div id="00:06:27.200" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t that easy for me.</div><div id="00:06:34.200" class="transcript_line"> I think in my country I used to feel myself more. I had that nice feeling.</div><div id="00:06:43.200" class="transcript_line"> When I came here it was like a cold feeling. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the weather. It could be.</div><div id="00:06:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And a bit of isolation. It&#039;s different.</div><div id="00:07:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. It could be the weather because in South America it&#039;s more tropical.</div><div id="00:07:08.200" class="transcript_line"> And over here the weather, you have seasons, it changes quite a lot.</div><div id="00:07:14.200" class="transcript_line"> It could be that. I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:07:19.200" class="transcript_line"> Is isolation and the coldness and refractions?</div><div id="00:07:28.200" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re home there&#039;s a lot of people you can see and you can see a reflection.</div><div id="00:07:32.200" class="transcript_line"> My parents had a big general store so I used to work in it since I was five.</div><div id="00:07:40.200" class="transcript_line"> So I think that helped me to be among people. It was nice.</div><div id="00:07:49.200" class="transcript_line"> I never felt sad or unhappy because people are around you all the time. So that was good.</div><div id="00:08:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Does that mean all of you and your sisters as well?</div><div id="00:08:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sisters and brothers. I have brothers as well. Three brothers.</div><div id="00:08:13.200" class="transcript_line"> When did you come to the UK and where did you land as well?</div><div id="00:08:19.200" class="transcript_line"> I came in the 70s. I landed in Heathrow. So I lived in London for a while. About three or four years.</div><div id="00:08:32.200" class="transcript_line"> How did that feel? How did you feel arriving to the UK?</div><div id="00:08:36.200" class="transcript_line"> It was very dismal, dark. It wasn&#039;t attractive at that moment to me.</div><div id="00:08:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Remember South America is more like the sunshine, the brightness, the people.</div><div id="00:08:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Over here people are more indoor. You have to go out to certain things to be able to see people.</div><div id="00:09:07.200" class="transcript_line"> When did you arrive in Newport then?</div><div id="00:09:13.200" class="transcript_line"> I lived in London for three or four years. Then went to the Midlands to live in Leicester.</div><div id="00:09:23.200" class="transcript_line"> From Leicester I came to Wales. So that is a long time. 1968.</div><div id="00:09:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Wales is much better. I think because it is smaller. You can get on a bit more with the people. But in London it was different.</div><div id="00:09:52.200" class="transcript_line"> It is fast.</div><div id="00:09:56.200" class="transcript_line"> So what was the decision to move to Leicester?</div><div id="00:10:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it is to do with my husband. He was moving to different places. So I had to follow him in that way.</div><div id="00:10:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Coming and arriving to Newport, what can you remember about the first weeks or months that you were here?</div><div id="00:10:23.200" class="transcript_line"> I did like it. I did like Newport. I think because it is smaller and the people are a bit more friendly.</div><div id="00:10:33.200" class="transcript_line"> Then I had a job in the hospital. So that helped quite a lot. Seeing people all the time. So it helped me. That was good.</div><div id="00:10:47.200" class="transcript_line"> By seeing people you are interacting with people.</div><div id="00:10:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, interacting. It takes away things from your mind. It takes away all the negative feelings.</div><div id="00:10:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Did that help them to not so much think about home?</div><div id="00:11:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that is right. It helped me. So that I don&#039;t have to think about where I came from.</div><div id="00:11:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Wherever I settled I tried to make it my home. So that was good in that way.</div><div id="00:11:27.200" class="transcript_line"> Then I had my three daughters growing up. So that was keeping me busy also.</div><div id="00:11:35.200" class="transcript_line"> How many were born here in Newport?</div><div id="00:11:39.200" class="transcript_line"> Two were born in Leicester and one in London.</div><div id="00:11:45.200" class="transcript_line"> As you were travelling and when you were in Newport, did you have any friends or family that joined you from Guyana?</div><div id="00:11:55.200" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t know anyone from Guyana. Just me. But I had other friends and neighbours. I just make friends with whoever is around me.</div><div id="00:12:13.200" class="transcript_line"> You said about waking up late and then you were a nurse. You went into the hospital.</div><div id="00:12:23.200" class="transcript_line"> I was assisting the doctors and midwives. So it was like chaperoning and assisting.</div><div id="00:12:33.200" class="transcript_line"> That was very nice. I enjoyed that. I&#039;m interacting with people of different levels. So that was good.</div><div id="00:12:47.200" class="transcript_line"> I did enjoy it. It helps me a lot so I don&#039;t forget back home where I came from.</div><div id="00:12:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I felt like a community. I felt nice as I&#039;m in a community. So that was very good.</div><div id="00:13:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Even to not forget back home, what could you say that you miss the most about?</div><div id="00:13:15.200" class="transcript_line"> I miss the family atmosphere. It&#039;s closer. It&#039;s a different feeling. I can&#039;t express it. It&#039;s a nicer feeling. I miss that close connection.</div><div id="00:13:37.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s a different upbringing back home from here. I notice.</div><div id="00:13:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Definitely there&#039;s that big difference.</div><div id="00:13:53.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a big gap really. Over here I can&#039;t feel that. Even with my children I notice they&#039;re different from me.</div><div id="00:14:03.200" class="transcript_line"> I know they have their own personalities but I can see it. They can&#039;t imagine where I came from and how things are over there.</div><div id="00:14:19.200" class="transcript_line"> They were born in these countries. They&#039;re adapting to these countries, which is good.</div><div id="00:14:29.200" class="transcript_line"> What would you say, of course there&#039;s the family aspect, what could you say that you love the most about your culture?</div><div id="00:14:37.200" class="transcript_line"> I like the culture because it brings you together as a strong family unit. That nurturing is important. I did miss that with all my siblings.</div><div id="00:14:55.200" class="transcript_line"> I like the community spirit. It&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:15:03.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there elements of your culture that you&#039;ve made an effort to preserve?</div><div id="00:15:09.200" class="transcript_line"> I think over here it&#039;s very different. I tried my best because I don&#039;t go out a lot. I think Aged Alive helped me to get out a bit, to socialize.</div><div id="00:15:25.200" class="transcript_line"> That was good because then I can see different people from different parts of the world, different nationalities.</div><div id="00:15:35.200" class="transcript_line"> In that way it&#039;s good because then I can interact a bit more.</div><div id="00:15:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a little grandson and he&#039;s keeping me busy at the moment. I have to lay apart with him at the moment.</div><div id="00:15:57.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to know myself. It took me a long time. As I&#039;m getting on, it&#039;s only now I&#039;m getting to know myself.</div><div id="00:16:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there certain foods, music that&#039;s helped you?</div><div id="00:16:19.200" class="transcript_line"> I like all sorts of different cultural music. I like different types of food. I don&#039;t have a speciality.</div><div id="00:16:27.200" class="transcript_line"> I like rice. I like a lot of Asian food as well as my own country food. I like different types. I like different tastes.</div><div id="00:16:41.200" class="transcript_line"> What is the Guyanese food?</div><div id="00:16:43.200" class="transcript_line"> This is a cooker price, kechari, salt fish. They like salt fish. They like pepper pot.</div><div id="00:16:55.200" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of plantain and cassava dumplings. They eat a lot of pepper.</div><div id="00:17:07.200" class="transcript_line"> They grow it there. It&#039;s a lovely country. I miss it for all the different fruits.</div><div id="00:17:19.200" class="transcript_line"> The tropical fruits are different from over here.</div><div id="00:17:25.200" class="transcript_line"> When was your last return?</div><div id="00:17:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Since I came, I never returned. That&#039;s why it&#039;s sad. That&#039;s about four to seven years.</div><div id="00:17:41.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there a particular reason or is it just not yet?</div><div id="00:17:47.200" class="transcript_line"> I think because of the kids. I had the children just after I got married.</div><div id="00:17:55.200" class="transcript_line"> It prevented me from going. I was on my own, in isolation as usual. I had to look after them. It wasn&#039;t that easy.</div><div id="00:18:07.200" class="transcript_line"> It was hard for me to make friends at that time of my life.</div><div id="00:18:15.200" class="transcript_line"> As you spoke about friends and being out there, that age alive you said you spoke about.</div><div id="00:18:21.200" class="transcript_line"> I think now because I stopped working, I never used to socialise much when the kids were younger.</div><div id="00:18:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Because I was working in the hospital, I was tied up with that. Just going to work and back home.</div><div id="00:18:47.200" class="transcript_line"> That sort of routine thing. It&#039;s only now I have the time to do a bit more.</div><div id="00:18:55.200" class="transcript_line"> To go on outings and to get together. I don&#039;t do a lot but I try to whenever I can spare time.</div><div id="00:19:05.200" class="transcript_line"> How did you become involved with Age Alive?</div><div id="00:19:11.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it was just after the lockdown I got to find out about Age Alive. Someone told me about it and decided to join.</div><div id="00:19:21.200" class="transcript_line"> What can you tell us about your involvement with Age Alive?</div><div id="00:19:27.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not totally involved in anything at the moment. I participate in events they have.</div><div id="00:19:39.200" class="transcript_line"> I like to listen a lot. Whatever programme they&#039;re having, I try to take part whenever I can.</div><div id="00:19:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there one event or a trip?</div><div id="00:19:55.200" class="transcript_line"> I did go on the trips. They had a few other things I used to participate in.</div><div id="00:20:07.200" class="transcript_line"> How do you think that Age Alive supports the ethnic groups over 50?</div><div id="00:20:15.200" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;re doing well. They&#039;re making progress. A lot of them are in the same type of situation.</div><div id="00:20:25.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s helping them to get together and to do things together. It helped me as well to get to know people.</div><div id="00:20:35.200" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re in your home you can&#039;t get to know people. So this sort of environment is good to meet people.</div><div id="00:20:45.200" class="transcript_line"> You said to learn about different parts of the world as well?</div><div id="00:20:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right. I need to know that. I need to learn about different places in the world.</div><div id="00:20:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I think that is important to hear about different stories, about different parts.</div><div id="00:21:09.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t go to those parts of the world.</div><div id="00:21:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Why is that also important for our young people, our next generation, to know and hear the stories about different parts?</div><div id="00:21:23.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s very important. I don&#039;t think young people are so keen to know things like that.</div><div id="00:21:31.200" class="transcript_line"> If they can get some feedback to know about different parts of the world, it would be good.</div><div id="00:21:39.200" class="transcript_line"> Because my children, they don&#039;t really want to know. They&#039;re too busy and occupied with their own things.</div><div id="00:21:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Even though they&#039;re still very, very young and they haven&#039;t got anything.</div><div id="00:21:55.200" class="transcript_line"> I suppose when they get older they would want to listen a bit more. But at the moment they&#039;re distracted.</div><div id="00:22:05.200" class="transcript_line"> This is a question that has come to mind now. If there was anything you could say to a younger version of yourself?</div><div id="00:22:17.200" class="transcript_line"> Of myself?</div><div id="00:22:23.200" class="transcript_line"> When I was young I was very sensitive and timid. I never used to speak a lot.</div><div id="00:22:33.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if I was afraid of things. Although I was happy, I had that sort of sensitivity in me.</div><div id="00:22:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I can&#039;t explain more about it. Although I used to enjoy myself.</div><div id="00:22:57.200" class="transcript_line"> But I was very sensitive and I get emotional as well. I don&#039;t know the reason behind that.</div><div id="00:23:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s my grandson. He&#039;s got a bit of that in him. I don&#039;t know what it is.</div><div id="00:23:17.200" class="transcript_line"> What message can you give him or yourself?</div><div id="00:23:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully he will grow out of that. I hope so. Because the education system is different here.</div><div id="00:23:33.200" class="transcript_line"> When you go to school they were very strict. You used to get smacked to be late.</div><div id="00:23:41.200" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t do things right you get a bit of punishment for that. So it could be that is why. I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:23:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Have you kept any family heirlooms or photographs or ornaments?</div><div id="00:23:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I have. Some nice ones.</div><div id="00:24:03.200" class="transcript_line"> Photographs? Why are they important to you?</div><div id="00:24:08.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important because I was born there. I have to remember that for my whole life. That&#039;s important.</div><div id="00:24:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful. That&#039;s everything I have.
