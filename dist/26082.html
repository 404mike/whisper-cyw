    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Radnysher itself probably never really would have been able to support the recruitment</div><div id="00:00:09.600" class="transcript_line"> of its own regiment.</div><div id="00:00:11.560" class="transcript_line"> There have been militias in Radnysher in the past and indeed those of you that go and see</div><div id="00:00:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Thomas Jones that&#039;s actually the guy inside the bandstand there, go and see his grave</div><div id="00:00:22.360" class="transcript_line"> in Kaibar Chapel.</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> His inscription on his tablet does detail the association of his family with the Radnysher</div><div id="00:00:29.720" class="transcript_line"> militia.</div><div id="00:00:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Now the Yeomanry regiments were largely there as a sort of emergency militia and a lot of</div><div id="00:00:38.600" class="transcript_line"> the time they were used to quell problems with the civilian population, for example</div><div id="00:00:45.240" class="transcript_line"> in the Chartist riots in the 19th century.</div><div id="00:00:48.760" class="transcript_line"> They were not professional military, it was some guy that was a Yeoman farmer or something</div><div id="00:00:57.640" class="transcript_line"> one day then he was called out, he got on his horse, he had a cutlass and he could go</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> around chopping people&#039;s heads off as indeed they did at Peter Lee in Manchester when these</div><div id="00:01:04.880" class="transcript_line"> things got out of hand there.</div><div id="00:01:10.720" class="transcript_line"> There had been a tradition in Radnysher and in the south of Powys really of going into</div><div id="00:01:14.680" class="transcript_line"> the south of Wales broadways, that&#039;s more in Brecknoch.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a tradition of going in Radnysher into the 1st Battalion of the Herefordshire</div><div id="00:01:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Regiment as well.</div><div id="00:01:25.760" class="transcript_line"> In fact the 1st Battalion of the Herefordshire Regiment was called something like the Radner</div><div id="00:01:29.280" class="transcript_line"> and Herefordshire Regiment or something like that.</div><div id="00:01:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Therefore really this explains the reason why we&#039;re in the Montgomery Yeomanry here</div><div id="00:01:39.920" class="transcript_line"> and not the Radner Yeomanry.</div><div id="00:01:44.800" class="transcript_line"> This regiment had served in the Boer War and throughout the 19th century as its various</div><div id="00:01:49.160" class="transcript_line"> incarnations.</div><div id="00:01:51.520" class="transcript_line"> When the British Army went off to the Boer War everybody expected they would do very</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> well because of course they were British soldiers.</div><div id="00:01:58.960" class="transcript_line"> The upshot of this was that they actually had a complete and total kicking.</div><div id="00:02:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Boer commanders absolutely slaughtered them.</div><div id="00:02:05.960" class="transcript_line"> Standards of soldiering were very very very poor, standards of musketry were absolutely</div><div id="00:02:10.600" class="transcript_line"> appalling.</div><div id="00:02:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Now the upshot of this was really two or three things.</div><div id="00:02:14.200" class="transcript_line"> One when they came back Lord Roberts founded the National Rifle Association which popularised</div><div id="00:02:18.920" class="transcript_line"> small boar shooting in this country so that civilians could actually join shooting clubs</div><div id="00:02:25.760" class="transcript_line"> and actually practice their targetry so they could then actually join the army in time</div><div id="00:02:30.080" class="transcript_line"> for war.</div><div id="00:02:31.080" class="transcript_line"> That is why around the country we&#039;ve got hundreds of little small boar rifle clubs</div><div id="00:02:35.160" class="transcript_line"> for example in the bottom of the Houses of Parliament there&#039;s a rifle range, in the various</div><div id="00:02:39.280" class="transcript_line"> railway clubs used to have rifle ranges and particularly around Llandridd as well.</div><div id="00:02:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Several rifle ranges, a small boar and a full boar.</div><div id="00:02:47.240" class="transcript_line"> In 1908 a guy called Lord Haldane reforms the Yeomanry.</div><div id="00:02:51.960" class="transcript_line"> He forms what&#039;s known as the Territorial Force, now known as the Territorial Army.</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> In fact the TA had its 100th anniversary last year.</div><div id="00:03:03.960" class="transcript_line"> These guys would have met at the drill hall in Llandrinded which is now underneath where</div><div id="00:03:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Tesco&#039;s is.</div><div id="00:03:09.320" class="transcript_line"> In fact the drill hall was there for about six months ago.</div><div id="00:03:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Part of the deal with Tesco&#039;s was they built a new one but that drill hall had been there</div><div id="00:03:16.440" class="transcript_line"> since around 1909.</div><div id="00:03:18.800" class="transcript_line"> The Montgomery&#039;s were not the only people that met there, the Hereford and Stavante</div><div id="00:03:21.600" class="transcript_line"> attacks were there and the King&#039;s Shropshire Light Infantry met there as well.</div><div id="00:03:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Start of the war the Montgomery Yeomanry consists of four squadrons.</div><div id="00:03:33.400" class="transcript_line"> A squadron which is up at Llandruthlin, B squadron which is down at Wellspool, that</div><div id="00:03:37.160" class="transcript_line"> is also the headquarters squadron, C squadron up at Newtown and D squadron down at Llandrinded.</div><div id="00:03:45.360" class="transcript_line"> The late Victorians and Wardians, early Georgians were very probable sort of people because</div><div id="00:03:51.120" class="transcript_line"> there was no telly, they went out and did stuff.</div><div id="00:03:53.920" class="transcript_line"> So they went out and went to Perthree evenings and Llandrinded.</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> The lads would do things like join the Territorial Army because of course you had a nice posh</div><div id="00:04:00.800" class="transcript_line"> uniform and indeed the dress uniform of the Yeomanry was actually quite smart.</div><div id="00:04:06.080" class="transcript_line"> If those of you who have seen the Trooping of the Colour had actually seen the Horse</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Guards they actually look a little bit like this with these big hats and plumes off the</div><div id="00:04:13.360" class="transcript_line"> top.</div><div id="00:04:16.880" class="transcript_line"> You also got when you went on the annual summer camp three weeks under canvas and that really</div><div id="00:04:21.360" class="transcript_line"> for some people was about as close as they were going to get to a summer holiday.</div><div id="00:04:24.800" class="transcript_line"> And of course you got your annual bounty as well.</div><div id="00:04:28.320" class="transcript_line"> So good reasons to join and the Comrade ship and most CA formations have a cheap subsidised</div><div id="00:04:35.160" class="transcript_line"> bar so there was probably a bit of that going on as well.</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> The outbreak of war, that is D Squadron on Comishier Yeomanry, that is Llandrinded&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> cavalry.</div><div id="00:04:49.600" class="transcript_line"> That picture is taken as they are formed up on the muster for the start of the First World</div><div id="00:04:56.200" class="transcript_line"> War.</div><div id="00:04:57.200" class="transcript_line"> I can see some frantic pointing going on in the audience because there are two highways</div><div id="00:05:03.480" class="transcript_line"> somewhere in that picture.</div><div id="00:05:06.160" class="transcript_line"> One of them is over here.</div><div id="00:05:13.160" class="transcript_line"> And the other one is somewhere there.</div><div id="00:05:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Those of you who are local may know Geoff Michael, that&#039;s his uncle.</div><div id="00:05:20.160" class="transcript_line"> This chap at the back here has obviously just joined, he&#039;s in a uniform so they&#039;ve stuck</div><div id="00:05:23.160" class="transcript_line"> him right at the back.</div><div id="00:05:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;re not smart enough.</div><div id="00:05:25.160" class="transcript_line"> They are actually, considering they are a territorial force, spectacularly well dressed</div><div id="00:05:32.160" class="transcript_line"> and they are all wearing more or less the same thing.</div><div id="00:05:35.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a standing joke for the rest of us in the old services, the army, they wear what</div><div id="00:05:40.160" class="transcript_line"> they like.</div><div id="00:05:41.160" class="transcript_line"> The number of uniforms and possible combinations you have are huge.</div><div id="00:05:46.160" class="transcript_line"> They are standing on what is now Tesco&#039;s car park.</div><div id="00:05:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Which at the time was the Lanark Common.</div><div id="00:05:52.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the railway station, there&#039;s the police station, down here is the Lanark.</div><div id="00:05:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, as territorial force soldiers, they were, indeed the territorial force was designed</div><div id="00:06:14.160" class="transcript_line"> for home defence, so these guys actually had no obligation to go off and fight the Han</div><div id="00:06:19.160" class="transcript_line"> overseas at all.</div><div id="00:06:21.160" class="transcript_line"> They could have quite nicely sat out the war doing garrison duty somewhere.</div><div id="00:06:26.160" class="transcript_line"> But when asked, okay lads, who wants to come and have a crack at the Han?</div><div id="00:06:32.160" class="transcript_line"> They volunteered to a man.</div><div id="00:06:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Which really is not surprising because of course, you know, if you&#039;re going to stand</div><div id="00:06:40.160" class="transcript_line"> in the Lanark having a fight with two mates and they&#039;ve both volunteered, the peer pressure</div><div id="00:06:45.160" class="transcript_line"> to do so must have been immense.</div><div id="00:06:47.160" class="transcript_line"> You know, people in non-uniform, wandering the streets, used to get white feathered.</div><div id="00:06:54.160" class="transcript_line"> So, this is the start of the war and there&#039;s quite a bit of harrarring and patriotism.</div><div id="00:07:01.160" class="transcript_line"> And they volunteered to a man.</div><div id="00:07:03.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, bearing in mind that these are in fact a cavalry regiment, you will notice in this</div><div id="00:07:11.160" class="transcript_line"> picture a certain absence of one commodity.</div><div id="00:07:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Horses.</div><div id="00:07:16.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I do think it does say on the...</div><div id="00:07:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Something about the, you don&#039;t need to own a horse or something.</div><div id="00:07:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there we are.</div><div id="00:07:38.160" class="transcript_line"> But experience not required.</div><div id="00:07:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, start of the war, the government horse traders went out and started buying just about</div><div id="00:07:44.160" class="transcript_line"> every nag that had a leg on each corner.</div><div id="00:07:48.160" class="transcript_line"> And many a poor young girl, you know, woke up one morning and found out that Dobbin had</div><div id="00:07:53.160" class="transcript_line"> gone to be a soldier.</div><div id="00:07:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Tearfully.</div><div id="00:07:59.160" class="transcript_line"> There was frantic horse buying.</div><div id="00:08:01.160" class="transcript_line"> By the 8th of August, the Montgomery&#039;s are assembled and ready to move.</div><div id="00:08:09.160" class="transcript_line"> Absence of horses, there was also a shortage of binoculars for them to use.</div><div id="00:08:16.160" class="transcript_line"> So, they take out a full page advert in the Breckenham-Radner.</div><div id="00:08:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Ladies and gentlemen, has anyone got any binoculars we could have, please?</div><div id="00:08:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Because yet again, who are the major manufacturers of optical instruments in Europe?</div><div id="00:08:29.160" class="transcript_line"> The Germans.</div><div id="00:08:30.160" class="transcript_line"> The Germans, Carl Zeiss.</div><div id="00:08:32.160" class="transcript_line"> So, people give up their binoculars to the Montgomery&#039;s for them to use.</div><div id="00:08:37.160" class="transcript_line"> They start to move to a war footing.</div><div id="00:08:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, I haven&#039;t got one today, but there are pictures of the squadrons riding through the</div><div id="00:08:45.160" class="transcript_line"> various towns on their way to their muster point.</div><div id="00:08:48.160" class="transcript_line"> They all met up, and it must have looked pretty spectacular.</div><div id="00:08:51.160" class="transcript_line"> The squadrons, the Welsh Bulls squadron had been disbanded and distributed through the</div><div id="00:08:56.160" class="transcript_line"> other squadrons, but they came down from Glenvathlin and Newtown, the North Paris squadrons</div><div id="00:09:00.160" class="transcript_line"> come down, Llandrindod, the D squadron went down via Hay, and they all met up for the</div><div id="00:09:05.160" class="transcript_line"> first night on Hereford Racecourse, because they needed somewhere that could look after</div><div id="00:09:10.160" class="transcript_line"> horses and they had the space to actually, you know, imagine a squadron&#039;s about 120</div><div id="00:09:15.160" class="transcript_line"> guys, 120 guys, 120 horses.</div><div id="00:09:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, a full cavalry regiment, you&#039;re talking 600 men and horses there.</div><div id="00:09:23.160" class="transcript_line"> It must have looked pretty spectacular.</div><div id="00:09:26.160" class="transcript_line"> They start their way over through the Midlands towards East Anglia.</div><div id="00:09:31.160" class="transcript_line"> On the way, D squadron have to stop and send home Bugler Hope, because he&#039;s 14 years old.</div><div id="00:09:39.160" class="transcript_line"> We hadn&#039;t quite got to the point where we&#039;re using 14 year olds to fight.</div><div id="00:09:44.160" class="transcript_line"> It did happen.</div><div id="00:09:45.160" class="transcript_line"> This person killed in the British Army in World War I, Private Condon was 14 years old.</div><div id="00:09:51.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, some 14 and 15 year olds when they went into recruiting offices were told by</div><div id="00:10:03.160" class="transcript_line"> the recruiting sergeant to come back in half an hour when they were 16.</div><div id="00:10:13.160" class="transcript_line"> They end up in a place called Ailsham in Norfolk.</div><div id="00:10:17.160" class="transcript_line"> By this time they&#039;ve acquired their horses.</div><div id="00:10:20.160" class="transcript_line"> As you can see here, we&#039;ve actually got a cavalry line.</div><div id="00:10:24.160" class="transcript_line"> 120 horses, in fact, well, 400 or 500 horses would take a lot of looking after.</div><div id="00:10:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Think of the associated blacksmithery and farrier skills needed to look after 600 horses.</div><div id="00:10:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Think of the amounts of hay and oats you would need to feed that number of horses.</div><div id="00:10:49.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, the first couple of years of the First World War, something like 4 million tonnes of hay</div><div id="00:10:56.160" class="transcript_line"> alone were carried over to the Western Front to feed horses.</div><div id="00:11:00.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a lot of hay.</div><div id="00:11:07.160" class="transcript_line"> What used to happen is the local photographer would rock up and take pictures of the lads.</div><div id="00:11:14.160" class="transcript_line"> They would then take the photos and convert them into postcards which you could then send to your rallies.</div><div id="00:11:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen that one before, Megan?</div><div id="00:11:24.160" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:11:29.160" class="transcript_line"> There are two highways in this picture as well.</div><div id="00:11:33.160" class="transcript_line"> D Squadron, Tom Highway section.</div><div id="00:11:35.160" class="transcript_line"> By this time he&#039;s a corporal, or rather a lance sergeant because this is a cavalry regiment.</div><div id="00:11:41.160" class="transcript_line"> This guy here, I don&#039;t know who he is, he may well be Private Hutt, more about him and on.</div><div id="00:11:48.160" class="transcript_line"> As you can see they&#039;re wearing the cap badge there of the Montgomery,</div><div id="00:11:52.160" class="transcript_line"> the Yeomanry with the motto, which is a Welsh word I can&#039;t pronounce, but it means invincible.</div><div id="00:12:00.160" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re actually staying in the grounds of Blickling Hall, which is in Norfolk.</div><div id="00:12:04.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a National Trust property now, birthplace of Anne Boleyn, if you ever go out that way.</div><div id="00:12:11.160" class="transcript_line"> You can go there and have a look at that.</div><div id="00:12:12.160" class="transcript_line"> The officers of course stayed in the big house.</div><div id="00:12:15.160" class="transcript_line"> The seniors were put into local pubs.</div><div id="00:12:17.160" class="transcript_line"> The junior ranks of course stayed under tents.</div><div id="00:12:23.160" class="transcript_line"> You can see them here doing what they do, which is training, fooling around, joking.</div><div id="00:12:30.160" class="transcript_line"> This chap here, I think he&#039;s one of the Edwards brothers of Landerindard.</div><div id="00:12:37.160" class="transcript_line"> This one here is Church Parade 1914.</div><div id="00:12:41.160" class="transcript_line"> As you can see this time they&#039;re fully suited and ready to go, big band of liars of ammunition.</div><div id="00:12:47.160" class="transcript_line"> All nice and smart, ready to go off and fight.</div><div id="00:12:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, we&#039;ve got these territorial regiments.</div><div id="00:13:00.160" class="transcript_line"> Large numbers of them, but they are still effectively gentlemen amateurs.</div><div id="00:13:05.160" class="transcript_line"> One night a week in an annual camp.</div><div id="00:13:07.160" class="transcript_line"> They are not professional soldiers, so they&#039;re not as good effectively as the old contemporaries of the BEF.</div><div id="00:13:15.160" class="transcript_line"> The guy who stopped the Germans at Mons, the guy who could fire ten shots out of a Lee-Metford rifle at a figure 11 target at 600 yards in a minute.</div><div id="00:13:24.160" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t as good.</div><div id="00:13:26.160" class="transcript_line"> We did however have professional forces in places like India, Australia, New Zealand.</div><div id="00:13:33.160" class="transcript_line"> So the idea of the exercise is then, why don&#039;t we bring in all these forces from our dominions and Commonwealth, the Indians, the Anzacs, over to the Western Front.</div><div id="00:13:43.160" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ll backfill what they&#039;re doing, garrison duties, with our territorial force.</div><div id="00:13:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s not quite as hot at the moment.</div><div id="00:13:52.160" class="transcript_line"> So what they did was they took the Montgomery&#039;s and they sent them to Egypt.</div><div id="00:13:58.160" class="transcript_line"> They spent on the Norfolk coast about 12 months looking east from Kroma.</div><div id="00:14:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Waiting for something to happen.</div><div id="00:14:09.160" class="transcript_line"> They were doing basically defensive duty on the Norfolk coast.</div><div id="00:14:12.160" class="transcript_line"> They then get sent to Egypt and they sail out of Plymouth in 1916 in a converted Royal Mail steam packet called the HMT Arcadian.</div><div id="00:14:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Now as they are sailing down through the Mediterranean, the Arcadian sails through the wreckage of two other transport ships that have been torpedoed.</div><div id="00:14:37.160" class="transcript_line"> So the U-boats are out there, sinking everything left, right and Chelsea.</div><div id="00:14:41.160" class="transcript_line"> The Arcadian makes it through.</div><div id="00:14:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Now those of you who know your World War I history would remember these things about these Pals battalions.</div><div id="00:14:47.160" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re based like at Akrington and Bradford.</div><div id="00:14:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Where they recruited from a single town.</div><div id="00:14:52.160" class="transcript_line"> And they went over the top of the first day of the Somme, shot to a man.</div><div id="00:14:57.160" class="transcript_line"> And that actually had huge effects on the little locations and towns they came from.</div><div id="00:15:02.160" class="transcript_line"> Because they lost every single man in the town.</div><div id="00:15:04.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite possible then that the Arcadian might have been sunk in the Med with 120 of Landrinder&#039;s lads in it.</div><div id="00:15:11.160" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ve all gone down in a one-er.</div><div id="00:15:13.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact the Arcadian was sunk later on in the war off Greece.</div><div id="00:15:17.160" class="transcript_line"> The loss of life was not great because as she was sunk they were practicing lifeboat drills.</div><div id="00:15:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Coincidentally.</div><div id="00:15:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Coincidentally.</div><div id="00:15:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was very, very lucky.</div><div id="00:15:34.160" class="transcript_line"> They come into the Egyptian port of Alexandria.</div><div id="00:15:38.160" class="transcript_line"> Where I&#039;ve been. Absolute hellhole.</div><div id="00:15:44.160" class="transcript_line"> And they end up sat in the desert doing garrison duty protecting the Suez Canal.</div><div id="00:15:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, Suez Canal is one of the five great naval choke points of the world.</div><div id="00:15:55.160" class="transcript_line"> If you control the Suez Canal, you&#039;re in.</div><div id="00:15:59.160" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise your ships have to go all the way down, around the Cape.</div><div id="00:16:04.160" class="transcript_line"> All the way around back the other side.</div><div id="00:16:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Which adds 9,000 miles to your journey.</div><div id="00:16:08.160" class="transcript_line"> So, realising of course the importance of this.</div><div id="00:16:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Over here we&#039;ve got the Silo Peninsula.</div><div id="00:16:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Up here we&#039;ve got Palestine and Syria.</div><div id="00:16:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Up here we&#039;ve got the Ottoman Turks.</div><div id="00:16:22.160" class="transcript_line"> They are in the war with the Germans.</div><div id="00:16:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Not a hugely professional army.</div><div id="00:16:26.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact they&#039;ve got lots of German military advisors on their staff.</div><div id="00:16:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Now the Germans have of course realised that our resupply is coming from the Suez Canal.</div><div id="00:16:35.160" class="transcript_line"> So they say to the Turks, would you mind awfully going down and becoming a complete pain on the Suez Canal.</div><div id="00:16:42.160" class="transcript_line"> This is what they do.</div><div id="00:16:43.160" class="transcript_line"> So the Ottomans start hassling the Suez Canal across Sinai in early 1915.</div><div id="00:16:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, this area here is one enormous desert.</div><div id="00:16:59.160" class="transcript_line"> So if you&#039;re going to make your way across there,</div><div id="00:17:01.160" class="transcript_line"> maybe you&#039;re going to carry all your guns and ammunition,</div><div id="00:17:03.160" class="transcript_line"> but you&#039;ve got to carry every single bit of water you&#039;re going to drink as well.</div><div id="00:17:06.160" class="transcript_line"> So, yet again as a military professional,</div><div id="00:17:08.160" class="transcript_line"> we often say that amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics.</div><div id="00:17:11.160" class="transcript_line"> Because that is what wars tend to be fought on.</div><div id="00:17:18.160" class="transcript_line"> The Germans working with them were organisational geniuses.</div><div id="00:17:22.160" class="transcript_line"> And they developed supply lines,</div><div id="00:17:24.160" class="transcript_line"> centred largely on railways down through Sinai that enabled them to carry water and supplies.</div><div id="00:17:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Particularly lots of camels down there to actually do this.</div><div id="00:17:35.160" class="transcript_line"> The Ottoman attacks are largely unsuccessful.</div><div id="00:17:37.160" class="transcript_line"> They then ignore Suez for about a year because they&#039;ve got other things going on.</div><div id="00:17:42.160" class="transcript_line"> For example, Gallipoli.</div><div id="00:17:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, a couple of details quite important to this.</div><div id="00:17:49.160" class="transcript_line"> On the left hand side there we&#039;ve got T. Lawrence.</div><div id="00:17:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Lawrence of Arabia.</div><div id="00:17:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Widely thought to be one of the greatest living Englishmen of the 20th century,</div><div id="00:17:57.160" class="transcript_line"> when in fact he was Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Born in Traumatic.</div><div id="00:18:04.160" class="transcript_line"> The guy on the right is General Allenby.</div><div id="00:18:07.160" class="transcript_line"> More about him and I&#039;ll play it in the film Lawrence of Arabia by Jack Hawkins,</div><div id="00:18:10.160" class="transcript_line"> those of you who remember the film.</div><div id="00:18:19.160" class="transcript_line"> 1916, the Turks come down and have another go.</div><div id="00:18:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, there are only three ways you can get through the Sinai.</div><div id="00:18:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Bottom route, middle route, top route.</div><div id="00:18:27.160" class="transcript_line"> So they come down the top route and have another go and they get defeated at a place called Romani.</div><div id="00:18:31.160" class="transcript_line"> By this day, as the British high command have had enough,</div><div id="00:18:35.160" class="transcript_line"> have been hassled by the Turks.</div><div id="00:18:38.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, you ask any interest soldier what their role is in life.</div><div id="00:18:43.160" class="transcript_line"> It is advance to the enemy, kill them, dominate the ground.</div><div id="00:18:47.160" class="transcript_line"> So, why not, instead of just sat here and letting these enemy come to us,</div><div id="00:18:51.160" class="transcript_line"> why don&#039;t we go out into the Sinai and kick it up a bit.</div><div id="00:18:54.160" class="transcript_line"> So what they did was they sent the Australians out</div><div id="00:18:57.160" class="transcript_line"> to smash up all the oasis and water storage facilities</div><div id="00:19:01.160" class="transcript_line"> that the Ottomans had got in the Sinai.</div><div id="00:19:04.160" class="transcript_line"> So, yet again, they reduced this to one enormous parched piece of land.</div><div id="00:19:11.160" class="transcript_line"> And from that point on, you&#039;re actually quite safe</div><div id="00:19:14.160" class="transcript_line"> because the threat really from the Ottoman Turks has reduced.</div><div id="00:19:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, really, by this time, the offensive age of the horse in war is over.</div><div id="00:19:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Cavalry, really, has had it today.</div><div id="00:19:31.160" class="transcript_line"> So, unfortunately, the Montgomery&#039;s this time get their horses taken off them</div><div id="00:19:36.160" class="transcript_line"> and told they&#039;re going to be remastered as infantry.</div><div id="00:19:41.160" class="transcript_line"> So they are remastered into the 25th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers</div><div id="00:19:45.160" class="transcript_line"> along with an organization called the Welsh Horse,</div><div id="00:19:48.160" class="transcript_line"> which was another Yeomanry regiment that somebody founded in the First World War.</div><div id="00:19:54.160" class="transcript_line"> So all the Yeomanry regiments, and there were lots of them,</div><div id="00:19:57.160" class="transcript_line"> Flintshire, Denbighshire, Gloucester, Leicester, Yeomanry,</div><div id="00:20:01.160" class="transcript_line"> all had their horses taken away.</div><div id="00:20:03.160" class="transcript_line"> They were formed into one big fighting division, the 74th Division.</div><div id="00:20:08.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, how pleased do you think they were to have their horses taken off them?</div><div id="00:20:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Not at all, absolutely not.</div><div id="00:20:15.160" class="transcript_line"> So they took as their divisional badge a broken spur.</div><div id="00:20:20.160" class="transcript_line"> To signify, they had once been horsemen,</div><div id="00:20:23.160" class="transcript_line"> and the horses were still at the back of their mind.</div><div id="00:20:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, a little bit of all-back training here for you.</div><div id="00:20:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Allenby&#039;s army consisted of two corps, 21 and 20.</div><div id="00:20:36.160" class="transcript_line"> 20 Corps was under Lieutenant General Chetwood.</div><div id="00:20:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Now 74th Div, the Yeomanry Div, sat under Chetwood in his all-back.</div><div id="00:20:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Now that division, yet again, is broken up into a number of brigades.</div><div id="00:20:50.160" class="transcript_line"> 74th Division run by Major General Gurdwood.</div><div id="00:20:53.160" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got 231, 230 and 229 Brigade.</div><div id="00:21:00.160" class="transcript_line"> The 231 Brigade is consisting at that time of four regiments.</div><div id="00:21:07.160" class="transcript_line"> 25 RWF, who are our guys, and three other regiments as well.</div><div id="00:21:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Within 25 RWF, we&#039;ve got four companies, A, B, C and D.</div><div id="00:21:17.160" class="transcript_line"> The Montgomery&#039;s were smashed up and put into A and B company.</div><div id="00:21:20.160" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh horse went and formed C and D company.</div><div id="00:21:23.160" class="transcript_line"> So from now on, we&#039;re not really talking about the Montgomery&#039;s,</div><div id="00:21:26.160" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re talking about 25 RWF.</div><div id="00:21:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Still our guys from Landerunded.</div><div id="00:21:31.160" class="transcript_line"> There they are.</div><div id="00:21:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, another Welshman is going to get his two pence worth in.</div><div id="00:21:39.160" class="transcript_line"> 1917, the campaign in Sinai has been going pretty well.</div><div id="00:21:45.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, it&#039;s about the only thing in the entire war that&#039;s going well.</div><div id="00:21:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Now Lloyd George, who&#039;s a very astute political man, sees this.</div><div id="00:21:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course, 1917, you&#039;ve got the Third Battle of Eek, Pashtun Dale,</div><div id="00:21:59.160" class="transcript_line"> complete and total disaster.</div><div id="00:22:01.160" class="transcript_line"> He needs good news.</div><div id="00:22:03.160" class="transcript_line"> There are people in the government, people in the country who are saying,</div><div id="00:22:06.160" class="transcript_line"> well, it&#039;s about time we sued for peace with the Kaiser, we&#039;ve had enough of this.</div><div id="00:22:10.160" class="transcript_line"> He needs good news.</div><div id="00:22:12.160" class="transcript_line"> So he says to the high command in the Middle East,</div><div id="00:22:15.160" class="transcript_line"> would you mind terribly invading Palestine for me?</div><div id="00:22:20.160" class="transcript_line"> All the time we&#039;ve got this happening,</div><div id="00:22:26.160" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got Lawrence of Arabia,</div><div id="00:22:29.160" class="transcript_line"> who is with his Arabs leading the Arab revolt.</div><div id="00:22:33.160" class="transcript_line"> They are basically running up and down on the eastern flank,</div><div id="00:22:37.160" class="transcript_line"> blowing up railways, destroying water.</div><div id="00:22:40.160" class="transcript_line"> And if you remember from the film, they do the attack on Aqaba,</div><div id="00:22:43.160" class="transcript_line"> which is the port on the Red Sea that the Ottomans hold.</div><div id="00:22:46.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s that very famous scene where he claims to have walked all the way through the desert in 39 hours or whatever it was.</div><div id="00:22:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Completely rubbish.</div><div id="00:22:55.160" class="transcript_line"> But he took his Arabs and they capture Aqaba.</div><div id="00:22:59.160" class="transcript_line"> So, would you mind awfully going off and invading Palestine?</div><div id="00:23:03.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, in charge of the army at this time is a guy called General Murray.</div><div id="00:23:07.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, of course, every single bomb, bullet, gallon of water you need to take into battle has got to be carried.</div><div id="00:23:13.160" class="transcript_line"> So what they actually do is they construct a railway back into Sinai and run a water line alongside it.</div><div id="00:23:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Huge amounts of labour involved in doing this.</div><div id="00:23:23.160" class="transcript_line"> What they do is they get the people in the army to come and get the people in the army.</div><div id="00:23:28.160" class="transcript_line"> What they do is they get the Egyptian Labour Corps, these local Egyptian levies,</div><div id="00:23:32.160" class="transcript_line"> so they&#039;re in the heat with a shovel, digging a railway.</div><div id="00:23:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And the effort involved in this is absolutely phenomenal.</div><div id="00:23:39.160" class="transcript_line"> They run this railway up the coast and in 1917 there&#039;s a battle at a place called Ra&#039;far where they decidedly defeat the Ottomans.</div><div id="00:23:51.160" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s them finished in Sinai.</div><div id="00:23:53.160" class="transcript_line"> However, we now then need to move into Palestine.</div><div id="00:24:03.160" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got the next big sort of place to come to is Gaza.</div><div id="00:24:08.160" class="transcript_line"> Yet again, still important in Israeli history today.</div><div id="00:24:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Notice, none of this really, all this fighting is taking with about 20, 30 miles of the coast.</div><div id="00:24:21.160" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re hugging the coast because out here an enormous expanse of nothingness, heat dust flies.</div><div id="00:24:32.160" class="transcript_line"> How much water does a horse drink?</div><div id="00:24:37.160" class="transcript_line"> A horse drinks about as much as 30 blokes do.</div><div id="00:24:42.160" class="transcript_line"> So a cavalry regiment of 600 horses will drink as much water as 30,000 men.</div><div id="00:24:51.160" class="transcript_line"> The first attack is disastrous.</div><div id="00:25:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Murray attacks Gaza.</div><div id="00:25:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Now there is a large chain of defences stretching inland from Gaza.</div><div id="00:25:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Murray tries the tactic of banging his head against it.</div><div id="00:25:18.160" class="transcript_line"> The first attack is disastrous.</div><div id="00:25:24.160" class="transcript_line"> The second battle of Gaza in April 1917 is similarly disastrous.</div><div id="00:25:27.160" class="transcript_line"> There were 6,000 casualties.</div><div id="00:25:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Now our guys from Landarin at this point are not engaged because for the second battle of Gaza, 74 Div are held to the back as a reserve.</div><div id="00:25:37.160" class="transcript_line"> So casualties therefore do not happen.</div><div id="00:25:39.160" class="transcript_line"> This is the Turkish defensive line, one of the Turkish defensive lines on Gaza.</div><div id="00:25:43.160" class="transcript_line"> You can see it&#039;s interlocking machine guns.</div><div id="00:25:45.160" class="transcript_line"> Very, very low rolling ground.</div><div id="00:25:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Very, very large fields of view.</div><div id="00:25:49.160" class="transcript_line"> If you go anywhere near those you&#039;re going to get absolutely and totally taken out.</div><div id="00:25:56.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so disastrous that Murray is replaced by the General Officer Commanding by Allenby.</div><div id="00:26:05.160" class="transcript_line"> So we end up at a place called Beersheba.</div><div id="00:26:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Now the Montgomery&#039;s men of Landarin would have been God fearing men.</div><div id="00:26:17.160" class="transcript_line"> And as they went through these towns they would have seen names they would have seen in their Bibles on a Sunday morning in Sunday school.</div><div id="00:26:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Gaza. It was Samson wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Eilis and Gaza.</div><div id="00:26:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Beersheba.</div><div id="00:26:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Mentioned from the book of Genesis onwards.</div><div id="00:26:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Beersheba is wells. Beersheba is water.</div><div id="00:26:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay, now that&#039;s a very busy map. That&#039;s because it&#039;s a professional military one.</div><div id="00:26:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Bear with me.</div><div id="00:26:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Here is the defensive line across Gaza and Beersheba.</div><div id="00:26:55.160" class="transcript_line"> Now the Turks decide to stop it here and leave a gap between Beersheba and the Gaza defensive line.</div><div id="00:27:03.160" class="transcript_line"> They rationalise that in order to take 50,000 men and horses that far inland they&#039;re just all going to die first in the desert.</div><div id="00:27:14.160" class="transcript_line"> So they don&#039;t need to actually fortify that because the desert will do the rest.</div><div id="00:27:22.160" class="transcript_line"> However, what they actually do is they bring a branch of the railway line across here.</div><div id="00:27:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Very, very, very quietly. If it&#039;s possible to build a railway quietly.</div><div id="00:27:33.160" class="transcript_line"> They also do quite a large amount of deception tactics.</div><div id="00:27:37.160" class="transcript_line"> They get the Royal Navy some battleships off Gaza to shell Gaza.</div><div id="00:27:42.160" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve also got a very small force outside Gaza running up and down, waving their arms and pretending to be much bigger than they are.</div><div id="00:27:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Meanwhile, Al-Anbi rocks up to Beersheba with 40,000 men who can be supplied by this railway.</div><div id="00:28:00.160" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s going to be a very close run thing.</div><div id="00:28:07.160" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I&#039;ll come back to that one in a minute.</div><div id="00:28:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, somebody, when I was doing this talk last week, somebody from Landrunnerd, whose grandfather had been out there,</div><div id="00:28:16.160" class="transcript_line"> and she said to me, can you tell me, my grandfather said that everywhere he fought, he was always alongside Australians.</div><div id="00:28:25.160" class="transcript_line"> And she was absolutely right because the Montgomery&#039;s, when they fought in the Holy Land and when they fought in France,</div><div id="00:28:33.160" class="transcript_line"> were always alongside Australian formations and fought alongside them.</div><div id="00:28:39.160" class="transcript_line"> The Australians had an organization called the Australian Light Horse.</div><div id="00:28:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, these are not cavalry.</div><div id="00:28:46.160" class="transcript_line"> In Montgomery cavalry, they have a huge horse with a great big sword.</div><div id="00:28:50.160" class="transcript_line"> The idea is you wander around, you just wave your saber across the top of somebody&#039;s head and take it off quite nicely. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:28:56.160" class="transcript_line"> The Australian Light Horse rode into battle. They&#039;ve got a rifle. They ride in sticks of four.</div><div id="00:29:02.160" class="transcript_line"> They ride so far up to the battle that they all dismount off their little Brumby pack horses.</div><div id="00:29:08.160" class="transcript_line"> One of the guys takes the bridles of the four horses, leads them to the rear.</div><div id="00:29:14.160" class="transcript_line"> The other three then advance into battle. They fight their battle. If anyone were left, they get back on their horses and ride out.</div><div id="00:29:20.160" class="transcript_line"> This is all very well, except while you&#039;re getting off and dismounting, people can actually drop artillery shells on top of you.</div><div id="00:29:26.160" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re absolutely sitting target. And they were actually the first, the Australian Light Horse in the first two battles were actually used very, very, very poorly.</div><div id="00:29:33.160" class="transcript_line"> In Beersheba, on the 31st of October 1917, Allenby fights all day. They don&#039;t manage to smash Beersheba.</div><div id="00:29:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, it&#039;s getting a bit dodgy because you&#039;ve got 40 to 50,000 people and horses there. The horses haven&#039;t had any water for three days.</div><div id="00:29:51.160" class="transcript_line"> The men haven&#039;t had any water now approaching. We need to resupply for approaching a day.</div><div id="00:29:55.160" class="transcript_line"> Things are starting to get a bit critical. If they don&#039;t do something soon, they will lose this battle.</div><div id="00:30:02.160" class="transcript_line"> At about half past six, on the 31st of October, the Australian commander in charge of the Light Horse decides to send in, as a last throw of the dice, a brigade of the Light Horse.</div><div id="00:30:16.160" class="transcript_line"> One of his officers said to him, well, I tell you what, why don&#039;t we just have a charge at it?</div><div id="00:30:21.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, we don&#039;t normally do that. Well, let&#039;s have a go with a charge.</div><div id="00:30:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Beersheba has got 17 wells. It&#039;s the water. You&#039;ve got Beersheba, you&#039;re safe.</div><div id="00:30:33.160" class="transcript_line"> What happened, I&#039;ll show you a little film now, I looked like this.</div><div id="00:30:50.160" class="transcript_line"> Was it a major Australian film?</div><div id="00:30:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Australian film?</div><div id="00:30:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Yep, that&#039;s called The Light Horseman.</div><div id="00:30:56.160" class="transcript_line"> When would that have been made?</div><div id="00:30:58.160" class="transcript_line"> That was made in 1987.</div><div id="00:31:00.160" class="transcript_line"> 1987?</div><div id="00:31:02.160" class="transcript_line"> You can get it on Amazon. Just make sure you get the right region DVD.</div><div id="00:31:06.160" class="transcript_line"> My new favourite film, The Light Horseman.</div><div id="00:31:09.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, basically they didn&#039;t expect there was a charge, because that&#039;s not what Light Horseman did.</div><div id="00:31:15.160" class="transcript_line"> They did, they weren&#039;t cabinmen, they didn&#039;t have swords, so they took their bait that sat on charge.</div><div id="00:31:19.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, the Turks couldn&#039;t just depress the sights on their weapons fast enough to shoot them,</div><div id="00:31:25.160" class="transcript_line"> so they were actually shooting over the top of them constantly.</div><div id="00:31:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Obviously dramatised, there were no machine guns, because British counter-battery artillery had taken it out by then.</div><div id="00:31:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Also, the casualties there exaggerated a bit, that was a brigade-sized attack,</div><div id="00:31:39.160" class="transcript_line"> probably the best part of 2,000 men and horses, they suffered 31 dead.</div><div id="00:31:42.160" class="transcript_line"> That is probably the only successful attack in modern war for using horse formations.</div><div id="00:31:49.160" class="transcript_line"> It was astounding, they captured 15 of the 17 wells.</div><div id="00:31:53.160" class="transcript_line"> They then got the engineers in to repair the broken ones,</div><div id="00:31:57.160" class="transcript_line"> and in about a week they&#039;d got a daily capacity for about 350,000 gallons of water.</div><div id="00:32:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, that of course meant that the yeomanry divisions, including our guys at Landrindud,</div><div id="00:32:09.160" class="transcript_line"> would then supply, get behind the defensive wall, and then do what we in the military call rolling up a flank.</div><div id="00:32:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Basically make it where a long and undefended position.</div><div id="00:32:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Lloyd George said to Allenby, I want you in Jerusalem by Christmas, that is your goal.</div><div id="00:32:33.160" class="transcript_line"> And that indeed is what Allenby managed to accomplish.</div><div id="00:32:36.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, he went on after that into Syria and captured Damascus as well.</div><div id="00:32:45.160" class="transcript_line"> Our guys are not involved in that, because by this stage it is mid-1918.</div><div id="00:32:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Things are going badly on the Western Front again.</div><div id="00:32:57.160" class="transcript_line"> The Kaiser&#039;s last throw of the dice, the Kaiser&#039;s last, the Kaiser&#039;s offensive, also known as Operation Michael,</div><div id="00:33:02.160" class="transcript_line"> smashed through Allied formations and actually pushed them back to more or less where they&#039;d started at the start of the war.</div><div id="00:33:10.160" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, the last three years they&#039;d been basically doing that on the Western Front.</div><div id="00:33:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Millions of lives lost, as somebody once said, to move General Hague&#039;s drinks cabinet three miles closer to Berlin.</div><div id="00:33:25.160" class="transcript_line"> The upshot of this is Allenby losing the battle against the West.</div><div id="00:33:30.160" class="transcript_line"> The upshot of this is Allenby loses 60 infantry battalions to go back to France to fight the Kaiser.</div><div id="00:33:39.160" class="transcript_line"> So, 25 RWF, ex-Montgomerys, sail back through the torpedo-infested Mediterranean on a P&amp;O packet called the SS Malwa.</div><div id="00:33:52.160" class="transcript_line"> They come into Marseille, they sit behind the lines for a while,</div><div id="00:33:55.160" class="transcript_line"> they then find themselves fighting the battles of the last hundred days of the war on the Hindenburg Line, a place called Epochie.</div><div id="00:34:04.160" class="transcript_line"> September 1918, they go into battle at Epochie, they suffer 65 casualties.</div><div id="00:34:10.160" class="transcript_line"> During that action, Sergeant Waring, Military Medal, he was from Montgomery, he was from just outside Welshpool, wins the Victoria Cross.</div><div id="00:34:18.160" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s killed, it&#039;s posthumous, he&#039;s killed in the trenches as well.</div><div id="00:34:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Incidentally, attached to 25 RWF at this point is this chap on the right-hand side.</div><div id="00:34:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Anybody recognise him?</div><div id="00:34:32.160" class="transcript_line"> It is the war poet Siegfried Sassoon.</div><div id="00:34:35.160" class="transcript_line"> He started out in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, he&#039;d been so horrified by what he&#039;d seen at places like Mermetz Wood,</div><div id="00:34:44.160" class="transcript_line"> he took his military cross and threw it in the Mersey and refused to go back and fight.</div><div id="00:34:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Now he was an influential man, he was of the upper class, he was an author and poet.</div><div id="00:34:53.160" class="transcript_line"> He wrote a very, very long letter to the Times saying, I&#039;m not fighting anymore.</div><div id="00:34:58.160" class="transcript_line"> They sent him to a psychiatric hospital, Craig Lockhart, in Scotland, and attempted to prove he was mad,</div><div id="00:35:04.160" class="transcript_line"> because of course he was actually having prejudicial effect on the conduct of the war.</div><div id="00:35:09.160" class="transcript_line"> He eventually agreed to go back and fight and was posted in Palestine during the last days of that campaign into 25 RWF,</div><div id="00:35:15.160" class="transcript_line"> and therefore ended up in the trenches with our guys from Landerillen.</div><div id="00:35:19.160" class="transcript_line"> However, he was there about a week before he was shot in the head, allegedly by a friendly fire incident.</div><div id="00:35:26.160" class="transcript_line"> So he wasn&#039;t there long before he was cast back out again.</div><div id="00:35:32.160" class="transcript_line"> He is noted in the regimental history.</div><div id="00:35:36.160" class="transcript_line"> The Hindenburg line, in front of it, had some high ground.</div><div id="00:35:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, the idea of the exercise with this assault was to actually take the high ground as a prelude to actually advancing onto the Hindenburg line.</div><div id="00:35:51.160" class="transcript_line"> They were actually advancing onto stuff which until recently had been British fortifications,</div><div id="00:35:55.160" class="transcript_line"> because the Germans had just pushed them back.</div><div id="00:35:58.160" class="transcript_line"> 25 RWF, on the flank of the Austrian army, was a very large group of people,</div><div id="00:36:03.160" class="transcript_line"> 25 RWF, on the flank of the Australian II Corps, ended up assaulting something called the quadrilateral, which was a defensive position.</div><div id="00:36:12.160" class="transcript_line"> By the 25th of September, 7 officers and 32 men killed, 300 had been wounded, largely by judicious use of gas.</div><div id="00:36:24.160" class="transcript_line"> By this stage, the battalion actually ceases to exist as a fighting formation and is taken out of the line.</div><div id="00:36:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, we&#039;re bordering on the end of the war here. November 11th sounds off and we get peace in the armistice.</div><div id="00:36:39.160" class="transcript_line"> The regiment comes back into this country to Welshpool.</div><div id="00:36:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, at this stage we&#039;ve got a standing army of several million men that we do not need and no money.</div><div id="00:36:50.160" class="transcript_line"> We do not need all these regiments, so large quantities of them are disbanded.</div><div id="00:36:55.160" class="transcript_line"> In fact, all the ex-Yomunary regiments, with the exception of the 12th most senior, are disbanded.</div><div id="00:36:59.160" class="transcript_line"> So, 25 RWF and hence the Montgomery Yomunary cease to exist.</div><div id="00:37:05.160" class="transcript_line"> One last parade is held in Welshpool in 1920 and the Giedons, which are the squadron flags, if you like, along with the battalion pennant, are laid up in St. Mary&#039;s Church in Welshpool.</div><div id="00:37:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Where they still are, if you want to go and have a look at them.</div><div id="00:37:22.160" class="transcript_line"> As regimental colours are, they are left there, they are not maintained and cleaned.</div><div id="00:37:27.160" class="transcript_line"> The idea being that over time they fail away rather like old soldiers do.</div><div id="00:37:31.160" class="transcript_line"> This is a picture of Bathsheba Commonwealth graveyard. It&#039;s about 70 miles south of Jerusalem.</div><div id="00:37:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Immaculately maintained, as they inevitably are.</div><div id="00:37:45.160" class="transcript_line"> In this graveyard there are two guys from Landerinden.</div><div id="00:37:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Corporal Hutt, who we saw earlier as Private Hutt, killed on the 31st of October the day that charge happened.</div><div id="00:38:04.160" class="transcript_line"> Edward Daines Hutt, he came from Chatsworth Villas down on Waterloo Road, which is not far from the crossing chip shop there.</div><div id="00:38:12.160" class="transcript_line"> His mother lost two sons in the war. The other Daines Hutt is also commemorated on the war memorial.</div><div id="00:38:20.160" class="transcript_line"> There was another chap in there, Private Smith, who was the only Smith, spookily enough, on the war memorial.</div><div id="00:38:27.160" class="transcript_line"> He was from Lanoilly over the top of the gulf course. He was also killed on the 31st of October as well.</div><div id="00:38:32.160" class="transcript_line"> So there are two guys from Landerinden, I think they&#039;re very good, a very long way from home, I think you&#039;ll agree.</div><div id="00:38:37.160" class="transcript_line"> But that, ladies and gentlemen, is it. That shows the path of the Montgomery&#039;s from Landerinden through Norfolk out to Egypt, up through the Holy Land, then back through France.</div><div id="00:39:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, the chap I had, the relative I had, whose daughter-in-law is in the audience today, arrived back in Landerinden, gassed and shell-shocked.</div><div id="00:39:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, had a military pension, but of course that was not enough really to live on.</div><div id="00:39:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Now, these days, if you had that kind of injury, the Help for Heroes will look after you a bit, and you could probably scrape along on what you could get.</div><div id="00:39:26.160" class="transcript_line"> These were different times. He actually went back to work in a coal mine, which is probably the most rough-tie-tough-tie-nasty occupation you could think of, or really to do in those times.</div><div id="00:39:37.160" class="transcript_line"> This shows really the type of desperation that people had in the interwar years. It was certainly not a land fit for heroes they came back to.</div><div id="00:39:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for listening. It&#039;s been an absolute pleasure. Hope you&#039;ve enjoyed it. And we will see you next year.</div></div></p>
