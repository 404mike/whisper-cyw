    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> An accident. It was early evening and we were back at the village house that had been kindly</div><div id="00:00:06.800" class="transcript_line"> loaned to us by the architect. I&#039;d taken something upstairs, washing I think, to rinse</div><div id="00:00:12.680" class="transcript_line"> on the terrace and hang out. Coming back down the stone staircase, I guessed with bare feet,</div><div id="00:00:19.320" class="transcript_line"> I found myself losing my footing. I arrived at the foot of the stairs on my back. The</div><div id="00:00:24.600" class="transcript_line"> next thing I heard was, can you hear me? And being shaken. Opening my eyes is like a scene</div><div id="00:00:30.480" class="transcript_line"> from a comic. As I moved my head around I was seeing stars and my right leg and bum</div><div id="00:00:36.280" class="transcript_line"> hurt like hell. I&#039;d been unconscious for no more than 20 or 30 seconds but this seemed</div><div id="00:00:42.160" class="transcript_line"> like a lifetime to Stephanie who was now reluctant to try and haul me to my feet or at least</div><div id="00:00:47.920" class="transcript_line"> to my knees. With instructions not to move she ran round the corner to her neighbour&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:52.800" class="transcript_line"> house. I wasn&#039;t sure I could. She soon arrived back with Matt, her neighbour and his mum</div><div id="00:00:59.680" class="transcript_line"> and I was slowly raised to a seating position but I was still seeing stars. Cautiously I</div><div id="00:01:05.480" class="transcript_line"> answered questions. Did I feel sick? Could I focus my eyes? Could I rotate my head? Move</div><div id="00:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> my leg? Wiggle my toes? All seemed well but a large bump was rising on my head and the</div><div id="00:01:18.320" class="transcript_line"> stars at last went away. Nothing seemed to be broken and the offer of a trip to hospital</div><div id="00:01:25.040" class="transcript_line"> in the port was declined. An early night, a long sleep and a review of the position</div><div id="00:01:29.960" class="transcript_line"> next morning was the plan. After a restless night that was mostly caused by my aching</div><div id="00:01:35.320" class="transcript_line"> leg we decided a hospital visit would be a sensible precaution. My leg was more painful</div><div id="00:01:41.480" class="transcript_line"> than my head with the bump having shrunk away. I hobbled into the general hospital reception</div><div id="00:01:47.560" class="transcript_line"> where we were directed to a general waiting area. After a short time we realised there</div><div id="00:01:52.840" class="transcript_line"> was an appointment system in operation and fearing we could be there for several hours</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> waiting our turn I suggested ringing Manos for advice. We adjourned to a cafe opposite</div><div id="00:02:03.800" class="transcript_line"> and made the call. His concern was immediate. Drive Jeff over here straight away I will</div><div id="00:02:09.600" class="transcript_line"> call my doctor and get him to see you as soon as possible. It sounded a good offer and within</div><div id="00:02:15.320" class="transcript_line"> the hour after a nice frappe at the office we were in the doctor&#039;s waiting room. After</div><div id="00:02:22.200" class="transcript_line"> a short wait we were called in. Hello I&#039;m George and Manos has told me about the incident.</div><div id="00:02:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Where is the pain at the moment? Dr George carried out a thorough series of tests and</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> conducted a detailed cross examination with questions about the fall as well as my general</div><div id="00:02:39.200" class="transcript_line"> health. He even put out his cigarette in the ashtray on his desk and resisted lighting</div><div id="00:02:44.480" class="transcript_line"> another. Eventually we both sat down and he offered his advice. There appeared not to</div><div id="00:02:50.240" class="transcript_line"> be any serious repercussions from the fall. His tests had not revealed any signs of neurological</div><div id="00:02:56.200" class="transcript_line"> effects. He outlined the sort of things I should watch for including nausea, balance</div><div id="00:03:01.720" class="transcript_line"> problems, eyesight changes etc. He recommended visiting my doctor back in England in a week&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:09.720" class="transcript_line"> time. Reassured I asked if there were any changes I should make. He suggested I should</div><div id="00:03:14.480" class="transcript_line"> avoid strenuous exercise, I do anyway, and should avoid excessive drinking but as I was</div><div id="00:03:20.760" class="transcript_line"> on holiday and it was hot social drinking was okay. By this he elaborated he meant a</div><div id="00:03:26.760" class="transcript_line"> glass or two of wine with my evening meal should be okay. As an after thought he added</div><div id="00:03:31.920" class="transcript_line"> that social smoking should be okay as well as the flight home next week. If I had any</div><div id="00:03:37.440" class="transcript_line"> concerns I should call him again. We returned back to the office feeling relieved and relayed</div><div id="00:03:42.960" class="transcript_line"> the information to Manos. We laughed about the social drinking and smoking and Manos</div><div id="00:03:48.080" class="transcript_line"> immediately offered me one of his high strength cigarettes. I readily refused. As an alternative</div><div id="00:03:54.560" class="transcript_line"> he suggested lunch. His treat had to have guilt about the stairs despite me reassuring</div><div id="00:03:59.840" class="transcript_line"> him it was only my own fault that the fall had taken place. A welcome long lunch was</div><div id="00:04:05.160" class="transcript_line"> taken under trees at the restaurant near the office and apparently owned by the mother</div><div id="00:04:09.440" class="transcript_line"> of our electrician. Manos was now also feeling delicate and arriving at the restaurant announced</div><div id="00:04:16.480" class="transcript_line"> to the owner in a stage whisper I have diarrhoea what do you recommend. I&#039;m certain that in</div><div id="00:04:23.120" class="transcript_line"> England the same request would have been met with something like I recommend you eat somewhere</div><div id="00:04:27.320" class="transcript_line"> else. Thankfully we were the first customers and the owner brought a plate of two fried</div><div id="00:04:32.080" class="transcript_line"> eggs for Manos before serving large helpings of mixed mesedas to the three of us. I drank</div><div id="00:04:38.400" class="transcript_line"> a soft drink resisting the recommended social drinking while Manos fortified by the eggs</div><div id="00:04:44.480" class="transcript_line"> ate at least half the mesedas and drank a couple of cold beers. We chatted for an hour</div><div id="00:04:49.480" class="transcript_line"> or two until I said I felt I needed a rest so we returned to the house. Manos I hope</div><div id="00:04:55.080" class="transcript_line"> went back to the office to lie down as well. Sunday morning was spent agreeing the outstanding</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> list of works to be completed with Manos. The main items that were obstructing this</div><div id="00:05:06.320" class="transcript_line"> was the hatch and the metal hatch covers on the ground floor. Manos is also in creative</div><div id="00:05:12.440" class="transcript_line"> mood this morning. What about a folding bed attached to the metalwork? It would give you</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> much more flexibility upstairs. I know somewhere in town that can have strong mattresses made</div><div id="00:05:22.880" class="transcript_line"> up to any size. It&#039;s not expensive I would give you directions. In the bathroom he proposed</div><div id="00:05:29.240" class="transcript_line"> using the metal upright as a spine for some small shelving that would make you for useful</div><div id="00:05:34.760" class="transcript_line"> storage. Up on the roof we discussed the necessity for shade. We brought a large white triangular</div><div id="00:05:41.760" class="transcript_line"> canvas cell from England. We asked if anything could be done with this. We stretched it out.</div><div id="00:05:47.320" class="transcript_line"> It would need some uprights to suspend it from. Leave it with me I&#039;ll see what can be done.</div><div id="00:05:52.880" class="transcript_line"> The problems with the hatches, the roof one and the ground floor hatches, had kept downstairs</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> as a building site. In this state, even though we&#039;d taken measurements, there had been limited</div><div id="00:06:04.360" class="transcript_line"> opportunity to make decisions about any permanent arrangements for the kitchen and seating which</div><div id="00:06:09.960" class="transcript_line"> we knew we needed. The hope had been that we would camp in the house and give ourselves</div><div id="00:06:14.920" class="transcript_line"> an idea of how much or how little space there was and how we should split it up. As a compromise</div><div id="00:06:21.120" class="transcript_line"> we suggested to Manos that if his carpenter could make us a simple bench work surface</div><div id="00:06:26.360" class="transcript_line"> housing a sink, the taps could be fitted to the wall. Then we could use it as a temporary</div><div id="00:06:31.680" class="transcript_line"> kitchen until we felt we understood the space in the house for us to make some decisions</div><div id="00:06:36.440" class="transcript_line"> on more permanent arrangements. This was readily agreed to, even suggested some storage below</div><div id="00:06:42.720" class="transcript_line"> the work surface. We agreed to meet again before we left midweek and we adjourned to</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> a new restaurant that was quickly becoming our favourite. We took a long lunch again</div><div id="00:06:54.280" class="transcript_line"> on the first floor terrace in the restaurant, created inside an old carob factory. The</div><div id="00:06:59.320" class="transcript_line"> rub seemed to be a wonder crop, used as a chocolate substitute, as cattle fodder and</div><div id="00:07:04.680" class="transcript_line"> as some mysterious ingredient in the photographic film production. The building has been beautifully</div><div id="00:07:10.760" class="transcript_line"> restored with carefully selected fittings set against stone walls, lots of glass and</div><div id="00:07:15.960" class="transcript_line"> pastel coloured furniture. I noticed that there were no pictures hung on the walls and</div><div id="00:07:21.120" class="transcript_line"> cheekily asked the owner if they would be interested in some framed prints, the product</div><div id="00:07:26.040" class="transcript_line"> of a recent spell at a print department in our local college at home. The answer was</div><div id="00:07:30.760" class="transcript_line"> typically cretin, why not, bring them in with you next time and we&#039;ll look at them. The</div><div id="00:07:35.960" class="transcript_line"> following day we returned and ordered some wine. I showed the pictures to the owner who</div><div id="00:07:40.840" class="transcript_line"> was complimentary but said he thought he would leave the walls clear for the time being.</div><div id="00:07:45.960" class="transcript_line"> He must have sensed my disappointment as he quickly asked me to bring the pictures with</div><div id="00:07:50.120" class="transcript_line"> me. We&#039;re going next door where we have a shop. We left the restaurant and just next</div><div id="00:07:55.360" class="transcript_line"> door down a couple of steps was a small shop and as my eyes adapted to the contrast between</div><div id="00:08:00.760" class="transcript_line"> the bright sun outside and the comparatively subdued lighting within, I saw a smiling dark</div><div id="00:08:06.600" class="transcript_line"> haired lady sitting behind a carved polished wood desk. This is my mother. We exchanged</div><div id="00:08:12.520" class="transcript_line"> handshakes. Jeff has some pictures for us to sell. Where shall we put them? The shop</div><div id="00:08:17.920" class="transcript_line"> comprised two smallish rooms with stone walls and a cool tiled floor with sets of shelves</div><div id="00:08:23.360" class="transcript_line"> and small tables on every wall. The stock was a mixture of beautifully coloured glass,</div><div id="00:08:29.440" class="transcript_line"> racks of wine and local rackie, carved olive wood ornaments and kitchenware as well as</div><div id="00:08:34.920" class="transcript_line"> pretty coloured metal jugs used in restaurants or house wine. So near the start of the season</div><div id="00:08:40.400" class="transcript_line"> it seemed very well stocked with little space for all five framed prints, each one some</div><div id="00:08:45.760" class="transcript_line"> two foot by 18 inches. Dimitri was undeterred and started handing items off the shelves</div><div id="00:08:51.680" class="transcript_line"> to me. Once my arms were full I had to start putting stuff down on some of the other shelves.</div><div id="00:08:57.520" class="transcript_line"> After several reshuffles and reducing some of the space in between items we were left</div><div id="00:09:01.600" class="transcript_line"> with a bare shelf, lit with spotlumps in a prime position facing the door. We&#039;ll put</div><div id="00:09:07.160" class="transcript_line"> them here he said decisively. I hoped his mother approved, after all it was her shop.</div><div id="00:09:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I needn&#039;t have worried as she was smiling serenely and turned to attend to a customer</div><div id="00:09:17.560" class="transcript_line"> who was making what appeared to be an impulse purchase of a large coloured glass piece for</div><div id="00:09:22.440" class="transcript_line"> the princy sum of 300 euros. Perhaps bringing the princy would be a good move, then I remembered</div><div id="00:09:28.560" class="transcript_line"> we had yet to discuss any commercial arrangements.</div><div id="00:09:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Are you happy with the pictures here Jeff? Yes they look good, let&#039;s hope they will</div><div id="00:09:35.920" class="transcript_line"> sell I answered. What are your normal arrangements for pricing with suppliers? We quickly agreed</div><div id="00:09:41.400" class="transcript_line"> on a simple arrangement, a 50-50 profit split and a euros retail price per frame print</div><div id="00:09:47.520" class="transcript_line"> with Dimitri at my suggestion having the option of discounting the price later in the season</div><div id="00:09:52.760" class="transcript_line"> if they were unsold. As I folded up the large zip bag I brought them in and my pack of greeting</div><div id="00:09:58.960" class="transcript_line"> cards with local photos fell out. What are these? You do cards too? Yes, would you like</div><div id="00:10:04.680" class="transcript_line"> some of these as well? Why not? he said positively. Let&#039;s go, your wine will be getting warm.</div><div id="00:10:11.240" class="transcript_line"> I returned to the restaurant terrace where my wife was enjoying the sun, the view and</div><div id="00:10:15.600" class="transcript_line"> the wine. You&#039;d be gone ages, will they take any? Smiling I was able to report that</div><div id="00:10:21.200" class="transcript_line"> all five were on display in the shop next door together with the cards. On the strength</div><div id="00:10:26.400" class="transcript_line"> of future revenue we ordered lunch and another carafe of wine, well why not? At home. We</div><div id="00:10:33.960" class="transcript_line"> were away staying with friends in Wales towards the end of June when the next update arrived,</div><div id="00:10:39.360" class="transcript_line"> just a photo of the spiral staircase and the hatch with the caption, Glass for the hatch</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> has been located. This is good news as there will be much discussion about whether it will</div><div id="00:10:48.880" class="transcript_line"> be one panel of glass or nine, plate glass or glass bricks or even in a fit of frustration</div><div id="00:10:55.680" class="transcript_line"> wood. Dear Geoff, I hope you had a pleasant weekend. The Glass for the hatch has been</div><div id="00:11:00.760" class="transcript_line"> located. This week the Ironman, Glassman, Electrician and me all go together to see</div><div id="00:11:06.540" class="transcript_line"> how it&#039;s working and what is needed. I thought that would be a site meeting I would be happy</div><div id="00:11:11.580" class="transcript_line"> to miss. Earlier in the process we&#039;ve detected some fairly undisguised tensions between Manos</div><div id="00:11:17.740" class="transcript_line"> and the Metalman and there have been some uncomplimentary comments about the Glassman.</div><div id="00:11:22.740" class="transcript_line"> At one point Manos had told me that the Tileman thought they were all making too much fuss.</div><div id="00:11:28.260" class="transcript_line"> Frustrated by the delay I suggested, only half in jest, that the Tileman should be immediately</div><div id="00:11:33.720" class="transcript_line"> commissioned to install a hatch of his own design, tiled or otherwise. I left my call</div><div id="00:11:39.960" class="transcript_line"> to Manos until the end of the week and on the Friday morning had one of our usual styles</div><div id="00:11:44.920" class="transcript_line"> of conversations. It could not be described as being at total cross purposes nor it could</div><div id="00:11:50.640" class="transcript_line"> be thought of as entirely in tune. I opened the skirmish by asking whether the hatch meeting</div><div id="00:11:55.840" class="transcript_line"> had concluded satisfactorily. He gave a guarded yes. I then asked him whether it had leaked</div><div id="00:12:01.720" class="transcript_line"> at all and asked if he was satisfied with the seal. Ah yes, it was fine for the hose</div><div id="00:12:06.640" class="transcript_line"> pipe but here the winter rains would be unlike rain you&#039;ve ever seen. Okay, so we just hope</div><div id="00:12:12.920" class="transcript_line"> it will be okay then. But as far as it goes the house is now sealed and weather tight.</div><div id="00:12:18.240" class="transcript_line"> He then changed tack. So tell me when are you coming back again? Well as we said, when</div><div id="00:12:23.520" class="transcript_line"> the house is finished and we can stay in it, let us know when that will be and then I can</div><div id="00:12:27.900" class="transcript_line"> book flights. His reply was that we should tell him when we would be coming and the house</div><div id="00:12:33.020" class="transcript_line"> would be finished by that date. I gave up and said we would talk about it here and contact</div><div id="00:12:38.500" class="transcript_line"> him shortly, probably the next day. The next day after booking flights for the end of July</div><div id="00:12:45.020" class="transcript_line"> we called the office and relayed the dates, also agreeing a few details to be finished.</div><div id="00:12:50.300" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately this visit did not take place following a dramatic turn of events. Since</div><div id="00:12:55.580" class="transcript_line"> the last visit in June I had suffered from painful headaches. Visits to our doctor and</div><div id="00:13:01.660" class="transcript_line"> two subsequent trips to two casualty wards had only resulted in suggestions of migraines.</div><div id="00:13:08.340" class="transcript_line"> After a rapid deterioration and a very frightening 24 hours of the kind support of our friends</div><div id="00:13:13.100" class="transcript_line"> Dallara Martin, I was to wake up in an intensive care unit in a neurological centre of the</div><div id="00:13:19.340" class="transcript_line"> Sussex hospital. A surgical team had been called in and I had undergone an emergency</div><div id="00:13:25.240" class="transcript_line"> and life savouring operation. Delayed completion of the holiday home seemed an incidental matter.</div><div id="00:13:32.520" class="transcript_line"> Once the haematoma was drained and following several days monitoring and a second brain</div><div id="00:13:37.640" class="transcript_line"> scan I was released home for recuperation with stern instructions to take it very easy,</div><div id="00:13:44.320" class="transcript_line"> no driving or flying for the immediate future. It appeared that the split second slip back</div><div id="00:13:50.420" class="transcript_line"> in June had resulted in a very close call. After my dramatic hospital visit the need</div><div id="00:13:56.660" class="transcript_line"> to recuperate pushed the thoughts of the house project from my mind but there was a need</div><div id="00:14:01.720" class="transcript_line"> to tell Monos that the planned visit in August would not be taking place.</div><div id="00:14:09.040" class="transcript_line"> The latest emails had been some questions of detail that I had picked up while in hospital</div><div id="00:14:13.920" class="transcript_line"> so these were briefly answered with an accompanying promise to call him in a few days without</div><div id="00:14:18.960" class="transcript_line"> revealing the reason for this. I had been told to avoid any further drama and excitement</div><div id="00:14:24.680" class="transcript_line"> and we concluded that conversations about the house, particularly with Monos, usually</div><div id="00:14:29.480" class="transcript_line"> involved a measure of both of these. An update arrived via the photo website with some welcome</div><div id="00:14:35.600" class="transcript_line"> progress. The floor tiles on the ground floor had been relayed which must mean the floor</div><div id="00:14:40.040" class="transcript_line"> hatches had been reinstalled, new stone inserts had been cut and fitted to the side of the</div><div id="00:14:45.240" class="transcript_line"> stair treads and we could see that the air conditioning unit had been installed, placed</div><div id="00:14:51.280" class="transcript_line"> neatly high up in the stairwell next to the spiral stairs. Stephanie rang the office and</div><div id="00:14:56.840" class="transcript_line"> broke the news to Helen and asked her when would be a good time to speak to Monos, knowing</div><div id="00:15:01.440" class="transcript_line"> he would be upset. An hour later, breathless and very concerned, Monos was ringing us.</div><div id="00:15:06.680" class="transcript_line"> It is dreadful, how is Geoff? Will he be alright? I am so upset. Eventually she asked if he</div><div id="00:15:12.480" class="transcript_line"> would like to talk to me. A plaintiff Monos weakly inquired, can he speak? We talked and</div><div id="00:15:19.360" class="transcript_line"> I reassured him that the surgeon said there was no reason I should not make a full recovery</div><div id="00:15:24.080" class="transcript_line"> as long as I took a period of taking things easy. In practical terms this meant postponing</div><div id="00:15:29.440" class="transcript_line"> our planned visit for the following week. The house is almost ready, I will send you</div><div id="00:15:34.200" class="transcript_line"> photos but are you sure that you will be okay? It is so tragic. We broke the news of our</div><div id="00:15:39.840" class="transcript_line"> abandoned trip to move into the house but emphasised that we would travel as soon as</div><div id="00:15:44.080" class="transcript_line"> I received the all clear to. Conversation moved on to details of completed works and</div><div id="00:15:49.600" class="transcript_line"> outstanding tasks. I felt an information overload and perceptively Monos must have sensed this</div><div id="00:15:55.880" class="transcript_line"> as he said that it would be best to look at the photos and call with any questions or</div><div id="00:16:00.120" class="transcript_line"> instructions. Exchanging best wishes we ended the call. He was as good as his word and later</div><div id="00:16:06.840" class="transcript_line"> the same day some more photos arrived showing that the fridge had been installed. There</div><div id="00:16:11.160" class="transcript_line"> was also photos of a new doorbell, an outside light above the front door and down lighters</div><div id="00:16:16.760" class="transcript_line"> in one of the warm niches. Early evening I called Monos again to thank him for the photos</div><div id="00:16:22.480" class="transcript_line"> and check he was over the shock of my news. He sounded more composed but also promised</div><div id="00:16:27.440" class="transcript_line"> to take some more photos that evening to show the lights on in the house. Again he wished</div><div id="00:16:33.440" class="transcript_line"> me a speedy recovery and we look forward to receiving this further update even though</div><div id="00:16:38.360" class="transcript_line"> there was a growing sense of frustration at not being able to stay in the completed house.</div><div id="00:16:43.720" class="transcript_line"> When we were able to look at the photos the next day we were truly delighted by them.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The outside lights washed down the stones at the front of the house highlighting the</div><div id="00:16:52.280" class="transcript_line"> contours and bringing out the honey coloured tones of the stones. The lights inside shone</div><div id="00:16:57.600" class="transcript_line"> out through the open windows with the grey painted shutters and frames contrasting with</div><div id="00:17:01.880" class="transcript_line"> the colour of the stones. The photos of the interior were equally rewarding. The same</div><div id="00:17:07.440" class="transcript_line"> coloured stones with the wide light pointing between them looked wonderful with the warm</div><div id="00:17:12.600" class="transcript_line"> browns and yellows relieved by some light greys. We&#039;d chosen some coloured light shades</div><div id="00:17:18.080" class="transcript_line"> to use as four pendant lights to hang from the old wooden beams upstairs. These contrasted</div><div id="00:17:23.600" class="transcript_line"> nicely with the sharper light of the down lighters and niche lights but their harshness</div><div id="00:17:28.320" class="transcript_line"> was already tempered by the variety of colours in the stone and the walls. Manos has also</div><div id="00:17:33.840" class="transcript_line"> prepared a small surprise for us by way of a ribbon of LED lights forming an L shape</div><div id="00:17:39.600" class="transcript_line"> along the two walls. We&#039;d agreed with Manos to leave a gap between the walls and the floorboards</div><div id="00:17:44.920" class="transcript_line"> on the first floor. He&#039;d eloquently described the floor as floating with the light washing</div><div id="00:17:50.480" class="transcript_line"> up and down the stone walls through a small gap. The LED lights magnify this effect and</div><div id="00:17:56.200" class="transcript_line"> look very dramatic in the photos. There was also a practical aspect to the floating floor</div><div id="00:18:01.800" class="transcript_line"> meaning that the edge could be straight even though the wall surface around it was uneven.</div><div id="00:18:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Another photo showed some expensive looking black box with a blue light on it. It also</div><div id="00:18:12.400" class="transcript_line"> stated uninterruptible power supply for the electric hatch mechanism. Very high tech but</div><div id="00:18:18.880" class="transcript_line"> perhaps essential if we didn&#039;t want to get stranded on the roof terrace. There was also</div><div id="00:18:24.040" class="transcript_line"> pictures of the stairs with the light from the bathrooms shining through the frosted</div><div id="00:18:27.960" class="transcript_line"> glass stair backs illuminating the stairs very theatrically. The whole look was now closer to</div><div id="00:18:34.920" class="transcript_line"> our imagination. A blend of traditional and modern with interesting little design surprises.</div><div id="00:18:41.160" class="transcript_line"> The final addition was the kitchen unit that the carpenter had made. There&#039;d be much discussion</div><div id="00:18:46.120" class="transcript_line"> about the kitchen throughout the project but as the building details were finalised and we began</div><div id="00:18:51.400" class="transcript_line"> to see more Cretan houses and think about Cretan recipes the options widened rather than narrowed.</div><div id="00:18:58.360" class="transcript_line"> We concluded that we wanted to live in the house before finalising the kitchen</div><div id="00:19:02.600" class="transcript_line"> so to ask Manos if a simple temporary kitchen bench could be made.</div><div id="00:19:06.920" class="transcript_line"> This had a simple sink inset, space for a free-standing hob and food preparation. The</div><div id="00:19:13.240" class="transcript_line"> taps could be fixed to the wall and some storage made on a shelf below the work surface.</div><div id="00:19:18.600" class="transcript_line"> The phone rang early at home one morning. Good morning, is it too early? I&#039;m up at your house</div><div id="00:19:23.080" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m wondering about the plant from outside. What do you think? A bougainvillea, a vine or a</div><div id="00:19:28.200" class="transcript_line"> jasmine? Well it must be nearly finished if he&#039;s thinking about planting shrubs. After a brief</div><div id="00:19:34.200" class="transcript_line"> discussion we settled on a jasmine. It would be more fragrant than a vine and less prickly on the</div><div id="00:19:39.640" class="transcript_line"> stem than a bougainvillea. Once more we expressed our gratitude and said how pleased we&#039;d been with</div><div id="00:19:45.240" class="transcript_line"> the whole look of the house in the recent night pictures that we&#039;d seen. He agreed that the</div><div id="00:19:49.880" class="transcript_line"> lighting seemed to have enlarged the building both inside and out and after he&#039;d gone we realised that</div><div id="00:19:55.400" class="transcript_line"> today was the day we would have flown out again but had to be cancelled because of my operation.</div><div id="00:20:02.040" class="transcript_line"> No matter, the house would still be there for later visits. The next contact from Manos was an</div><div id="00:20:07.880" class="transcript_line"> online conversation one evening early in August. After asking about my post-op recovery plan,</div><div id="00:20:14.120" class="transcript_line"> he told us that jasmine had been planted and was some two metres tall. We exchanged other text</div><div id="00:20:19.800" class="transcript_line"> comments and then it became quite lyrical. I&#039;ve just finished a large project but it&#039;s not been</div><div id="00:20:24.760" class="transcript_line"> as creative as your house. Your house is small but enlarged, unique and intelligent. I have enjoyed</div><div id="00:20:32.040" class="transcript_line"> the project and working with you. This is good to hear because the three of us knew that the whole</div><div id="00:20:37.240" class="transcript_line"> project had not been without its frustrations for all of us but if we got to this point in all fairness</div><div id="00:20:42.760" class="transcript_line"> and we got to this point and all felt so positive at the end of it then it would be a good thing.</div><div id="00:20:48.200" class="transcript_line"> He concluded by saying he would send a photo of the climbing jasmine and pictures of the inside</div><div id="00:20:53.080" class="transcript_line"> after cleaning and we would wish each other a good weekend. As promised a new set of pictures</div><div id="00:20:59.080" class="transcript_line"> arrived with the first one showing the jasmine planted to the left of the front door and climbing</div><div id="00:21:04.760" class="transcript_line"> three quarters of the way to the top of the door. Other photos were of the staircase after they&#039;d</div><div id="00:21:10.200" class="transcript_line"> been cleaned as well as the new floorboards upstairs. There are also more images of the</div><div id="00:21:15.880" class="transcript_line"> detail in the wet room with its shock tiling which was still taking a little getting used to.</div><div id="00:21:22.040" class="transcript_line"> The glass in the windows and the floor pan looked clean as did the large mirror entirely covering</div><div id="00:21:27.480" class="transcript_line"> the back of the bathroom door. Areas of tiling that needed finishing when we were last there</div><div id="00:21:32.920" class="transcript_line"> in the early summer were now finished. We noticed details such as door handles and window</div><div id="00:21:39.560" class="transcript_line"> shutter latches. This has really felt like finishing touches and I couldn&#039;t wait to</div><div id="00:21:44.520" class="transcript_line"> get out there to see it all and at long last stay in the house.</div></div></p>
