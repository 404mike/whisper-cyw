id="00:00:57.360" class="transcript_line"> and also and culture got a lot because my father the attitude lot was the boys had to work and things like that so I had a bit of my parents attitude because my daughter apparently she&#039;s done very</div><div id="00:01:14.800" class="transcript_line"> well in Sweden well I know she passed all levels and things like that but how well you know I could have pushed her on you know to go to I didn&#039;t know about going to you know the university or like during school they have like</div><div id="00:01:33.600" class="transcript_line"> I never knew about that so you know since they were in school you know because my parents never once came to parents meeting anything like that</div><div id="00:01:45.480" class="transcript_line"> so you basically you only knew what you experienced with our experience and you put on to you as a girl with mine then he went to um always racism in school my son and I remember when he was little</div><div id="00:02:10.120" class="transcript_line"> junior where he let say I live here in the school was like just down the crossroad and I walked through and he be I could see him outside you know standing by the door so I asked him what are you doing out there the teacher</div><div id="00:02:26.240" class="transcript_line"> I said what for he said because then he has to go to toilet and they won&#039;t let him go that&#039;s told him if you want to go to it should done it in break time and that he read himself and they kept him so went to school and I complained to the headmaster about it and I wanted to see her so with her with his teacher me and the headmaster so I said to him I asked my son and he told me that you will say to him that I am going to go to the toilet.</div><div id="00:02:56.280" class="transcript_line"> They were not just him the whole class you got to if you want to go to it go at break time but then you know the little boys you know the boys like to play first and they come in and she was just punishing him you know and make him wet himself and keep him there she do it all the time.</div><div id="00:03:13.280" class="transcript_line"> He was powerful so I said to him I asked my son and he told me exactly what happened I said you know and I know my son knocked on the door and said my son wouldn&#039;t do this or do that I said you know him and he wouldn&#039;t tell lies I said but you seem to be the type of person you are very quick to push it put a child down and make them out to be the liar and then headmaster went ladies ladies please let&#039;s not antagonize one another you know at that time.</div><div id="00:03:43.280" class="transcript_line"> I noticed it then but then when he went on to the but what they do in school they put on a report on the child then to make the which was put on a terrible report on him because we went to their school then the teacher he had was awful he wasn&#039;t being taught English I can&#039;t remember how I found out but then I I found the school I went up to see the headmaster as it happened I knew the headmaster because he attended the same church in the same church.</div><div id="00:04:13.320" class="transcript_line"> So I said to him I kept on phoning him but I didn&#039;t get nowhere they were actually putting him right in when I put him right in I had to reply the following they asked me to come in and then he said to me I said she&#039;s refusing to teach him English.</div><div id="00:04:31.360" class="transcript_line"> I asked her why her excuse was someone like your son he&#039;s very good at maths when they go to maths they&#039;re no good at English I said that&#039;s the reason if he&#039;s been coming to school is to learn isn&#039;t it and the headmaster said don&#039;t worry missus has to leave it with me but what she did because he insisted she had to she had to teach him she went off sick rather than teach him.</div><div id="00:04:57.400" class="transcript_line"> But he said don&#039;t worry about him I&#039;ll make sure you&#039;ll be okay but he did make sure he was okay.</div><div id="00:05:03.400" class="transcript_line"> He sent him a program which he passed and sent him to college and when he went to college they gave him a program he passed put him through to university then you know so he kept his words out there.</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> He was terrible the school racist then so when I met this chap I told him he came to me he was from Africa and I said to him about in Newport they&#039;re very racist there&#039;s no teachers there black teachers so I said to him because he took over there&#039;s a place called Jim GEMS.</div><div id="00:05:39.480" class="transcript_line"> He said I can&#039;t grant minority support or something like that he was first of his kind in Newport I said well you&#039;ve got the building I said if you can train if I get a group of people together get something to train them up to a level then go to school and teach.</div><div id="00:05:59.520" class="transcript_line"> So he said right he said well I&#039;ll do I&#039;ll apply to the European for funding and I&#039;ve got the space there and you just bring me the people so I did I got quite a few about 12 Caribbean people I was one and we taught English she got someone from London she was excellent and they was Caribbean.</div><div id="00:06:19.560" class="transcript_line"> She was excellent teacher she really was she went through everything and she was so patient if you want to help with anything you know don&#039;t be afraid to ask you know but she got us through it and while she taught us when we did it then we had to go into various schools colleges as well.</div><div id="00:06:39.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d be assessed by it and marked as well by the teachers so we done all that we all passed but then while we&#039;re doing it as well well I found it but the Asian was coming then and in the schools now you find the more Asians now rather than it was taught English as a second language because I explained.</div><div id="00:06:59.640" class="transcript_line"> As Caribbean even though you speak English is like pigeon English you know and when you&#039;re writing the grammar is not the same it is not whereas you know with the Asian they&#039;re going to school they get the help I want to win that&#039;s why they do better than this.</div><div id="00:07:16.680" class="transcript_line"> And there was a server came around do we need that extra help and I said yes we needed it and I&#039;ve booked in the community and there was the other ones no we speak English and all the old it&#039;s ridiculous they poo poo it and so that went by the wayside.</div><div id="00:07:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Because I.</div><div id="00:07:40.720" class="transcript_line"> But they do need you know what they definitely need definitely.</div><div id="00:07:47.720" class="transcript_line"> The extra support they do yeah because you when you&#039;re writing doesn&#039;t flow so easy and then get your thoughts into chronic or the like you do need that support definitely.</div><div id="00:07:58.760" class="transcript_line"> How important is it do you think for the next generation to hear and to know the stories of people like you and your parents and that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:08:11.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s very important to the top of definitely and I think they definitely that support in school as well they really do because it will help a lot that support you know in the region the writing.</div><div id="00:08:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Why is it important.</div><div id="00:08:32.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important for them to achieve later on you know in their adult to get good jobs you know and to be able to express themselves you know.</div><div id="00:08:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Be their own voice as well they need a voice don&#039;t they.</div><div id="00:08:48.800" class="transcript_line"> And they need someone to look up to as well in school and so there&#039;s no one they can look up to and who&#039;s a voice for them within the community.</div><div id="00:09:00.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing here in Newport nothing at all you know where they can go and meet and support it&#039;s like for instance being ill as well there&#039;s no.</div><div id="00:09:08.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing like within the in they&#039;ve all got that support you know.</div><div id="00:09:13.840" class="transcript_line"> They need a bit them they link need to go back as far as their country as well I think with their high commission them supporting them over here.</div><div id="00:09:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Link it up.</div><div id="00:09:24.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good thing.</div><div id="00:09:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Because with the Asian as well when they buy all this property they link it up with their government.</div><div id="00:09:34.880" class="transcript_line"> So they link to the government back home and everything.</div><div id="00:09:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Is there any other thing you&#039;d like to say about.</div><div id="00:09:44.880" class="transcript_line"> Britain about being British about feeling British or not feeling British do you feel more British or more Caribbean.</div><div id="00:09:56.880" class="transcript_line"> The both.</div><div id="00:09:58.880" class="transcript_line"> So you describe yourself as what.</div><div id="00:10:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Ethnicity wise.</div><div id="00:10:02.920" class="transcript_line"> Ethnicity wise.</div><div id="00:10:08.920" class="transcript_line"> I would say black British.</div><div id="00:10:15.920" class="transcript_line"> No matter where I go I&#039;m open my mouth.</div><div id="00:10:18.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh you&#039;re from Wales tell you&#039;re from Calif I was in St. Kitts as well.</div><div id="00:10:22.920" class="transcript_line"> And this white girl came up to me she said to me and how well do the people how do they accept you here.</div><div id="00:10:27.960" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m saying kids with your accent as a what the speaking person they always say that to me always on the train you know they got all your go Shalibasi.</div><div id="00:10:40.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what they always say.</div><div id="00:10:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Moment I open my mouth.</div><div id="00:10:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel more Welsh or more British.</div><div id="00:10:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you think there&#039;s a difference between being Welsh and being British.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> About a very racist.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Very very racist.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But I.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only now and all I realize because we&#039;re the younger I went to my friend&#039;s house before.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And she didn&#039;t let me know you know it won&#039;t be me anywhere.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I said why haven&#039;t you invited me.</div><div id="00:11:21.040" class="transcript_line"> I invited straight away but she didn&#039;t know schools until it wasn&#039;t she wouldn&#039;t let to invite me and I realized then.</div><div id="00:11:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have the time zone later on when you&#039;re growing up you realize these things.</div><div id="00:11:40.040" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t want to let me in.</div><div id="00:11:41.080" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t want you around.</div><div id="00:11:42.080" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t want to let me in.</div><div id="00:11:47.080" class="transcript_line"> And I realized growing up that racism is not in the school.</div><div id="00:11:53.080" class="transcript_line"> I define the mixture it starts within the home without that&#039;s a hundred percent the parents you know.</div><div id="00:12:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Is there any hope is there anything we can do about that.</div><div id="00:12:06.120" class="transcript_line"> I think they see.</div><div id="00:12:09.120" class="transcript_line"> In the school is all just.</div><div id="00:12:12.120" class="transcript_line"> In the white faces of the mixture.</div><div id="00:12:17.120" class="transcript_line"> That would help as well because when I was teaching the school as well.</div><div id="00:12:21.120" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:12:23.120" class="transcript_line"> The teacher was doing something.</div><div id="00:12:25.120" class="transcript_line"> She used the letter N.</div><div id="00:12:26.120" class="transcript_line"> She chose a letter to the class names of the beginning with N.</div><div id="00:12:31.120" class="transcript_line"> And they went.</div><div id="00:12:32.160" class="transcript_line"> I was so I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:12:34.160" class="transcript_line"> But the teacher didn&#039;t blink.</div><div id="00:12:36.160" class="transcript_line"> She acted with the children acted with something normal.</div><div id="00:12:39.160" class="transcript_line"> So obviously something it was terrible.</div><div id="00:12:42.160" class="transcript_line"> So I came back and went to I reported them.</div><div id="00:12:47.160" class="transcript_line"> But they were worried because this chap came to see me which from the council.</div><div id="00:12:52.160" class="transcript_line"> He said to me they&#039;re worried that you might take it further and all this.</div><div id="00:12:55.160" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;m not worried.</div><div id="00:12:56.200" class="transcript_line"> Because this chap came to see me which from the council.</div><div id="00:12:58.200" class="transcript_line"> He said to me they&#039;re worried that you might take it further and all this.</div><div id="00:13:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I said I got no intention of taking it further.</div><div id="00:13:04.200" class="transcript_line"> The person what I want.</div><div id="00:13:05.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like it to go.</div><div id="00:13:08.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like it to go on a course.</div><div id="00:13:11.200" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:13:12.200" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d like to be around to make sure she did go on that.</div><div id="00:13:16.200" class="transcript_line"> But they said I couldn&#039;t be there and all this nonsense.</div><div id="00:13:19.200" class="transcript_line"> It was gems.</div><div id="00:13:23.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:13:26.200" class="transcript_line"> But then then because that happened there was this what did they wear.</div><div id="00:13:31.200" class="transcript_line"> It was in school.</div><div id="00:13:32.200" class="transcript_line"> There was this blonde girl with blue eyes.</div><div id="00:13:34.200" class="transcript_line"> She cut it&#039;s my it was my husband niece looks call me Antigua.</div><div id="00:13:38.200" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t realize we were related.</div><div id="00:13:42.200" class="transcript_line"> So she started picking that she said oh she&#039;s.</div><div id="00:13:46.200" class="transcript_line"> She seems to be tired in school.</div><div id="00:13:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Do you think she&#039;s you know getting me to be negative but I just ignored her.</div><div id="00:13:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Because in the school.</div><div id="00:13:57.240" class="transcript_line"> During the breaks they.</div><div id="00:14:00.240" class="transcript_line"> They talk so they talk about each child.</div><div id="00:14:03.240" class="transcript_line"> Like I remember this little boy this mixed race boy and he was very bright and clever.</div><div id="00:14:09.240" class="transcript_line"> And because he was mixed race they would always put him down in there.</div><div id="00:14:13.240" class="transcript_line"> And kept him down.</div><div id="00:14:15.240" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s got a lot to do with them.</div><div id="00:14:17.280" class="transcript_line"> With them.</div><div id="00:14:20.280" class="transcript_line"> Is your background I think like and the judge you in school that he the judge you a lot.</div><div id="00:14:25.280" class="transcript_line"> I know what to say.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> The system is already gay against you so to make it.</div><div id="00:14:40.280" class="transcript_line"> You have to work extra hard I guess.</div><div id="00:14:42.320" class="transcript_line"> Is to the mentality.</div><div id="00:14:45.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like it&#039;s institutionalized isn&#039;t it.</div><div id="00:14:48.320" class="transcript_line"> In all these.</div><div id="00:14:56.320" class="transcript_line"> When.</div><div id="00:14:58.320" class="transcript_line"> I will leave you to have your lunch.</div><div id="00:15:01.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think I think this is how that feels.</div><div id="00:15:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you say anything else you want to say.</div><div id="00:15:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh please don&#039;t forget to get in touch with them.</div><div id="00:15:08.360" class="transcript_line"> The.</div><div id="00:15:09.360"

class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t play on.</div><div id="00:15:31.360" class="transcript_line"> The French room.</div><div id="00:15:32.400" class="transcript_line"> I was very so good the chop I did it with.</div><div id="00:15:36.400" class="transcript_line"> He he he was a Jamaican chap he&#039;d never when he came over here.</div><div id="00:15:42.400" class="transcript_line"> He
