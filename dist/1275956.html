    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> 1919 workers strikes, the army and Belfast. Belfast was also presenting problems for</div><div id="00:00:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Firstly let me take you back, before the war there were a number</div><div id="00:00:16.080" class="transcript_line"> of strikes and I&#039;d recommend the excellent work of Simon Webb in his book 1919 Britain&#039;s Year of</div><div id="00:00:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Revolution. In the years before World War One there was considerable industrial unrest which</div><div id="00:00:30.160" class="transcript_line"> peaked in 1912 when 40 million working days were lost across Britain. Then in 1914 the Triple</div><div id="00:00:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Alliance was formed. This was a triumvirate of the three big trade union areas coal, rail and dock</div><div id="00:00:48.480" class="transcript_line"> workers and only the war stopped a general strike that would have crippled the nation.</div><div id="00:00:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Patriotism affected industrial unrest but by 1917 that atmosphere was changing and seamstresses,</div><div id="00:01:02.480" class="transcript_line"> bank clerks, telegraph messengers and munition workers all went on strike. The government</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> introduced the defense of the realm act in 1914 which was draconian and forced citizens to do</div><div id="00:01:17.680" class="transcript_line"> some things and forbade them from doing others. One critical clause gave the government absolute</div><div id="00:01:24.400" class="transcript_line"> freedom to introduce further regulations as and when needed. For example engineers could not change</div><div id="00:01:33.440" class="transcript_line"> jobs without approval and it was an offense to suggest the war was a bad thing. Although some</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> rules were blatantly bizarre regulation 40b concerned the supply of cocaine to actresses.</div><div id="00:01:50.800" class="transcript_line"> As soon as the war had ended there was the December 1918 election and David George had made three</div><div id="00:01:59.600" class="transcript_line"> significant promises all of which he was to break. One that those who had fought would return to a</div><div id="00:02:07.760" class="transcript_line"> land fit for heroes. Two there would be habitation for heroes and three demobilization back to Sibby</div><div id="00:02:16.720" class="transcript_line"> street would be speedy. Well no new housing had been built in fact while the men had been away</div><div id="00:02:22.400" class="transcript_line"> their wives had led rent strikes. There were few jobs and demobilization was slow</div><div id="00:02:28.640" class="transcript_line"> and Winston Churchill had tried to send the armed forces to Russia.</div><div id="00:02:32.720" class="transcript_line"> So at the end of the war the trade union congress on behalf of all workers negotiated a reduction in</div><div id="00:02:39.280" class="transcript_line"> working hours from 54 to 47 a week. However this was rejected in a ballot of workers by three to one</div><div id="00:02:48.560" class="transcript_line"> and the rank and file chose to ignore the TUC. On the 27th of January the industrial war between</div><div id="00:02:56.080" class="transcript_line"> workers and governments began in Glasgow and in Belfast. Well we&#039;ve mentioned Glasgow in chapter</div><div id="00:03:01.040" class="transcript_line"> seven of this. And when but in Belfast the general strike began the interesting thing was that workers</div><div id="00:03:09.520" class="transcript_line"> were not simply demanding less money less hours for more wages as was traditional. Instead they</div><div id="00:03:15.760" class="transcript_line"> demanded a 40 hour working week as an experiment with the object of absorbing the unemployed.</div><div id="00:03:21.920" class="transcript_line"> The strikes were no longer simply strikes they were now a people&#039;s movement taking strategy out of the hands of government.</div><div id="00:03:27.440" class="transcript_line"> In Belfast the strikers took control of electricity and the added issue was the general demand for Irish independence</div><div id="00:03:33.440" class="transcript_line"> which had led to the election of Sinn Fein MPs in the late 1920s.</div><div id="00:03:41.360" class="transcript_line"> The strike was a result of the</div><div id="00:03:50.160" class="transcript_line"> election of Sinn Fein MPs in the general election of 1918. Six days earlier on the 21st the first</div><div id="00:03:58.080" class="transcript_line"> meeting of Dale Arron had occurred in Dublin declaring an independent Ireland on the 21st of January</div><div id="00:04:05.840" class="transcript_line"> and at the killing of two policemen in county Tipperary that same day at the beginning of</div><div id="00:04:12.240" class="transcript_line"> what was the Anglo-Irish war for independence.</div><div id="00:04:18.560" class="transcript_line"> The strikers in Belfast the strike committee were in total control of electricity</div><div id="00:04:27.280" class="transcript_line"> they even were deciding which industry could have electricity.</div><div id="00:04:34.720" class="transcript_line"> In effect no industry could have it but hospitals could. They were seeking to create a workers</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> parliament and government knew this was step one to independence but it was also bolshevism.</div><div id="00:04:49.440" class="transcript_line"> As the Belfast newsletters headlined these objectives are not industrial they are</div><div id="00:04:56.160" class="transcript_line"> revolutionary. Well when workers in London announced they were going to join the general strike</div><div id="00:05:02.640" class="transcript_line"> the government had to act which it did very forcibly in Glasgow and it also then amended</div><div id="00:05:11.600" class="transcript_line"> the defence of the realm act making it illegal to deprive the inhabitants of electricity</div><div id="00:05:18.320" class="transcript_line"> with a penalty of six months hard work labour for any worker that did so.</div><div id="00:05:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Well after gas and electricity had been disrupted for three weeks in Belfast the army was brought</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> in. Army detachment, Lewis machine guns mounted at the electricity station</div><div id="00:05:38.720" class="transcript_line"> and in other places led to the strike collapsing but it was now clear the army would be used to</div><div id="00:05:46.240" class="transcript_line"> bring order and that their orders were clear whatever force was necessary.</div><div id="00:05:55.840" class="transcript_line"> So the Belfast general strike collapsed but the atmosphere of strikes in 1919</div><div id="00:06:02.880" class="transcript_line"> was to continue not least because the police went on strike twice in 1919 in London and in Liverpool</div><div id="00:06:15.280" class="transcript_line"> the government had to sack 2 000 police officers and make strikes by the police illegal</div><div id="00:06:22.720" class="transcript_line"> which is true to this day.</div></div></p>
