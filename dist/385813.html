the top line there,</div><div id="00:04:55.940" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s about two and a half tonnes, something like that.</div><div id="00:04:58.140" class="transcript_line"> We used to carry six of them up to Spearing Jackson&#039;s,</div><div id="00:05:01.380" class="transcript_line"> for them to be in the old as well.</div><div id="00:05:03.140" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;d go back a couple of days later and bring them back here for rolling.</div><div id="00:05:06.440" class="transcript_line"> I could never understand that,</div><div id="00:05:07.980" class="transcript_line"> because most of the stuff that we could do was what we could do here, you know.</div><div id="00:05:12.080" class="transcript_line"> But it was a situation where...</div><div id="00:05:15.680" class="transcript_line"> sometimes you knew the night before where you were going,</div><div id="00:05:18.720" class="transcript_line"> sometimes you didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:05:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you&#039;d come in and the boss would say,</div><div id="00:05:22.180" class="transcript_line"> his nephew&#039;s had your load, he&#039;s only gone to the Midlands,</div><div id="00:05:25.280" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got to go to Lincoln.</div><div id="00:05:27.140" class="transcript_line"> Lincoln cross country, from here.</div><div id="00:05:30.380" class="transcript_line"> The only fast road you could call it is the A38,</div><div id="00:05:33.240" class="transcript_line"> which is the dual carriageway that runs to Derby and Nottingham.</div><div id="00:05:36.480" class="transcript_line"> There was no big motorways, so you went the long way round.</div><div id="00:05:40.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d always give his nephew, or there&#039;s two nephews, Graham and Philip, the easy jobs,</div><div id="00:05:46.040" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d have the best wagons.</div><div id="00:05:48.280" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a 40-odd-year-old lorry there.</div><div id="00:05:51.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the GKE lorry, it&#039;s the company that had it, if you haven&#039;t.</div><div id="00:05:55.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll show you now.</div><div id="00:05:56.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the gas for the company at any point.</div><div id="00:06:00.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the guest king of the night-opera&#039;s wagon.</div><div id="00:06:02.180" class="transcript_line"> But exactly the same type of lorry we had,</div><div id="00:06:05.080" class="transcript_line"> with the same type of trailer,</div><div id="00:06:06.680" class="transcript_line"> but not to the tip of the left,</div><div id="00:06:07.980" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d have to put a magnet in and drag the stuff up and down and get it emptied that way.</div><div id="00:06:11.180" class="transcript_line"> And they were pretty rubbish.</div><div id="00:06:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Won&#039;t pull you that off.</div><div id="00:06:14.380" class="transcript_line"> He was carrying 32 ton overall with the load on the vehicle.</div><div id="00:06:18.980" class="transcript_line"> And especially when he went up to sort of, like, bleeds up the motorway,</div><div id="00:06:22.980" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d have more of his witting past, he&#039;d have more weight on.</div><div id="00:06:25.880" class="transcript_line"> And he thinks, yes, I&#039;ve got to, you know, what is this like?</div><div id="00:06:28.080" class="transcript_line"> But with these trailers, this is the drop side, they never drop side, they&#039;re solid.</div><div id="00:06:34.480" class="transcript_line"> This one&#039;s a tipper, there&#039;s a ram at the back of that to sit up.</div><div id="00:06:37.580" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t have that, we just had the one for attempting with magnets.</div><div id="00:06:42.080" class="transcript_line"> But there was a couple of steel stockholders as well,</div><div id="00:06:45.480" class="transcript_line"> we used to take the steel to,</div><div id="00:06:47.080" class="transcript_line"> and then they would sell it on to whatever company wanted it,</div><div id="00:06:49.980" class="transcript_line"> whether it was in this country or abroad anyway.</div><div id="00:06:52.780" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d just sell it to Germany.</div><div id="00:06:54.880" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d just sell it, hang on, two anomalies there, Sheffield,</div><div id="00:06:58.480" class="transcript_line"> the biggest lot of steelworks in the world, not enough.</div><div id="00:07:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And Germany was one of the next second biggest, the Roar Valley and all this, you know.</div><div id="00:07:05.880" class="transcript_line"> And you often wonder, what the hell you were doing.</div><div id="00:07:08.180" class="transcript_line"> It was a job, I suppose, you know, we did it.</div><div id="00:07:10.680" class="transcript_line"> But we should bring the stuff back in,</div><div id="00:07:13.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, these are magnets here full of coke and stuff,</div><div id="00:07:16.780" class="transcript_line"> way down there, they&#039;d go down the road, right down here,</div><div id="00:07:19.980" class="transcript_line"> and there should be a scrap bay, we should pull in the scrap bay and load it there.</div><div id="00:07:25.680" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of stuff.</div><div id="00:07:27.080" class="transcript_line"> And of course, when you stamp something,</div><div id="00:07:28.880" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a bit like if you do pastry, there&#039;s always a skin around the edge of it.</div><div id="00:07:32.680" class="transcript_line"> And when they were stamping crack chaps and congoats with the engines,</div><div id="00:07:36.080" class="transcript_line"> there was always that little bit left over.</div><div id="00:07:37.980" class="transcript_line"> So they did bring that back as well to different companies.</div><div id="00:07:40.480" class="transcript_line"> That would keep the work slow and scrap from all over the bloody place, you know.</div><div id="00:07:44.980" class="transcript_line"> They were even fetching it at one time from up to here.</div><div id="00:07:48.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, and I thought, well, it was something.</div><div id="00:07:51.880" class="transcript_line"> They were cutting ships up in the one on the coastal town,</div><div id="00:07:56.380" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure which one it was, on the west coast.</div><div id="00:07:59.280" class="transcript_line"> They were cutting ships up and they were bringing pieces like that.</div><div id="00:08:02.980" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d cut them up into squares and then bring them back to this country for de-melted.</div><div id="00:08:06.780" class="transcript_line"> Which I suppose is recycling in the way, you know.</div><div id="00:08:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it wasn&#039;t a bad job.</div><div id="00:08:11.880" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t pay very well.</div><div id="00:08:13.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this was £70.</div><div id="00:08:15.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m looking at my pay packets here.</div><div id="00:08:17.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got to hire my hoarder to keep things delicious.</div><div id="00:08:19.780" class="transcript_line"> I know I shouldn&#039;t, this is called preserve.</div><div id="00:08:21.980" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got a pay packet from 1979</div><div id="00:08:25.380" class="transcript_line"> and I was taking home £23.70 for a week.</div><div id="00:08:29.680" class="transcript_line"> That was working a 50 hour week.</div><div id="00:08:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And how much would that have been now?</div><div id="00:08:36.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you got paid the rate now, it&#039;d be on about maybe £200 a week.</div><div id="00:08:42.080" class="transcript_line"> But then, I suppose it was a job and just carried on.</div><div id="00:08:44.780" class="transcript_line"> But the GKN lads were on £40 a week more than us.</div><div id="00:08:48.080" class="transcript_line"> And they had, well, except for that for anything, they had decent wagons.</div><div id="00:08:52.080" class="transcript_line"> And they were changing their units and track trailers every couple of years.</div><div id="00:08:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Where, I was with Moss.</div><div id="00:08:57.780" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the wagon I&#039;d drive, it was TCA Travel 4J,</div><div id="00:09:02.180" class="transcript_line"> the old J, red with the sepix on the end there, not on the beginning of it.</div><div id="00:09:07.980" class="transcript_line"> And it was a 1960 wagon and I was driving a 1978, 79.</div><div id="00:09:13.580" class="transcript_line"> And bearing in mind, it&#039;s a total mileage.</div><div id="00:09:17.680" class="transcript_line"> A lot of hard mileage pulling heavy loads.</div><div id="00:09:20.980" class="transcript_line"> Not like your car, see you&#039;re standing here, you&#039;re going to step around the country</div><div id="00:09:23.880" class="transcript_line"> and clock up maybe 10,000 miles in a month.</div><div id="00:09:26.880" class="transcript_line"> These have got 100,000 or 1,000 miles and they were going around the clock again, you know.</div><div id="00:09:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Did you have much problems with them?</div><div id="00:09:33.980" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:35.480" class="transcript_line"> His motto was, if it&#039;s not broken, don&#039;t fix it.</div><div id="00:09:40.480" class="transcript_line"> You know, you hear a noise and you think, take it to the fetter and the fetter says, what&#039;s wrong with it?</div><div id="00:09:43.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, and before the fetter had something to do with it, leave it until it goes.</div><div id="00:09:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Now bearing in mind, you went just nipping round Wrexham.</div><div id="00:09:50.980" class="transcript_line"> You went to Lees, you went to Durham.</div><div id="00:09:53.280" class="transcript_line"> And I had one of these go, a wheel bearing collapsed on the trailer there.</div><div id="00:09:58.480" class="transcript_line"> And it was on the M56.</div><div id="00:10:01.480" class="transcript_line"> So I had to pull on the hard shoulder.</div><div id="00:10:02.980" class="transcript_line"> Of course, as soon as I...</div><div id="00:10:04.480" class="transcript_line"> You never place them around when you want one.</div><div id="00:10:06.480" class="transcript_line"> As soon as you stop, they&#039;re coming out of everywhere, you know.</div><div id="00:10:08.480" class="transcript_line"> And this cop said, what are you stop for?</div><div id="00:10:09.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, the bearing&#039;s collapsed.</div><div id="00:10:12.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, if I follow you, can you get to the next service station?</div><div id="00:10:15.480" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, the next service station&#039;s at 10 miles off the road.</div><div id="00:10:17.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s dangerous.</div><div id="00:10:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what are you going to do?</div><div id="00:10:20.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ve just phoned you on them radio-dose phones you have on the side of the motorway.</div><div id="00:10:24.480" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, the boss come with the fetter.</div><div id="00:10:27.480" class="transcript_line"> And he said, what have you done to it?</div><div id="00:10:29.480" class="transcript_line"> I said, I don&#039;t know, I was sitting in the cab.</div><div id="00:10:32.480" class="transcript_line"> He said, you must have done something to it.</div><div id="00:10:33.980" class="transcript_line"> He said, it wouldn&#039;t go like that.</div><div id="00:10:34.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, this is the trailer.</div><div id="00:10:36.480" class="transcript_line"> I was telling you about a fortnight ago, and it was just making noise.</div><div id="00:10:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Now the bearing&#039;s collapsed.</div><div id="00:10:40.480" class="transcript_line"> And the wheel, the two wheels up it were on the side of the road.</div><div id="00:10:43.480" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just as well it was that side, and not the road side, otherwise it would have gone through some weird care.</div><div id="00:10:47.480" class="transcript_line"> But he just wouldn&#039;t listen.</div><div id="00:10:51.480" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever meet Raymond then when you were here?</div><div id="00:10:54.980" class="transcript_line"> Not until he&#039;d come here.</div><div id="00:10:56.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the works was a big site, obviously.</div><div id="00:10:59.480" class="transcript_line"> How many people do you think were at that time?</div><div id="00:11:02.980" class="transcript_line"> Somebody asked me that question.</div><div id="00:11:04.480" class="transcript_line"> How many people worked in Brombeis?</div><div id="00:11:05.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, about half of them.</div><div id="00:11:07.980" class="transcript_line"> At the end of the, when it closed, there was just over a thousand.</div><div id="00:11:12.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say there was just two and a half thousand somewhere, two thousand, two hundred, something like that.</div><div id="00:11:17.980" class="transcript_line"> But there were a lot of contractors as well.</div><div id="00:11:20.980" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have contractors coming in to do certain jobs.</div><div id="00:11:23.980" class="transcript_line"> The electricians would be doing their job, their own electricians would be doing their job.</div><div id="00:11:28.480" class="transcript_line"> And if something else came up, they&#039;d have to put electricians in because they wouldn&#039;t have enough to cover.</div><div id="00:11:32.480" class="transcript_line"> And you imagine the site.</div><div id="00:11:33.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s what you&#039;d thought, so that&#039;s all the way there.</div><div id="00:11:37.980" class="transcript_line"> From there, right over here, all the way through to there.</div><div id="00:11:40.980" class="transcript_line"> All that there, half a thousand.</div><div id="00:11:42.980" class="transcript_line"> But all that there was a steelwork site.</div><div id="00:11:45.980" class="transcript_line"> And you could have, maybe four or five electricians, they&#039;d be working on something there, there and there.</div><div id="00:11:49.980" class="transcript_line"> And then somebody would go round here.</div><div id="00:11:51.980" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d sort of drag somebody from upside to do that.</div><div id="00:11:55.980" class="transcript_line"> But this office block here, I&#039;ve got to have that down.</div><div id="00:11:59.980" class="transcript_line"> Because that would have been a hell of a good youth centre.</div><div id="00:12:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And I mean a good youth centre.</div><div id="00:12:04.980" class="transcript_line"> There was two big canteens there, where the kids could have played pool, table tennis, McGovernies or this way.</div><div id="00:12:10.980" class="transcript_line"> Office space, the lot.</div><div id="00:12:12.980" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, it&#039;s in the way of the road.</div><div id="00:12:14.980" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, hang on a minute.</div><div id="00:12:16.980" class="transcript_line"> The Romans left this country thousands of years ago and they were the only ones to build straight roads.</div><div id="00:12:19.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, you can go round here, because the road&#039;s coming through here now.</div><div id="00:12:23.980" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you&#039;ve probably got to do with the box of the road a bit.</div><div id="00:12:27.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit faster.</div><div id="00:12:29.980" class="transcript_line"> A perfectly good office block, mate, built in the 60s.</div><div id="00:12:31.980" class="transcript_line"> And they said, no, knock it down.</div><div id="00:12:33.980" class="transcript_line"> When was that?</div><div id="00:12:35.980" class="transcript_line"> 1993, 1994.</div><div id="00:12:39.980" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got photographs of it somewhere, with the dates on somewhere.</div><div id="00:12:43.980" class="transcript_line"> Bright money, and then I&#039;d try to finish with a haulage.</div><div id="00:12:46.980" class="transcript_line"> I worked in a company up here called Slagmere&#039;s Dock.</div><div id="00:12:48.980" class="transcript_line"> It was separating the waste products from what could be pre-melted.</div><div id="00:12:52.980" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s 23 years last month, on the 22nd of August, 1983, I had an accident.</div><div id="00:13:01.980" class="transcript_line"> I got crushed between two naphtone pieces of steel.</div><div id="00:13:04.980" class="transcript_line"> It did me in the pelvis, my spine, my leg.</div><div id="00:13:06.980" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I&#039;ve got a character now in me, otherwise I&#039;d fall over.</div><div id="00:13:09.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the falling over, but it&#039;s trying to get back up again.</div><div id="00:13:12.980" class="transcript_line"> But it was a job.</div><div id="00:13:14.980" class="transcript_line"> And the money there was brilliant.</div><div id="00:13:17.980" class="transcript_line"> You were working on ships.</div><div id="00:13:19.980" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t want to work night ships.</div><div id="00:13:23.980" class="transcript_line"> So they decided that it was going to be six to three day ships, and three till midnight.</div><div id="00:13:28.980" class="transcript_line"> Now we&#039;d have to do the bloody night anyway.</div><div id="00:13:31.980" class="transcript_line"> So what was the problem with working nights?</div><div id="00:13:33.980" class="transcript_line"> It was on the day ship that day.</div><div id="00:13:36.980" class="transcript_line"> And a guy got a hoist, lifted the steel, what do you call it, about 30-odd foot long.</div><div id="00:13:43.980" class="transcript_line"> And I was standing next to it, in a hole like that, across the air, bang.</div><div id="00:13:49.980" class="transcript_line"> And it just turned to face it.</div><div id="00:13:51.980" class="transcript_line"> If I&#039;d been standing side on, his pelvis would have folded in on me, gone to the specialist.</div><div id="00:13:55.980" class="transcript_line"> And I was hit, finished.</div><div id="00:13:58.980" class="transcript_line"> 43, couldn&#039;t get a job anyway.</div></div></p>
