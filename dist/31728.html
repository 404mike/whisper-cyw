    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Butterfly Effect</div><div id="00:00:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the first time that you hit me?</div><div id="00:00:17.720" class="transcript_line"> A left out plate triggered it off, a little domino falling, culminating in a quick sting,</div><div id="00:00:24.840" class="transcript_line"> a piece of fresh fruit, soft and velvety, now bruised, the sweetness of taste, a little</div><div id="00:00:31.800" class="transcript_line"> bitter now and prone to take rot.</div><div id="00:00:34.600" class="transcript_line"> I cried and phoned Mum, she served up some lines taken out of the jar labelled coping.</div><div id="00:00:40.600" class="transcript_line"> But you were so high on a pedestal, built up from the dust, brought in from some old</div><div id="00:00:46.440" class="transcript_line"> places, bedrooms filled with pink and wishes for towers of ivory, a child vacuum pulling</div><div id="00:00:53.320" class="transcript_line"> for a touch.</div><div id="00:00:54.760" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t see your faults up close.</div><div id="00:00:57.320" class="transcript_line"> This tower was cracked, a dud egg in a box, yet inside I was deprived of that sight.</div><div id="00:01:03.880" class="transcript_line"> So when you said I only did it to teach you, I actually thanked you.</div><div id="00:01:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Like the fool, I danced around in bells, trying to keep you with a smile.</div><div id="00:01:14.760" class="transcript_line"> I gave you flowers and songs, false grunts and perfect poses.</div><div id="00:01:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I gave you the benefit of the doubt so many times that the doubt began to change.</div><div id="00:01:26.280" class="transcript_line"> A caterpillar, my heart, young and hungry, ate up your blame and your childhood rages.</div><div id="00:01:32.840" class="transcript_line"> I consumed them for you.</div><div id="00:01:35.200" class="transcript_line"> The memory of those bullies who chased you at school, put you in a ring made from bags</div><div id="00:01:39.560" class="transcript_line"> and scuffed knees, beat you in formation like a ritual each day, and you kept it secret</div><div id="00:01:46.560" class="transcript_line"> like you&#039;d soiled yourself and were too scared to say.</div><div id="00:01:50.160" class="transcript_line"> So my pity and magnet held me to you, tin man, devoid of something vital.</div><div id="00:01:56.400" class="transcript_line"> I took your life&#039;s lines, waved the threads of them into a cocoon.</div><div id="00:02:00.600" class="transcript_line"> I bound up my mouth and trapped words went bad, a compost formed right for some growth.</div><div id="00:02:07.600" class="transcript_line"> And so I festered and melted all down, went back to a primordial soup made of hugs and</div><div id="00:02:13.800" class="transcript_line"> a lullaby hush.</div><div id="00:02:16.280" class="transcript_line"> What a wonder it was to find that I&#039;d grown wings, fragile membranes, new and quite raw.</div><div id="00:02:22.840" class="transcript_line"> I struggled myself loose, bore out of my bindings, and I found a window then and let them unfurl.</div><div id="00:02:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I flew out of the tower, your princess, no more.</div><div id="00:02:33.840" class="transcript_line"> So now looking back at the arc of my days, seeing how a proverb breathes, as closed doors</div><div id="00:02:41.080" class="transcript_line"> do reveal ones that open.</div><div id="00:02:43.400" class="transcript_line"> I can thank you quietly, almost under my breath, for what to the world looked like a caterpillar</div><div id="00:02:51.400" class="transcript_line"> was to the caterpillar but a fly.</div><div id="00:02:54.400" class="transcript_line"> I danced with my friends last night, wild Celtic women, our faces alight, with the joy</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> of our bodies, unfettered responses to this tribal fusion, Afro and Celt, an outburst</div><div id="00:03:21.640" class="transcript_line"> of freedom, pure and heartfelt.</div><div id="00:03:35.160" class="transcript_line"> So this is a poem I wrote ages ago actually.</div><div id="00:03:38.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called The Weed.</div><div id="00:03:41.320" class="transcript_line"> I was never as pure as the lily, never as sweet as the rose.</div><div id="00:03:45.640" class="transcript_line"> I was a thing that strangled up, an ugly dirty bit of scrub that suffocated buttercups and</div><div id="00:03:51.520" class="transcript_line"> muscled in on marigolds.</div><div id="00:03:54.080" class="transcript_line"> Unlike the lily I toiled, and unlike the rose I did not bud.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a thing that clambered, climbed, a filthy root that grew in slime.</div><div id="00:04:02.440" class="transcript_line"> On daisy heads and daffs I dined, and through my roots I ate up mud.</div><div id="00:04:07.280" class="transcript_line"> The lily wears an elegant gown, the rose wears elaborate garb.</div><div id="00:04:11.360" class="transcript_line"> I was a thin and dirty child, but now I&#039;m fat and strong and wild.</div><div id="00:04:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Whole families of flowers have been defiled by my poisoned barbs.</div><div id="00:04:20.120" class="transcript_line"> The lily cries sweetly for mercy, the rose bends his soft head and begs.</div><div id="00:04:24.960" class="transcript_line"> But I am a thing without feeling or fears.</div><div id="00:04:27.160" class="transcript_line"> They fall on deaf ears as I squeeze dry their tears and drink their sweet sap to the dregs.</div><div id="00:04:41.880" class="transcript_line"> This hearth&#039;s a magic invitation.</div><div id="00:04:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Every memory feels elemental forces, igniting nerve endings, zinging the senses alert, gathering</div><div id="00:04:53.200" class="transcript_line"> for shamanic ritual, offering to source.</div><div id="00:04:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:05:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Celebrations, energy, healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:05:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Dancing and singing, drumming and thinking, healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:05:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Nurture, desire, strength, commitment and boundaries.</div><div id="00:05:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Anointed with boggy earth blood blessing, hedonistic bodies crackle and moan in the</div><div id="00:05:23.280" class="transcript_line"> trees and in the tents.</div><div id="00:05:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Base chakra sinks and opens, yogic lubrication attunes muscles to dance the soul of Nia.</div><div id="00:05:34.200" class="transcript_line"> Shoulder spiral concentrates Aikido Chi.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Sink holeing powerful vibrations into radial wand, allowing hands to sculpt and mould,</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> enfold raw elemental offerings, returning to source.</div><div id="00:05:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:05:52.720" class="transcript_line"> Dancing with intent.</div><div id="00:05:54.880" class="transcript_line"> Healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:05:57.120" class="transcript_line"> Fingers with focus flowing.</div><div id="00:05:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Healing the earth, healing myself.</div><div id="00:06:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Nurture, desire, strength, commitment and boundaries.</div><div id="00:06:06.760" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:09.880" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:15.960" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:19.320" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:22.440" class="transcript_line"> We trip before we get up again.</div><div id="00:06:24.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m in Kinspite in Wales, which was recently in bloom in the National Botanic Garden and</div><div id="00:06:30.120" class="transcript_line"> I went and saw it and it was a bloody ugly thing, huge, massive, monstrous, grey, looked</div><div id="00:06:35.120" class="transcript_line"> like a big bulging head.</div><div id="00:06:38.720" class="transcript_line"> But when it bloomed it was beautiful, it was amazing, it had these lovely golden cups and</div><div id="00:06:44.600" class="transcript_line"> they were full of nectar and you can drink them, humans can drink them, animals can drink</div><div id="00:06:49.400" class="transcript_line"> them and it kind of gives you a high.</div><div id="00:06:51.880" class="transcript_line"> So this is a poem about that plant, it&#039;s called a Puyya plant, which is kind of a horrible</div><div id="00:06:57.760" class="transcript_line"> name as well for this thing.</div><div id="00:06:59.760" class="transcript_line"> It only blooms every ten years, so that was in April this year and this is a poem for</div><div id="00:07:05.120" class="transcript_line"> the Puyya.</div><div id="00:07:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Puyya, they call you, the words sticky in their mouths.</div><div id="00:07:11.960" class="transcript_line"> You prickle the roof of the glass house and settle the groups of visiting classes.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a nettle your leaves are sting sharp, laced with thorns.</div><div id="00:07:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Cruel, they remark, your taste is for animal flesh, which they hook, pull in and starve</div><div id="00:07:25.960" class="transcript_line"> to death.</div><div id="00:07:27.160" class="transcript_line"> Their blood is your food, your bed more wet with this than dew.</div><div id="00:07:31.960" class="transcript_line"> From the Andes to Llanarthni you came, a monster baby in a way, eight feet tall and closer</div><div id="00:07:37.780" class="transcript_line"> to a mutant than a flower.</div><div id="00:07:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Towering above the others, a giant in the nursery.</div><div id="00:07:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Cursed to slowness, reliant on your new owners, still you grew, your brontosaurus neck too</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> thick for them to prune, a Chilean imposter that loomed above its human masters.</div><div id="00:07:55.040" class="transcript_line"> But now, a decade later, you&#039;re in bud, about to blossom.</div><div id="00:07:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Your body is round and fulsome as a woman&#039;s.</div><div id="00:08:02.200" class="transcript_line"> Crowds come to marvel, wondering at your beauty, eyes hunger for your form.</div><div id="00:08:07.160" class="transcript_line"> Cameras snap and looks are thrown, but sweeter than before.</div><div id="00:08:10.560" class="transcript_line"> You ignore them, take no note.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Your name now sweet as nectar in every thirsting throat.</div></div></p>
