    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I have been asked to record my experiences, my wartime experiences of World War II.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Who am I? My name is Dennis Tidswell. I live in Pembroke.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m now 98 and a half years old, and unfortunately that wonderful human faculty of memory does begin to fade.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So before it goes completely, I will make every endeavor to talk about those experiences, something that I hadn&#039;t done before.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I think to appreciate my feelings during the wartime, and my experiences, it would help a little to go back to my childhood days to know what you&#039;re dealing with.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I was brought up in a small village called Gindros, which is about three and a half miles outside of Swansea.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was a member of the Swansea Police Force.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He, during the First World War, was in the Grenadier Guards and rose through the ranks and at the end of that war was granted a commission.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Now he always told me that in the forces, if you wanted a commission, you needed a private income, which was something I didn&#039;t have when I came to the point of becoming a member of the forces.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> During my young days, society in Forrest Falk and indeed the whole of Wales was passing through a very deeply religious fervor.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There were indeed two fractions of society. There were the deeply religious and then there were the otherwise non-believers who had a very different kind of life.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But my life was church three times on a Sunday and the whole area was literally covered in Welsh chapels with names like Calvaryan, Bethany, Zion, Sarum, Teroselam, Hebrum.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was one established church, which I think was called the Church of Hysard in those days. Church in Wales hadn&#039;t appeared on the scene.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there were the other denominations of the Gospel Hall, the Baptists, the Homeward Witnesses, Salvation Army and the Congregational.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was to the Congregational Church that I was sent three times every Sunday.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So here we had this young lad brought up very strictly in a very religious atmosphere.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I vivid recollections of being taken to the largest Welsh chapel called Calvaryan in nearby Forrest Falk.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I stood I suppose about almost three feet tall at several inches of age amongst a congregation of probably, let&#039;s say 400 or more people,</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> giving full voice to the bread of heaven, which literally lifted the roof and to me was almost a terrifying experience.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> There was tremendous noise. However, that&#039;s just an aside.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The other factions of society of course were the pub goers and the billiard halls and the club goers.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Welsh soup was dry in those days. There were no drinks on a Sunday in pubs, but you could get a drink in a club.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were two very distinct factions of society.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can&#039;t say I had a particularly good education.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t able to take the eleven plus. I had as a young man a labors facial tick, which set me back a bit in that my parents took me everywhere to try and cure this.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I have distinct memories of being taken to someone called a phrenologist who made an analysis of what may be wrong with you by the bumps in your head.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, by the time I had come round to about 14 years of age, that tick unfortunately disappeared.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> My interests mainly were swimming, cycling, tennis and amateur dramatics.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> When the war broke out in 1939, I soon found myself somewhat on my own because a lot of my friends who were slightly older had joined the forces in one way or another.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I was now an insurance clerk with a company called the London Shores.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I had made up for my poor education by evening studies and getting various certificates for mathematics and accountancy, and I was studying insurance examinations.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My favorite hobbies were photography and radio.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was a keen radio amateur and in the early 30s we were just coming out of the crystal set and moving into wireless sets made with thermionic valves.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So he had taught me how to build a wireless set.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So one day I took it into my head that I would like to join the Royal Air Force.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Another one of my hobbies was aerial modeling and flying model airplanes.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So one particular morning I would go to the RAF recruiting office at the bottom of Page Street in Swansea and sat in front of this group of these RAF officers.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what age are you my boy? I&#039;m 17. Come back when you&#039;re 18.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> As I passed the sergeant at the entrance way, he said, you&#039;re 18 next week, aren&#039;t you boy?</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, no, it&#039;s next July. You&#039;re 18 next week, aren&#039;t you boy?</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got the message and I kept...</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Two or three weeks later I found myself sitting in front of this group of RAF officers at the recruitment center.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They go into your educational background and then ask about your past times and hobbies.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> When I mentioned that I was interested in wireless and could build a wireless set, they cottoned onto that one and talked very much about that.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to train very much as a pilot.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the whole object in joining the Air Force, to learn to fly and to be a pilot.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But they said that why wouldn&#039;t I join now as a radio operator?</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then at some later date I could quite easily remaster and train as a pilot.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But things didn&#039;t quite turn out that way.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> A radio operator had nothing to do with flying at all, I discovered.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It was really very high frequency intercommunication between ground and aircraft.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was all different to what I intended, but I went along with that.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And in a matter of a couple of months really I was called up.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Apparently they were very short of radio operators at that particular time.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So here we had this somewhat naive young man leaving home for the very first time to go out into the big wide world.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother cried, my father said, I&#039;ll make a man out of him.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And off I went and started at Uxbridge, which was a recruiting centre.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then on to Padgate, in terms of language.</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I seldom have ever heard the F word. That was certainly not part of the vocabulary.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> In July 1940 I turned up at the recruiting centre at Uxbridge amongst quite a few others, hundreds of people.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We were put into groups of about 50 and we were sworn in.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And here you agree to obey orders and keep to the King&#039;s regulations.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So no one had ever read them. And of course an allegiance to the sovereign.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And once you had sworn those orders you were no longer a civilian, you were now a member of HM forces.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And indeed this was a defining moment which put you firmly in your place.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I was now an Aircraftman, second class.</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were then directed to some tents which were on grassland between some rather nice looking brick buildings.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were not to be our sleeping place. We were shown where we were to sleep.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was in a tent on a straw palliats which was damp and musty and smelly.</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> With one blanket and a sausage, a canvas bag, I suppose about 9 inches in diameter.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was your pillow and that was where you were to sleep. Henceforth you were to wash and shave in cold water.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Now this indeed was a second part of the culture shock. However that was only to last about 4 or 5 days.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were then put into a billet as it was called, which was like a Nissan hut with cast iron pipes.</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Fortunately it was July so there was a reasonable temperature.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it contained a number of steel bed frames with the wire springs across. And three were called biscuits.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were the mattresses you slept on divided into three sections.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And two blankets, rather coarse things, made you scratch your niche. And the sausage as a pillow.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was your sleeping quarter.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a corporal&#039;s room at the end and the corporal was invariably a regular airman.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And the chairman sort of shat because he would wake you up in the morning very politely.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Come on here sods, wakey, wakey, get your hands out your cocks and get moving and stand by your beds at 8 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Very friendly sort of, you know, got a greeting.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, when you stood by your beds you were taught how to stand to attention for the only officer who came out, looked you up and down from bed to bed.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt this business of being stood to attention not very much to my liking.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were usually commanded to stand to attention in the presence of an officer.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the command of stand to attention is being like placed in an invisible straitjacket with your arms bound to your sides and your legs immobilized and your brain literally numbed by the aura of class distinction.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I found this was an ultimate humiliation and I felt degradation.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Now they put you in your place and at their mercy more move or twit an eyebrow at your peril.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> However, there was no going back.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I had sworn allegiance to a sovereign, one I had never met or ever likely to, yet under whom I was prepared to sacrifice the one life I had.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So it behoved me now, I felt, to accept my surroundings and I volunteered for it, so just get on with it.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that was the right move because otherwise life could have been very miserable indeed.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, at Uxbridge you then came to being kitted out.</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Kitted out. You&#039;re saying farewell to your civilian clothes and you&#039;re now about to don a uniform.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> In this great big hall, loads of tables and piles of clothes, you woke up to the counter, height five foot two, and could fly at you a tunic.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Before that you&#039;d been given a white kit bag. It stood about three foot high, a little bit of foot in diameter, and for the time being you simply put all this uniform into this kit bag.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So it came flying at you at the rate of knots. Length of inside length? 27. Okay.</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> All this clothing, shirt, dress, pants came hurling at you and then the one final thing, a pair of boots.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I never wore boots in my life, but I was about to learn what it was like because at Uxbridge you were taken out on to the parade ground by the drill sergeant, who was another very polite gentleman.</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I won&#039;t repeat a lot of the way he described us, but anyway, marching back up and down, the boots were chuffing my ankles, and red wool legs around my ankles.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You were given a rifle now. What did the rifle have to do with the RAF? I don&#039;t know, but of course you had to learn the appropriate drill.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were given a Lee-Enfield rifle, no bullets, and all the cleaning kit and the gear, and trained how to use it in marching and on parade.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> When I turned came to do a guard duty at night, you present yourself with a guard room, and they tell you you take your sentry post at the station entrance, and obviously you challenge any on-comer who goes on.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, well, where are the bullets? They said, give me those bullets. So you were guarded in the place, but you didn&#039;t have any bullets, but now all that stage passed, and eventually they knocked us into shape,</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and we were able, I think, to march reasonably well.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Before we leave Atbridge, there&#039;s a couple of other recollections popped up, and I&#039;m not really sure whether I should include them, because things have got to be so politically correct in this year 2021.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But way back in 1940, I think I should really tell it like it was, and in no way dress it up, but we were all lined up for ATT inoculation, anti-tetanus and typhoid.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So there stood two men in white coats, I presume one was a doctor, I don&#039;t know, and on this high table were three kidney-shaped white enamel dishes with a blue rim around the top.</div><div id="00:25:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They were filled with methylated spirits, and there were two rather large needles, the actual needle of which was not like the fine one that there is nowadays, it was really like a very fine nail, really.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, there were hundreds of blokes lined up, there were two people, you came along, got it jabbed into your arm, and then that particular needle was thrown into the dish of mass where the other man rinsed it out and refilled it, and in sequence.</div><div id="00:26:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So those two needles really injected hundreds of men. That was the ATT inoculation.</div><div id="00:26:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And then one day we were all marched up to this large room and all seated down in front of a screen, cinema fashion, and we were shown a film about venereal disease.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, looking at ages 18 to 25ish, the likes of me would never have had any sexual education at all, either school, college, home, anywhere.</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So this film showed the graphic detail, the horrors that had gone over here, and in the end it showed this chubby, rather like a violent, epileptic fit, who was in the advanced stages of her life.</div><div id="00:28:03.000" class="transcript_line"> In the stages of syphilatic locomotor attack here.</div><div id="00:28:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But at least this had served the purpose of sex for quite a while, but at least it had taught most of us something of which we had precious little knowledge before.</div><div id="00:28:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then to round this off, the real classic was the FFI parade. Now, I&#039;ve no idea what an FFI parade was, but we soon found out you stood in a long line in order to drop your trousers and roll up your shirt and expose your genitals.</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, hmm, then we realized we were free from infection inspection. Wonderful to lady doctor, but then there weren&#039;t many lady doctors in those days, and if it had been the sight of almost hundreds of willies, it would have given us a nervous breakdown.</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, along comes this doctor, I presume, medical officer, and he&#039;s carrying like a musical conductor&#039;s baton.</div><div id="00:29:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, anyhow again, he sticks it under someone&#039;s willy and makes a bit of a close examination and sees it well done.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the point at which I think I should end my description of Oxbridge and then move on to the next posting, which was Padgate.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I should explain at this point, I&#039;m taking my dictation from recollections from my RAF record sheet, which I obtained from the RAF records office in Gloucester,</div><div id="00:30:43.000" class="transcript_line"> way back in March 98, and things are getting a little bit hazy here. I&#039;ll read you a letter. Thank you for your letter dated February 98.</div><div id="00:31:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry to have to tell you that at this late date only a very brief record of your service in the Royal Air Force is now held at the RM Headquarters personnel and training command.</div><div id="00:31:17.000" class="transcript_line"> This record was compiled at the time of your service and contains very little detail of your postings and movements at that time.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> However, I have enclosed a photograph of your service taken from the remaining record, which I hope will be of interest to you.</div><div id="00:31:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Now here in the record, after Padgate, there is a gap, and it says number one wing, sing 6RC, which I take to be a recruiting center.</div><div id="00:31:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The next posting in September 40 is to the RAF station at Tuxford, and I have some recollections of that.</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But between leaving Padgate and arriving at Tuxford, we must have acquired the necessary skills to operate this VHF radio system, because Tuxford was the operational headquarters at that time, I think, of number 12 group.</div><div id="00:32:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a recollection of looking up and seeing the old dog right, and of course Tuxford played a very active part in the Battle of Britain.</div><div id="00:33:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But be that as it may, I only stayed at Tuxford for something like a month or so, and now I get posted in October 40 to the RAF Signal School at Cranwell in Lincolnshire.</div><div id="00:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Now Cranwell in Lincolnshire was the RAF training college, and I learned another aspect of radio operating which did interest me very much, and that was called VHF-DF, very high frequency direction finding.</div><div id="00:33:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a means of radio communication which enabled us to establish the position for our own aircraft, radar being very much in its infancy at that stage.</div><div id="00:34:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So fighter command in particular relied on VHF-DF, which consisted of three units, something like 40 or so miles apart, from which you drew a line on a bearing taken on their equipment.</div><div id="00:34:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And formed what was known as a cocked hat, and in that cocked hat was the position of our own aircraft.</div><div id="00:35:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Radio transmission on VHF at ground levels was optical, but air to ground and ground to air was very clear reception.</div><div id="00:35:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And sitting, listening out, which we had to do for very long periods at a time, was just listening to a quiet sort of motion, like a pshhhhhh.</div><div id="00:35:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And the equipment was set up in wooden towers, and the beauty of all this was those towers were generally well away from any air force establishment.</div><div id="00:35:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a little unit on its own, and most times the RAF personnel operating it were in civilian pilots.</div><div id="00:36:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So to be away from RAF military discipline and operating in one of these units appealed to me very much.</div><div id="00:36:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I set my stall out for that at Cranwell, and over a period of, let me see, something like a month or six weeks, qualified as a VHF-DF operator.</div><div id="00:36:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was then sent to a station in Curtin and Lindsay in Lincolnshire. That was in November 1940.</div><div id="00:37:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now all this time I was still radio operated on the ground when really I joined this outfit to learn to fly and to be a member of air crew.</div><div id="00:37:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a recollection of going to Cardington and sitting in front of this panel of RAF officers.</div><div id="00:37:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Now according to my records that took place in May 1941. This was a selection board for air crew.</div><div id="00:38:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I see according to my record it reads, accepted for training as pilot, observer, wireless RPG, 8-5-1941.</div><div id="00:38:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So from that date onward I was waiting to go for air crew training.</div><div id="00:38:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But then out of the blue at Curtin and Lindsay along comes a sergeant and says, report to so and so and you&#039;re being posted abroad.</div><div id="00:39:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well now I can&#039;t go abroad, I&#039;m waiting for air crew training. You&#039;re being posted abroad.</div><div id="00:39:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And she says, can I have an interview with the commanding officer? You are being posted abroad.</div><div id="00:39:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, what the hell with this? So I took it into my head to go straight up to the commanding officer&#039;s office.</div><div id="00:39:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So leading aircast man Tidwell goes into the station commander&#039;s office and says, I want to see the commander.</div><div id="00:39:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well upon I was pounced upon by two sergeants, took me by one arm either side, knocked my cap off and folk marched me backwards out of the office.</div><div id="00:40:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I found myself on the charge for insubordination. So the following day I appeared in front of the station commander and offered my apologies.</div><div id="00:40:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And said, but I was listed for air crew training. Why was I being sent abroad?</div><div id="00:40:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, we too have to do as we are told. You, I understand, are a radio DF operator and wherever you&#039;re going they seem to be urgently needed.</div><div id="00:40:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m sorry, but you are going abroad. And were it not for that fact, you would be on a very serious charge.</div><div id="00:40:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And now you would be spending your time in the glass house, which was the RF term for being in prison.</div><div id="00:41:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, be that as it may, the next thing, I was kitted out for fallen service.</div><div id="00:41:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Coggy shirt, ordinary vest, tin hat, respirator, and now a backpack, a blanket and a ground sheet.</div><div id="00:41:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So you rolled your ground sheet around a blanket like a long sausage.</div><div id="00:41:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you strapped it in the form of three parts of a square on the back, around your backpack.</div><div id="00:42:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It all looked a bit like a French legionnaire, but we didn&#039;t have that neck protector like the Frenchman had.</div><div id="00:42:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But a very similar appearance. And of course all this had to be packed in this extra backpack.</div><div id="00:42:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And by now the law to carry a boat was the winter gear. But there was one bright spot about all this.</div><div id="00:42:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You no longer wore boots abroad, you had shoes. The other ranks had leather shoes.</div><div id="00:42:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The officers had hush puppies and cotton socks, whereas ranks had thick woolen socks.</div><div id="00:43:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And hush puppies, which we nicknamed brothel creepers.</div><div id="00:43:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And the trouble with the woolen sock abroad, I&#039;d come to later.</div><div id="00:43:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I found myself boarding a train for Gunnock, way up north.</div><div id="00:43:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the train we were really like sardines in a tin. Packed, packed, packed.</div><div id="00:43:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite an unpleasant journey really.</div><div id="00:43:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, at Gunnock, or Gunnock, we then went aboard various ships.</div><div id="00:44:10.000" class="transcript_line"> At Gunnock, some 1750 personnel, mainly army and probably about a third of that Royal Air Force,</div><div id="00:44:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They boarded a ship called the Leinster. The Leinster was a British and Irish ferry boat that in normal times crossed the Irish Sea on a daily basis.</div><div id="00:44:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d been taken over by the Department of Transport.</div><div id="00:44:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Leinster, in fact, she turned out to be the smallest of the convoy in which she pruned herself.</div><div id="00:45:02.000" class="transcript_line"> She just weighed 4,300 tons, while the larger merchant ship was almost 11,000 tons.</div><div id="00:45:14.000" class="transcript_line"> For the historian, this was called Operation Substance. That is in July 1941.</div><div id="00:45:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The naval coverage was quite extensive. The Nelson, the Banksman, the Edinburgh, Manchester, Arathusa, and something like seven other destroyers.</div><div id="00:45:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, none of us were aware at that time where we were bound.</div><div id="00:46:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we got aboard, we were asked if we would form marches.</div><div id="00:46:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The march was to be placed at intervals all around the ship. And on any sightings, they were to pass voice-wise back to the bridge.</div><div id="00:46:38.000" class="transcript_line"> The accommodation, I can&#039;t really remember much about the food, but what does strike me, I remember, was quite a bit of food.</div><div id="00:47:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got tape over. Where were we? Back on the Leinster.</div><div id="00:47:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the Leinster, there were 1,700 troops aboard, a mixture of army and air force, air force about 300 or so, I would say.</div><div id="00:47:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember much about the food. Sleep in accommodation, we slept in hammocks. They were all slung between all the various loads of pipes that there are on ships.</div><div id="00:48:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And one would look and see all these lines of hammocks swinging away. A hammock is a bit tricky to get into on land, but on a rolling ship it tends to be a bit tricky.</div><div id="00:48:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Leinster did roll. She didn&#039;t have any stabilizers. And we were at this time forming and maneuvering into a convoy.</div><div id="00:48:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The convoy for the benefit of the historian was to be known as Operation Substance in July 1941.</div><div id="00:49:01.000" class="transcript_line"> There were some seven odd merchant men and quite a number of naval vessels.</div><div id="00:49:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The naval vessels were the Nielsen, the Maxman, the Edinburgh, the Manchester, the Arathuja, and something like seven destroyers.</div><div id="00:49:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This operation I learned after the war, actually, when I looked up the records, was to relieve Malta, Malta being under seizure at that time, and was desperately in need of practically everything.</div><div id="00:50:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And the power to be such hammer on this convoy must get through.</div><div id="00:50:30.000" class="transcript_line"> However, we were back on the Leinster. We set sail. We were in a westerly direction for probably half a day.</div><div id="00:50:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we turned south, and I suppose after about 36 or so hours, we were told to change into our tropical gear, which we did, of course.</div><div id="00:51:14.000" class="transcript_line"> During this time, one of our radio operators, a crew, a man called Dick Watson, who was a colored gentleman from Jamaica, who had come over to the UK at his own expense just to join the World Air Force.</div><div id="00:51:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a great respect for him, but he had fallen somehow, an injury in his ankle. So in the ship&#039;s medical quarters, they&#039;d put on a light plaster. He could just hobble around.</div><div id="00:51:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So he needed to be assisted in and around, getting in and out of his hammock, etc.</div><div id="00:52:06.000" class="transcript_line"> However, we are now in our tropical gear, an enormous number of white knees, and we&#039;re heading south.</div><div id="00:52:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we next thing we find we&#039;re into the Strait of Gibraltar, and we arrive at Gibraltar.</div><div id="00:52:38.000" class="transcript_line"> We were given surely, strangely enough, and I have recollections of going to a pub in Bell Lane in Gibraltar.</div><div id="00:52:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was beer available in those days, and we all got a bit merry and went back aboard and got into a bunk and fell asleep.</div><div id="00:53:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But the next thing we know, after probably about five or six hours, the engine started up and we were on the way.</div><div id="00:53:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And quite clearly we were moving on for the rest of our voyage.</div><div id="00:53:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But all of a sudden there was one enormous bang, and the ship shook and didn&#039;t completely turn on its side, but it turned over at a very angle.</div><div id="00:54:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what I said. It leaned onto the port side, I think it was.</div><div id="00:54:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But then again, 18 years ago, it&#039;s a bit vague on detail, but we were down below, a couple of decks down.</div><div id="00:54:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And we found ourselves in almost complete darkness, a couple of chinks of light coming through.</div><div id="00:54:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But the gangways and the stairways were just at a bit of an angle and obviously in the almost dark.</div><div id="00:55:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This was a rather frightening situation, that you were trapped down below and certainly no easy access to the upper deck.</div><div id="00:55:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And we also had Dick Watson with his injured ankle.</div><div id="00:55:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, we could hear a lot of noise and banging and bumping up on the main deck.</div><div id="00:55:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we eventually did get through into daylight, the whole place really was pandemonium, really.</div><div id="00:55:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I got onto the port side because it didn&#039;t seem possible to launch lifeboats on the starboard side.</div><div id="00:56:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But I never heard an order to abandon ship, but that&#039;s clearly what was being done.</div><div id="00:56:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when I got down to the ship&#039;s rail, there were seven lifeboats, six of them absolutely chock-a-bang full.</div><div id="00:56:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And the seventh pretty well full.</div><div id="00:56:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they got Dick Watson aboard the lifeboat.</div><div id="00:56:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And from the ship&#039;s rail, I then jumped into the stern part of the last lifeboat,</div><div id="00:56:56.000" class="transcript_line"> at a distance of about six or seven feet, and you go down with a bit of a bump.</div><div id="00:57:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, I&#039;m in the stern end of the seventh tightly packed lifeboat.</div><div id="00:57:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, it&#039;s clear there was a mist just lifting.</div><div id="00:57:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I could see on the mainland a pillowbox type of thing with these soldiers.</div><div id="00:57:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And clearly the reason for the evacuation was that no one wanted to be detained in Spain.</div><div id="00:57:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Franco was very friendly with Mr. Hitler.</div><div id="00:57:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And to be his guest for the remainder of the war didn&#039;t appeal at all.</div><div id="00:58:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, the lifeboats were all put in a line and collected by a line.</div><div id="00:58:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the one lifeboat had an engine.</div><div id="00:58:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was about three-quarters of a mile out in the bay at sea.</div><div id="00:58:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a naval craft. I think it was a destroyer, but I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:58:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were a chug, chug, chug out to the destroyer, who then put us in tow.</div><div id="00:58:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he got underway, of course all the lifeboats were lifted up.</div><div id="00:58:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, next thing we know, out of the mist comes the Rock of Gibraltar.</div><div id="00:59:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had my pocket camera in my pocket.</div><div id="00:59:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And to this day I&#039;ve got some photographs that I took from the lifeboat on the Rock of Gibraltar.</div><div id="00:59:26.000" class="transcript_line"> When we got to Gibraltar, we were put aboard a ship called the Louis Pasteur,</div><div id="00:59:40.000" class="transcript_line"> which is obviously of French origin.</div><div id="00:59:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was a very, very different kettle of fish.</div><div id="00:59:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We were able to have a shower, a shower the like of which I&#039;d never seen in my life or even heard of.</div><div id="01:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Instead of the water throwing down from the shower head, it came from pipes on the side.</div><div id="01:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was called a needle shower, but the jet of water was horizontal from the side, from your feet right up to your head.</div><div id="01:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that indeed was very refreshing.</div><div id="01:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Alongside it was the French idea of a gen&#039;s toilet, because it was a long, wide, two-foot wide plank of wood,</div><div id="01:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> about 20, 25 feet long, and about every five feet a hole was cut.</div><div id="01:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was where you did your ablutions. You just sat down, had a chat.</div><div id="01:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The flushing system was quite unique.</div><div id="01:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There was something like an 8-inch pipe at one end, which was constantly flowing, a strong flow of water.</div><div id="01:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was a thorough flushing of 24 hours a day.</div><div id="01:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember much about the food.</div><div id="01:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember going down way down below into the engine room and meeting Scottish engineers who, to my astonishment, were drinking gin.</div><div id="01:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was introduced to gin. I&#039;d never tasted gin in my life, until I met these chaps.</div><div id="01:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I think I&#039;ve probably transmitted enough for this time, so we&#039;ll leave it there, and we&#039;ll come back to the moment when I&#039;m aboard the Louis Pasteur in the harbor at Gibraltar.</div><div id="01:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We are now in Gibraltar, and I think at this stage, I assume the situation in the Mediterranean might well be appropriate.</div><div id="01:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The mid being a completely landlocked sea, we are in Gibraltar, but to the north there is Spain, France, Italy, Greece, islands of Kofu and Crete,</div><div id="01:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> all occupied by hostile forces, also North Africa under the control of Rommel.</div><div id="01:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So the only British place, of course, was Malta and Gujol.</div><div id="01:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So quite clearly, if you&#039;re traveling east, that is your office and destination.</div><div id="01:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t officially told that, but that was the general buzz amongst the troops.</div><div id="01:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So from the Louis Pasteur, we were transferred to a warship called the Hermione.</div><div id="01:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The Hermione was a modern fast cruiser of the Diado class.</div><div id="01:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, she had a very short lifetime because she was commissioned in March 1941 and sunk in June 1942.</div><div id="01:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So she was torpedoed with a loss of about 700 miles.</div><div id="01:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But she was actually a very fast ship.</div><div id="01:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Its speed was 32 knots, its range was 1500 miles, and its armament was state of the art for the day.</div><div id="01:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was absolutely bristling with various guns of all sorts.</div><div id="01:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It also had torpedo tubes.</div><div id="01:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> At this time Malta was under siege, undergoing very heavy bombing.</div><div id="01:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ll just read a very short paragraph written by an historian.</div><div id="01:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Defense against such attacks and against the regular air raids were a constant drain on ammunition.</div><div id="01:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Moreover, the 1,750 troops and RAF support personnel, now in Gibraltar,</div><div id="01:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> as a result of the grounding of the Leinster, were not only urgently required on Malta, but an embarrassment where they were.</div><div id="01:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> To maintain stocks of munitions between major convoys and to push through the stranded soldiers and airmen,</div><div id="01:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Operation Steyr was run from the west.</div><div id="01:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The designated ships sailing from Gibraltar were Arathusa, Abani, and the Maxman,</div><div id="01:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> each of which embarked a quota of passengers and cases of aviation spirit, ammunition, food stamps.</div><div id="01:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The Maxman&#039;s mine decks were capacious compared with available spaces on the two cruisers,</div><div id="01:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> where every water closet and bathroom was stacked with cases, drums, cartons of food.</div><div id="01:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, when we went aboard the Abani, the skipper piped up and welcomed us aboard and said,</div><div id="01:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> he said, well now on passage I can feed you, but I&#039;ve got problems with water.</div><div id="01:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I can only allocate you a pint per person per day. And that is that.</div><div id="01:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We slept against the sides of the ship&#039;s hull.</div><div id="01:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> As we were, you didn&#039;t undress, you just slept where you could, kept your tin hat and respirator handy.</div><div id="01:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t realize it at that particular moment, but I suppose I was about to receive what you might call my baptism of fire</div><div id="01:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and realize the real horrors of war.</div><div id="01:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> On board the Abani, as with the convoy, you could volunteer for duties.</div><div id="01:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Having the experience of being down below when the ship ran aground in Algeciras Bay,</div><div id="01:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t fancy the idea of bombing at torpedo rates when I was down below.</div><div id="01:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So I volunteered to work on deck and I found myself passing boxes of ammunition to the crew gunners of the point bomb guns.</div><div id="01:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we were about two days out, something like that.</div><div id="01:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> The ship was traveling quite fast when a ship of some 7,000 odd tons was going along at 32 miles an hour.</div><div id="01:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know you&#039;re moving. But suddenly the clocks and goes, action stations, action stations.</div><div id="01:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I hadn&#039;t really had time to get up on deck before they typed out,</div><div id="01:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Stand by to ram, stand by to ram. And there was a terrific crash. The ship shutters from stem to stem and then carried on sailing.</div><div id="01:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It turned out we had rammed an Italian submarine called the Tambien which was charging its batteries at dawn on the surface.</div><div id="01:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the following ships in our wake felt the contact of the sub underneath their hooves.</div><div id="01:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Hermione sustained a gash in its bow. But I suddenly realized what a terrible way to die in a submarine being rammed by another ship.</div><div id="01:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what I mean when I say the horrors of war became apparent to me.</div><div id="01:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We were now a couple of days into the passage and we were finding it rather hot in the tail,</div><div id="01:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We were very long from the UK and I had no time to acclimatize and the bed in July was hot and below decks we hadn&#039;t changed our clothing.</div><div id="01:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed and hadn&#039;t even taken our clothes off for a couple of days and we were like short engine at 10.</div><div id="01:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was rather uncomfortable. But anyway, we must be now approaching the real hot spots of the passage.</div><div id="01:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We were coming up to the Sicilian Straits in the Marus and of course in Sicily we now had the Luftwaffe and the Italian Aeronautica.</div><div id="01:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The Italians did their bombing from high level but were very accurate really.</div><div id="01:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The Germans had the Ju-88s and their Stukas and we were coming to well within their range.</div><div id="01:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I had volunteered to assist in passing the ammunition boxes to the pom-pom guns on the deck and the Klaxon sounded action stations.</div><div id="01:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now was my baptism of fire because we came under air attack mainly. Bombs were all around, fortunately missing the ship.</div><div id="01:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The ship must have been doing a zigzag course because the deck never stayed still. The angle seemed to alter all the time.</div><div id="01:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The noise was absolutely terrific. The engine noise, the ship was doing its full 32 knots, the exploding shells, bombs, anti-aircraft. It was absolute pandemonium.</div><div id="01:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> However, to comment on my feelings at that time, first of all when it all started, there was one of fright.</div><div id="01:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly one of fright. And then suddenly it becomes one of excitement. And then suddenly one of aggression because you realize well it&#039;s either him or it&#039;s me.</div><div id="01:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s one of fun game. You&#039;re either going to live or you&#039;re going to die. So you have to make every endeavor to survive.</div><div id="01:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That is a feeling I should probably never have again, never particularly want to, but it&#039;s quite an experience really.</div><div id="01:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, we survived that unscathed and eventually, not very long actually, sailed into Malta harbor and tied up. I think that will be sufficient for this episode.</div></div></p>
