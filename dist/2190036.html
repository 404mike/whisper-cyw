    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m in Holy Trinity Church, interviewing people as part of the</div><div id="00:00:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Longest Yarn. I&#039;m with Bithig Cole and she&#039;s going to talk about her childhood during the</div><div id="00:00:11.440" class="transcript_line"> war in Anglesey and also other memories. Thank you Bithig. So do you want to start and tell</div><div id="00:00:17.300" class="transcript_line"> me a little bit about being a child during the war in Anglesey?</div><div id="00:00:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I was born in 1933, so when the war broke out I was sort of six, wasn&#039;t I? And just</div><div id="00:00:29.240" class="transcript_line"> remember the sort of fear and worry about everything. It didn&#039;t really mean much to</div><div id="00:00:37.080" class="transcript_line"> me as a child. And the things that happened, sort of the school, our schoolmaster was very,</div><div id="00:00:45.560" class="transcript_line"> very keen that we knew about the war. And this really, I can&#039;t say that we suffered terrible</div><div id="00:00:58.760" class="transcript_line"> hardship because we lived on the farm so we had plenty of food. But the one thing I remember</div><div id="00:01:04.520" class="transcript_line"> particularly was not being able to use the car. So we went everywhere by pony and trap.</div><div id="00:01:12.360" class="transcript_line"> Which, you know, now I think about it, it sounds quite romantic, but if you went to</div><div id="00:01:18.880" class="transcript_line"> visit family in the evenings in the winter it was not fun. And one thing I remember that</div><div id="00:01:28.760" class="transcript_line"> was the sound of the planes because then valley was becoming quite important and there was</div><div id="00:01:36.160" class="transcript_line"> always the hum and it was always the, is it one of theirs or is it one of ours? You know,</div><div id="00:01:41.880" class="transcript_line"> that sort of fear. And listening to the radio, always had to listen to the news, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:53.140" class="transcript_line"> And there were some days when the batteries had run down. My word, that was the end of</div><div id="00:01:58.980" class="transcript_line"> the world, wasn&#039;t it? Yeah, sort of lots of interesting things. I remember this African,</div><div id="00:02:10.980" class="transcript_line"> they said she was, lady used to come around and talk to the schools. In fact, I think</div><div id="00:02:17.860" class="transcript_line"> it turned out that she was a spy that was going around. Yeah. Yeah, it&#039;s some very</div><div id="00:02:28.980" class="transcript_line"> happy things as well. One unhappy thing, unfortunately, was my father died in 1943. Died suddenly,</div><div id="00:02:37.860" class="transcript_line"> had septicemia. That was quite a change in our lives. But when I talk to other people,</div><div id="00:02:47.860" class="transcript_line"> as I said, I married a man from Kent and when he talks about, talked about his experiences,</div><div id="00:02:55.460" class="transcript_line"> their life was so different from ours. He talks about spending sort of half their nights</div><div id="00:03:01.900" class="transcript_line"> in shelters and, you know, all these bombs falling around them and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:03:08.460" class="transcript_line"> We did have a few bombs in Anglesey, but nothing to speak of really. And one big event I remembered</div><div id="00:03:17.260" class="transcript_line"> was that a plane came down on a farm about three miles from us. And I suppose it was</div><div id="00:03:25.740" class="transcript_line"> a Spitfire or something, because I remember thinking it wasn&#039;t very big. You know, for a</div><div id="00:03:32.860" class="transcript_line"> sort of six-year-old to think that, it can&#039;t have been very big, can it? But everybody was there</div><div id="00:03:38.940" class="transcript_line"> around it, you know. And I suppose, really, that was one of the sort of biggest events that I can</div><div id="00:03:47.340" class="transcript_line"> remember. So did your mother cope on the farm on her own or did she have family who you could get</div><div id="00:03:53.740" class="transcript_line"> in? She coped for two years and then she remarried. And yes, she did. She did cope. She was an amazing</div><div id="00:04:00.940" class="transcript_line"> woman, really. It must have been very hard because you were in the middle of a war and your father</div><div id="00:04:06.220" class="transcript_line"> had died suddenly. Yes, it was. But in those days, I don&#039;t know, children worked. And I can</div><div id="00:04:17.740" class="transcript_line"> not remember, not working, really. I used to sort of go and feed the pigs, sort of, and even doing</div><div id="00:04:24.060" class="transcript_line"> milking at eight years old. So it was hard, but I suppose because my mother was such a strong woman,</div><div id="00:04:35.020" class="transcript_line"> she made life easy for us, really. That sounds amazing. And thank you so much.</div></div></p>
