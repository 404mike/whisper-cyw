I can remember my mother</div><div id="00:00:16.200" class="transcript_line"> and father used to go probably three or four times a week. They&#039;d walk over the bridge</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were there. My mother used to go there. She was a brilliant pianist.</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, your mother? Oh, my mother. Really? Oh, yeah. She was a... well, she was a clarinet.</div><div id="00:00:46.200" class="transcript_line"> She was a concert pianist. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. She was a brilliant, brilliant</div><div id="00:01:11.200" class="transcript_line"> pianist. Also, another interesting thing, she was the first woman in Cardiff to hold</div><div id="00:01:25.900" class="transcript_line"> a driving licence in 1925. Now it passed a test. I don&#039;t think she had to then. No.</div><div id="00:01:37.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think she had to. But her father bought a car and he never drove.

And what were you going to do with</div><div id="00:02:00.200" class="transcript_line"> the car? They sold it for £100 to Jack Silver. And he saved all those cars. He had the big</div><div id="00:02:13.800" class="transcript_line"> garage in Carbridge Road. And at the end of the war, if he had money, he had 100 cars.</div><div id="00:02:29.400" class="transcript_line"> They were worth... the worst of them was probably worth £1,000 because you couldn&#039;t get a car</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> for £1100 of money.</div></div></p>
