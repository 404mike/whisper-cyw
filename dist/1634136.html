    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was diving with the Sea Search Volunteer Survey Group back in 1999, looking at the</div><div id="00:00:06.800" class="transcript_line"> seabed to the east of the St. Tudwell&#039;s Islands off Abersach in Traumatic Bay when we found</div><div id="00:00:11.600" class="transcript_line"> mantis shrimps for the first time.</div><div id="00:00:14.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always been interested in sediment burrowing fauna, having looked at mud communities in</div><div id="00:00:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Scottish sea lochs, where you regularly find various species of mud burrowing crustaceans,</div><div id="00:00:23.680" class="transcript_line"> fish and even giant fireworks and enemies that produce characteristic burrows and tubes.</div><div id="00:00:29.440" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t recognise the thumb diameter vertical holes we started to find in the muddy</div><div id="00:00:33.400" class="transcript_line"> gravel on that sea search dive.</div><div id="00:00:36.200" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t see anything down the burrow, so I poked a finger down and didn&#039;t find anything.</div><div id="00:00:42.360" class="transcript_line"> Pushing harder into the sediment I could feel that the burrow went vertically down for about</div><div id="00:00:45.900" class="transcript_line"> 20cm and then levelled off.</div><div id="00:00:48.640" class="transcript_line"> I could also see that I was pushing water through the far end of the burrow by the small</div><div id="00:00:53.400" class="transcript_line"> plume of silt coming out of an exit about 40cm away.</div><div id="00:00:58.240" class="transcript_line"> It was then my ungloved fingers were stabbed by something sharp and shortly after a prawn-like</div><div id="00:01:02.920" class="transcript_line"> animal shot out through the silt plume and started running off across the seabed.</div><div id="00:01:07.760" class="transcript_line"> I grabbed it, got stabbed a few more times and somehow managed to get it into my sample</div><div id="00:01:12.360" class="transcript_line"> bag that I had stowed in my drysuit pocket.</div><div id="00:01:15.720" class="transcript_line"> I could now see that what I had in the bag was clearly a mantis shrimp.</div><div id="00:01:19.420" class="transcript_line"> It had the characteristic long serrated forelimbs designed to snatch prey animals, very like</div><div id="00:01:24.880" class="transcript_line"> those of a praying mantis.</div><div id="00:01:27.080" class="transcript_line"> It had two twin lobed compound eyes and a heavily armoured tail.</div><div id="00:01:30.520" class="transcript_line"> But what was it doing in this part of Wales?</div><div id="00:01:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Back on dry land, the old Hamlin guide described Squilla desmoresti as the best fit for this</div><div id="00:01:38.760" class="transcript_line"> species, but the distribution seemed to be limited to the Mediterranean and only as far</div><div id="00:01:43.440" class="transcript_line"> north as the English Channel.</div><div id="00:01:46.200" class="transcript_line"> Further investigation confirmed that its current scientific name was Rhysoides desmoresti,</div><div id="00:01:51.560" class="transcript_line"> and this new record extended its known range much further north and it was also a new record</div><div id="00:01:56.580" class="transcript_line"> for Wales.</div><div id="00:01:58.120" class="transcript_line"> This news went well beyond the scientific community and the mantis shrimps were even</div><div id="00:02:01.800" class="transcript_line"> featured on the national news and mainstream TV.</div><div id="00:02:05.020" class="transcript_line"> Since that dive I have been back regularly to get a better idea of its abundance and</div><div id="00:02:08.340" class="transcript_line"> distribution.</div><div id="00:02:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Once you get your eye in, the burrows are easy to discriminate from the burrows of other</div><div id="00:02:13.920" class="transcript_line"> species in the area and you can tell whether they are occupied or not by the intact lining</div><div id="00:02:18.600" class="transcript_line"> of fine silt at the entrance.</div><div id="00:02:21.220" class="transcript_line"> We found them around much of Cardingham Bay, around the 10-15m depth zone where the suitable</div><div id="00:02:26.640" class="transcript_line"> mixture of stable muddy gravel and sand that supports the formation of the burrows.</div><div id="00:02:31.980" class="transcript_line"> At their most abundant there is as many as one burrow every 5-10m2, so that&#039;s a lot</div><div id="00:02:36.700" class="transcript_line"> of mantis shrimps overall in this area.</div><div id="00:02:40.120" class="transcript_line"> But until recently I have never seen them occurring naturally out of their burrows.</div><div id="00:02:44.880" class="transcript_line"> In 2020 I was lucky enough to be involved in the filming of a natural history programme</div><div id="00:02:49.140" class="transcript_line"> about the marine life of Wales, and that included diving at night on the mantis shrimp beds.</div><div id="00:02:55.220" class="transcript_line"> In the middle of a warm summer&#039;s night we waited on the seabed next to a group of burrows</div><div id="00:02:59.440" class="transcript_line"> and watched and filmed them as they emerged.</div><div id="00:03:01.560" class="transcript_line"> They are nocturnal.</div><div id="00:03:03.360" class="transcript_line"> We saw a couple of animals travelling across the seabed and also tracked one as it disappeared</div><div id="00:03:07.960" class="transcript_line"> down a burrow.</div><div id="00:03:09.360" class="transcript_line"> But we still don&#039;t know whether they leave from and return to the same burrow, or whether</div><div id="00:03:13.560" class="transcript_line"> they might even use multiple burrows.</div><div id="00:03:15.560" class="transcript_line"> A good excuse to dive this area again at night.</div></div></p>
