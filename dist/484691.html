Now on this particular</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> parade Samba Galez, the Cardiff School of Samba, were performing</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Samba rhythms played to a funky Brazilian swing beat</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> but the group were placed too close to a military drumming band</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> whose beat was intended to be the metronome for the steps of the</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> accompanying uniformed soldiers. In the ensuing</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> sound clash the funky swing of the Samba beat overcame</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and infected the military drummers to such an extent that</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> the marching soldiers couldn&#039;t help but break step and began</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> bumping into each other.
