He knew the Mickeys.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re still all their own relatives.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were the only people.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were the only...</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, look, Margaret, that would be Louis&#039; girl.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember Louis Phillips?</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Zemmer does.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Louis lived up here off the road.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And his girl, Margaret, was the head of the nurses over in the Lancaster when Ruthie worked there.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When Ruthie was at the Lancaster Veterans Hostel.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Ruthie, of course, was a female auditor.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, Ruthie, why don&#039;t you go in training?</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, your status would be a lot better what&#039;s in now.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, you&#039;re capable and smart.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, why don&#039;t you go in training and get your RN?</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We see Ruthie tried over here and not paid enough attention and got put out.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And they wouldn&#039;t take her back.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So she rode up to the outermost and asked if she could train there.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And the doctor told her she didn&#039;t have a personal interview.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But she told her what had happened down here.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So Ruth went up.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And she told her the whole thing.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have any trouble that way now.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, I used to go to sleep in class.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t bank my keep of mind on it.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I&#039;m quite a lot older now.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, 25.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> She was only 18 before.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, if I give...</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ll give me a chance, she said, I&#039;ll work.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, she said, it was almost.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, I&#039;ll give you a chance.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And because she did, Ruthie worked like a dooker and got five prizes when she graduated.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And always had a soft spot in her heart for the major.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, this woman that you speak of, was instrumental in getting...</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Was she with Bonda Phillips?</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, Lewis Phillips was your mother&#039;s first cousin.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And Margaret was his daughter.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she asked me about Ruth one time.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was out with Lewis at the store.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was out with the two of them down at the mini store one day.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think Lewis had been dead since then.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But she was very nice indeed.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told her I wanted to thank her for her good advice to Ruth.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, we&#039;ve been after you.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And she tried to get training and she went back to the road building.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, all she needed was what you said, encouragement.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I felt she was better, she was well-prepared to be a nurse.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I better than just being ordered.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I felt that she had a lot to do with getting Ruth to do training.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> She was very nice indeed.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t see how I need that fire.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sinking.</div></div></p>
