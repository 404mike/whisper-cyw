Cardiff Cardiff Hall 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:03.680" class="transcript_line"> interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Justine Goulding.</div><div id="00:00:08.360" class="transcript_line"> The location is number one Yersinian Avenue in Pont Canna Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date is the 21st of October 2015</div><div id="00:00:17.720" class="transcript_line"> and before we start Justine, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:22.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s J-U-S-T-I-N-E</div><div id="00:00:26.400" class="transcript_line"> G-O-U-L-D-I-N-G.</div><div id="00:00:29.240" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much. Well done, that&#039;s correct.</div><div id="00:00:32.240" class="transcript_line"> So how did you first get involved in the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I knew yourself and</div><div id="00:00:39.520" class="transcript_line"> so I wanted to get involved in some of the dance projects</div><div id="00:00:43.640" class="transcript_line"> that initially attracted me to the Swicker Carnival.</div><div id="00:00:48.480" class="transcript_line"> And I joined the...</div><div id="00:00:50.920" class="transcript_line"> A group of fire dancers was the theme for it</div><div id="00:00:53.720" class="transcript_line"> and we all had costumes made for us by some of the lovely people</div><div id="00:00:57.400" class="transcript_line"> and I had to go there every evening to learn how to dance this particular routine.</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> And the carnival camp at that time would have been at Catay&#039;s Community Centre?</div><div id="00:01:08.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:01:08.960" class="transcript_line"> And obviously the parade has followed various different routes during the years</div><div id="00:01:15.120" class="transcript_line"> but in that year we would have ended the parade with a choreographed piece of sorts</div><div id="00:01:22.240" class="transcript_line"> on the steps of the National Museum at night time</div><div id="00:01:25.520" class="transcript_line"> and generate a big, big audience.</div><div id="00:01:27.640" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any of that, being on the steps of the National Museum?</div><div id="00:01:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I do actually, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:33.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember being up on the left hand side as you&#039;re looking at it</div><div id="00:01:36.600" class="transcript_line"> and standing up on the top steps looking down over everybody</div><div id="00:01:40.800" class="transcript_line"> and having brought large crowds with us from the whole parade as we walked through</div><div id="00:01:47.080" class="transcript_line"> and looking out over all the people and seeing all the smiling faces.</div><div id="00:01:52.840" class="transcript_line"> So that was kind of carnival number one for you</div><div id="00:01:56.160" class="transcript_line"> but you were back the next year, less so as a dancer.</div><div id="00:01:59.720" class="transcript_line"> What was your next role?</div><div id="00:02:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when I came back the next time, I&#039;m quite into the arts and I did a degree in art</div><div id="00:02:08.640" class="transcript_line"> so I decided I fancied doing one of the amazing costumes</div><div id="00:02:12.200" class="transcript_line"> and I wanted to have a backpack costume which is one of the larger ones</div><div id="00:02:16.400" class="transcript_line"> and I think the theme was, what was it, water or rain or something</div><div id="00:02:21.520" class="transcript_line"> but I ended up doing a massive umbrella larger than life</div><div id="00:02:25.960" class="transcript_line"> which I made out of withy sticks and had lots of rain coming down on the inside of it</div><div id="00:02:31.400" class="transcript_line"> which all twinkled as I danced around underneath.</div><div id="00:02:36.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was really good actually, when you get all the atmosphere when you&#039;re at the camp</div><div id="00:02:40.600" class="transcript_line"> at Cotets and everybody&#039;s getting all ready together</div><div id="00:02:45.080" class="transcript_line"> and jeeing each other up and finishing each other&#039;s face paints</div><div id="00:02:49.160" class="transcript_line"> and then somebody came along that year, I remember spraying everybody&#039;s shoes</div><div id="00:02:52.280" class="transcript_line"> so even their shoes were all...</div><div id="00:02:54.280" class="transcript_line"> Attention to detail, very important.</div><div id="00:02:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, nothing was wrong.</div><div id="00:02:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Took us a few years to discover that, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:00.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was lovely and then by the time everybody&#039;s got their faces done</div><div id="00:03:04.280" class="transcript_line"> and all their costumes on and the atmosphere was amazing before you start,</div><div id="00:03:07.480" class="transcript_line"> everybody was really excited and just really looking forward to jeeing up the audience</div><div id="00:03:12.600" class="transcript_line"> as you go through the town and taking a weird, securitas route</div><div id="00:03:17.160" class="transcript_line"> which is bumping to different people all the time and they don&#039;t know that you&#039;re coming</div><div id="00:03:20.160" class="transcript_line"> and they just hear the drums in the distance and then you turn up and they&#039;re like</div><div id="00:03:24.160" class="transcript_line"> taken over by this massive carnival with all these different people in various costumes</div><div id="00:03:28.160" class="transcript_line"> all going past and there&#039;s just like some kind of surreal event happening to them.</div><div id="00:03:33.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:03:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Cotets Carnival was in your early role in Swicka in the mid-90s.</div><div id="00:03:41.160" class="transcript_line"> You of course left your mark on Barry Carnival.</div><div id="00:03:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember a little bit about that for us?</div><div id="00:03:47.160" class="transcript_line"> It was the lantern parade, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:49.160" class="transcript_line"> So I think Terry Chin taught us all how to bend all the sticks</div><div id="00:03:54.160" class="transcript_line"> and make various lanterns which weren&#039;t going to catch fire as soon as we put a flame inside them</div><div id="00:04:00.160" class="transcript_line"> which I thought was amazing considering they&#039;re made out of wood and paper</div><div id="00:04:04.160" class="transcript_line"> the key ingredients for a little fire</div><div id="00:04:06.160" class="transcript_line"> but apparently Swicka didn&#039;t mind about that at the time and that was OK.</div><div id="00:04:11.160" class="transcript_line"> But more importantly they had a hole in it.</div><div id="00:04:14.160" class="transcript_line"> It was before health and safety was invented.</div><div id="00:04:16.160" class="transcript_line"> It kind of was but it wasn&#039;t, was it?</div><div id="00:04:18.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a little hole in the top so that they didn&#039;t burn</div><div id="00:04:20.160" class="transcript_line"> and that was the only thing you had to make sure that you had.</div><div id="00:04:23.160" class="transcript_line"> You could have any shape or size you liked and you could have a number of candles inside.</div><div id="00:04:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Whatever you did, wherever the flame was, there&#039;d have to be an air vent at the top</div><div id="00:04:31.160" class="transcript_line"> so that the heat could escape out and wouldn&#039;t set the whole thing on fire.</div><div id="00:04:36.160" class="transcript_line"> That was fun. I was working as one of the tutors then</div><div id="00:04:41.160" class="transcript_line"> helping all the little kids in Barry make their lanterns ready for the parade.</div><div id="00:04:46.160" class="transcript_line"> It was good.</div><div id="00:04:48.160" class="transcript_line"> And of course your stint there with us at Caddickston House</div><div id="00:04:50.160" class="transcript_line"> you were saying was a small step in which ultimately became your creative career.</div><div id="00:04:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Tell us more.</div><div id="00:04:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:04:58.160" class="transcript_line"> After having done that then they offered me some evening classes</div><div id="00:05:02.160" class="transcript_line"> teaching ceramics in Caddickston House</div><div id="00:05:04.160" class="transcript_line"> and that was the spur really for me to take on PGCE in art and design</div><div id="00:05:09.160" class="transcript_line"> and now I&#039;ve been a teacher in secondary education for 16 years teaching art and design.</div><div id="00:05:14.160" class="transcript_line"> So that sort of set me off on that path really.</div><div id="00:05:17.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic. Justine, can I just say I award you the title of Cardinal Hero.</div><div id="00:05:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed for those memories.</div><div id="00:05:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:05:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Ciao.</div></div></p>
