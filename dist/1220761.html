class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Tell me more about that.</div><div id="00:00:06.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve belonged to Wheatsow for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:00:09.920" class="transcript_line"> And where was the Wheatsow?</div><div id="00:00:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, here we used to have it in different people&#039;s houses.</div><div id="00:00:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Eventually the organisation that I belonged to called Betty Silver, we got older and older</div><div id="00:00:21.680" class="transcript_line"> and it was the same people taking office all the time.</div><div id="00:00:25.920" class="transcript_line"> So it was rather difficult.</div><div id="00:00:27.200" class="transcript_line"> So now I belong to a younger group.</div><div id="00:00:29.960" class="transcript_line"> So what happened to Betty Silver&#039;s group?</div><div id="00:00:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Did it just fade away?</div><div id="00:00:33.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes.</div><div id="00:00:34.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And who was it?</div><div id="00:00:36.520" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people, they were no longer living.</div><div id="00:00:39.520" class="transcript_line"> It was rather sad, but we did very well.</div><div id="00:00:43.320" class="transcript_line"> And who was Betty Silver?</div><div id="00:00:45.760" class="transcript_line"> She was one of the original members as far as I know.</div><div id="00:00:50.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going back before I belonged.</div><div id="00:00:53.080" class="transcript_line"> And so they, I think it was originally called the Friendship Club.</div><div id="00:00:58.640" class="transcript_line"> And then they called it Betty Silver after her.</div><div id="00:01:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Was this attached to a particular synagogue or was it Orthodox Anarcho-Weats?</div><div id="00:01:06.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:01:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Anybody.</div><div id="00:01:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Anybody, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:09.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an international organisation.</div><div id="00:01:12.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been going for a very long time.</div><div id="00:01:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it mainly raising money or was it social or both?</div><div id="00:01:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Both.</div><div id="00:01:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Both, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:20.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to have weekly weeding and weekly meetings and then we used to have these charity</div><div id="00:01:27.560" class="transcript_line"> shops which was something quite new in those days.</div><div id="00:01:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Now they&#039;re everywhere.</div><div id="00:01:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So did you have a charity shop in Cardiff?</div><div id="00:01:36.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:01:37.560" class="transcript_line"> This was just a couple of times a year we&#039;d have one.</div><div id="00:01:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And that would be where?</div><div id="00:01:43.560" class="transcript_line"> At the synagogue or?</div><div id="00:01:44.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:01:45.560" class="transcript_line"> It would be wherever we could find premises.</div><div id="00:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So you were just finding an empty shop and use it for a couple of days?</div><div id="00:01:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, some rather grotty shops.</div><div id="00:01:56.560" class="transcript_line"> We had to clean them up first.</div><div id="00:01:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember where any of them were?</div><div id="00:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Clifton Street.</div><div id="00:02:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:06.560" class="transcript_line"> City Road.</div><div id="00:02:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Wellfield Road.</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Wherever we, as I say, we could find.</div><div id="00:02:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And that would be what, once a year?</div><div id="00:02:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Initially, yes.</div><div id="00:02:17.560" class="transcript_line"> And then after?</div><div id="00:02:19.560" class="transcript_line"> More often or less often?</div><div id="00:02:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we used to have a big bazaar once a year.</div><div id="00:02:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And where would the bazaar be?</div><div id="00:02:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Again, wherever we could get premises.</div><div id="00:02:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Usually church halls.</div></div></p>
