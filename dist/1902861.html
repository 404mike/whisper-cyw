I remember all the excitement building up to it.</div><div id="00:00:29.300" class="transcript_line"> I think people were almost in a state of disbelief.</div><div id="00:00:32.600" class="transcript_line"> Is it going to happen? How can it possibly happen?</div><div id="00:00:35.600" class="transcript_line"> How can mankind possibly get all the way up there?</div><div id="00:00:39.600" class="transcript_line"> The little stick figures that we saw jumping around in the films, which of course we&#039;ve seen forever more,</div><div id="00:00:47.100" class="transcript_line"> they were almost beyond belief really. They looked a little bit like cartoon characters.</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, as they said, one giant step for mankind, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:59.400" class="transcript_line"> Where were you when you were watching it?</div><div id="00:01:02.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, where would I have been?

I suppose it must have been.</div><div id="00:01:10.900" class="transcript_line"> But of course we saw it for at least several weeks afterwards.</div><div id="00:01:14.400" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re living in Lincolnshire.</div><div id="00:01:17.400" class="transcript_line"> Some people heard it on the radio.</div><div id="00:01:19.700" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think most people had a TV in those days.</div><div id="00:01:22.700" class="transcript_line"> I know we&#039;d certainly had a TV for well over 10 years by then.</div><div id="00:01:27.700" class="transcript_line"> One thing I remember thinking, people talk about Neil Armstrong,</div><div id="00:01:32.700" class="transcript_line"> Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon.</div><div id="00:01:35.700" class="transcript_line"> That would have been wonderful, but the way I looked at it was,</div><div id="00:01:40.700" class="transcript_line"> we were all on the earth, they were all up there.</div><div id="00:01:43.700" class="transcript_line"> But Buzz Aldrin, who came second,</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> how wonderful to be the first man to be in close proximity</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and to presumably watch Neil Armstrong actually set foot on the moon.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I think Buzz had the better deal actually. I really do.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We always talk about getting there first.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure where Buzz was when he got onto the moon,</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> but at least he was the closest person to the first man on the moon.</div><div id="00:02:13.300" class="transcript_line"> I mean, how wonderful that would be.</div><div id="00:02:16.300" class="transcript_line"> Also what I do remember was people&#039;s attitudes towards it.</div><div id="00:02:21.300" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the Americans were all patting themselves on the back,</div><div id="00:02:24.300" class="transcript_line"> basically, because I think they&#039;d won the space race.</div><div id="00:02:27.300" class="transcript_line"> I remember seeing an interview sometime before when Yuri Gagarin,</div><div id="00:02:33.300" class="transcript_line"> if you remember, was the first astronaut actually in outer space</div><div id="00:02:38.300" class="transcript_line"> and how disappointed these guys on the radio were</div><div id="00:02:41.600" class="transcript_line"> because Russia had got there first.</div><div id="00:02:44.600" class="transcript_line"> But of course they went that step further and made it to the moon.</div><div id="00:02:48.600" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the Cold War would have been at its peak then really,</div><div id="00:02:52.600" class="transcript_line"> so it was very much an enmity.</div><div id="00:02:54.600" class="transcript_line"> But I remember them being so pleased that they got there first.</div><div id="00:02:58.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think really the Western world was happier about that too,</div><div id="00:03:02.600" class="transcript_line"> because there was always that sort of slight,</div><div id="00:03:04.600" class="transcript_line"> oh dear Russia, you know, that slight,</div><div id="00:03:07.900" class="transcript_line"> not being very comfortable with Russia and what Russia was doing.</div><div id="00:03:12.900" class="transcript_line"> And then in hindsight, I remember how people&#039;s views changed.</div><div id="00:03:19.900" class="transcript_line"> I mean, mankind had stepped on the moon</div><div id="00:03:22.900" class="transcript_line"> and nothing could ever, ever be the same again.</div><div id="00:03:25.900" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the myths that we&#039;d comfortably lift with,</div><div id="00:03:29.900" class="transcript_line"> ad infinitum really, about darker the moon and the spirits</div><div id="00:03:33.900" class="transcript_line"> and this lovely mystery about it,</div><div id="00:03:36.200" class="transcript_line"> and a little man called Akin Drum up there,</div><div id="00:03:38.200" class="transcript_line"> you know, banging his ladle.</div><div id="00:03:40.200" class="transcript_line"> All that was suddenly dispelled.</div><div id="00:03:42.200" class="transcript_line"> All that was suddenly shattered by the fact</div><div id="00:03:44.200" class="transcript_line"> that a human being had sort of gone through that barrier</div><div id="00:03:48.200" class="transcript_line"> and actually walked on the moon.</div><div id="00:03:51.200" class="transcript_line"> And I think people started questioning their beliefs,</div><div id="00:03:55.200" class="transcript_line"> their religious belief.</div><div id="00:03:56.200" class="transcript_line"> And I think that also coincided with</div><div id="00:03:59.200" class="transcript_line"> perhaps a drop-off in church attendances</div><div id="00:04:03.200" class="transcript_line"> and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:04:05.500" class="transcript_line"> And people were just querying the sort of things</div><div id="00:04:07.500" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;d held precious to them for, you know,</div><div id="00:04:10.500" class="transcript_line"> for so long, really.</div><div id="00:04:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was amazing.</div><div id="00:04:14.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, certainly, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:16.500" class="transcript_line"> And of course they&#039;re still up there</div><div id="00:04:18.500" class="transcript_line"> doing all sorts of strange things, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:20.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, good luck to them,</div><div id="00:04:22.500" class="transcript_line"> as long as we learn something from it.</div><div id="00:04:24.500" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:04:26.500" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for that, Jill.</div><div id="00:04:28.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very, very good.</div><div id="00:04:29.500" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div></div></p>
