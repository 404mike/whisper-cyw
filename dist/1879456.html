    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;d done most of my work in the late 60s, early 80s.</div><div id="00:00:13.560" class="transcript_line"> I went a bit quiet because my second marriage in the 80s and my second child.</div><div id="00:00:19.720" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot more clubs.</div><div id="00:00:21.480" class="transcript_line"> The colleges as well, which was great because they all used to put on bands.</div><div id="00:00:26.640" class="transcript_line"> The old art college used to put on bands.</div><div id="00:00:28.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d done one at the actual art college itself, just over the bridge by the castle.</div><div id="00:00:35.360" class="transcript_line"> But we had a lot of church halls that was going.</div><div id="00:00:38.840" class="transcript_line"> I started off the Bosco church hall where the pieces of mine recorded their album.</div><div id="00:00:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And I used to use St. Willis church hall.</div><div id="00:00:50.600" class="transcript_line"> The only thing was that these places didn&#039;t have bars in them.</div><div id="00:00:54.840" class="transcript_line"> We got around that with people bringing their own and even, I even won two bottles on hand.</div><div id="00:01:00.840" class="transcript_line"> But otherwise, I&#039;d just tried different venues like the Dolmen Theatre.</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d only had one band that played previously.</div><div id="00:01:12.840" class="transcript_line"> That was Steeleyes Band, who were basically a folk band but they turned electric.</div><div id="00:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Like Bob Dylan.</div><div id="00:01:21.880" class="transcript_line"> But when I, Kevin Hayes and the whole world played there, they insisted I had their dorm in</div><div id="00:01:31.880" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d pay for their dorm in.</div><div id="00:01:33.880" class="transcript_line"> But apparently it was too low for them.</div><div id="00:01:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Even though they turned out their year in age, they&#039;d left their post and people got into the venue free.</div><div id="00:01:42.880" class="transcript_line"> Which was a shame.</div><div id="00:01:44.880" class="transcript_line"> But I did try quite a few venues because there was quite a lot of them.</div><div id="00:01:48.920" class="transcript_line"> The Alex was one of the best but I caught the ass end of it.</div><div id="00:01:53.920" class="transcript_line"> It belonged, I was owned by someone from Cardiff at the time and I wasn&#039;t aware that they were closing down.</div><div id="00:02:03.920" class="transcript_line"> So I only managed to put on half a dozen gigs there before they closed down and I had to move on again.</div><div id="00:02:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Or it would be the venue would moan about it, the committee would say it was too loud, this, that and the other.</div><div id="00:02:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Or I&#039;d have to move on.</div><div id="00:02:21.960" class="transcript_line"> One time I approached the British Social Club, which is probably the biggest venue left in Newport now.</div><div id="00:02:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And at the time I was going to put on Gary Glitter.</div><div id="00:02:34.960" class="transcript_line"> I got it all arranged, booked, contract signed.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything OK with the committee.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I was let down at the last minute by the committee.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> For what reason exactly I can&#039;t remember, a long time ago.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to try and rearrange it and the only venue I could get was the Roundabout.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But not for the same date.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And the date that I could get it for, Mr. Glitter wasn&#039;t available.</div><div id="00:03:05.040" class="transcript_line"> Well I&#039;m glad to see it wasn&#039;t now actually.</div><div id="00:03:08.040" class="transcript_line"> But there you go, that&#039;s by the by.</div><div id="00:03:10.040" class="transcript_line"> And I still wanted to put on a Glitter band.</div><div id="00:03:14.040" class="transcript_line"> So I got the, Gary was number one in the Glitters, but the number two was the Suite.</div><div id="00:03:20.040" class="transcript_line"> And I had the Suite and I&#039;m glad I did put on the Suite.</div><div id="00:03:23.040" class="transcript_line"> They were absolutely fabulous.</div><div id="00:03:25.040" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have much of a set to play because they were into their first or second single at the time.</div><div id="00:03:32.080" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d done a lot of Hoo covers.</div><div id="00:03:36.080" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d done them better than the Hoo.</div><div id="00:03:39.080" class="transcript_line"> I mean another band I had at St. Louis Church was a band called Egg.</div><div id="00:03:43.080" class="transcript_line"> Three piece band, they were great.</div><div id="00:03:45.080" class="transcript_line"> They turned up very early.</div><div id="00:03:47.080" class="transcript_line"> So we all went next door into the park, next door and played football.</div><div id="00:03:51.080" class="transcript_line"> Until the gig started.</div><div id="00:03:53.080" class="transcript_line"> You just make the most of it.</div><div id="00:03:55.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just like going to a factory or somewhere else to them.</div><div id="00:03:59.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just turning up for work isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:01.120" class="transcript_line"> And you just try to make the most of it.</div><div id="00:04:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And we had a game of football that night, that day.</div><div id="00:04:06.120" class="transcript_line"> When I had caronets in the whole world at the Dolmen Theatre,</div><div id="00:04:12.120" class="transcript_line"> the electrics went down about 15 minutes into the gig.</div><div id="00:04:16.120" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lot of mess about.</div><div id="00:04:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Couldn&#039;t find the electrics or sort them out, whatever.</div><div id="00:04:22.120" class="transcript_line"> So the saxophonist stepped forward, Lord Coxell,</div><div id="00:04:27.120" class="transcript_line"> and entertained the crowd with the sax.</div><div id="00:04:30.160" class="transcript_line"> And he was absolutely fabulous.</div><div id="00:04:32.160" class="transcript_line"> The crowd loved him.</div><div id="00:04:34.160" class="transcript_line"> They would have been happy if just Lord Coxell had turned up.</div><div id="00:04:37.160" class="transcript_line"> And he told me he used to busk in London at the time</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> and he could earn Â£100 a day.</div><div id="00:04:44.160" class="transcript_line"> And that was 1970?</div><div id="00:04:48.160" class="transcript_line"> But that was one incident where we had a support act</div><div id="00:04:52.160" class="transcript_line"> where we didn&#039;t have a support act.</div><div id="00:04:54.160" class="transcript_line"> If you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:04:56.200" class="transcript_line"> One of the main venues for pun on bands at the time</div><div id="00:04:59.200" class="transcript_line"> was the Kensington Court Club,</div><div id="00:05:01.200" class="transcript_line"> over in Kensington Place,</div><div id="00:05:02.200" class="transcript_line"> just to the other side of the George Street Bridge,</div><div id="00:05:05.200" class="transcript_line"> just off Chapsville Road.</div><div id="00:05:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Are you aware of that venue?</div><div id="00:05:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ve heard about it a lot.</div><div id="00:05:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, right, that&#039;s where I seen Screaming Lord Such</div><div id="00:05:16.200" class="transcript_line"> and Hackensack and a lot of other bands.</div><div id="00:05:20.200" class="transcript_line"> I used to live just there.</div><div id="00:05:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I used to live just across the road from it.</div><div id="00:05:27.240" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t get to the venue too often</div><div id="00:05:29.240" class="transcript_line"> because I was busy myself.</div><div id="00:05:31.240" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve seen Focus play there.</div><div id="00:05:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s like a big old mansion there,</div><div id="00:05:41.240" class="transcript_line"> a house-type building type thing.</div><div id="00:05:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And it had 10 stairs where they used to have the main bands</div><div id="00:05:47.240" class="transcript_line"> and it had upstairs where you had a disco,</div><div id="00:05:49.240" class="transcript_line"> which was more or less for the discoites.</div><div id="00:05:52.280" class="transcript_line"> And whatever, but it wasn&#039;t a big venue.</div><div id="00:05:55.280" class="transcript_line"> I mean, one band turned away from there when they turned up</div><div id="00:05:58.280" class="transcript_line"> because they said the stage was too small</div><div id="00:06:00.280" class="transcript_line"> and the roof was too low.</div><div id="00:06:02.280" class="transcript_line"> On a Thursday night,</div><div id="00:06:03.280" class="transcript_line"> they used to have all the up-and-coming bands</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> like, excuse me, Brian Ferry&#039;s first band,</div><div id="00:06:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Roxy Music and things.</div><div id="00:06:12.280" class="transcript_line"> And it was the most influential rock place at the time.</div><div id="00:06:19.320" class="transcript_line"> And also I think something had to do with it</div><div id="00:06:23.320" class="transcript_line"> from the Kensington Chord Club,</div><div id="00:06:25.320" class="transcript_line"> the Bull Mo Lido just outside Cleon.</div><div id="00:06:29.320" class="transcript_line"> They used to have bands playing out there</div><div id="00:06:32.320" class="transcript_line"> like Good Abbott and the Racing Cars</div><div id="00:06:36.320" class="transcript_line"> and Albert, the band I mentioned,</div><div id="00:06:38.320" class="transcript_line"> and things like that.</div><div id="00:06:39.320" class="transcript_line"> That was a good venue for a while</div><div id="00:06:41.320" class="transcript_line"> before it closed down again.</div><div id="00:06:43.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why they all closed down</div><div id="00:06:45.320" class="transcript_line"> because they was well frequented back in the day.</div><div id="00:06:48.360" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s not so much life in Newport now,</div><div id="00:06:50.360" class="transcript_line"> so back in the day, it was always pretty busy.</div><div id="00:06:54.360" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t much trouble at all,</div><div id="00:06:56.360" class="transcript_line"> although Newport has got a bad reputation for trouble.</div><div id="00:07:00.360" class="transcript_line"> I could count the fights I&#039;d seen in the last 50 years</div><div id="00:07:07.360" class="transcript_line"> on my one hand.</div><div id="00:07:08.360" class="transcript_line"> The Newport Athletic Club,</div><div id="00:07:10.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen one or two fights.</div><div id="00:07:12.360" class="transcript_line"> The Baptist Club,</div><div id="00:07:13.360" class="transcript_line"> where I&#039;ve seen the A-man corner</div><div id="00:07:15.360" class="transcript_line"> playing out there one night.</div><div id="00:07:17.400" class="transcript_line"> They had a Newport member with them,</div><div id="00:07:19.400" class="transcript_line"> the A-man corner.</div><div id="00:07:20.400" class="transcript_line"> The sax player was Alan Jones.</div><div id="00:07:24.400" class="transcript_line"> He also had another band after A-man corner.</div><div id="00:07:31.400" class="transcript_line"> He also had a boutique in Newport called Clobber</div><div id="00:07:35.400" class="transcript_line"> and a boutique in Carriff.</div><div id="00:07:37.400" class="transcript_line"> Garage Paradise or something.</div><div id="00:07:41.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still about now,</div><div id="00:07:43.440" class="transcript_line"> promoting.</div><div id="00:07:45.440" class="transcript_line"> Most bands, it was OK,</div><div id="00:07:47.440" class="transcript_line"> but one or two had riders.</div><div id="00:07:49.440" class="transcript_line"> The biggest rider I ever had was for Nine Below Zero,</div><div id="00:07:54.440" class="transcript_line"> where I had them play at the storey.</div><div id="00:07:57.440" class="transcript_line"> I was the DJ at the storey,</div><div id="00:07:59.440" class="transcript_line"> but I only ever promoted one band at the storey</div><div id="00:08:01.440" class="transcript_line"> and that was Nine Below Zero.</div><div id="00:08:03.440" class="transcript_line"> They had one of the biggest riders</div><div id="00:08:05.440" class="transcript_line"> and it cost me half a lot of money</div><div id="00:08:07.440" class="transcript_line"> because there was vegans in the band,</div><div id="00:08:09.440" class="transcript_line"> there was eating,</div><div id="00:08:10.480" class="transcript_line"> meat eaters,</div><div id="00:08:11.480" class="transcript_line"> there was connoisseurs of drinks</div><div id="00:08:13.480" class="transcript_line"> and there was others that wanted water</div><div id="00:08:16.480" class="transcript_line"> and it was one of the biggest</div><div id="00:08:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and most expensive riders I had to lay on.</div><div id="00:08:22.480" class="transcript_line"> Luckily enough,</div><div id="00:08:23.480" class="transcript_line"> not too many of them had riders</div><div id="00:08:25.480" class="transcript_line"> but I certainly remember the Nine Below Zero one</div><div id="00:08:28.480" class="transcript_line"> because it was expensive</div><div id="00:08:30.480" class="transcript_line"> and like I said,</div><div id="00:08:31.480" class="transcript_line"> they were fussed over their food</div><div id="00:08:32.480" class="transcript_line"> and their drinks</div><div id="00:08:33.480" class="transcript_line"> and wanted quite a bit of it.</div><div id="00:08:36.520" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s seven in the band anyway,</div><div id="00:08:38.520" class="transcript_line"> you know what?</div><div id="00:08:39.520" class="transcript_line"> I had to wind up in the end as well</div><div id="00:08:41.520" class="transcript_line"> because the roundabout was the last gig I did</div><div id="00:08:45.520" class="transcript_line"> and that was a slot on the dogs from Manchester.</div><div id="00:08:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Only six people turned up.</div><div id="00:08:52.520" class="transcript_line"> They used to demand me their money before they went on</div><div id="00:08:55.520" class="transcript_line"> and I said I haven&#039;t got it</div><div id="00:08:56.520" class="transcript_line"> and there were pre-mobile phones and everything like that</div><div id="00:08:59.520" class="transcript_line"> so it was hard to get hold of people</div><div id="00:09:01.520" class="transcript_line"> until I got to the end of the gig.</div><div id="00:09:03.560" class="transcript_line"> So anyway,</div><div id="00:09:04.560" class="transcript_line"> they were asking me for the money</div><div id="00:09:06.560" class="transcript_line"> and I said we&#039;ve got a contract</div><div id="00:09:08.560" class="transcript_line"> and it says you&#039;ll do 60 minutes</div><div id="00:09:09.560" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;ll pay you the Â£100.</div><div id="00:09:12.560" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t say I&#039;ll pay you Â£100</div><div id="00:09:14.560" class="transcript_line"> and then you do the gig.</div><div id="00:09:15.560" class="transcript_line"> I said if you want to be funny,</div><div id="00:09:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be funny.</div><div id="00:09:18.560" class="transcript_line"> So they went on,</div><div id="00:09:19.560" class="transcript_line"> done a half hour</div><div id="00:09:20.560" class="transcript_line"> and came back off</div><div id="00:09:21.560" class="transcript_line"> and said we want the money.</div><div id="00:09:23.560" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;ll give you half the money</div><div id="00:09:24.560" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve done half the gig.</div><div id="00:09:26.560" class="transcript_line"> They phoned me around and said</div><div id="00:09:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got the money</div><div id="00:09:29.560" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve got the money</div><div id="00:09:30.560" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve got the money</div><div id="00:09:31.600" class="transcript_line"> so they phoned me around people</div><div id="00:09:33.600" class="transcript_line"> trying to get hold of people</div><div id="00:09:36.600" class="transcript_line"> which wasn&#039;t easy then,</div><div id="00:09:37.600" class="transcript_line"> pre-mobiles</div><div id="00:09:39.600" class="transcript_line"> and we were talking about the money</div><div id="00:09:42.600" class="transcript_line"> and one of the six people out in the audience</div><div id="00:09:45.600" class="transcript_line"> when running past me</div><div id="00:09:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I turned around</div><div id="00:09:48.600" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;s grappling with a roadie on the floor</div><div id="00:09:50.600" class="transcript_line"> with a metal bar in his hand</div><div id="00:09:52.600" class="transcript_line"> who was just about to put it over my head.</div><div id="00:09:57.600" class="transcript_line"> So he saved my life that night I think</div><div id="00:09:59.640" class="transcript_line"> and I managed to get the money</div><div id="00:10:05.640" class="transcript_line"> but I made them finish their over sack first.</div><div id="00:10:09.640" class="transcript_line"> So that was the amount of pork here.</div></div></p>
