    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Investiture of Prince Charles, what do you remember about that ceremony?</div><div id="00:00:06.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re picking all my favourite subjects now, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember that very well. Although I was living in London, I was very fortunate to be part</div><div id="00:00:15.840" class="transcript_line"> of the choir that took part in the actual ceremony in the castle and it was a great privilege</div><div id="00:00:23.440" class="transcript_line"> to belong to such a choir which comprised of members from each county of Wales plus a contingent</div><div id="00:00:32.160" class="transcript_line"> from London Welsh which made up a choir of about 200 voices. There was a lot of hard work in</div><div id="00:00:40.960" class="transcript_line"> learning the music because they weren&#039;t easy pieces to learn. We were staying in</div><div id="00:00:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Bangor University over the weekend. We rehearsed hard and we had our rehearsal</div><div id="00:00:56.720" class="transcript_line"> the day before in the castle and the performance on the following day. Now it was a</div><div id="00:01:04.080" class="transcript_line"> not a very nice day. It tended to have rainy showers and wind which blew the</div><div id="00:01:14.560" class="transcript_line"> panels that had graced the castle walls and made such a noise that when the television came on</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> it sort of interrupted the music which was very sad really. To my mind there was never a recording</div><div id="00:01:34.320" class="transcript_line"> of all the music that we sang that day and nor has it appeared on television since,</div><div id="00:01:41.440" class="transcript_line"> which to me is a shame. Do you remember the atmosphere in the castle that day?</div><div id="00:01:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, it was very tense because of all the problems that had happened outside</div><div id="00:01:56.320" class="transcript_line"> with the various shootings that had happened in areas and it was very full of</div><div id="00:02:07.040" class="transcript_line"> well secret police but a lot of police around. Yes it was very tight security.</div><div id="00:02:16.080" class="transcript_line"> Our handbags were searched as we went in and out.</div><div id="00:02:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah that was very tight security then.</div><div id="00:02:26.960" class="transcript_line"> In the run up to the ceremony do you remember what was on television?</div><div id="00:02:31.360" class="transcript_line"> No not really because I&#039;ll say we came up to the university about Friday and we were</div><div id="00:02:39.280" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t see any television then because we were so busy sort of rehearsing and</div><div id="00:02:46.080" class="transcript_line"> getting ready for the performance. I don&#039;t recall an awful lot on television. It&#039;s only what I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:02:53.520" class="transcript_line"> seen on the television in later years when they&#039;ve been on television for a long time.</div><div id="00:03:00.160" class="transcript_line"> In later years when they&#039;ve done special programmes and you&#039;ve seen a bit of the</div><div id="00:03:07.520" class="transcript_line"> procession outside.</div><div id="00:03:12.640" class="transcript_line"> You were living in London at the time was was anything organised in London do you remember?</div><div id="00:03:20.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember anything specific no.</div></div></p>
