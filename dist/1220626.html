Do you know what the membership used to be like here?</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Used to be up to about 800. And now it&#039;s 40.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, big difference. And I guess there&#039;s no... what happens if you want kosher meat, what do you do now?</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We order it from London. It comes down to Cardiff, because Cardiff have got the same problem as us, they don&#039;t have a kosher butcher.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We send a van up to London, which brings it down, drops off the meat in Cardiff, then comes our van from Swansea, picks it up from Cardiff.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah. And that&#039;s a regular arrangement?</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a regular arrangement.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, every four, five weeks.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So how... when you do your orders, do you... how is that all coordinated? Do you do it all with the butcher in direct or does someone support that?</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> No, direct.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we give the order to the butcher, and then he collates obviously all the orders, but the van comes from him, he comes to Cardiff, sometimes he goes to Bristol as well.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, say, our van, we pay for a van and a driver to go up to Cardiff. And then when... he always rings when he&#039;s leaving Cardiff, so we know what time to go down, he parks at a certain place, and usually the managers go down and pick it up.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you pay for it the following day with a card, you know, so...</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main thing is that we also have kosher bread.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So in other words, for Friday night when you use a challah.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And growth series as well.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So all that&#039;s sorted every four weeks on the same ground?</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Every four weeks, yes.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div></div></p>
