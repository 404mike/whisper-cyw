    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 22 in our continuing story that follows on from the race riots of 1919 in Wales and across the rest of England.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Chapter 22. India, the beginning of the collapse of empire.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Quote from Mahatma Gandhi.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> In 1960 the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Harold Milk Millen, delivered a famous speech known as the Wind of Change.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> In that speech he said,</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Many countries there of different races and civilisation pressed their claim to an independent national life.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Today the same thing is happening in Africa.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> In different places it may take different forms, but it is happening everywhere.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The wind of change is blowing through the continent.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We must accept it as a fact.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Now in India there were numerous uprisings and conflicts that erupted over the course of the centuries, the centuries long British occupation.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t until Mahandas Mahatma Gandhi&#039;s social efforts began, beginning in India from 1915 to 1920 and onward,</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> that a popular vision for India began to spread amongst ordinary Indians.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> At the time Gandhi had only recently returned from South Africa, where he had stayed for more than 20 years.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> As the voice and conscience of thousands of racially subjugated Indians upon his return to India,</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Gandhi advocated for Indians to boycott British institutions and products in a non-violent way.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> This movement was ultimately known as Swadeshi.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> India suffered a significant cost during World War I.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Over one million Indian troops served overseas, of whom 62,000 at least died and another 67,000 were wounded.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In total at least 74,187 Indian soldiers died during World War I.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> In World War I the Indian army fought against the German Empire in Germany,</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Germany East Africa I should say, and on the Western Front.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Indian men were also a significant part of Mercantile Marine, later to be called the Merchant Navy.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately we cannot say how many died, many of those died because the British government destroyed those records after the war.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> During the First World War these seamen replaced British mariners recruited into the Royal Navy.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The Laskers, which is what Indian merchant seamen were first known as and that spread to other seamen,</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> were paid a fraction of white cruise wages.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And along with other overseas sailors such as African and Caribbean people suffered harsh treatment.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Received inferior rations and mostly worked in cramped, hot, badly ventilated areas below deck.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The Laskers, as I said, slang for Indian seamen, comprised an estimated 17.5% of mariners on British registered ships.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Some 51,000 men, according to Historic England.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a monument erected by the shipping companies and mercantile community of Calcutta</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> to the memory of 896 seamen of Bengal, Assam and Upper India who lost their lives in the service to the British Empire in the Great War of 1914-18.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The SS Maloa is an example.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a requisitioned liner carrying military and civilian passengers en route to Bombay.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It sank, causing the death of 122 passengers, 85 Lasker crew.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the greatest single loss of Indian merchant seamen in the war.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The names of 63 of those are remembered at the Commonwealth War Grades Commission Bombay Memorial.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> This memorial commemorates 1708 members of the Indian Merchant Service,</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> which was separate from the UK Merchant Navy, and a further 498 from the Royal Indian Marine, the Royal Navy and the Mercantile Marine Reserve.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So we don&#039;t know the numbers of Indians at sea who died, but we know it was significant.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Repatriation was sought after the war, but it wasn&#039;t effective.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The local councils, the police, the government, once the merchant seamen in particular,</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> but the others from the Empire had served their purpose in World War I, wanted them to go home.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So they sought to repatriate, but it wasn&#039;t effective. Some had families.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And so a new measure was introduced that required black workers to provide documentary proof of British nationality.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> A requirement that was impossible for thousands of seafarers born in British colonial Africa, the Caribbean, Middle East, India and Malaysia.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Many of which could not write.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> This practice was subsequently incorporated into the special restriction Coloured Seamen Order in 1925, described as the whitewashing of Britain.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The order set the policy direction of the British government with regard to black workers, far beyond that time period.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> This group of merchant seamen and those from the armed forces that had fought for the Empire,</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> but came home to exactly the same conditions they had left, contribute to an angry India and an angry British Empire.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That significantly diluted the non-violent nature of Gandhi&#039;s revolution.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Merchant seamen, for example, from the Punjab, were largely Muslims and they were largely underclass within the class system, some even being untouchables.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, the behaviour of the British government&#039;s local representatives became more punitive after the war because of their fear of uprising.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> One major event that directly affected Sikhs and Muslims in particular is still a stain on their history and helped to destroy Empire.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The Jallinwalabagh Massacre, also known as the Amritsar Massacre, took place on the 13th of April 1919.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> When Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed civilians in Jallinwalabagh,</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> killing at least 400 people, including men and women, over 1,000 people were injured.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Those people were on a peaceful, mainly religious march.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a plaque in Amritsar which sums it up.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Notice, this place is saturated with the blood of thousands of Indian patriots who were martyred in a non-violent struggle to free India from British domination.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> General Dyer and the British Army opened fire here on unarmed people.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Jallinwalabagh is thus an everlasting symbol of non-violent and peaceful struggle for freedom of Indian people and the tyranny of the British.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> India&#039;s actions led the movement to end the British Empire that was to conclude in its collapse after World War II.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Hence the Wind of Change speech. But Africa, China, the Caribbean and the Middle East soon followed India.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The race riots and the behaviour of government was a part of a turning point in history, as Lord Milner predicted.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> This is a quote from Peter Fryer, 1984, The Staying Power book.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The Colonial Secretary Lord Milner pointed out that many of the black men attacked in the riots had served in the Army, Navy and Merchant Service during the war and bitterly resented the ingratitude shown in the attacks.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> He feared the effect their return to the colonies would have on attitudes to white minorities there and his fears were soon justified.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite true that racial feeling is rising in World War I, as elsewhere the causes are many.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The participation of coloured men in the war, slights and insults received by them mainly from Dominion troops on account of their colour, the USA race troubles, Liverpool and Cardiff riots and in addition the general unrest all over the world.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the trouble is a fact to be faced and there is no special remedy for it.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We can provide against disorder, improve conditions and be careful over questions of race, but nothing we can do will alter the fact that the black man has begun to think and feel himself as good as the white.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Gilbert Grindle, later to be Sir Gilbert Grindle, 22nd October 1919, Colonial Office Memo.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So the race riots in 1919 in their own way had a longer lasting effect in a few days in June and led to a group of people returning unhappy, angry and a tidal wave of change across the empire.</div></div></p>
