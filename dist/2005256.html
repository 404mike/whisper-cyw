I don&#039;t know. No.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially the Glastonbury, but it could have been afterwards, couldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, maybe it was afterwards.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> TJs? Oh, it&#039;s absolutely brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the best nightclubs you could ask for, to be honest.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> When you think of all the up-and-coming bands that used to play there,</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> they would play TJs, and then six months later they&#039;d be playing Glastonbury, you know, big stages.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So many bands came through that place. Amazing.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t so much the gig was memorable, it was the memorable bit of bumping into PJ Harvey, I suppose.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Not every day that happens.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you a fan of Shadr? Not really.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to like Big Black. Probably got a couple of albums a day.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s probably from my brother, really. He probably bought them and then gave them to me, or whatever I do.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t really matter when you went to TJs. I think they used to put on so many good bands</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> that you might not have even heard of them, and you would go there and you&#039;d have a good night,</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you&#039;d become a fan.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the date, I can&#039;t know. I can&#039;t remember the year, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember yesterday. I should have done my research.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I suppose it was the grunge scene, really. That was the era.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It was like a cave inside, made of, I don&#039;t know, what, like plaster and whatever,</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and bits of cobweb hanging down, if I remember.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They did change it a couple of times, didn&#039;t they? They had a huge makeover where they knocked through or something.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what they did, actually, but there was like a proper bar area then, the one side of it.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Then still the cave bit in the other side.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember once, I&#039;m not sure what stage it was, but the toilets had overflowed.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There was planks walking into the toilet to go to the urinals,</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and you had to walk across these planks because the floor was flooded,</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> yet they were still open and they were still using it.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You probably couldn&#039;t do it these days, health and safety.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> There was always a gang of us that would go to these gigs.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the good thing with Newport. You could just come into town,</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and you could go to a particular pub where you&#039;d meet.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d normally meet at the Riverside or Morringer, and then just pop along with the TJs afterwards.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Very rarely you would arrange something. They would just be there.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been playing in bands in TJs myself, so you might go there the next day.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re actually in the nightclub, when it&#039;s happening,</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s not really much of a smell, it&#039;s just a nightclub,</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> but then you go the next day and it&#039;s horrendous.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;re mixed with bleach and beer and sick and everything.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So many bands were coming here from America, and there were a lot of bands forming as well.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if the scene is the same now. I don&#039;t really know.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So many venues have closed.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It must be difficult for bands to get together and gig now.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There are still venues, but not like TJs, I don&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose times change.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we did make a bit of an impact, I suppose.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I think newspapers were calling us the new Seattle on there, I think, at some point.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So there must have been something really buzzing at that period of time, I suppose.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was nice to have lived through that.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if people will talk about that sort of time from years to come, like now.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this band&#039;s popping up, but to me they all seem to be sort of recycled things.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That sounds like so-and-so. That sounds like so-and-so.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a gig that I actually played with Headhunker.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d done a few gigs in and around Newport, and we got a chance to support Selecta, the ska band.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Our singer, Marcus, at the time was the bouncer in TJs.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So we asked Johnny Cicola, any chance we can support tonight?</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was like, a last-minute thing.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, OK. So it was a big gig for us.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a few hundred people there. They had a big following.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were a bit nervous, but we played really well.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely smashed it. They seemed to like it.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a different crowd. We weren&#039;t ska, but if you like music, you like music.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And they seemed to like us.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d borrowed their drums, and our drummer on the last song put the pedal right through the drum, split the drum.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was about half past eleven at night with about 200, 300 people there and no bass drum.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So Johnny Cicola was going crazy. He was going mental.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And luckily, Carlton comes in the story again, saved the day, because he lived around the corner,</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and he just happened to have a set of drums set up in his living room.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So we borrowed the drums quickly and saved the day he did.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great. But I don&#039;t think they ever returned the drums.</div></div></p>
