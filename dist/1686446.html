    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> At HDA we&#039;d like to say thank you to Heritage Lottery for supporting us with the development</div><div id="00:00:07.160" class="transcript_line"> of this short series of podcasts which are about U-Town, Tiger Bay, Cardiff Docs. This</div><div id="00:00:17.200" class="transcript_line"> particular broadcast is just a short explanation, let&#039;s say, of Cardiff&#039;s Norwegian Church.</div><div id="00:00:28.400" class="transcript_line"> It was founded by Herman Lundt of Oslo in 1868. The wooden building originally stood</div><div id="00:00:37.240" class="transcript_line"> between the East and West docks on land donated by the Marquis of Bute. The gallery and the</div><div id="00:00:44.800" class="transcript_line"> bell tower were added in 1885. It is the oldest church built overseas by the Norwegian seamen&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:52.960" class="transcript_line"> mission to survive intact. Scandinavian seamen worked on ships which came to Cardiff. The</div><div id="00:01:02.800" class="transcript_line"> church, designed like a village church back home, was a haven in the bustling port where</div><div id="00:01:09.480" class="transcript_line"> the seamen could meet, worship, read periodicals from their native countries or write letters</div><div id="00:01:16.720" class="transcript_line"> home. After the decline of the coal trade the church was closed in 1974 and had a period where</div><div id="00:01:28.360" class="transcript_line"> it fell into decay. But in 1987 it was dismantled by the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust which</div><div id="00:01:38.280" class="transcript_line"> also kept many of the interior fittings. The trust raised 250,000 pounds in Wales and Norway</div><div id="00:01:46.520" class="transcript_line"> to re-erack the church on its present site where Prince Martha Louise of Norway opened it to the public in 1992.</div><div id="00:01:57.320" class="transcript_line"> And if anyone who&#039;s been there will know if you sit outside there and have a cup of coffee you get an excellent view of the pier head,</div><div id="00:02:06.520" class="transcript_line"> the Welsh assembly building and all of the new shops and bars and restaurants.</div><div id="00:02:14.680" class="transcript_line"> The trust&#039;s first president was the children&#039;s author Roald Dahl who was christened in the</div><div id="00:02:24.760" class="transcript_line"> church in 1916. His father Harold who worshipped at the church hailed from Oslo and had co-founded</div><div id="00:02:33.240" class="transcript_line"> the Addison and Dahl Ship Broken Company in Cardiff in 1880. The company also had offices</div><div id="00:02:41.360" class="transcript_line"> in Swansea, Port Talbot and Newport. Roald Dahl died in 1990. Every year his birthday</div><div id="00:02:49.760" class="transcript_line"> is celebrated at the church with a party for local children. The church is now a venue</div><div id="00:02:55.560" class="transcript_line"> for arts exhibitions and events and meetings of the Welsh-Norwegian society with the coffee</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> bar seeking to add a bit of Scandinavian cuisine. The church reopened in May 2011 after further</div><div id="00:03:14.160" class="transcript_line"> renovation funded by the Landfill Communities Funds and with assistance from Hoardland County</div><div id="00:03:20.520" class="transcript_line"> Council Norway. In the 19th century Cardiff of course was one of Britain&#039;s three major</div><div id="00:03:30.120" class="transcript_line"> ports along with London and Liverpool. The Norwegian merchant fleet at the time was the</div><div id="00:03:36.080" class="transcript_line"> third largest in the world and Cardiff became one of its major centres of operation which</div><div id="00:03:42.720" class="transcript_line"> clearly meant an awful lot of people from Norway and its surrounding nations came to</div><div id="00:03:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff. Sjomanskirken which is the Norwegian church abroad organisation which is part of</div><div id="00:03:59.520" class="transcript_line"> the Church of Norway followed in its footsteps. Under Carl Hermann Lund from Oslo the church</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> was built to serve the religious needs of Norwegian sailors and expatriates as I&#039;ve said. It was</div><div id="00:04:14.880" class="transcript_line"> consecrated in December 1868. The church was clad in iron sheets originally on the instruction</div><div id="00:04:22.800" class="transcript_line"> of the harbour master to allow it to be moved if necessary. However the construction that form</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> meant it could also be extended many times. In 1883 a reading room was enlarged, in 1885 the gallery</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and bell tower added and in 1894 the reading room was enlarged again and re-clad in wood. It was</div><div id="00:04:49.840" class="transcript_line"> known at that and until that point as the Norwegian iron church. It later became known as the Little</div><div id="00:04:57.280" class="transcript_line"> White Church and become a welcome home point for sailors. Between 1867 and 1915 the number of</div><div id="00:05:06.720" class="transcript_line"> visiting sailors to the church rose from 7,572 to 73,580 seamen per year. So when it was originally</div><div id="00:05:25.040" class="transcript_line"> built and in its prime it had a lot of public activity from the Nordic community settling in</div><div id="00:05:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff and making routes there to the Norwegian sailors using the place as a rest stop. It was</div><div id="00:05:41.840" class="transcript_line"> also became a home away from home for sailors during World War II as they weren&#039;t able to go</div><div id="00:05:48.560" class="transcript_line"> back to Norway due to Nazi occupation and increasingly the church hosted many important</div><div id="00:05:56.960" class="transcript_line"> family occasions such as weddings and christening. Now coal exports had been declining and post World</div><div id="00:06:05.040" class="transcript_line"> War II shipping trade had moved from Cardiff and in 1959 the mission&#039;s work was discontinued. In the</div><div id="00:06:13.760" class="transcript_line"> early 1960s the Norwegian seamen&#039;s mission withdrew its patronage from the little church</div><div id="00:06:21.840" class="transcript_line"> and the last seaman priest Per Conrad Hansen was withdrawn.</div><div id="00:06:28.880" class="transcript_line"> The residual congregation and other Lutheran organizations funded its continuing use by the</div><div id="00:06:35.360" class="transcript_line"> resident expatriate Norwegian community but it was closed and deconsecrated in 1974 as a church.</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Because of Roald Dahl&#039;s contribution as the first president of the Norwegian church</div><div id="00:06:59.920" class="transcript_line"> and certainly his support in fundraising a room in the church is named the Dahl Gamera Gallery.</div><div id="00:07:09.440" class="transcript_line"> Thanks to the successful work of the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust</div><div id="00:07:14.880" class="transcript_line"> the church was moved, reconstructed and preserved and is still there and it&#039;s an excellent place</div><div id="00:07:29.520" class="transcript_line"> for events and coffee etc.</div><div id="00:07:33.920" class="transcript_line"> And here&#039;s an example once again of how you can preserve a building.</div><div id="00:07:44.080" class="transcript_line"> Sadly it also reminds us that no one bothered trying to preserve the homes of the people of Bute Town</div><div id="00:07:56.480" class="transcript_line"> but nonetheless the Norwegian church is a beautiful building.</div></div></p>
