    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The main trade here, as you can imagine, they were the name of that fish cart, the main trade was fish.</div><div id="00:00:04.800" class="transcript_line"> There was an awful lot of fish landed here. Fish was kippered, fish was preserved in salt,</div><div id="00:00:11.280" class="transcript_line"> sent all over the country. They even had a trade as far as Russia, I believe, who did salt fish.</div><div id="00:00:17.200" class="transcript_line"> So it was a busy little port. And there was a lot of smuggling went on. And the smuggling was</div><div id="00:00:25.440" class="transcript_line"> quite mundane in the sense that they were smuggling salt, because you had to pay a big</div><div id="00:00:29.520" class="transcript_line"> tax on salt. So there was salt smuggling going on. And also lots of other things were smuggled.</div><div id="00:00:35.760" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d only have to look at the map and you&#039;ve got things like Brandy Cove,</div><div id="00:00:39.440" class="transcript_line"> Gin Cove. You can imagine what was being put into those coves. Booze from Europe, wine.</div><div id="00:00:46.480" class="transcript_line"> But the official business was really just fish. But anybody traveling down this coastline had to</div><div id="00:00:56.480" class="transcript_line"> have somewhere to hide if the weather got bad. Imagine a ship that doesn&#039;t have an engine.</div><div id="00:01:00.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s reliant on the weather. So you needed somewhere you could duck into and get out of</div><div id="00:01:05.200" class="transcript_line"> the weather if the weather turned bad. And traditionally, you have the headland of St. David&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:11.840" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got the Octopatorum. The Romans knew about St. David&#039;s. The old map mentioned by</div><div id="00:01:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Pliny, Ptolemy&#039;s map, the Marksdown Fish Guard and the headland of St. David&#039;s. St. David&#039;s headland</div><div id="00:01:24.640" class="transcript_line"> was called Octopatorum, the eight perils. And so that the eight perils was eight reefs, big reefs,</div><div id="00:01:31.120" class="transcript_line"> reefs outside of St. David&#039;s. So to get around that headland was a big job. And particularly</div><div id="00:01:38.960" class="transcript_line"> in a sailing boat, because you don&#039;t know on which way the wind was blowing, which way the tide was</div><div id="00:01:43.200" class="transcript_line"> going. The easiest way of describing it is to say you had to come up on the tide. You had to wait</div><div id="00:01:48.160" class="transcript_line"> until the tide was right and the weather was right before you get around that headland.</div><div id="00:01:52.480" class="transcript_line"> And the first place you came to where you could hide out of bad weather if the weather turned</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> nasty, which it does, as you know, quite well in Wales, was Fish Guard. And Fish Guard Harbor was</div><div id="00:02:05.520" class="transcript_line"> a good place to come in. Even if you weren&#039;t trading in fish, say you were trading in timber</div><div id="00:02:09.920" class="transcript_line"> or you were trading in any other product, you&#039;d come into the harbor to hide from the weather and</div><div id="00:02:14.240" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d pay harbor duty. You&#039;d pay harbor duty to come in to hide in the harbor for a couple of days</div><div id="00:02:19.520" class="transcript_line"> and then pass on out. And at the same time, you&#039;d be buying local products.</div><div id="00:02:24.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a good place to be. It made money.</div></div></p>
