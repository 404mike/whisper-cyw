I will say that it did change the relationship that I had with those special friends that I was always with.</div><div id="00:15:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Because you can&#039;t be seen to be having favourites. And I didn&#039;t work with them anymore because I worked with a different set of people.</div><div id="00:16:01.680" class="transcript_line"> So you start these people when you, they&#039;d only worked in the factory for a fortnight and I worked with them so they didn&#039;t really know a lot about me at the time when it started.</div><div id="00:16:11.680" class="transcript_line"> So where was this now, this was in?</div><div id="00:16:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Lotteries. But what I say is, and I&#039;d always been saying this, you don&#039;t know, there&#039;s 500 of them and you might know individuals, few individuals throughout the factory</div><div id="00:16:29.680" class="transcript_line"> and you know a lot by sight because you don&#039;t really know them. But you see them often enough to know that they&#039;re part of the factory workers.</div><div id="00:16:38.680" class="transcript_line"> But because you&#039;re one of a few, they&#039;ll know every single thing about your business. And they think they know you.</div><div id="00:16:47.680" class="transcript_line"> So when they meet you out, they&#039;ll greet you like an old friend thinking that you know just as much about them as they know about you.</div><div id="00:16:55.680" class="transcript_line"> But you don&#039;t, you see. They&#039;re just a face in a crowd. And you only get to know the ones that you were immediately working with.</div><div id="00:17:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Like I knew all of my team that I had, my candle-wick machinists. But it&#039;s very rarely, and you have individual friends, that&#039;s why you&#039;d be waving across the factory.</div><div id="00:17:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Because your friend would be working in a different thing on the other side of the factory. And you all learned to live with so you could talk to them over the noise and over the distance that you were away.</div><div id="00:17:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you find that difficult then that you&#039;d been separated from your friends?</div><div id="00:17:39.680" class="transcript_line"> No, not really, no. I was conscious of it. Perhaps somebody else wouldn&#039;t have been conscious of it. But I was conscious that it had made a difference.</div><div id="00:17:50.680" class="transcript_line"> And did you mind that as you were saying, everybody knew who you were, and everybody thought they knew your business. Did you mind that?</div><div id="00:18:00.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no, because it&#039;s inevitable. You were of interest to them. They all want to think that they know you, because you were in a superior position.</div><div id="00:18:13.680" class="transcript_line"> So they talk about you, either good or bad. They probably hate your guts. But they wanted to know you, so they want to know all about you.</div><div id="00:18:27.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a strange phenomenon.</div><div id="00:18:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Would there be a lot of gossiping going on then in the factory? About the people working there?</div><div id="00:18:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes. What women are, some of it is quite catty. But it depends on you. If you are catty, then you can belong to this catty group.</div><div id="00:18:52.680" class="transcript_line"> But if you&#039;re not, they don&#039;t come into your area, because you have nothing to do with them. Even in a factory, the type of person you&#039;d want to be friends with,</div><div id="00:19:06.680" class="transcript_line"> you wouldn&#039;t be friends with the ones you wouldn&#039;t be friends with in any circumstances, because they&#039;re not your sort. You&#039;ve got nothing in common.</div><div id="00:19:15.680" class="transcript_line"> But aren&#039;t you friends with the people who are sitting next to you?</div><div id="00:19:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh yes.</div><div id="00:19:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Just because of circumstances?</div><div id="00:19:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because of circumstances. But then they might be talking about other people outside your group. But you don&#039;t have to belong to that, do you?</div><div id="00:19:33.680" class="transcript_line"> No, you don&#039;t have to take part.</div><div id="00:19:35.680" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t have to take part. So they know it would be no good talking to you about other people, because you weren&#039;t interested.</div><div id="00:19:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Was a supervisor&#039;s job something that was coveted then? Because you know it gave you privileges like the toilet.</div><div id="00:19:54.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was.</div><div id="00:19:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Some people do well with responsibility, but some don&#039;t, do they?</div><div id="00:20:01.680" class="transcript_line"> What I found, when I worked in the hospital, I was always trying to find supervisors, and it&#039;s no good advertising and bringing somebody in from outside. It doesn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:20:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Why not?</div><div id="00:20:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, when they don&#039;t know the setup, they don&#039;t know the hospital, they&#039;ve got to have someone to teach them from scratch. It&#039;s not what you want with a supervisor.</div><div id="00:20:29.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not useful to you. But to try and get some of the girls who you knew would do well to take on the responsibility was hard.</div><div id="00:20:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Because that big step over the threshold of being one of the girls and being in management is, you know, some of them didn&#039;t want to take it. They didn&#039;t want it. They wanted to be with the girls.</div><div id="00:20:57.680" class="transcript_line"> So I instigated a system where there was a couple of girls who were really good, I had, when I worked in the hospital, and they wouldn&#039;t take on a supervisor&#039;s role.</div><div id="00:21:11.680" class="transcript_line"> So in the end I said to the one girl, she&#039;s done really well for herself now, why don&#039;t you take it on temporarily and give it a try?</div><div id="00:21:24.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, you can work with Margaret and she&#039;ll show you the ropes. This is one of my supervisors. So she did that for a day and I thought, well that&#039;s not really working.</div><div id="00:21:35.680" class="transcript_line"> So because they didn&#039;t, the girls didn&#039;t respect that she was now supervising. So I ordered some more overalls and I gave her a supervisor&#039;s overall.</div><div id="00:21:48.680" class="transcript_line"> And I said, when you do your supervising duties, you have to wear a supervisor&#039;s uniform so that all the girls know that you&#039;re no longer one of them.</div><div id="00:22:01.680" class="transcript_line"> You are a supervisor and you have other responsibilities. So she gave it a go so that when the vacancy came, I had a trained supervisor ready to step in.</div><div id="00:22:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Because she took the job then, because she knew what it entailed and she wasn&#039;t afraid of it anymore and she&#039;d sorted out a relationship with the rest of the girls.</div><div id="00:22:24.680" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t a big transition from one role to the other. And when she left me, she went into, when they went out to tender in the hospital, she went in, she came to see me and said that she was going to apply.</div><div id="00:22:42.680" class="transcript_line"> That she was going to apply for this job on the monitoring side of the new contract. And I said, go for it. There was a lot more money than she had.</div><div id="00:22:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Because what I said to her in the beginning was, you don&#039;t always want to be a cleaner. There&#039;s more to life than cleaners.</div><div id="00:23:01.680" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s nothing wrong with that, is there?</div><div id="00:23:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, but the money aspect of it, she was only getting paid a cleaner&#039;s money.</div><div id="00:23:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And if she had the chance to go on and increase her earnings, the whole family benefited, didn&#039;t they? Her husband, the kids.</div><div id="00:23:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, you want to look at it like that, you have to look at what you&#039;re getting for going out every day.</div><div id="00:23:26.680" class="transcript_line"> But do you think that lack of, well ambition&#039;s probably not the right word, but lack of confidence then.</div><div id="00:23:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, lack of confidence and really lack of ambition because they don&#039;t think they can do it.</div><div id="00:23:37.680" class="transcript_line"> She was a brilliant supervisor and she&#039;s gone on, she&#039;s got quite a high position in the hospital now from this monitoring job.</div><div id="00:23:46.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, I often think, if I hadn&#039;t pushed you, you would never have started. She didn&#039;t know she could do it.</div><div id="00:23:55.680" class="transcript_line"> And there was a couple of others who I pushed in the same way because some women got no ambition and they don&#039;t look at the far distance thing with money.</div><div id="00:24:11.680" class="transcript_line"> If you can increase your earnings, that&#039;s what you should be trying to do.</div><div id="00:24:16.680" class="transcript_line"> But it might be that lack of confidence though, do you think? Because perhaps it&#039;s the way they&#039;ve been brought up, that they haven&#039;t been told that they can do stuff.</div><div id="00:24:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s lack of confidence.</div><div id="00:24:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that you were respected when you were a supervisor? Because you were a production manager as well, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:24:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, as much as you can do, they don&#039;t like you because you tell them what to do.</div><div id="00:24:42.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, you&#039;re always being popular, you can be popular and then popular.</div><div id="00:24:50.680" class="transcript_line"> If you always get things done, if you do your job, that&#039;s the thing, if you do what you&#039;re paid for, they&#039;re going to always want you to do beyond their side.</div><div id="00:25:03.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, how can I explain?</div><div id="00:25:06.680" class="transcript_line"> The management you mean?</div><div id="00:25:08.680" class="transcript_line"> No, the girls.</div><div id="00:25:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ve got to control these girls, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:25:12.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a peculiar relationship you&#039;ve got with the people who work for you.</div><div id="00:25:19.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to be able to make them do what you want without any hassle.</div><div id="00:25:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And if you say, do it, they&#039;re going to do it because they know that you&#039;re not taking advantage of them and you&#039;re not bossing them around.</div><div id="00:25:33.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve just got to do it because you&#039;ve told them they&#039;ve got to do it.</div><div id="00:25:37.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a difficult relationship.</div><div id="00:25:39.680" class="transcript_line"> But did you feel like piggy in the middle a bit then, because you were trying to fulfil what the management wanted as well?</div><div id="00:25:46.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I never felt that with the girls.</div><div id="00:25:49.680" class="transcript_line"> I did feel that sometimes with fellow supervisors.</div><div id="00:25:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes there was a lot of bitchiness.</div><div id="00:26:00.680" class="transcript_line"> When I first took supervisor, there was a lot of resentment about it from other supervisors.</div><div id="00:26:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Why though?</div><div id="00:26:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, but they didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:26:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps they felt threatened or something?</div><div id="00:26:13.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, they just didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:26:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And there was one or two that were really helpful, but there was one or two that you had to watch because they would be after your blood really.</div><div id="00:26:27.680" class="transcript_line"> But in what way would that manifest itself?</div><div id="00:26:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Would they be talking about you?</div><div id="00:26:33.680" class="transcript_line"> No, they would tell you wrong information.</div><div id="00:26:37.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fairly sneaky.</div><div id="00:26:39.680" class="transcript_line"> It is, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:40.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I found.</div><div id="00:26:41.680" class="transcript_line"> But then if I went to one of the others and said, you know, what about that?</div><div id="00:26:45.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d say, oh no, no, don&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:26:48.680" class="transcript_line"> And so there was people who were helpful and people who weren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:26:53.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was always amazing which ones turned out to be helpful to you.</div><div id="00:26:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, well that&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:27:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Not who you would necessarily have predicted then.</div><div id="00:27:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, predicted, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember how much you were paid then?</div><div id="00:27:09.680" class="transcript_line"> £1.76 when I started.</div><div id="00:27:12.680" class="transcript_line"> So were you given a pay rise every so often then?</div><div id="00:27:16.680" class="transcript_line"> We usually got a pay rise every year, but because it was all age incremented.</div><div id="00:27:21.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, if you started and you were 15, which I was 15, you had the wages of a 15-year-old.</div><div id="00:27:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Then when you were 16 you&#039;d have a bit more, and 17, and then you would get full pay at 18.</div><div id="00:27:36.680" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t get full pay until you were 18.</div><div id="00:27:39.680" class="transcript_line"> But work in Peace Work, it didn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:27:42.680" class="transcript_line"> But your rate was less though, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Your basic rate was less, but you got the same money for the Peace Work.</div><div id="00:27:51.680" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t pay you less Peace Work.</div><div id="00:27:53.680" class="transcript_line"> The rate for the Peace Work was universal.</div><div id="00:27:56.680" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d get what you earned.</div><div id="00:28:01.680" class="transcript_line"> You know we were talking about unions before.</div><div id="00:28:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I assumed they were something that became stronger a bit later on, were they?</div><div id="00:28:10.680" class="transcript_line"> There was never a union to encompass the clothing trade.</div><div id="00:28:15.680" class="transcript_line"> It was very difficult.</div><div id="00:28:17.680" class="transcript_line"> It would have to be the general workers union.</div><div id="00:28:20.680" class="transcript_line"> So not many people in those.</div><div id="00:28:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think it was something that was needed?</div><div id="00:28:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:28:25.680" class="transcript_line"> But why though?</div><div id="00:28:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Well because it stopped.</div><div id="00:28:29.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean I could always stick up for myself.</div><div id="00:28:32.680" class="transcript_line"> I know, but if somebody didn&#039;t like a job they could go somewhere else, couldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:28:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was very easy to walk.</div><div id="00:28:38.680" class="transcript_line"> There was no trouble.</div><div id="00:28:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Not like today, if you&#039;re unemployed you&#039;re unemployed and getting another job is, today is difficult.</div><div id="00:28:47.680" class="transcript_line"> You could walk, you could finish on a Monday and start work on a Tuesday.</div><div id="00:28:51.680" class="transcript_line"> So why would you need a union then?</div><div id="00:28:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Not in those days, but it would have been useful.</div><div id="00:28:58.680" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t believe in unions when I was, my mother didn&#039;t believe in unions, you see.</div><div id="00:29:04.680" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t believe in them.</div><div id="00:29:06.680" class="transcript_line"> So I would never have joined a union.</div><div id="00:29:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Plus you had to pay the union fees which you didn&#039;t want taken out of your wages.</div><div id="00:29:14.680" class="transcript_line"> But bad enough with national health, you know.</div><div id="00:29:19.680" class="transcript_line"> I forgot what I was going to say now.</div><div id="00:29:21.680" class="transcript_line"> But you could say that the work the unions did was detrimental sometimes.</div><div id="00:29:28.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, when they became quite powerful.</div><div id="00:29:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Never in the clothing trade.</div><div id="00:29:33.680" class="transcript_line"> I tell you what, there was a strike which is, I think, significant.</div><div id="00:29:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And people committed suicide over it.</div><div id="00:29:41.680" class="transcript_line"> There was a strike in the clothing trade.</div><div id="00:29:43.680" class="transcript_line"> I was never part of it.</div><div id="00:29:45.680" class="transcript_line"> It was years before the war.</div><div id="00:29:48.680" class="transcript_line"> These people, and I think now when you think about it, it&#039;s very relevant today.</div><div id="00:29:54.680" class="transcript_line"> These pile of clothing workers in the Midlands came out on strike.</div><div id="00:30:01.680" class="transcript_line"> They wanted thrup&#039;n seipni more an hour.</div><div id="00:30:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Thrup&#039;n seipni, now I ask you.</div><div id="00:30:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Thrup&#039;n seipni.</div><div id="00:30:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And they were out nearly eight, I think it was eight, nine weeks.</div><div id="00:30:15.680" class="transcript_line"> And they went back and they got one and a half pennies.</div><div id="00:30:19.680" class="transcript_line"> That was the only increase they had.</div><div id="00:30:22.680" class="transcript_line"> The strike failed.</div><div id="00:30:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And in that time the people were in such desperate need of money.</div><div id="00:30:30.680" class="transcript_line"> In such desperate straits.</div><div id="00:30:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s men and women, mind.</div><div id="00:30:34.680" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of men working in the clothing trade.</div><div id="00:30:37.680" class="transcript_line"> But they didn&#039;t have any money and the families were starving.</div><div id="00:30:41.680" class="transcript_line"> No help like the miners had when they were out.</div><div id="00:30:44.680" class="transcript_line"> They were just on their own.</div><div id="00:30:46.680" class="transcript_line"> No, not any real unions.</div><div id="00:30:49.680" class="transcript_line"> So when was that? Before the war, you said?</div><div id="00:30:52.680" class="transcript_line"> I think it was before the war.</div><div id="00:30:54.680" class="transcript_line"> It was talked about within the clothing trade.</div><div id="00:30:57.680" class="transcript_line"> I often think, you know, well, thrup&#039;n seipni.</div><div id="00:31:02.680" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s thrup&#039;n seipni today?</div><div id="00:31:04.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not 6p, is it?</div><div id="00:31:06.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:31:07.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about 2p.</div><div id="00:31:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And all they got was one and a half pennies.</div><div id="00:31:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Three eights.</div><div id="00:31:15.680" class="transcript_line"> It starved for a few months, didn&#039;t it, Bro?</div><div id="00:31:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh yeah.</div><div id="00:31:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s all the extra pay they got.</div><div id="00:31:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So all the strike and all the suffering was for three eights.</div><div id="00:31:27.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:29.680" class="transcript_line"> It is, yeah.</div><div id="00:31:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And I think it epitomises the times then.</div><div id="00:31:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And what the times are now.</div><div id="00:31:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Where people had not, the headlines in the paper I saw today,</div><div id="00:31:42.680" class="transcript_line"> or a couple of days ago, was an old paper.</div><div id="00:31:46.680" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s a good old paper.</div><div id="00:31:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Saying civil servants are coming out on strike</div><div id="00:31:53.680" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;ve been insulted with one percent pay increase.</div><div id="00:31:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, one percent of nothing is nothing.</div><div id="00:32:03.680" class="transcript_line"> One percent of what the government earn is worth having.</div><div id="00:32:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:08.680" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve been earning good wages, you see, for a long time.</div><div id="00:32:12.680" class="transcript_line"> I think they feel threatened perhaps.</div><div id="00:32:17.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been eroded away.</div><div id="00:32:20.680" class="transcript_line"> But it is being eroded away for everybody.</div><div id="00:32:22.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got pensions now.</div><div id="00:32:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And I think people who start work now are much, much worse off</div><div id="00:32:28.680" class="transcript_line"> because they&#039;re not going to get the pensions that workers who started years ago will get.</div><div id="00:32:34.680" class="transcript_line"> No, they&#039;ve got to work till they&#039;re 70 for a start, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:32:37.680" class="transcript_line"> 90 probably.</div><div id="00:32:39.680" class="transcript_line"> By that time.</div><div id="00:32:40.680" class="transcript_line"> By the time they get to it, yes.</div><div id="00:32:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got these people who are earning 600,000 a year.</div><div id="00:32:48.680" class="transcript_line"> You know?</div><div id="00:32:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:50.680" class="transcript_line"> There are no cutbacks for the people on the top.</div><div id="00:32:53.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the problem.</div><div id="00:32:54.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:32:55.680" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s got to be wrong.</div><div id="00:32:56.680" class="transcript_line"> It has definitely got to be wrong.</div><div id="00:32:58.680" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s about time that...</div><div id="00:33:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I remember seeing on the television a coloured American</div><div id="00:33:06.680" class="transcript_line"> who was looking into slavery, was doing a degree on slavery.</div><div id="00:33:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And he came here because out of the whole of the world,</div><div id="00:33:17.680" class="transcript_line"> the British were the biggest enslaved lot.</div><div id="00:33:22.680" class="transcript_line"> We were more enslaved than African slaves working in the sugar plantations.</div><div id="00:33:29.680" class="transcript_line"> We were slaves.</div><div id="00:33:31.680" class="transcript_line"> You were a slave.</div><div id="00:33:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Because if you worked on a sugar plantation and you were a slave,</div><div id="00:33:36.680" class="transcript_line"> you were a commodity.</div><div id="00:33:38.680" class="transcript_line"> So they might have beaten you up and treated you rotten,</div><div id="00:33:45.680" class="transcript_line"> but you did get fed and you did get clothing and you did have somewhere to sleep.</div><div id="00:33:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, in this country, during the same period, people didn&#039;t get that.</div><div id="00:34:00.680" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t get a decent wage, they didn&#039;t get clothes, they didn&#039;t get food.</div><div id="00:34:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And if they hented on the lordships&#039; land for rabbits, they&#039;d probably get...</div><div id="00:34:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Shipped off.</div><div id="00:34:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, shipped off, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:14.680" class="transcript_line"> So he reckoned this guy, that the British public, the British people,</div><div id="00:34:20.680" class="transcript_line"> were the most enslaved nation in the world.</div><div id="00:34:23.680" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the same today, we really are slaves.</div><div id="00:34:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:28.680" class="transcript_line"> My father always used to say, because he was a miner,</div><div id="00:34:32.680" class="transcript_line"> although he had different views to all the other miners,</div><div id="00:34:35.680" class="transcript_line"> he was very individual, but he used to say that the horses were looked after better than the workers.</div><div id="00:34:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I bet, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Because they were worth more, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:34:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, he&#039;s always another worker, a lot.</div><div id="00:34:47.680" class="transcript_line"> You have to go and look for a horse.</div><div id="00:34:49.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s a fact.</div><div id="00:34:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what this boy&#039;s thesis was about.</div><div id="00:34:54.680" class="transcript_line"> When he was talking about it, I thought, yes, you&#039;re absolutely right.</div><div id="00:34:59.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, you are right.</div><div id="00:35:01.680" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;ve got a much more relaxed attitude to work on the continent even, haven&#039;t they, than here.</div><div id="00:35:09.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;s more of an exploitative element in this country, perhaps.</div><div id="00:35:15.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the establishment.</div><div id="00:35:19.680" class="transcript_line"> If we didn&#039;t have the establishment, we would be all right as a nation.</div><div id="00:35:24.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to change very soon.</div><div id="00:35:27.680" class="transcript_line"> No, because the thing is, they&#039;re getting poorer, that&#039;s the only thing.</div><div id="00:35:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Some of them are getting richer, but the majority of them are getting more.</div><div id="00:35:34.680" class="transcript_line"> The old lot, the old lot that...</div><div id="00:35:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Old money.</div><div id="00:35:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, old money is getting tighter, but the new money is just...</div><div id="00:35:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, on the up.</div><div id="00:35:44.680" class="transcript_line"> On the up, yeah.</div><div id="00:35:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Was there anybody that you admired, either in lotteries or in RSW, anybody you looked up to?</div><div id="00:35:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I know he was a rogue, but I quite liked Harry Nash.</div><div id="00:36:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I worked with another guy.</div><div id="00:36:05.680" class="transcript_line"> An Irish guy, an Irish name.</div><div id="00:36:08.680" class="transcript_line"> He was lovely.</div><div id="00:36:11.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked a lot with him.</div><div id="00:36:12.680" class="transcript_line"> I worked a lot with him.</div><div id="00:36:13.680" class="transcript_line"> I was working for him when I started, you know.</div><div id="00:36:16.680" class="transcript_line"> So why did you admire him, for example?</div><div id="00:36:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Because he was always helpful.</div><div id="00:36:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:36:22.680" class="transcript_line"> He would explain things and he&#039;d be helpful.</div><div id="00:36:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And he didn&#039;t have a blame...</div><div id="00:36:30.680" class="transcript_line"> He wasn&#039;t part of the blame culture.</div><div id="00:36:33.680" class="transcript_line"> The majority of people have got to have someone who they can blame when things go wrong.</div><div id="00:36:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very true.</div><div id="00:36:40.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a blame culture.</div><div id="00:36:42.680" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nobody to blame.</div><div id="00:36:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Not even you, when you&#039;re in the middle of it.</div><div id="00:36:46.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a fact that it happens.</div><div id="00:36:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Things can go wrong.</div><div id="00:36:51.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very prevalent now, though, isn&#039;t it, blame culture?</div><div id="00:36:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:54.680" class="transcript_line"> More so now, I think, than back then.</div><div id="00:36:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:58.680" class="transcript_line"> But with, you know, health and safety, for example, if you&#039;ve left something on the floor and you fall over it, it&#039;s the fault of the factory.</div><div id="00:37:09.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not your fault for leaving it there, whereas perhaps years ago you&#039;d be told,</div><div id="00:37:13.680" class="transcript_line"> you shouldn&#039;t have put it there then, should you?</div><div id="00:37:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Or whatever.</div><div id="00:37:17.680" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s more people out to make money.</div><div id="00:37:20.680" class="transcript_line"> They think they&#039;re going to make some money.</div><div id="00:37:22.680" class="transcript_line"> If they fall down, they go to litigation because they&#039;re out after the money.</div><div id="00:37:29.680" class="transcript_line"> People are a lot more conscious of being able to...</div><div id="00:37:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they&#039;re clued up.</div><div id="00:37:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:37:37.680" class="transcript_line"> They want to get the money.</div><div id="00:37:40.680" class="transcript_line"> So they want to blame somebody so that they can say,</div><div id="00:37:44.680" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s your fault and you&#039;ve got to pay me some money.</div><div id="00:37:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Was there any accidents that you remember?</div><div id="00:37:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Did I ask you this last time?</div><div id="00:37:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:37:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Needles in fingers.</div><div id="00:37:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:37:58.680" class="transcript_line"> But they would take you to the hospital.</div><div id="00:38:00.680" class="transcript_line"> They sent you to the hospital.</div><div id="00:38:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Did that happen to you?</div><div id="00:38:04.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen him several times.</div><div id="00:38:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and I did once fall over.</div><div id="00:38:11.680" class="transcript_line"> They had a doctor that used to come in and examine all new.</div><div id="00:38:17.680" class="transcript_line"> If you had to watch him, he was a bit...</div><div id="00:38:20.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, today, when I see these things about Russ...</div><div id="00:38:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Rob Harris?</div><div id="00:38:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Rob Harris and all these others, I think you didn&#039;t know what we had to go through.</div><div id="00:38:30.680" class="transcript_line"> So what do you mind asking?</div><div id="00:38:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, I shouldn&#039;t laugh, really.</div><div id="00:38:33.680" class="transcript_line"> So what would he do?</div><div id="00:38:35.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d always have to strip to the waist.</div><div id="00:38:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And if you wouldn&#039;t take your bra off, he would go...</div><div id="00:38:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Ping it?</div><div id="00:38:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, ping your bra.</div><div id="00:38:46.680"

job, he did.</div><div id="00:38:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Everybody told...</div><div id="00:38:56.680" class="transcript_line"> All the girls went on about it.</div><div id="00:38:58.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d go, oh, I&#039;ve got to go and see this.</div><div id="00:39:00.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what his name was.</div><div id="00:39:01.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just as well, really.</div><div id="00:39:03.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was a laugh.</div><div id="00:39:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Everybody had suffered.</div><div id="00:39:08.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just how it was.</div><div id="00:39:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Somebody told him, well, literally.</div><div id="00:39:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Nobody had complained either.</div><div id="00:39:15.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they did.</div><div id="00:39:18.680" class="transcript_line"> He was a fact of life, you know.</div><div id="00:39:20.680" class="transcript_line"> You had to go and have this medical, and he was the doctor that did the medical examination.</div><div id="00:39:25.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the way he was, you know.</div><div id="00:39:27.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d touch you up.</div><div id="00:39:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t take any notice.</div><div id="00:39:31.680" class="transcript_line"> It was an odd deal by...</div><div id="00:39:35.680" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have a nickname for him, did you?</div><div id="00:39:38.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think they did.</div><div id="00:39:40.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d say, oh, God.</div><div id="00:39:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Especially if you were ordered to go for some reason or other.</div><div id="00:39:44.680" class="transcript_line"> You had a rash or anything.</div><div id="00:39:46.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d still have to take your bra off.</div><div id="00:39:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Strip to the waist.</div><div id="00:39:53.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was just a fact of life.</div><div id="00:39:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that you had a lot...</div><div id="00:39:58.680" class="transcript_line"> But would he actually touch somebody or just have a look?</div><div id="00:40:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, have a look.</div><div id="00:40:04.680" class="transcript_line"> That wouldn&#039;t happen today, would it?</div><div id="00:40:06.680" class="transcript_line"> No, he&#039;d be sued.</div><div id="00:40:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Have a kill.</div><div id="00:40:10.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I think they&#039;d say.</div><div id="00:40:12.680" class="transcript_line"> He sexually harassed them.</div><div id="00:40:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Or, you know...</div><div id="00:40:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I think to myself, you kept out of his way.</div><div id="00:40:23.680" class="transcript_line"> You never voluntarily went to see this man.</div><div id="00:40:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Only if you were ordered.</div><div id="00:40:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of that on theirs is a similar type of thing.</div><div id="00:40:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Why didn&#039;t they just keep out of his way?</div><div id="00:40:40.680" class="transcript_line"> How often was he in the factory?</div><div id="00:40:42.680" class="transcript_line"> He wasn&#039;t there full-time. He counted.</div><div id="00:40:44.680" class="transcript_line"> No, he&#039;d come sort of once a month.</div><div id="00:40:48.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d be in with the nurse.</div><div id="00:40:50.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d always have the nurse there, mind.</div><div id="00:40:53.680" class="transcript_line"> So what would he be like if he didn&#039;t have the nurse?</div><div id="00:41:00.680" class="transcript_line"> It was just a fact of life.</div><div id="00:41:02.680" class="transcript_line"> So if you were ordered to go and see the doctor, it would be about a rash or something?</div><div id="00:41:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Or something, because you get dermatitis in...</div><div id="00:41:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, do you? In factories?</div><div id="00:41:14.680" class="transcript_line"> With cloth.</div><div id="00:41:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Because you get mites that live in the cloth.</div><div id="00:41:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh!</div><div id="00:41:21.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s like a mite that is living in the cloth.</div><div id="00:41:27.680" class="transcript_line"> In wool?</div><div id="00:41:28.680" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of things, yes.</div><div id="00:41:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. I hadn&#039;t realised that.</div><div id="00:41:32.680" class="transcript_line"> You get bitten by... they&#039;re almost invisible. You can&#039;t see them.</div><div id="00:41:36.680" class="transcript_line"> So who would notice that then?</div><div id="00:41:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you would if you were itching, because you&#039;re itching.</div><div id="00:41:41.680" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t admit to that if you had to go and see him, would you?</div><div id="00:41:45.680" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have any folk remedies or anything like that to sort it out yourselves?</div><div id="00:41:49.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no. But it was something that could happen.</div><div id="00:41:53.680" class="transcript_line"> It might not be anything. It might not have been dermatitis.</div><div id="00:41:56.680" class="transcript_line"> But you have to be careful.</div><div id="00:41:58.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, because you can become allergic to the cloth.</div><div id="00:42:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:42:04.680" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes there&#039;s chemicals in it that come out when it&#039;s steamed.</div><div id="00:42:09.680" class="transcript_line"> So that would affect the pressers then, would it?</div><div id="00:42:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Pressers would have problems. They&#039;d have respiratory problems.</div><div id="00:42:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="00:42:19.680" class="transcript_line"> It was...</div><div id="00:42:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Dangerous work.</div><div id="00:42:23.680" class="transcript_line"> It could be, if you were particularly sensitive.</div><div id="00:42:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Did some girls ever finish there due to health problems?</div><div id="00:42:30.680" class="transcript_line"> I never heard of anybody.</div><div id="00:42:32.680" class="transcript_line"> But there was always a big turnover of females.</div><div id="00:42:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Why is that then? Because it was so difficult?</div><div id="00:42:38.680" class="transcript_line"> No, they just... their jobs were so easy to come by.</div><div id="00:42:41.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d get another job and move on.</div><div id="00:42:43.680" class="transcript_line"> But what type of job would they get instead of working there?</div><div id="00:42:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, in Newport there was Santons that were totally different.</div><div id="00:42:51.680" class="transcript_line"> They made water heaters.</div><div id="00:42:53.680" class="transcript_line"> But would that work later then?</div><div id="00:42:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so. It was still the same boring old repetitive stuff.</div><div id="00:43:01.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, and there were standard telephones.</div><div id="00:43:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, standard telephones was a much better job.</div><div id="00:43:08.680" class="transcript_line"> You were at market if you worked for standard telephones.</div><div id="00:43:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Why, though?</div><div id="00:43:13.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s all part of the snobbery.</div><div id="00:43:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Was the money better?</div><div id="00:43:17.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:43:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Better money doesn&#039;t necessarily reflect status, though, does it, with work?</div><div id="00:43:22.680" class="transcript_line"> No, but the thing is, if you&#039;d worked...</div><div id="00:43:25.680" class="transcript_line"> A couple of my friends worked at standard telephones,</div><div id="00:43:28.680" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t honestly know what they do, what they were doing.</div><div id="00:43:33.680" class="transcript_line"> But I think they thought they were educationally a bit better.</div><div id="00:43:38.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, you can&#039;t tell with women.</div><div id="00:43:42.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s strange.

Thanks.</div><div id="00:50:09.680" class="transcript_line"> So the work in a factory was five days a week with possible extra on Saturdays, is it?</div><div id="00:50:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes on a Saturday.</div><div id="00:50:17.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember because it was a 48-hour week, so I think Saturday was included.</div><div id="00:50:23.680" class="transcript_line"> It was eight till five and eight till one or eight till twelve on a Saturday.</div><div id="00:50:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But was that all the time or was it just when there were particular orders in?</div><div id="00:50:34.680" class="transcript_line"> No, that was a 48-hour week.</div><div id="00:50:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh, it&#039;s a lot isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:50:38.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s what you worked.</div><div id="00:50:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Most people worked a 48-hour week.</div><div id="00:50:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh did they?</div><div id="00:50:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Then they put it down to 40.</div><div id="00:50:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:47.680" class="transcript_line"> And in fact when I worked at the hospital...</div><div id="00:50:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well at 40 it&#039;s a day less isn&#039;t it? You know?</div><div id="00:50:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is really.</div><div id="00:50:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And when they put it down to 40 and I started working in the hospital many years later,</div><div id="00:50:59.680" class="transcript_line"> I just assumed that it was a 40-hour week, but I was only working a 47-hour week, a 37-hour week.</div><div id="00:51:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:51:08.680" class="transcript_line"> So I always worked 40 hours, I was always there 40 hours.</div><div id="00:51:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:51:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Because I was used to those sort of hours, 37, you know, and that&#039;s sometimes not having a dinner break or anything.</div><div id="00:51:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Was there a...there was a canteen in Lothreys, was there?</div><div id="00:51:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, a lovely canteen.</div><div id="00:51:26.680" class="transcript_line"> So was that subsidised then?</div><div id="00:51:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they did have, also in Lothreys, they had a works council.</div><div id="00:51:35.680" class="transcript_line"> That meant it was very...I think works councils are very progressive.</div><div id="00:51:40.680" class="transcript_line"> They had different girls from different sections of the factory who would stay behind for an evening,</div><div id="00:51:49.680" class="transcript_line"> and they would provide a tea, a substantial tea, and they&#039;d have like a big meeting in the canteen</div><div id="00:51:57.680" class="transcript_line"> where they would discuss all the grievances from their sections with management.</div><div id="00:52:07.680" class="transcript_line"> But were they supervisors or just representatives?</div><div id="00:52:11.680" class="transcript_line"> They were representatives of the factory floor.</div><div id="00:52:14.680" class="transcript_line"> So who would have chosen them then?</div><div id="00:52:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, the girls did.</div><div id="00:52:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, that is very progressive, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:52:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be supervisors there as well, a few. Not all of them, but a few of them.</div><div id="00:52:25.680" class="transcript_line"> And top management would be there. You know, Mr Lothreys himself used to come down for the workers&#039; management.</div><div id="00:52:31.680" class="transcript_line"> So how often would they be held?</div><div id="00:52:33.680" class="transcript_line"> About every three or four months.</div><div id="00:52:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Gosh. So do you remember any decisions being made on the back of these meetings?</div><div id="00:52:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t really remember, but I can remember there was a lot of...</div><div id="00:52:44.680" class="transcript_line"> One thing, there was always things like the long queues, not moving fast enough at breaks,</div><div id="00:52:52.680" class="transcript_line"> because you only had a small amount of time.</div><div id="00:52:55.680" class="transcript_line"> So if you wanted a cup of tea, the teas had to be ready when each section went in,</div><div id="00:53:02.680" class="transcript_line"> and you had to be able to pay quickly and sit down and have your tea.</div><div id="00:53:06.680" class="transcript_line"> So that was always a bone of contention, the times that the canteen would keep you waiting out of your break time.</div><div id="00:53:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Then there was problems with toilets, you know, the cleaning of the toilets, all the cloakrooms.</div><div id="00:53:23.680" class="transcript_line"> What, that they weren&#039;t clean?</div><div id="00:53:25.680" class="transcript_line"> That they weren&#039;t done properly.</div><div id="00:53:27.680" class="transcript_line"> And the complaints about the girls writing on the walls of the toilets. You know, those sort of things.</div><div id="00:53:35.680" class="transcript_line"> But who would be complaining about that?</div><div id="00:53:37.680" class="transcript_line"> The girls. It was quite rude.</div><div id="00:53:40.680" class="transcript_line"> About other girls, or just rude?</div><div id="00:53:43.680" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t know who did it, you see. Nobody knew who did it.</div><div id="00:53:47.680" class="transcript_line"> They never found out.</div><div id="00:53:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s another form of expression, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:53:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You didn&#039;t have to read it.</div><div id="00:53:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it would all depend whether it was about you or not.</div><div id="00:54:02.680" class="transcript_line"> No, they were really rude. Really, really rude.</div><div id="00:54:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear. Yeah, we were talking about the canteen. The food was good there.</div><div id="00:54:16.680" class="transcript_line"> The food was good, yeah. Never ever complaints about the quality of the food. Just how slow it was being served.</div><div id="00:54:26.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very good psychology to give workers good food though, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:54:30.680" class="transcript_line"> It is, yeah.</div><div id="00:54:32.680" class="transcript_line"> It keeps them happy, doesn&#039;t it, for a while?</div><div id="00:54:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah. You know, when you only got such a little time, a lot of them took their own food in.</div><div id="00:54:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you just take your own?</div><div id="00:54:43.680" class="transcript_line"> No. You had to pay for it, but I think that it wasn&#039;t extortion, it was reasonable.</div><div id="00:54:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Were the holidays something you were desperate to see coming, you know, having time off?</div><div id="00:55:00.680" class="transcript_line"> You were desperate for time off?</div><div id="00:55:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, the clothing trade has closed down fortnight, so you weren&#039;t given any choice when you had your holidays.</div><div id="00:55:09.680" class="transcript_line"> And they were always the worst two weeks of the year, because it was the last week of July and the first week of August.</div><div id="00:55:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Worst for weather.</div><div id="00:55:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the worst for weather.</div><div id="00:55:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Nothing new there then?</div><div id="00:55:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So unless you went abroad, which you didn&#039;t do in those days, no package to earth. I mean, I used to go abroad.</div><div id="00:55:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So where did you go?</div><div id="00:55:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Spain. I went to Holland. And I went to Spain.</div><div id="00:55:38.680" class="transcript_line"> But I wasn&#039;t your ordinary everyday Renard Pearson. My cousin worked on the railway. She worked for the railway and the office.</div><div id="00:55:51.680" class="transcript_line"> This is the one, I think I told you, that did sitting girls, dressmaking and design, and then went on and taught.</div><div id="00:56:01.680" class="transcript_line"> But before that she worked for the British Rail in the offices in Newport. And she used to get cheap rail fare, you see.</div><div id="00:56:11.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s handy.</div><div id="00:56:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she did, but I had to pay full price. So we used to go on holiday together.</div><div id="00:56:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, lovely.</div><div id="00:56:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And my mother would let me go with her, even though I was only fifteen.</div><div id="00:56:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh. Well, you wouldn&#039;t go abroad when you were fifteen, though, would you?</div><div id="00:56:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:56:29.680" class="transcript_line"> I went abroad for the first time. But I was with Doreen.</div><div id="00:56:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Before your time. Obviously.</div><div id="00:56:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:38.680" class="transcript_line"> The social activities in the factory then, would you socialise much with people outside work?</div><div id="00:56:45.680" class="transcript_line"> No, you didn&#039;t have time. You just didn&#039;t have time because you were working eight till five by the time you got home.</div><div id="00:56:54.680" class="transcript_line"> We all used to go out together. There was always a Christmas dinner dance where the management all came.</div><div id="00:57:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Was that in the factory?</div><div id="00:57:03.680" class="transcript_line"> No, it was in a hotel, a local hotel. So there was the dinner dance. They used to rent trips during the shutdown for people who didn&#039;t go on holiday.</div><div id="00:57:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they do it in the shutdown?</div><div id="00:57:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they&#039;d have a couple of trips out. They used to go to Western on the paddle steamer.</div><div id="00:57:24.680" class="transcript_line"> But you had to pay for those, presumably?</div><div id="00:57:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah. Go to Barry Island on a bus.</div><div id="00:57:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Was there a sports and social club?</div><div id="00:57:33.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:57:34.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:57:35.680" class="transcript_line"> But I used to play tennis with two of the fellas in the cutting room.</div><div id="00:57:42.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a tennis court at the back of the factory, adjacent to the canteen. They also used to let me keep the canoe there.</div><div id="00:57:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Canoe?</div><div id="00:57:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, canoe. My brother and I had a canoe. Of course, we were not far from the river.</div><div id="00:58:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, of course.</div><div id="00:58:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Instead of carting it back and forth on the back of the bike, on a push bike, it&#039;s wheeled back and forth.</div><div id="00:58:09.680" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a long way to go with this canoe. They used to let me keep it in a little room off the canteen.</div><div id="00:58:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I told you I wanted the canoes. I don&#039;t want to be every day so...</div><div id="00:58:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, at least you didn&#039;t take the canoe to go to work.</div><div id="00:58:29.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:58:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But I used to like playing tennis. I played a lot of tennis.</div><div id="00:58:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Were there any other teams? Were there teams of like... I mean, there were football teams in some factories.</div><div id="00:58:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, oh no. They weren&#039;t that sort of... A lot of them used to cycle to work, but they never did anything with cycling as a sport in things.</div><div id="00:58:57.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve told me of a few instances already that you remember. Is there any other event that comes to mind when you think about your work, either at lotteries or at RSW, anybody famous visiting or taking a look at what you&#039;re doing or any event?</div><div id="00:59:16.680" class="transcript_line"> No, you always have government inspectors for the army or the British railway.</div><div id="00:59:25.680" class="transcript_line"> But of course they don&#039;t do that sort of stuff. There&#039;s all those big contracts and are no longer relevant because they don&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:59:37.680" class="transcript_line"> British Railways provided uniforms for their staff. The army staff is made... Well, look, you look at it, if my son was in the army, it&#039;s absolute rubbish.</div><div id="00:59:52.680" class="transcript_line"> When he was in Northern Ireland, he did a 12 month first, and then he did something else and they brought him back from Canada when he was in Canada.</div><div id="01:00:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And that was the end. He never could go back. So I don&#039;t know what they were doing. And he never told me.</div><div id="01:00:14.680" class="transcript_line"> It was good to keep it a secret then.</div><div id="01:00:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, they had to. And they couldn&#039;t go back. So what they were doing, I don&#039;t know. Because it was dangerous for them to go back. Their faces might have been recognised.</div><div id="01:00:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And he had a body armour and he brought it home with him because he was going to wash it. I said, I&#039;ll wash it. But he said, no. He said, I know exactly what to do with it.</div><div id="01:00:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And when I saw it, it was falling apart. I mean, this was body armour. Not like the police wear now. It was absolutely tatty.</div><div id="01:00:51.680" class="transcript_line"> I was disgusted with the quality of it all. Made abroad, you see, somewhere. And it really wanted mending.</div><div id="01:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> And when he came home on leave, I was always bending those camouflage stuff he had. They were really tatty.</div><div id="01:01:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, were they? You would have thought they&#039;d be hard wearing. They need to be hard wearing.</div><div id="01:01:15.680" class="transcript_line"> They need to be, but they&#039;re not. They&#039;re not quality fabric.</div><div id="01:01:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Where are they made then?</div><div id="01:01:21.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where they&#039;re made now. I think they still might be made. Well, I&#039;ve never heard of anybody making uniform tailoring, doing army stuff.</div><div id="01:01:29.680" class="transcript_line"> There might be factories in London doing it, but I think they&#039;re all made abroad.</div><div id="01:01:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Because Gareth, just before he came out, he used to drive warrior personnel carriers.</div><div id="01:01:45.680" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t talk a lot, my boy. And he used to go off with his major.</div><div id="01:01:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And before the Iraq War, he went to Iraq with his major, or Jordan or somewhere, where they were having...</div><div id="01:02:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Because you know when our boys went out, they didn&#039;t have any light uniforms. They had to go out in...</div><div id="01:02:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Mad, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:02:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it was criminal. It was really criminal.</div><div id="01:02:17.680" class="transcript_line"> So the people in the War Office wanted to know what sort of uniforms they were wearing, these armies, the Jordanian army and what the uniforms were like.</div><div id="01:02:32.680" class="transcript_line"> And Gareth went with his major on a recce job, looking at and finding out how they manufactured them.</div><div id="01:02:40.680" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t think they were manufacturing them in this country. It might have been coming from Sri Lanka or somewhere in India.</div><div id="01:02:48.680" class="transcript_line"> I know the textile factories in West Wales. They went to Morocco, apparently.</div><div id="01:02:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, a friend of mine who&#039;s got this company in Newport called J&amp;B Builders is a sewing factory. He sells sewing machines.</div><div id="01:03:08.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got three factories in Morocco himself.</div><div id="01:03:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Making garments.</div><div id="01:03:16.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that factories will start coming back here though, eventually.</div><div id="01:03:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, the wages will be so low, they can&#039;t afford Thailand anymore.</div><div id="01:03:25.680" class="transcript_line"> China, for example. Things are getting more expensive coming from there and they&#039;re getting workers&#039; rights now, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:03:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="01:03:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Because I saw something on the telly the other day, and it showed one Chinese person saying, I&#039;m not working for you anymore. I&#039;m going to work for someone else.</div><div id="01:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, the thing is, Thailand and China are the fastest growing economies in the world.</div><div id="01:03:50.680" class="transcript_line"> And when people want more money, and that&#039;s what you say to these girls in the hospital, it&#039;s the money you&#039;ve got to go for.</div><div id="01:03:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Because at the end of the day, that&#039;s what benefits your family most, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:04:04.680" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve got to be out working, and most of us can&#039;t afford to stay home anymore, you&#039;ve got to go where you&#039;re getting most for your time.</div><div id="01:04:14.680" class="transcript_line"> The time you&#039;re away from the family.</div><div id="01:04:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s got to be worthwhile.</div><div id="01:04:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And they get the same. The Japanese and the Chinese used to be Japanese tourists, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:04:25.680" class="transcript_line"> But now it&#039;s Chinese tourists and Thai tourists.</div><div id="01:04:30.680" class="transcript_line"> And even Vietnam. They&#039;ve got tourists going all over the place.

It&#039;s quite cheap in places like Vietnam.</div><div id="01:05:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Whereas the flights are so cheaper.</div><div id="01:05:14.680" class="transcript_line"> And the weather is just the same as Spain.</div><div id="01:05:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Spain&#039;s got nothing more to offer than Vietnam or Thailand unless you get caught in a tsunami.</div><div id="01:05:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Which happened to a friend of mine.</div><div id="01:05:26.680" class="transcript_line"> She was out there during that terrible tsunami.</div><div id="01:05:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Staying at that pen beach, the one that was absolutely united.</div><div id="01:05:38.680" class="transcript_line"> It took her nearly three years to get over it.</div><div id="01:05:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not surprised.

And they could have done a lot better for themselves.</div><div id="01:12:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:12.680" class="transcript_line"> All of them were capable of, there was a lot of them there who were capable of doing a lot better, with better jobs.</div><div id="01:12:19.680" class="transcript_line"> But the opportunities weren&#039;t there.</div><div id="01:12:20.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:12:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was plenty of work, but there wasn&#039;t a variety of opportunities, I suppose.</div><div id="01:12:25.680" class="transcript_line"> No. It was very difficult to get on if you were female.</div><div id="01:12:32.680" class="transcript_line"> So what were the options apart from factory work?</div><div id="01:12:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Shop work, office work.</div><div id="01:12:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Things like hairdressing, if you wanted that. But those sort of things don&#039;t suit everybody today.</div><div id="01:12:48.680" class="transcript_line"> No, they don&#039;t.</div><div id="01:12:49.680" class="transcript_line"> And it depends what&#039;s available in your location as well, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:12:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:54.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve spoken to some girls who dreamed of doing hairdressing, but they lived out in the country, so that&#039;s a point.</div><div id="01:13:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:03.680" class="transcript_line"> It all depends what&#039;s on your doorstep.</div><div id="01:13:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And just how, I mean, if you were determined you were going to be a hairdresser.</div><div id="01:13:11.680" class="transcript_line"> But there was always something easier to do.</div><div id="01:13:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:17.680" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t worth the struggle.</div><div id="01:13:20.680" class="transcript_line"> So do you think factory work held people back then, in the sense, because it was well-paid work on the doorstep?</div><div id="01:13:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="01:13:32.680" class="transcript_line"> But then a lot of women haven&#039;t got a lot of ambition, have they?</div><div id="01:13:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Really and truly, they&#039;d only want to get married, and in those days, within getting married, you&#039;re pregnant within the first year, life was settled for you, you know?</div><div id="01:13:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Because you got married and you had a baby within the year, and sometimes you were already having the baby when you got married, you know?</div><div id="01:13:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:56.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have chairs in the factory that nobody would sit on, because that was the time you became pregnant.</div><div id="01:14:06.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a chair that you didn&#039;t sit on.</div><div id="01:14:10.680" class="transcript_line"> It was contagious.</div><div id="01:14:12.680" class="transcript_line"> That was all part of the myth.</div><div id="01:14:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And how would you describe the humour then, in that particular type of workplace?</div><div id="01:14:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it&#039;s great. There&#039;s a lot of camaraderie, you know?</div><div id="01:14:33.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have a really good laugh, because it&#039;d make the time go, you see?</div><div id="01:14:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, eight hours a day is a lot of hours, nine hours at one time.</div><div id="01:14:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But you were busy for all that time, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:14:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="01:14:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But you needed something else to keep you going.</div><div id="01:14:50.680" class="transcript_line"> We needed something to occupy your mind, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="01:14:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:14:53.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I always think about car workers, you see? That was a repetitive, boring thing.</div><div id="01:14:59.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they were always out on strike for more money. They had too much time on their hands, or too much time on their brains.</div><div id="01:15:07.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, they could sort of go—and you&#039;d get the ones that want to cause trouble, and they&#039;d all be out, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="01:15:14.680" class="transcript_line"> And I blamed them for the state that the world is in today.</div><div id="01:15:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And the miners, in a way. I think the miners did themselves a disservice.</div><div id="01:15:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was disastrous.</div><div id="01:15:27.680" class="transcript_line"> So why go out for more money? Money was no good to them. The government—so they&#039;d get a big pay rise.</div><div id="01:15:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Go out and try and get a big pay rise. It didn&#039;t affect them all. Only a certain few would get the money.</div><div id="01:15:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And what did they do? The government would take half of it off them in tax.</div><div id="01:15:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was political, wasn&#039;t it? It was politically motivated.</div><div id="01:15:54.680" class="transcript_line"> They had aging provocateurs there.</div><div id="01:15:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they did.</div><div id="01:16:00.680" class="transcript_line"> You see, I always say that if what the miners came out on strike for was six weeks holiday a year paid, and retirement at 55 on a full pension,</div><div id="01:16:15.680" class="transcript_line"> well, that would have been something, hadn&#039;t it? Because the only thing that money can do is to buy time.</div><div id="01:16:21.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the only thing on God&#039;s earth that buys time. If you&#039;ve got enough of it, you&#039;ve got more time.</div><div id="01:16:29.680" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s what I think about it. You either haven&#039;t got any time because you&#039;re working all the time, or you&#039;ve got plenty of time and no money.</div><div id="01:16:39.680" class="transcript_line"> You know? So time is tied up with money.</div><div id="01:16:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is.</div><div id="01:16:46.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what they should have gone for. They&#039;d have had a better life because they&#039;d have had six weeks paid holiday, and they&#039;d have retired at 55 on a full pension.</div><div id="01:16:57.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the things that they should have been going for. Not more money, because the government took half of it.</div><div id="01:17:04.680" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was not very productive.</div><div id="01:17:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, it wasn&#039;t. It was absolutely destructive.</div><div id="01:17:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So I do blame them for a lot of the things that went wrong.</div><div id="01:17:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Because if they&#039;d got it, it would have affected the rest of our lives. The rest of us, our lives would have improved.</div><div id="01:17:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;d have had to improve all of our working conditions.</div><div id="01:17:31.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I always felt. And especially the car workers, because they were in good. And what good to them. I mean, their industry is in turmoil, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:17:43.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s gone basically, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="01:17:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:17:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s gone somewhere else. So they should have been going out for more holidays, paid early retirement. And they&#039;d have benefited. I think they were men who were really stupid.</div><div id="01:18:02.680" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;re right there. Patricia, that&#039;s it. Thank you very, very much. It&#039;s been fantastic. Thank you.</div></div></p>
