    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And one night in the middle of the winter, my father must have smelled smoke and went</div><div id="00:00:13.340" class="transcript_line"> outside and saw the synagogue flame with us in it. So he managed to get all of us out,</div><div id="00:00:20.780" class="transcript_line"> my mother again pregnant and the baby in arms. And there we could see a group of Nazi youths</div><div id="00:00:29.560" class="transcript_line"> with bricks in their hands. They were determined to exterminate us as well as the synagogue.</div><div id="00:00:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Synagogue went down and in the, whatever it was, with the fires going and people shouting,</div><div id="00:00:52.120" class="transcript_line"> non-Jewish people got us away. We were in our nightclothes and no shoes and they hid us in</div><div id="00:01:00.760" class="transcript_line"> an ice cellar which in those days was a hollowed out hill filled with ice. There was no such thing as</div><div id="00:01:12.480" class="transcript_line"> fidgets. We were, these people who lived in the big house put us into the ice cellar when there</div><div id="00:01:28.960" class="transcript_line"> was virtually mass hysteria because they couldn&#039;t find us and they wanted to kill us. And we knew</div><div id="00:01:34.080" class="transcript_line"> they wanted to kill us. But the rest of the day of that night is complete blank. Actually it was</div><div id="00:01:43.560" class="transcript_line"> only four years ago that I saw the ice cellar and I met the daughter of the people who saved us.</div><div id="00:01:54.440" class="transcript_line"> How did you get, how were you saved? Well as I said, in this mass hysteria they smuggled us away</div><div id="00:02:05.600" class="transcript_line"> from the fire and these non-Jewish people and they hid us in the ice cellar. Until the next day,</div><div id="00:02:14.760" class="transcript_line"> by next day of course the hysteria which when a group of Hitler youths get together, they wind</div><div id="00:02:25.440" class="transcript_line"> one another up as we now say. And it&#039;s just one hysteric mob and all they wanted to do was kill us.</div></div></p>
