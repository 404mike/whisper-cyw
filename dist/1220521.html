    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a bit more about Habonim then? How it was organised and what you did?</div><div id="00:00:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, Habonim was largely, it was Zionist.</div><div id="00:00:10.200" class="transcript_line"> We basically were all for the State of Israel, the kibbutz movement,</div><div id="00:00:17.600" class="transcript_line"> because it was left-wing without being Marxist.</div><div id="00:00:20.600" class="transcript_line"> There were different forms of Jewish movements.</div><div id="00:00:25.600" class="transcript_line"> There was an extreme left-wing Marxist group, Hashomer HaTzaiyya,</div><div id="00:00:34.200" class="transcript_line"> Watchmen of the Night. They were extreme left-wing.</div><div id="00:00:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Habonim, the word bon-er in Hebrew is builder.</div><div id="00:00:43.200" class="transcript_line"> The prefix ha is the definite article, and im at the end of a word is the plural.</div><div id="00:00:50.200" class="transcript_line"> So, Habonim is the builders.</div><div id="00:00:52.800" class="transcript_line"> What are they building? They&#039;re building Eretz Israel, a land which would be for all Jews.</div><div id="00:01:00.400" class="transcript_line"> And interestingly, Zionism was the result, as Simon Schama said only recently,</div><div id="00:01:10.200" class="transcript_line"> the result of antisemitism. Not the cause of it.</div><div id="00:01:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Many people today think that because of Israel and Zionism, people are antisemitic.</div><div id="00:01:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Not true. Antisemitism, in my view, is a bit like fox hunting.</div><div id="00:01:28.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s fun. Kill a Jew. It&#039;s great fun.</div><div id="00:01:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Particularly at Easter time, you know, when the Passover and Easter relate.</div><div id="00:01:38.800" class="transcript_line"> So, Zionism as such was the key element of Habonim,</div><div id="00:01:45.400" class="transcript_line"> but there was a great emphasis upon Israeli folk tunes and dancing, Israeli dancing,</div><div id="00:01:51.800" class="transcript_line"> and play-acting and scouting, because we did a lot of camping and trekking and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:02:02.200" class="transcript_line"> It was influential in a big time.</div></div></p>
