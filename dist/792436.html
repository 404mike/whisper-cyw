We&#039;re at the YHA in Llanberis,</div><div id="00:00:14.580" class="transcript_line"> which has an old orchard that we are bringing back to life. And this is what I&#039;ve come up</div><div id="00:00:22.120" class="transcript_line"> with in my story this morning. So why wander? I like wandering. So I like to wander because</div><div id="00:00:29.700" class="transcript_line"> I meet new people. I listen to new voices. I revisit old friends and places. I enjoy</div><div id="00:00:35.780" class="transcript_line"> new colours, landscapes, wildlife, food and drink. I forget my worries. I get healthy.</div><div id="00:00:44.060" class="transcript_line"> I refresh my outlook on life, past and future. I can change my destiny. I can embrace my</div><div id="00:00:51.020" class="transcript_line"> future and I don&#039;t regret my past. I live more in the present. Wandering is good for</div><div id="00:00:57.340" class="transcript_line"> my physical, mental, emotional, cultural and social wellbeing. But wandering doesn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:01:03.780" class="transcript_line"> to mean physically travelling places, although that can sometimes help. You can go to and</div><div id="00:01:09.280" class="transcript_line"> experience new things in your imagination or by challenging yourself culturally, mentally</div><div id="00:01:14.740" class="transcript_line"> or creatively. Thank you.</div></div></p>
