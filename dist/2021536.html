    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I would consider you both to be, in my opinion, kind of real Newport kind</div><div id="00:00:29.960" class="transcript_line"> of Newport heads really. Is that fair comment do you think? Yeah. You&#039;re both very visible,</div><div id="00:00:38.360" class="transcript_line"> both very proactive, people are very positive. I think you&#039;ve done, you&#039;ve both done huge amounts</div><div id="00:00:44.680" class="transcript_line"> for Newport, actually I really do. I&#039;m not here to brown-nose you, but I think you both have kind of</div><div id="00:00:49.240" class="transcript_line"> done exactly what Newport needs, kind of, you&#039;ve been a hugely positive influence. So I&#039;m just</div><div id="00:00:56.040" class="transcript_line"> going to ask you first, when did we get City Stations? I can&#039;t remember. I think it was just</div><div id="00:01:02.440" class="transcript_line"> from doing a bit of prep for this, it was 2002 I think, I didn&#039;t make a note of it but... I was</div><div id="00:01:08.360" class="transcript_line"> going to say it was either 2001 or 2002 because my daughter was five because it was when the</div><div id="00:01:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Jubilee happened and my mum dressed her up in uni and jacks and took her to see the queen and I was</div><div id="00:01:19.240" class="transcript_line"> fucking fuming. What did it mean? Did it mean anything? What did Newport&#039;s kind of,</div><div id="00:01:27.320" class="transcript_line"> well it might have been able to City Stations to have any effect on you? Funnily enough, when I was</div><div id="00:01:31.640" class="transcript_line"> sort of doing a bit of prep for this and reading back, because I had this horrible feeling I just</div><div id="00:01:35.880" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t going to be able to remember anything because I spent certainly most of the noughties</div><div id="00:01:39.960" class="transcript_line"> in the second half of the 90s with a beer in my hand and I thought well I know that it was the</div><div id="00:01:45.080" class="transcript_line"> most exciting time of my life and it sort of made me who I am and I made the most amazing</div><div id="00:01:50.040" class="transcript_line"> friends and had great experiences and I don&#039;t mean like in an alcoholic, like blackout kind of way,</div><div id="00:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> I just mean like it was all just such, you know, like it was like 15 years there or longer that</div><div id="00:02:01.560" class="transcript_line"> was just kind of felt like one long night out. That&#039;s a good way of putting it. It&#039;s just sort</div><div id="00:02:06.440" class="transcript_line"> of very difficult to sort of put things in order. So I was having a bit of a look, you know,</div><div id="00:02:11.720" class="transcript_line"> googling a little bit to get the chronology and remember what happened when because some things</div><div id="00:02:15.160" class="transcript_line"> that I thought had happened in 2005 happened in 1997 or whatever and so it was interesting.</div><div id="00:02:21.800" class="transcript_line"> But the one thing that did come up was the City Status thing and I remember it quite well because</div><div id="00:02:26.360" class="transcript_line"> I remember, even though I&#039;ve always felt sort of, you know, in the mixed, in the middle of</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> the Newport experience or whatever you want to call it, I&#039;ve also felt as a writer, I&#039;ve also</div><div id="00:02:39.400" class="transcript_line"> felt very much sort of standing on the periphery of it, you know, sort of observing and almost</div><div id="00:02:46.280" class="transcript_line"> kind of like gathering material as my life has sort of gone on really for, you know, whenever that</div><div id="00:02:51.800" class="transcript_line"> might prove useful. So I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any other place in the UK really that would have been</div><div id="00:02:58.360" class="transcript_line"> so, you know, sort of ambivalent about it really. I mean it felt like something everybody was talking</div><div id="00:03:04.280" class="transcript_line"> about and it felt like there was kind of an interesting balance between, often happening</div><div id="00:03:11.160" class="transcript_line"> within the same sentence uttered by the same person, but this kind of like, well it&#039;s about time</div><div id="00:03:17.160" class="transcript_line"> and why do we care? Like why do we want this? What difference is this going to make? And there is</div><div id="00:03:23.400" class="transcript_line"> kind of, I know this isn&#039;t particular to Newport, but there is certainly an attitude to</div><div id="00:03:31.160" class="transcript_line"> of Newportonians that, you know, nobody else can criticise our place, but we&#039;re very sort of</div><div id="00:03:36.520" class="transcript_line"> proudly down on it ourselves. Almost like we understand it&#039;s a shithole, but we understand</div><div id="00:03:41.080" class="transcript_line"> the kind of the light that shines from that, you know what I mean? It&#039;s like everybody&#039;s kind of-</div><div id="00:03:46.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got a good image actually, the light that shines.</div><div id="00:03:48.200" class="transcript_line"> The light, that could, that should be the city logo, get rid of the cherub,</div><div id="00:03:51.640" class="transcript_line"> just like a turd with light shining out of it.</div><div id="00:03:53.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, I do specifically remember the city status thing, really kind of encapsulating that</div><div id="00:04:02.440" class="transcript_line"> attitude of the Newportonian, if you like, that it was kind of like, well of course we should be a</div><div id="00:04:07.880" class="transcript_line"> city. How dare Cardiff, Swansea and, you know, Wrexham be cities and Newport not be, that&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:14.360" class="transcript_line"> ridiculous, but at the same time it&#039;s stupid that we&#039;re a city. Like how on earth do we- I mean,</div><div id="00:04:20.840" class="transcript_line"> I suppose that this was before, you know, St Asaph and St David&#039;s, you know, and like one man and</div><div id="00:04:26.040" class="transcript_line"> his dog in a field, and if they were waving a flag the right way they became, were given city status.</div><div id="00:04:30.920" class="transcript_line"> So it was more sort of, there were certain people who&#039;d been waiting a long time for Newport to</div><div id="00:04:34.840" class="transcript_line"> become a city, but when it became a city nobody could see exactly what the benefits were.</div><div id="00:04:38.040" class="transcript_line"> No, were you aware of that, certainly when I was a teenager, a long time ago, were you aware of a</div><div id="00:04:44.200" class="transcript_line"> kind of a myth or urban myth that Newport would never get city status because of the Chardist</div><div id="00:04:50.280" class="transcript_line"> riots? I remember that. I was more aware of the narrative that Newport would never get city status</div><div id="00:04:58.360" class="transcript_line"> because that meant if you were a businessman coming from London it would be the first city you hit</div><div id="00:05:03.160" class="transcript_line"> when you came to Wales, and Cardiff would never allow that to happen. I mean, as you get older you</div><div id="00:05:08.440" class="transcript_line"> realize that almost everything you hear is a conspiracy theory. You know, as you get a bit</div><div id="00:05:13.960" class="transcript_line"> older you realize that most of the people in charge of things are so completely inept and out of their</div><div id="00:05:18.280" class="transcript_line"> depth that the very idea that a conspiracy on any level could take place is laughable. But when</div><div id="00:05:24.520" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re young you kind of think, yeah, the grey suits man, you know, and especially in a place like</div><div id="00:05:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Newport which is very, Newport to me was always a place that was about sticking your</div><div id="00:05:35.240" class="transcript_line"> fingers up to authority. That&#039;s what Newport was. I mean, perhaps we&#039;ll come on to talk about it</div><div id="00:05:39.960" class="transcript_line"> later, but one of the things like being editor of Wales Arts Review has done for me in the last 10</div><div id="00:05:44.120" class="transcript_line"> years is it&#039;s kind of introduced me to Wales. I didn&#039;t grow up having any kind of anything that</div><div id="00:05:49.640" class="transcript_line"> would resemble a Welsh identity. I was from Newport and that was that. I think that&#039;s really an</div><div id="00:05:54.280" class="transcript_line"> important point and one that kind of chimes with me. Sam, being a Newport girl, were you born in</div><div id="00:06:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Newport? No, I&#039;m from Birmingham. Look at that. I moved to Newport when I was 13, so I&#039;ve been here</div><div id="00:06:08.280" class="transcript_line"> for 32 years, so I&#039;m pretty Newport now, yeah. Honorary Newportonian? Yeah, no, Birmingham I</div><div id="00:06:15.560" class="transcript_line"> grew up in. My parents lived in Caleon when I was three until I was seven and then back to Birmingham</div><div id="00:06:21.640" class="transcript_line"> and then back to Newport. So I&#039;ve been here like 95 percent of my life. Do you identify as Welsh or</div><div id="00:06:28.200" class="transcript_line"> English or both? Oh, 100 percent Welsh, 100 percent Welsh. It&#039;s interesting actually, I wasn&#039;t sure</div><div id="00:06:34.200" class="transcript_line"> whether I&#039;d be Welsh or English until Wales qualified for the Euros and played England</div><div id="00:06:38.920" class="transcript_line"> and then I just wanted them to absolutely stuff the English and I was like oh crap I must be Welsh</div><div id="00:06:43.640" class="transcript_line"> because I genuinely had never really given it much thought until that match and then I was like stuff</div><div id="00:06:47.960" class="transcript_line"> them. So yeah. What Gary said, do you identify with any of that? The township to city, state,</div><div id="00:06:54.520" class="transcript_line"> does that mean anything to you? The main thing I identify with what Gary said is that living in</div><div id="00:07:00.120" class="transcript_line"> Newport you don&#039;t have a Welsh identity. Working for Music Venue Trust for the last two years</div><div id="00:07:04.920" class="transcript_line"> and the way that the profile of the pub has grown over the last five years, I&#039;ve been going up to</div><div id="00:07:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Wrexham to Focus Wales and you know over to other places to do to talk on behalf of Music Venue</div><div id="00:07:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Trust and things. I suddenly have this massive like view of how much of a Welsh identity everywhere</div><div id="00:07:21.160" class="transcript_line"> else has that Newport is really really lacking. Like I just spent six days up in Wrexham a couple</div><div id="00:07:28.040" class="transcript_line"> of weeks ago for Focus Wales and everything they do is about being Welsh and it&#039;s about being in</div><div id="00:07:33.880" class="transcript_line"> North Wales and it&#039;s about bringing you know bringing acts from Canada. They&#039;re so proud that</div><div id="00:07:38.360" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re bringing these Canadians in to to North Wales and you just don&#039;t get that in Newport.</div><div id="00:07:43.480" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no Welsh pride in our city and I don&#039;t know why. Well I think there&#039;s probably more</div><div id="00:07:48.680" class="transcript_line"> than there was than when I was younger. It&#039;s definitely on the rise, definitely.</div><div id="00:07:58.280" class="transcript_line"> How old are you in 1993 Sam if you don&#039;t mind me asking? I was 17. Okay that&#039;s a good age because</div><div id="00:08:05.960" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when I think the Welsh Language Act was passed and I just wondered if because I was</div><div id="00:08:13.320" class="transcript_line"> knocking around then and a lot of people were nose was put out of joint by having all these</div><div id="00:08:20.840" class="transcript_line"> bilingual signs suddenly spreading up everywhere. It sounds ridiculous now it&#039;s quite obvious they</div><div id="00:08:26.840" class="transcript_line"> should be there but do you remember that? I got a Gary first actually. Yeah well I mean I was 14 in</div><div id="00:08:35.080" class="transcript_line"> 1993 so I missed out on compulsory Welsh in school by one year and I remember not just me but all of</div><div id="00:08:42.440" class="transcript_line"> my friends being you know I think we might have even thrown a party specifically to celebrate the</div><div id="00:08:47.320" class="transcript_line"> fact we didn&#039;t have to learn compulsory Welsh and of course now I sort of not regret it because it</div><div id="00:08:53.160" class="transcript_line"> was beyond my control anyway but I feel a bit sad that I wasn&#039;t given the opportunity to learn</div><div id="00:08:57.240" class="transcript_line"> or wasn&#039;t forced to learn Welsh. There&#039;s a lot of things in school that you would have hated at the</div><div id="00:09:01.160" class="transcript_line"> time that when you get older I think you think oh god I wish they&#039;d made me do that. I wish they</div><div id="00:09:05.320" class="transcript_line"> really forced grammar down my throat so when I hand in a manuscript for a book I&#039;m not getting</div><div id="00:09:09.800" class="transcript_line"> loads of red marks back going you know I&#039;ve got all these in the wrong place or that is not where</div><div id="00:09:14.360" class="transcript_line"> a semicolon goes. So yeah I suppose you have you know sort of different perspective when you look</div><div id="00:09:18.280" class="transcript_line"> back on things. I have a sort of strange relationship with the Welsh language in that like my</div><div id="00:09:24.600" class="transcript_line"> one half of my family comes from Welsh speaking Wales I mean my father was from Newport but my</div><div id="00:09:29.560" class="transcript_line"> grandfather was from Kidwelly and I remember him he&#039;d be up when I was very young he&#039;d be on the</div><div id="00:09:35.240" class="transcript_line"> phone talking to his sister in Welsh and things like that and so that was kind of my introduction</div><div id="00:09:39.800" class="transcript_line"> to Welsh was actually through this kind of like mythic like ancestral line that fed through and</div><div id="00:09:48.600" class="transcript_line"> then stopped at my dad who was you know always Newport through and through and then it kind of</div><div id="00:09:55.720" class="transcript_line"> came back but came back in a kind of bureaucratic way it came down from above rather than up through</div><div id="00:10:00.920" class="transcript_line"> the soil do you know what I mean like with my with my granddad it was an organic real thing that</div><div id="00:10:05.880" class="transcript_line"> attached me to a culture I knew that I had an attachment to but didn&#039;t understand and then by</div><div id="00:10:11.400" class="transcript_line"> the time it comes to in school and you just you know the less all I want to do is you know listen</div><div id="00:10:16.440" class="transcript_line"> to Bob Dylan I didn&#039;t I have no interest in Mike Stevens you know I mean that was like insane</div><div id="00:10:21.560" class="transcript_line"> then and it felt like it was coming down rather than it was an absolutely interesting point I</div><div id="00:10:26.120" class="transcript_line"> completely agree Welsh culture is something you have to go in search of if you come from Newport</div><div id="00:10:32.200" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not something that&#039;s fed you really how about you Sam you you say you identify as Welsh</div><div id="00:10:38.280" class="transcript_line"> now completely even though you were born in England yeah so that&#039;s interesting because even</div><div id="00:10:44.680" class="transcript_line"> though I am Welsh my father&#039;s Welsh my mother Scottish but was born in Wales I I&#039;ve never really</div><div id="00:10:50.760" class="transcript_line"> you know cared that much to be honest about being Welsh didn&#039;t really mean it probably means more to</div><div id="00:10:57.240" class="transcript_line"> me than it ever has I remember when the Manics first came out how that kind of they were almost</div><div id="00:11:03.400" class="transcript_line"> anti-Welsh in a way and I kind of understood that you know in the late 80s because if you were from</div><div id="00:11:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Wales especially if you&#039;re in like because my being in bands my background you know there were no</div><div id="00:11:15.480" class="transcript_line"> there was no bands from who were cool from Wales in the in the 80s really or very few and you know</div><div id="00:11:21.480" class="transcript_line"> it was almost a cross you had to bear to be Welsh you know people would just assume that you were</div><div id="00:11:26.120" class="transcript_line"> shit if you were in a group you know anyway but enough of me so so again so what&#039;s your relationship</div><div id="00:11:34.440" class="transcript_line"> like with the Welsh language or just with your Welsh identity this would be interesting be in</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> English I actually took up Welsh on Duolingo during lockdown not getting that far not doing</div><div id="00:11:45.240" class="transcript_line"> that well but I&#039;m determined to keep it going but yeah Dwynduski Cymraeg so yeah I am learning</div><div id="00:11:50.920" class="transcript_line"> very very slowly it&#039;s it&#039;s a very difficult language but it&#039;s so beautiful and I gave</div><div id="00:11:57.240" class="transcript_line"> evidence to a select committee in the senate back about three years ago about grassroots music in</div><div id="00:12:03.400" class="transcript_line"> Wales and I was the only person there who needed the translation headphones and that really bothered</div><div id="00:12:08.600" class="transcript_line"> me because this is my country and it is the music scene that I&#039;ve spent 30 years working in and I</div><div id="00:12:13.800" class="transcript_line"> want to be able to talk about it in the language of the country you know I don&#039;t want to have to</div><div id="00:12:18.680" class="transcript_line"> be the only person there with the translation headphones on it was it was a real eye-opener</div><div id="00:12:23.240" class="transcript_line"> to how much I&#039;d missed by not as Gary said by not being forced to do Welsh in school because I was</div><div id="00:12:27.960" class="transcript_line"> in school in Wales at the same time but obviously I was three years away from compulsory Welsh</div><div id="00:12:33.240" class="transcript_line"> and I do feel like I&#039;m which school were you in I went to quite a few schools because my parents</div><div id="00:12:37.320" class="transcript_line"> moved a lot so I went to Westmarn in Pontypool and I went to Fairwater in Cwmbran and I went to</div><div id="00:12:42.920" class="transcript_line"> Closaciliog in Cwmbran. Wow that&#039;s good okay well you&#039;re talking about my manner there yeah.</div><div id="00:12:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah so yeah and I think in terms of Welsh identity one of the things that&#039;s driven it</div><div id="00:12:52.200" class="transcript_line"> at the moment is the difference between Welsh identity and British identity because there&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:56.600" class="transcript_line"> an artist I&#039;m a little bit obsessed with at the moment a black punk artist called Bob Villain</div><div id="00:13:01.240" class="transcript_line"> and one of the things he does is Bob Villain did you say? Bob Villain.</div><div id="00:13:06.920" class="transcript_line"> One of the things he does is he pisses on a Union Jack because he absolutely despises you know the</div><div id="00:13:12.520" class="transcript_line"> English government and the English system and when he played in Wrexham a few weeks ago I had</div><div id="00:13:17.400" class="transcript_line"> to say to him do not do that to the Welsh flag I said if you&#039;ve got a Union Jack with you do it</div><div id="00:13:22.520" class="transcript_line"> but you cannot get away with that in Wales the people in Wales will not appreciate you pissing</div><div id="00:13:27.480" class="transcript_line"> on their dragon you know and I had to and I think that&#039;s a big indicator of how different the culture</div><div id="00:13:32.200" class="transcript_line"> of England and Wales is is that in Wales if you piss on our flag someone&#039;s going to beat the shit</div><div id="00:13:36.680" class="transcript_line"> out of you. I say interesting actually it&#039;s not the English flag it&#039;s the English flag is the St.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> George&#039;s Cross you know it&#039;s the Unionist flag Union flag yeah but you have I don&#039;t even know</div><div id="00:13:48.280" class="transcript_line"> how long but for years 20 years at least probably more you&#039;ve been a real kind of face and a real</div><div id="00:13:55.640" class="transcript_line"> positive role model and driver of live music in Newport you know and South Wales really do you</div><div id="00:14:02.280" class="transcript_line"> ever put Welsh bands on? All the time yeah we&#039;re doing I&#039;m not going to try and say it in Welsh but</div><div id="00:14:06.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s Welsh Music Day in January and we&#039;re organising an entire week of Welsh language bands</div><div id="00:14:11.800" class="transcript_line"> in the pub because that&#039;s really important there&#039;s a Welsh language band from Cardiff called Chroma</div><div id="00:14:16.840" class="transcript_line"> and they are phenomenal and you know it&#039;s just there&#039;s so much amazing Welsh language music out</div><div id="00:14:22.280" class="transcript_line"> there at the moment it&#039;s really really coming through like back in the 90s when you know when</div><div id="00:14:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Gorkies came through and there was this oh god is Welsh language actually going to break through</div><div id="00:14:30.680" class="transcript_line"> into the mainstream thing I think that might finally happen now. Well okay maybe I&#039;m not the</div><div id="00:14:37.800" class="transcript_line"> opinion actually that the language of rock and roll is not English it&#039;s actually American you know</div><div id="00:14:43.560" class="transcript_line"> if you listen to it&#039;s kind of it&#039;s kind of the American we&#039;re dealing with really rather than</div><div id="00:14:50.280" class="transcript_line"> English. Yeah you&#039;ve got bands like you&#039;ve got bands like Adwaith coming out of West Wales who</div><div id="00:14:55.320" class="transcript_line"> are phenomenal and just things like that and there are some really incredible like Welsh language</div><div id="00:14:59.960" class="transcript_line"> artists out there at the moment. I want to talk a bit more about Newport though I&#039;m going to</div><div id="00:15:08.440" class="transcript_line"> nap you guys on music as well but I wanted to just try to talk about a few things anything you</div><div id="00:15:14.200" class="transcript_line"> can think of I put the Newport for some reason we got the Newport ship discovery here is anybody</div><div id="00:15:19.400" class="transcript_line"> interested in that or is that Gary I&#039;ve got a feeling you might be interested in the Newport ship.</div><div id="00:15:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Well maybe not quite as interested as you might think but I think the Newport ship debacle is</div><div id="00:15:31.240" class="transcript_line"> that what it is going to be called is it still in a shed somewhere like in a tank of water.</div><div id="00:15:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah isn&#039;t the basement of the riverfront the shape that it is because the ship was supposed</div><div id="00:15:41.800" class="transcript_line"> to go there something and then somebody realized that actually no it will just rot if we can&#039;t keep</div><div id="00:15:46.600" class="transcript_line"> it wet yeah it was it was something like that the entire of the riverfront theater has a ridiculous</div><div id="00:15:52.360" class="transcript_line"> basement it&#039;s huge have you been there yeah it&#039;s massive yeah we did we did a crazy golf project</div><div id="00:15:57.880" class="transcript_line"> for them where we built crazy golf out of trash and they let us build down there because no one</div><div id="00:16:01.960" class="transcript_line"> uses it for anything else and it&#039;s huge the word Gary used is perfect it&#039;s a debacle to pull a</div><div id="00:16:07.800" class="transcript_line"> perfect specimen of a medieval ship out of the river while you&#039;re building a theater and then</div><div id="00:16:13.960" class="transcript_line"> custom build a completely inappropriate space for that ship it&#039;s just so Newport it&#039;s so Newport</div><div id="00:16:21.720" class="transcript_line"> it seems to me that the whole thing around the ship at the time and consequently is something</div><div id="00:16:27.240" class="transcript_line"> that again you know is speaks almost like microcosmically of what where Newport stands</div><div id="00:16:33.400" class="transcript_line"> and what it is because I think I should have looked this up I can&#039;t remember the precise</div><div id="00:16:38.280" class="transcript_line"> details but there are worse examples of this type of medieval ship medieval boat you know</div><div id="00:16:47.080" class="transcript_line"> merchant vessel in other areas of the UK and they they are like prized possessions in that</div><div id="00:16:53.560" class="transcript_line"> area there&#039;s one in Bristol I believe or at least along that coast I did a thing for radio three</div><div id="00:17:00.360" class="transcript_line"> and one of the other people who are on this like arts round table discussion was a professor from</div><div id="00:17:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Bristol who was there to talk about the medieval ship that he&#039;d been sort of working on looking</div><div id="00:17:11.720" class="transcript_line"> after and curating and and he was like well it&#039;s really interesting because obviously you know you&#039;re</div><div id="00:17:16.200" class="transcript_line"> from Newport this is off air you&#039;re from Newport that&#039;s really interesting because you&#039;ve actually</div><div id="00:17:20.360" class="transcript_line"> got much better medieval ship than we&#039;ve gotten it&#039;s isn&#039;t it just sat in a in a shed somewhere</div><div id="00:17:25.080" class="transcript_line"> in a tub of water and and you you just you know you just wonder maybe it&#039;s a bit of a</div><div id="00:17:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Welsh thing I don&#039;t know that I have you know a lot of opinions about how the Welsh establishment</div><div id="00:17:38.840" class="transcript_line"> for want of a better term regards its own art and culture I don&#039;t think there&#039;s enough people who</div><div id="00:17:44.760" class="transcript_line"> feel free to talk about that I mean this is your chance to</div><div id="00:17:48.600" class="transcript_line"> feel like you&#039;ve got your own show well oh I&#039;ve got plenty of chances to talk about this</div><div id="00:17:54.840" class="transcript_line"> um I just think there&#039;s um they they they are too many people in decision-making offices um who you</div><div id="00:18:03.720" class="transcript_line"> know aren&#039;t interested in reading books or listening to music or going to the theatre I mean ironically</div><div id="00:18:10.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean I you know I probably should say from the off I don&#039;t live in Newport anymore I haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:18:14.600" class="transcript_line"> been for four years but um uh I would say that Jane Bryant who&#039;s the assembly member for Newport</div><div id="00:18:21.800" class="transcript_line"> Westroyd lived for you know nearly 35 years 40 years um is one of the most like interesting</div><div id="00:18:29.080" class="transcript_line"> cultured people I knew Jane before she became an am and she&#039;s a massive reader she&#039;s a massive</div><div id="00:18:34.840" class="transcript_line"> music fan and and hopefully she will work her way through the ranks and become you know more</div><div id="00:18:40.600" class="transcript_line"> influential as the years go by she&#039;s only been an am for you know the last the election but last</div><div id="00:18:46.200" class="transcript_line"> the one before um I think she already is she&#039;s put a stamp all over the Lady Ronda campaign and</div><div id="00:18:52.280" class="transcript_line"> that is now gathering some serious momentum you know things like so it&#039;s yeah yeah sorry it&#039;s</div><div id="00:18:57.320" class="transcript_line"> getting better yeah I didn&#039;t even suggest she didn&#039;t uh didn&#039;t have any you know sway but like</div><div id="00:19:02.120" class="transcript_line"> as it goes on I&#039;d expect her to become a cabinet member and then who knows what you know in the</div><div id="00:19:06.680" class="transcript_line"> next decade or whatever um and and I think she&#039;d bring that cultured uh idea of what being in an</div><div id="00:19:14.280" class="transcript_line"> office like hers um should be and you know um politics could do with more cultured people you</div><div id="00:19:20.920" class="transcript_line"> know absolutely if if the if the people you want to the people you want to see in politics are not</div><div id="00:19:26.280" class="transcript_line"> just like people who are passionate about all those things that are important social change and</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> you want people who you know read books for fun yeah you know people who people who have a record</div><div id="00:19:36.040" class="transcript_line"> collection you know people who go to gigs people who you know who are interested in the theater</div><div id="00:19:41.560" class="transcript_line"> people who you know you can sit in a pub and talk about whatever with you know not just somebody who</div><div id="00:19:46.840" class="transcript_line"> has a load of bullet points and they they they know how to operate in the political sphere which</div><div id="00:19:51.640" class="transcript_line"> is how you become successful in politics mostly nowadays tell us just about your first gigs you</div><div id="00:19:59.800" class="transcript_line"> went to you know things you the gigs you remember in newport first gig i went to was neds atomic</div><div id="00:20:06.280" class="transcript_line"> dustbin in newport center and i absolutely loved it i thought it was the greatest thing that i&#039;d</div><div id="00:20:13.320" class="transcript_line"> ever been to in my life and then i tried to go to a gig in lapub but i was 16 so i got thrown out</div><div id="00:20:20.440" class="transcript_line"> and then i had to wait until i was 18 to go back because kieran had clocked me and knew exactly who</div><div id="00:20:25.080" class="transcript_line"> i was and what i looked like so i spent all my time in tj&#039;s at gigs instead because</div><div id="00:20:30.520" class="transcript_line"> funny story john siccolo knew my family when we were living in chilean when i was three</div><div id="00:20:35.800" class="transcript_line"> and the first time i went into tj&#039;s at 13 maybe my 14th birthday i think he clocked me</div><div id="00:20:43.560" class="transcript_line"> clocked who my parents were but also thought i was my sister who was 10 years older than me so for</div><div id="00:20:49.400" class="transcript_line"> the first five years i was at gigs and tj&#039;s john would call me manda and he&#039;d always say how&#039;s the</div><div id="00:20:54.280" class="transcript_line"> baby meaning me and i&#039;d say things like yeah she&#039;s great she&#039;s doing the gcse&#039;s this year</div><div id="00:20:58.680" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d be like oh send her my love and then i turned up on my 18th and he just whacked me</div><div id="00:21:03.160" class="transcript_line"> around the head in typical john fashion you are the fucking baby you bastard and i was like yeah</div><div id="00:21:08.520" class="transcript_line"> sorry john so yeah that was just a lot of time in tj&#039;s really how do you remember that place though</div><div id="00:21:14.440" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s such it&#039;s such a lot of people you know so many everyone&#039;s got their own story and</div><div id="00:21:19.320" class="transcript_line"> memories tj&#039;s it kind of looms large in the new book legend but each story is kind of personal</div><div id="00:21:27.240" class="transcript_line"> and you were a regular right yeah i was four or five nights a week for about 10 years i think</div><div id="00:21:35.240" class="transcript_line"> because i once i got a job in lapar that was when simon was putting on gigs and the headline band</div><div id="00:21:40.200" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t go on till half 11 so i would close the bar at 10 to 11 fly through clean down and be in</div><div id="00:21:45.480" class="transcript_line"> tj&#039;s by 25 past 11 to watch the most incredible bands after my shift you know and then on the</div><div id="00:21:51.880" class="transcript_line"> weekends i&#039;d go over drinking so you you but you kind of went from being a just a music fan</div><div id="00:21:59.160" class="transcript_line"> and a barmaid right i guess to running the shit you know running the show and booking the band</div><div id="00:22:05.400" class="transcript_line"> and so tell us a bit about that if i remember if i remember you did you put on british c-pads</div><div id="00:22:12.920" class="transcript_line"> yeah i did yeah they became such an important band and they&#039;ve still gone actually they&#039;ve</div><div id="00:22:17.880" class="transcript_line"> changed their name they dropped british haven&#039;t they yeah they&#039;re now called c-power because</div><div id="00:22:22.920" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t want to be associated with you know any kind of uh toxicity around them</div><div id="00:22:30.760" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t want bob villan pissing on any of their album covers</div><div id="00:22:36.120" class="transcript_line"> for me the main thing was when i took over the pub as manager it blew my mind that the venue was</div><div id="00:22:41.880" class="transcript_line"> sat there empty and we only did local bands on a thursday and yet we had this incredible 100</div><div id="00:22:48.520" class="transcript_line"> capacity venue because while tj&#039;s is was amazing it was also too big for local bands and smaller</div><div id="00:22:55.960" class="transcript_line"> touring bands to feel like they&#039;d make you know they could ever fill it so a lot of them would</div><div id="00:22:59.720" class="transcript_line"> just skip newport by and go somewhere else that had a smaller venue so like the first thing i did</div><div id="00:23:05.320" class="transcript_line"> was why are we doing gigs seven days a week you know we&#039;ve got a pa we&#039;ve got a stage why why are</div><div id="00:23:11.160" class="transcript_line"> we only opening this room on thursdays for one local band and then fridays and saturdays for</div><div id="00:23:16.360" class="transcript_line"> discos why are we doing gigs seven nights a week so i reached out to some mates who were putting on</div><div id="00:23:21.480" class="transcript_line"> gigs in cardiff and offered a free venue hire and then that was it then the pub&#039;s been a staple of</div><div id="00:23:26.520" class="transcript_line"> the touring circuit actually you know i used to go there i actually think it&#039;s a much better venue</div><div id="00:23:32.200" class="transcript_line"> now the shape of it you know but you agree i love it yeah i love the new venue absolutely love it</div><div id="00:23:38.520" class="transcript_line"> somebody came in a few weeks ago and said it was the old one was better and i was like well</div><div id="00:23:42.920" class="transcript_line"> no it wasn&#039;t you&#039;re wrong like i&#039;m sure nostalgically yeah because you were younger</div><div id="00:23:48.200" class="transcript_line"> and you had some of your best times there but in terms of accessibility and everything else the</div><div id="00:23:54.120" class="transcript_line"> new one is so much better and the people that are having the time of their life there now are having</div><div id="00:23:58.760" class="transcript_line"> it in much better venue yeah no one&#039;s going to fall down the stairs and break their necks</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> no one&#039;s going to have to tell their disabled friend they can&#039;t come in right because of the</div><div id="00:24:06.680" class="transcript_line"> stairs you know it&#039;s it&#039;s just a much better venue for loads of reasons mainly the lack of the bloody</div><div id="00:24:11.960" class="transcript_line"> stairs gary similar sort of question really i mean yeah you&#039;re not smith&#039;s gig by any chance were</div><div id="00:24:17.720" class="transcript_line"> you i don&#039;t know if you were no no the smith&#039;s gig would have been uh before my time i mean the</div><div id="00:24:22.520" class="transcript_line"> two gigs um when was the smith&#039;s gig 86 yeah yeah something like that it&#039;s when he got pulled off</div><div id="00:24:30.040" class="transcript_line"> the stage you know he got pulled off the i mean we all knew the story and and i don&#039;t know if you</div><div id="00:24:35.400" class="transcript_line"> remember that he came back to newport i was reading the as doing prep for this but morris</div><div id="00:24:39.880" class="transcript_line"> he came back he played newport when he was supporting bowie in 95 they played newport center</div><div id="00:24:45.560" class="transcript_line"> that was the the famous tour that morris he quit the tour halfway through and the quote was</div><div id="00:24:50.120" class="transcript_line"> the quote was that i&#039;ll never forget for morris he was um which is just such a brilliant hilarious</div><div id="00:24:55.080" class="transcript_line"> quote coming for out of morris&#039;s mouth was that when i signed up to do the tour i didn&#039;t realize</div><div id="00:25:00.040" class="transcript_line"> that we would have to spend the entire time worshiping at the temple of david okay so what</div><div id="00:25:04.840" class="transcript_line"> newport music experiences do you remember so going back before the decade that we</div><div id="00:25:10.200" class="transcript_line"> sort of talking about i mean the interesting thing for me is how clearly i remember my first gig in</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> newport and the reason was was because i was about 13 and i went with my dad my dad got me tickets to</div><div id="00:25:20.840" class="transcript_line"> see huey louis and the news in newport center and it was the second gig i&#039;d ever been to because the</div><div id="00:25:26.360" class="transcript_line"> first gig he ever took them to was not long before that we went to see paul mccartney and</div><div id="00:25:30.200" class="transcript_line"> ills court and that was my first ever live musical experience but um but huey louis and the news it</div><div id="00:25:36.600" class="transcript_line"> was you know i think i went through a period probably for a while of like being slightly</div><div id="00:25:41.400" class="transcript_line"> well i&#039;m not going to tell my mates about that you know probably through the 90s i never mentioned</div><div id="00:25:46.600" class="transcript_line"> that was my one of my early early musical experience but like looking back at it i</div><div id="00:25:51.240" class="transcript_line"> remember it really well because i was young so obviously i hadn&#039;t been drinking because i was</div><div id="00:25:54.280" class="transcript_line"> a my old man and stuff but um uh and i was like 13 so i probably wasn&#039;t drinking by that point</div><div id="00:25:59.720" class="transcript_line"> anyway but um uh just that it was an absolutely fantastic gig i mean for a start i was 13 and i</div><div id="00:26:06.280" class="transcript_line"> was watching essentially what was to me the you know a live version of the back to the future</div><div id="00:26:12.040" class="transcript_line"> soundtrack now what like 13 year old boy wouldn&#039;t think that was the greatest night night of their</div><div id="00:26:17.160" class="transcript_line"> life but also i remember really clearly that they did um a like 50s acapella set in the middle</div><div id="00:26:23.880" class="transcript_line"> where the band put all their instruments down and walked to the front of the stage and did like four</div><div id="00:26:27.320" class="transcript_line"> or five songs as an acapella set and it was and it was even at sort of my young uh fresh age at</div><div id="00:26:34.520" class="transcript_line"> that point i remember thinking just what an amazing thing that was but then you know going on from</div><div id="00:26:41.160" class="transcript_line"> there i mean i&#039;ve been going through the gigs that i missed more than anything the gigs that i that</div><div id="00:26:48.520" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;ve got a bit of a history of missing great gigs missing faithless at v3 which i think was the</div><div id="00:26:54.920" class="transcript_line"> i was i was i was abroad at the time i was there was a hilarious story about that gig so faithless</div><div id="00:27:03.320" class="transcript_line"> played v3 and max jazz left a huge bag of weed and a bible in the dressing room and laurence who owned</div><div id="00:27:12.600" class="transcript_line"> v3 mailed the book back with a message that said enjoy your weed not so much your book and that</div><div id="00:27:18.440" class="transcript_line"> was that was that was his message that he sent back that was a great gig that was that was a</div><div id="00:27:24.200" class="transcript_line"> really great gig yeah that was a famously great gig in the in the world&#039;s probably the world&#039;s</div><div id="00:27:29.560" class="transcript_line"> weirdest short-lived club of v3 which i yeah i i almost completely forgotten about my experiences</div><div id="00:27:35.480" class="transcript_line"> of v3 and the 65 foot dragon that made its staircase um that&#039;s about that that sounds</div><div id="00:27:40.840" class="transcript_line"> interesting i don&#039;t even know about it well it was it was a club that the the guy um laurence howells</div><div id="00:27:47.080" class="transcript_line"> who owned the cotton club in the 90s he owned the cotton club and um part of rumors which was um</div><div id="00:27:53.080" class="transcript_line"> which is now the pub which is now the pub it is indeed um i worked in v3 for a long time yeah you</div><div id="00:27:59.800" class="transcript_line"> did not you got it was out was yeah it was only open for 15 months and i think i worked in it for</div><div id="00:28:04.600" class="transcript_line"> all of them it was a very very strange place really strange you could fill an hour with stories of v3</div><div id="00:28:11.560" class="transcript_line"> quite yeah you really i painted v3 before it opened i was like god what was i doing i was i was</div><div id="00:28:19.080" class="transcript_line"> i spent my teens and 20s like doing temp jobs and just earning beer tokens really to hang it in new</div><div id="00:28:26.440" class="transcript_line"> port that was my life i mean there&#039;s just there&#039;s no slander here because laurence ended up in</div><div id="00:28:31.240" class="transcript_line"> prison for drug offenses oh yeah he was insane but i was trying to run the bar the one saturday and</div><div id="00:28:36.680" class="transcript_line"> we had no alcohol nothing and i said we can&#039;t open he said we can we charge him a tenner

floor and then the other foot was at the other side of the room so the entire of the room</div><div id="00:31:20.360" class="transcript_line"> was just dragon when you press the smoke remote behind the dj the smoke would come out with the</div><div id="00:31:25.320" class="transcript_line"> dragon&#039;s mouth and his eyes would light up and it was incredible it must have cost so much

my father was talking about this</div><div id="00:32:58.120" class="transcript_line"> recently i think is like the largest municipal cemetery in the uk or something i gotta think</div><div id="00:33:02.760" class="transcript_line"> for i love cemeteries actually oh well i mean it&#039;s still i mean my dad walks walks the dog</div><div id="00:33:07.960" class="transcript_line"> around there so i still go around there every now and again it is absolutely huge it takes two</div><div id="00:33:13.000" class="transcript_line"> hours to take the dog around the whole thing because i do it with mine it&#039;s a really good walk</div><div id="00:33:17.000" class="transcript_line"> that was my main horn that&#039;s playing in there i mean like that is weird yeah i mean it sounds</div><div id="00:33:22.360" class="transcript_line"> weirder than it was i think but my one of my best friends in school um in primary school and then</div><div id="00:33:26.680" class="transcript_line"> we went to the secondary school together um his father was the foreman so we could get away with</div><div id="00:33:32.200" class="transcript_line"> doing lots of things that you you know kids who just jumped over the fence couldn&#039;t do like we</div><div id="00:33:35.960" class="transcript_line"> could play football there for instance because because he&#039;d go well play football down by here</div><div id="00:33:39.560" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re not going to be hitting any grave stones or you know they won&#039;t be able to see you</div><div id="00:33:44.200" class="transcript_line"> from the office and that kind of thing do you know what i mean but but we used to you know we</div><div id="00:33:47.320" class="transcript_line"> used to play football in the summer we used to play a bunch of us um school kids would play against</div><div id="00:33:52.600" class="transcript_line"> all the gravediggers down by the down by the um down with the mess room and uh you know these</div><div id="00:33:58.360" class="transcript_line"> were all like raggedy ass middle-aged men and they kicked lumps out of us and we had a whale of a time</div><div id="00:34:03.720" class="transcript_line"> but yeah so that was like when i was a kid when we started going out which was probably we were</div><div id="00:34:07.400" class="transcript_line"> probably like probably like 15 but really 16 i probably went to tj&#039;s like a mate it was a</div><div id="00:34:14.760" class="transcript_line"> right to passage really wasn&#039;t it yeah yeah t the things i remember earliest of tj&#039;s in the like</div><div id="00:34:21.240" class="transcript_line"> 94 95 96 yes she is my best years i reckon the best year yeah probably yeah but i remember i</div><div id="00:34:28.360" class="transcript_line"> remember my best mate he really didn&#039;t like beer he hated lager something you know he sort of grew</div><div id="00:34:33.160" class="transcript_line"> out of but um so we used to go to go to tj&#039;s and he yeah i remember he went up to the bar and say</div><div id="00:34:38.760" class="transcript_line"> and asked for a vodka orange and they gave him vodka with like half a pint of orange cordial</div><div id="00:34:45.960" class="transcript_line"> and he just kind of drank it and was like this what a vodka and orange must be i suppose</div><div id="00:34:50.600" class="transcript_line"> just like half a pint of cordial with a shot of vodka in it but um and i think he drank that for</div><div id="00:34:55.400" class="transcript_line"> a few years before he realized that that&#039;s not what a vodka orange was you know one of the things</div><div id="00:34:59.400" class="transcript_line"> people i mean because i&#039;m older than you guys generation or so i am i&#039;ve said this to glenn&#039;s</div><div id="00:35:06.280" class="transcript_line"> that people people do tend to romanticize tj&#039;s actually um and that&#039;s fair enough because it</div><div id="00:35:13.640" class="transcript_line"> was a brilliant place and a certain time it really took off but actually in the late 80s and early</div><div id="00:35:20.440" class="transcript_line"> 90s it could be very scary it could be a violent place you know i saw some i&#039;ve seen some pretty</div><div id="00:35:27.560" class="transcript_line"> uh pretty small i saw a really horrific fight in there once at one point somebody got punched to</div><div id="00:35:34.200" class="transcript_line"> death in there that story has got an infamous tj story carried out and left to die on the street</div><div id="00:35:39.960" class="transcript_line"> you know um and the other thing that people kind of because it became a great rock and roll venue</div><div id="00:35:47.560" class="transcript_line"> but actually one of the reasons it became a venue was quite simply the fact that it was doing so</div><div id="00:35:53.160" class="transcript_line"> badly as a as a pub or a bar that that in the end john was almost forced to take in um you know</div><div id="00:36:03.800" class="transcript_line"> bands who couldn&#039;t get gigs anywhere else you know she was like we couldn&#039;t get a gig anyway</div><div id="00:36:08.120" class="transcript_line"> oh john can we play here you know uh matriarchal and at least he&#039;ll buy beer and that would and</div><div id="00:36:14.120" class="transcript_line"> it was kind of almost like a meeting of two desperate situations you know and then it kind</div><div id="00:36:19.880" class="transcript_line"> of evolved into this great great venue when when really Simon definitely and also connell duds</div><div id="00:36:26.840" class="transcript_line"> connell dubs didn&#039;t really the fair share connell duds really um because Simon would only put</div><div id="00:36:32.600" class="transcript_line"> american bands on you know then further once connell was kind of moved on to bigger things</div><div id="00:36:38.600" class="transcript_line"> you had johnny phillips and the sick future crew i think there&#039;s this massive tendency to romanticize</div><div id="00:36:44.440" class="transcript_line"> john and john was an amazing guy but he was not the person that bought the bands to newport</div><div id="00:36:49.320" class="transcript_line"> there was there was simon there was connell there was johnny phillips you know there was a lot of</div><div id="00:36:53.880" class="transcript_line"> people bringing bands to newport it was amazing that john gave them a space to do that that was</div><div id="00:36:58.680" class="transcript_line"> affordable and gave them a space where you could actually like put punk bands on without getting</div><div id="00:37:03.640" class="transcript_line"> thrown out he was a great character john though he gave the place a certain uh you know i i i do</div><div id="00:37:10.760" class="transcript_line"> think more credit needs to go out to the people that were bringing the bands to the the weird</div><div id="00:37:15.080" class="transcript_line"> little border town that wasn&#039;t cardiff or bristol i will mention them you know i mean connell duds</div><div id="00:37:19.720" class="transcript_line"> obviously he was famously was always his agent you know he brought them there and now he runs</div><div id="00:37:28.360" class="transcript_line"> i was at that gig i stood on a table and showed we&#039;d bring back the 64 dolls because i thought</div><div id="00:37:32.840" class="transcript_line"> shit</div><div id="00:37:39.000" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;m cut we&#039;re done that gig though sam i&#039;ll cut this bit out is i do simply remember it different</div><div id="00:37:46.760" class="transcript_line"> with me because i was at that show obviously because we played them yeah when i was hanging</div><div id="00:37:51.000" class="transcript_line"> out with oasis before yeah no no and because i didn&#039;t know they were i never you know i didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:37:56.440" class="transcript_line"> know them they weren&#039;t famous basically for two weeks later they were really famous but</div><div id="00:38:01.160" class="transcript_line"> that period they were i don&#039;t remember it being packed do you was it it was not packed there was</div><div id="00:38:07.000" class="transcript_line"> about 65 of us i would say and that is a generous estimate because i get so sick of everybody saying</div><div id="00:38:14.360" class="transcript_line"> they were there because you weren&#039;t i&#039;m sorry i&#039;m not i&#039;m not like grabbing my own fucking call</div><div id="00:38:19.320" class="transcript_line"> points here you weren&#039;t there the other thing was a coach i remember two at least one coach if not</div><div id="00:38:24.840" class="transcript_line"> two but at least one coach from manchester show that with all their mates on it no i used to do</div><div id="00:38:30.120" class="transcript_line"> we used to do stuff like that is that if you play a gig at the town no one&#039;s going to come and see</div><div id="00:38:33.960" class="transcript_line"> you so you you take all your mates you know it&#039;s the only way you have an audience you probably do</div><div id="00:38:37.960" class="transcript_line"> it with the pub yeah i remember a coach coming down from manchester and i remember doing the gig</div><div id="00:38:42.280" class="transcript_line"> and i remember oasis going on but i just don&#039;t remember it being packed so it was not packed i</div><div id="00:38:47.720" class="transcript_line"> because i remember being you played and then me and remember my friend angie it was so quiet</div><div id="00:38:54.840" class="transcript_line"> and i remember being sat on the floor just in front of the stage smoking fags waiting for them</div><div id="00:39:00.440" class="transcript_line"> to come on there wasn&#039;t even a queue of people waiting for them to come on everyone else was at</div><div id="00:39:04.040" class="transcript_line"> the bar it was it was it was a really quiet gig i remember being sat on the floor on the floor</div><div id="00:39:10.600" class="transcript_line"> smoking a fag and thinking i wonder if these guys will be any good and then they came on and they</div><div id="00:39:14.680" class="transcript_line"> opened with cigarettes and alcohol which was the only single they&#039;ve released so therefore they</div><div id="00:39:19.400" class="transcript_line"> played the only song i knew so they brought the shit out of me so i just left and decided to</div><div id="00:39:24.440" class="transcript_line"> harass them yeah so i thought i was misremembering step because everyone was telling me how packed it</div><div id="00:39:32.920" class="transcript_line"> was i was like no it was not i was um i was gonna say that um you know like the like like you said</div><div id="00:39:42.600" class="transcript_line"> earlier rich like the the peak years of tj&#039;s i think was sort of the mid 90s that was when everything</div><div id="00:39:47.320" class="transcript_line"> was coming together you had all those bands that went on to do great things playing there</div><div id="00:39:51.480" class="transcript_line"> and i think if you go into the you know a little bit later than that maybe but but the 90s i think</div><div id="00:39:57.240" class="transcript_line"> had that real kind of nightlife music ecosystem that was going on that fed into the noughties a</div><div id="00:40:03.640" class="transcript_line"> little bit but i think you know um i think you know the decade we were going to talk about the</div><div id="00:40:09.960" class="transcript_line"> noughties one of the things that when i was thinking about it earlier was the the noughties</div><div id="00:40:13.640" class="transcript_line"> even though a lot there was a lot of great stuff going on and there was you know good clubs and</div><div id="00:40:18.120" class="transcript_line"> it was you know le pub was was absolutely banging it was definitely um one of the best places to be</div><div id="00:40:23.560" class="transcript_line"> um uh in the you know in still is now but in the noughties you know it&#039;s just like there was so</div><div id="00:40:29.400" class="transcript_line"> much going on but i think also it was a time when that kind of newport nostalgia thing began and</div><div id="00:40:35.800" class="transcript_line"> look looking back on you know there was a lot going on about looking back on the 90s and i think</div><div id="00:40:40.920" class="transcript_line"> like i spent like 25 years sat at the bar in the merringer and you know that was you know that was</div><div id="00:40:46.600" class="transcript_line"> where where i was and the merringer shut at 11 obviously every night and that&#039;s when you&#039;d go</div><div id="00:40:52.440" class="transcript_line"> to all the other places like le perbe or anywhere else that was that was my that was always my</div><div id="00:40:57.560" class="transcript_line"> journey and and the the thing rob jones who&#039;s still a landlady there who&#039;s like a bit of a</div><div id="00:41:02.360" class="transcript_line"> newport legend obviously um uh the thing about um that used to do rob&#039;s head in in the in the</div><div id="00:41:08.600" class="transcript_line"> noughties regularly was people coming in and saying where&#039;s your jukebox because they got rid</div><div id="00:41:12.280" class="transcript_line"> of the jukebox it was part of you know the brewery thing uh the sam smith brewery got rid of all</div><div id="00:41:16.920" class="transcript_line"> entertainment tvs and jukeboxes in the early noughties i think it was when they refurbed the</div><div id="00:41:20.680" class="transcript_line"> pub but the 90s you know the merringer jukebox was a was was like an iconic an iconic thing</div><div id="00:41:27.880" class="transcript_line"> but rob is a huge music head isn&#039;t he basically yeah yeah exactly you know he&#039;s a bit of an old</div><div id="00:41:33.240" class="transcript_line"> mardin you know he&#039;s um yeah massive massive music fan but but it was that jukebox in the merringer</div><div id="00:41:39.400" class="transcript_line"> that introduced me to loads of bands that i still hold really dearly today you know the idea of a</div><div id="00:41:44.680" class="transcript_line"> jukebox just being a place in the corner where you can put some music on to give some ambience to a</div><div id="00:41:49.240" class="transcript_line"> to a to a to a space to a pub is you know is one thing but what the the merringer jukebox was and</div><div id="00:41:55.560" class="transcript_line"> you know i&#039;m not saying this was the only thing but it became kind of iconic particularly when</div><div id="00:41:59.480" class="transcript_line"> it was gone people would always be asking about what happened to the jukebox and uh when&#039;s the</div><div id="00:42:03.800" class="transcript_line"> jukebox coming back rob was the easiest way to wind robert behind the grab to get like you know</div><div id="00:42:09.480" class="transcript_line"> something thrown at a lemon thrown at your head or something that was definitely the easiest way</div><div id="00:42:13.000" class="transcript_line"> to get that done but it wasn&#039;t just about um it wasn&#039;t just they were great tunes on it it was</div><div id="00:42:19.480" class="transcript_line"> it was about the attitude of the pub but also it introduced me to loads of things like it introduced</div><div id="00:42:24.040" class="transcript_line"> me to political areas i i don&#039;t know at what point i would have got around to listening to the redskins</div><div id="00:42:30.040" class="transcript_line"> if it wasn&#039;t for hearing the redskins on the merringer jukebox when i was like 18 19 or whatever</div><div id="00:42:35.320" class="transcript_line"> i think it says a lot for newport as a town that had a rich musical history was that me and rob</div><div id="00:42:40.360" class="transcript_line"> from the merringer had a conversation about how terry calia was probably only on two jukeboxes</div><div id="00:42:45.000" class="transcript_line"> in the uk and they were both in newport because he was in the pub and the merringer and we were</div><div id="00:42:49.800" class="transcript_line"> like we were like we should we should research this because we can&#039;t imagine walking into a</div><div id="00:42:53.720" class="transcript_line"> pub anywhere else in britain finding terry calia on the jukebox and we don&#039;t i think that shows like</div><div id="00:42:59.640" class="transcript_line"> at that point newport had such a rich rich musical history that it was just represented</div><div id="00:43:04.840" class="transcript_line"> everywhere you went every pub you went in you know that something would be going on somewhere</div><div id="00:43:10.040" class="transcript_line"> i mean look at the riverfront even the riverfront was doing gigs back then which seems mental to me</div><div id="00:43:14.920" class="transcript_line"> now that they were actually doing original bands the buzzcocks played in the riverfront what the</div><div id="00:43:20.120" class="transcript_line"> hell is that about you know really really strange i i just think like if you wanted to encapsulate</div><div id="00:43:26.760" class="transcript_line"> like what you know my experience of growing up and growing on in newport from like mid-90s to</div><div id="00:43:34.200" class="transcript_line"> you know 20 years later was that everything everything went through the prism of music like</div><div id="00:43:40.520" class="transcript_line"> everything you talked about all your nights out um even for you know the couple of decades since</div><div id="00:43:46.520" class="transcript_line"> when the merringer is at no jukebox and had no music it&#039;s still the like number one topic of</div><div id="00:43:51.960" class="transcript_line"> conversation in any nook or cranny or at the bar it&#039;s still the pub that everybody goes to before the pub</div><div id="00:43:57.720" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s a gig at the pub everyone will go to the merringer for a beer before it&#039;s still that</div><div id="00:44:02.520" class="transcript_line"> place that music people just just gravitate to the thing about the noughties was that the jukebox</div><div id="00:44:08.120" class="transcript_line"> was gone and i think it kind of stands for something along the track of we were everybody</div><div id="00:44:14.680" class="transcript_line"> was kind of looking back on things even by then you know sort of 2004 2005 people were looking</div><div id="00:44:20.120" class="transcript_line"> back and thinking about you know how how great newport was in the 90s just like how everywhere</div><div id="00:44:25.960" class="transcript_line"> was busy there were loads of great bands coming through and i think also talking about that musical</div><div id="00:44:30.520" class="transcript_line"> element and the nightlife sorry the the musical nightlife was it was the noughties when bands</div><div id="00:44:37.640" class="transcript_line"> you know sort of mid-range bands and big bands not the sort of bands that would play</div><div id="00:44:42.600" class="transcript_line"> the pub but the the medium range and the big audience bands um stopped coming to newport like</div><div id="00:44:50.920" class="transcript_line"> newport center stopped you know as far as like you remember newport center was just to have</div><div id="00:44:55.800" class="transcript_line"> motorhead there every year and um maybe delimitri that would that&#039;s what newport center was there</div><div id="00:45:02.280" class="transcript_line"> for um whereas you know as we&#039;ve talked about boi played there and you know uh the smiths and</div><div id="00:45:08.200" class="transcript_line"> the cure and um people just stopped booking those level those mid-range bands in newport they just</div><div id="00:45:14.200" class="transcript_line"> stopped booking them and neds atomic dustbin the cure the wonder stuff all played newport center</div><div id="00:45:18.840" class="transcript_line"> at some point exactly exactly and i and i think you know that was the noughties was the time when</div><div id="00:45:24.440" class="transcript_line"> people started looking back and maybe beginning to realize that those bands weren&#039;t coming to</div><div id="00:45:29.640" class="transcript_line"> newport anymore and i think there&#039;s a lot of reasons for those bands not coming to newport but</div><div id="00:45:33.480" class="transcript_line"> you know what one of them apparently i think one of the goldie looking chain told me this years ago</div><div id="00:45:37.640" class="transcript_line"> was that um uh promoters of those mid-range bands just didn&#039;t really want to come to wales anymore</div><div id="00:45:42.920" class="transcript_line"> because for some reason um in wales people buy the majority of people buy their tickets the night</div><div id="00:45:49.240" class="transcript_line"> before the gig and just no promoters wanted that kind of stress of like putting a band on and then</div><div id="00:45:55.400" class="transcript_line"> 24 hours before the gig going we sold 50 tickets for like a 2000 seat with except the cure when</div><div id="00:46:01.000" class="transcript_line"> everyone from my college camped for three days for tickets three days in tents for tickets for the</div><div id="00:46:07.000" class="transcript_line"> cure i think when i think when those bands were playing you know when the cure were there in the</div><div id="00:46:12.200" class="transcript_line"> i think they were there in the late 90s they played a few times and they played the late 90s as well</div><div id="00:46:16.120" class="transcript_line"> when those bands were there you know they were still packing out you know but but i just think</div><div id="00:46:20.760" class="transcript_line"> bands started going straight to carliff which was a shame because all carliff venues are terrible</div><div id="00:46:25.080" class="transcript_line"> you know like newport center was was a leisure center but it was a really good venue you know</div><div id="00:46:29.080" class="transcript_line"> had good acoustics it had a kind of a good vibe um even though it was you know um uh so you know</div><div id="00:46:34.360" class="transcript_line"> black great down there and things like that if you turned up early enough you could get chips after</div><div id="00:46:38.440" class="transcript_line"> you swim and then go watch a band exactly the famous chips before the band i took my knees</div><div id="00:46:43.960" class="transcript_line"> to see robbie williams and they were i think they were eight and nine so i just left them</div><div id="00:46:49.320" class="transcript_line"> went and sat in the caff and ate chips i didn&#039;t want to see robbie williams i&#039;m going to sit in</div><div id="00:46:53.000" class="transcript_line"> the cafe and eat chips that&#039;s exactly what the leisure center experience should be like really</div><div id="00:46:57.080" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t it you just like leave leave the kids to go and do whatever they&#039;re going to do see robbie</div><div id="00:47:01.880" class="transcript_line"> williams or take karate lessons or whatever it is it&#039;s all much of a muchness really and you just</div><div id="00:47:06.680" class="transcript_line"> sit there and eat chips and read the paper i don&#039;t know what was in there cheap ketchup because i hate</div><div id="00:47:10.760" class="transcript_line"> cheap ketchup except the cheap ketchup they had in newport center which was delicious</div><div id="00:47:15.400" class="transcript_line"> another another iconic element of newport in those days with ketchup in the leisure center</div><div id="00:47:20.280" class="transcript_line"> the ketchup in the leisure center</div><div id="00:47:24.840" class="transcript_line"> i can ask you i&#039;m gonna ask you some questions and just kind of like respond</div><div id="00:47:28.680" class="transcript_line"> quick fire if you can what is it you like or love about newport sam i&#039;ve got you first well why do</div><div id="00:47:34.600" class="transcript_line"> you stay here so long you came here you can you know honestly i love that it&#039;s not cardiff or</div><div id="00:47:39.960" class="transcript_line"> bristol and i love that it&#039;s i have no disrespect to cardiff and bristol no no they&#039;re great cities</div><div id="00:47:45.640" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got a lot more going for them than we have but they also have people that are so full of</div><div id="00:47:51.320" class="transcript_line"> themselves because they&#039;re from cardiff or bristol and they look down on everybody that isn&#039;t from a</div><div id="00:47:56.120" class="transcript_line"> major city and you don&#039;t get that in newport you know people from newport they know they know their</div><div id="00:48:00.520" class="transcript_line"> town&#039;s a shithole but it&#039;s their shithole and they&#039;re not going to look down on anybody else</div><div id="00:48:04.440" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re going to welcome you into their shithole because they could do with some more people in</div><div id="00:48:07.560" class="transcript_line"> it to improve it a little bit you know it&#039;s a it&#039;s a really welcoming place where people just don&#039;t</div><div id="00:48:12.200" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t seem to there&#039;s pride in where you come from but it doesn&#039;t translate into</div><div id="00:48:17.800" class="transcript_line"> belittling people that aren&#039;t from there i think it&#039;s small enough newport and newport is a city i</div><div id="00:48:22.120" class="transcript_line"> suppose but it&#039;s so so small it&#039;s more of a big town really it&#039;s kind of small and i can&#039;t get</div><div id="00:48:26.760" class="transcript_line"> lost in cardiff cardiff sprawls you know like like gary i left a long time ago but i still</div><div id="00:48:33.160" class="transcript_line"> i do feel my heart belongs to newport i definitely think newport has always been much cooler than</div><div id="00:48:38.600" class="transcript_line"> cardiff in every kind of cultural cutting edge way it has you know richard king said that to me</div><div id="00:48:43.800" class="transcript_line"> actually cardiff is is just uncool man newport is always to me it&#039;s always been the people you know</div><div id="00:48:51.160" class="transcript_line"> the people like i don&#039;t that&#039;s not like a big sort of nebulous oh the people the people are so</div><div id="00:48:55.720" class="transcript_line"> wonderful it&#039;s just a great sort of you know it&#039;s just a great social movement and that&#039;s that&#039;s</div><div id="00:49:00.920" class="transcript_line"> not what i mean i mean like the individual people that all of the friends i&#039;ve made over the years</div><div id="00:49:05.800" class="transcript_line"> the conversations i&#039;ve had like sam that you know the nights i&#039;ve had in your gaffes and the</div><div id="00:49:09.880" class="transcript_line"> the piss ups we&#039;ve had and the conversations we&#039;ve had you know are really dear to me in it</div><div id="00:49:13.880" class="transcript_line"> and so are all the conversations i&#039;ve had with complete strangers at bars there are people who i</div><div id="00:49:19.240" class="transcript_line"> i hold really dear to my heart that i have never ever seen in my life without a drink in their hand</div><div id="00:49:25.080" class="transcript_line"> and and you know these all these people are really important to me and and i&#039;m my my next book my</div><div id="00:49:31.160" class="transcript_line"> next novel i&#039;m working on is is most likely going to be about newport in the mid-north east funnily</div><div id="00:49:36.200" class="transcript_line"> enough since you asked me to talk about this decade specifically and it&#039;s been really interesting</div><div id="00:49:41.480" class="transcript_line"> going back and visiting those you know mainly a lot of the loudest characters rather than you know</div><div id="00:49:47.560" class="transcript_line"> the quiet sensible people but going back and visiting those characters and sort of</div><div id="00:49:55.480" class="transcript_line"> i mean the book is years away from from being anything but but you know finally just going</div><div id="00:50:00.440" class="transcript_line"> back and thinking about the people that i spent time with and i think i think i think also being</div><div id="00:50:06.200" class="transcript_line"> away from newport as i have them for four years now i mean i come my family&#039;s still there so i</div><div id="00:50:10.520" class="transcript_line"> you know come back every week but having the distance from it now is something that&#039;s given</div><div id="00:50:16.120" class="transcript_line"> me the opportunity to think about writing about it properly you know not be not being out in the</div><div id="00:50:22.440" class="transcript_line"> pubs or in the nightlife or i&#039;m also you know in my 40s now and one of the reasons i moved i mean</div><div id="00:50:27.320" class="transcript_line"> there were many reasons i moved to korea but one of them was that i thought getting away from newport</div><div id="00:50:32.280" class="transcript_line"> would sort of help me figure out what i thought about the place figure out my relationship and</div><div id="00:50:39.480" class="transcript_line"> sort of help me process you know the sort of 25 years i spent um out you know sat at the bar</div><div id="00:50:49.080" class="transcript_line"> and when i sort of decided that i wasn&#039;t going to be doing that quite so much i mean i got a family</div><div id="00:50:53.160" class="transcript_line"> now and stuff and um when i realized i wasn&#039;t going to be really living that life anymore i</div><div id="00:50:59.080" class="transcript_line"> i wanted to write about it and that&#039;s kind of where i&#039;m headed at the moment but thinking about</div><div id="00:51:03.480" class="transcript_line"> those characters and the people that i&#039;ve that are my friends the people that i&#039;ve even people</div><div id="00:51:09.080" class="transcript_line"> that aren&#039;t my friends who are just people that were always people i saw um going back and sort</div><div id="00:51:13.640" class="transcript_line"> of thinking about it and writing notes and sketches and characters and things like that</div><div id="00:51:17.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s it was just a just is and was a phenomenal place full of i know it can be a cliche you know</div><div id="00:51:24.680" class="transcript_line"> characters you know the characters that you meet in the merger for instance and we can all</div><div id="00:51:28.920" class="transcript_line"> name probably 20 different ones although there&#039;d be a venn diagram there where blakey would exist</div><div id="00:51:33.480" class="transcript_line"> in almost all of those venn diagrams no doubt but um for many different reasons but um but just all</div><div id="00:51:39.480" class="transcript_line"> those people and all the things those people brought to the table the different cultural</div><div id="00:51:44.360" class="transcript_line"> musical influences you know you you go to the pub on a on a wednesday thursday friday and you&#039;d</div><div id="00:51:50.600" class="transcript_line"> come away with a new playlist and that&#039;s you know 25 years of drinking in there drinking in</div><div id="00:51:56.040" class="transcript_line"> drinking in newport and drinking in the merengier and never once did i not feel like i was learning</div><div id="00:52:02.360" class="transcript_line"> something or encountering something even though i was just for the most part sat in the same on</div><div id="00:52:07.480" class="transcript_line"> the same store it really does in a new port i think really has uh great characters it&#039;s always</div><div id="00:52:13.400" class="transcript_line"> had great characters you know freak show yeah exactly some kind of strange carnival um but</div><div id="00:52:22.440" class="transcript_line"> also you know the point of writing a book like that is that you want to sort of capture some</div><div id="00:52:27.640" class="transcript_line"> kind of essence which is what i suppose we an element of what we&#039;ve been talking about tonight</div><div id="00:52:32.120" class="transcript_line"> but capture some kind of essence of what a place feels like and what the people they sort of create</div><div id="00:52:42.680" class="transcript_line"> how about you san how do you think newport has changed since you&#039;ve been here how do you hope it</div><div id="00:52:46.680" class="transcript_line"> has changed since you&#039;ve been here how do you hope it has changed since you&#039;ve been here how do you</div><div id="00:52:50.680" class="transcript_line"> i don&#039;t know i i think there&#039;s there&#039;s been a lot of it&#039;s really difficult to try and articulate but</div><div id="00:53:00.200" class="transcript_line"> i think newport is severely lacking in support from arts council wales and other organizations</div><div id="00:53:06.600" class="transcript_line"> of that ilk in that we have the riverfront but it&#039;s not used and it&#039;s just staffed by people who</div><div id="00:53:12.840" class="transcript_line"> understand the arts and yet are somehow running an arts center and that is one of my biggest</div><div id="00:53:17.640" class="transcript_line"> bug bears and i think when that theater was built there was this great like there was this great</div><div id="00:53:23.320" class="transcript_line"> feeling of okay they&#039;re they&#039;re going to build us a theater and we&#039;re going to be able to do the</div><div id="00:53:27.400" class="transcript_line"> most incredible things and have you know the most incredible acts coming to our theater and you end</div><div id="00:53:32.920" class="transcript_line"> up with a panto and a couple of comedians every year because and i mean speaking personally i</div><div id="00:53:40.040" class="transcript_line"> struggled for four years to get any form of support from arts council wales because i mean</div><div id="00:53:46.280" class="transcript_line"> they want to romanticize the past of me but when it comes to future funding you have to fight tooth</div><div id="00:53:52.520" class="transcript_line"> and nail whereas it seems if you&#039;re in cardiff or rexham or swansea and those are the only three</div><div id="00:53:57.720" class="transcript_line"> cities in wales i really have any experience of working in it seems if you&#039;re in one of those</div><div id="00:54:02.840" class="transcript_line"> three cities then they want to do things with you they want to work with you they want to you know</div><div id="00:54:07.640" class="transcript_line"> they want to help bring in the future whereas in newport i don&#039;t know what the issue is but it</div><div id="00:54:14.280" class="transcript_line"> needs looking into because we have the infrastructure we have you know the pubs a great venue the</div><div id="00:54:18.920" class="transcript_line"> morrange is still there the riverfront&#039;s a great venue we&#039;re getting a new leisure center</div><div id="00:54:24.120" class="transcript_line"> but without the support of arts council wales and the offices involved and other funders other arts</div><div id="00:54:29.960" class="transcript_line"> funders they&#039;re just going to sit empty for another 20 years and i think the big difference to me is</div><div id="00:54:35.240" class="transcript_line"> that the buildings are there now but there&#039;s still not the support that needed to be put in place</div><div id="00:54:40.120" class="transcript_line"> what breaks my heart is when i go to newport these days is seeing the death of the high street you</div><div id="00:54:45.480" class="transcript_line"> know i think that&#039;s probably a national problem but yeah but it seems to it&#039;s not really we&#039;re</div><div id="00:54:50.840" class="transcript_line"> not in cardiff yet and but i mean it is a national problem but the newport seems to have been hit</div><div id="00:54:55.160" class="transcript_line"> hardest i think i think it&#039;s it&#039;s a national problem but it&#039;s it&#039;s not hitting the massive cities</div><div id="00:55:01.080" class="transcript_line"> so your bristol&#039;s your swansies your manchesters but if you go to wakefield wakefield up you know</div><div id="00:55:09.720" class="transcript_line"> small city next to leeds exactly the same wrexham exactly the same it&#039;s i mean to me as well i don&#039;t</div><div id="00:55:16.040" class="transcript_line"> know why we&#039;re continuing to push for retail why we&#039;re trying to keep this retail in newport dream</div><div id="00:55:21.960" class="transcript_line"> alive because everyone is shopping online let&#039;s turn it into coffee shops flats you know pubs</div><div id="00:55:30.120" class="transcript_line"> clubs venues and make it a social hub so that people can all still come into the town but not</div><div id="00:55:35.960" class="transcript_line"> to shop anymore to socialize and access culture let&#039;s build more galleries let&#039;s build more museums</div><div id="00:55:41.880" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s build more music venues because people aren&#039;t shopping so why the hell do we keep</div><div id="00:55:47.320" class="transcript_line"> trying to force people to open shops that nobody wants to shop in it&#039;s just of the waste of that</div><div id="00:55:53.640" class="transcript_line"> this the massive buildings that are in newport center now are a waste let&#039;s let&#039;s let&#039;s access</div><div id="00:55:57.880" class="transcript_line"> them culturally and then that way we can enrich every single person in newport&#039;s life because if</div><div id="00:56:02.520" class="transcript_line"> the city center was to become this incredible like free access arts point like i remember the</div><div id="00:56:08.360" class="transcript_line"> project space that we had that was the old sports shop that was incredible you could just wander in</div><div id="00:56:12.840" class="transcript_line"> and there was somebody had put something on the walls at some point we put some gigs on a couple</div><div id="00:56:17.080" class="transcript_line"> people put some photography exhibitions on we need more of that i mean i guess how do you</div><div id="00:56:22.760" class="transcript_line"> know how street is that you can keep you got to keep money circulating you know you got to bring</div><div id="00:56:26.920" class="transcript_line"> money into charge charge them for it people would pay to access culture if it was cheap enough</div><div id="00:56:32.440" class="transcript_line"> so but how do you think about newport how has it changed though sam for you in over the years is it</div><div id="00:56:38.600" class="transcript_line"> i don&#039;t know i think structurally it&#039;s changed but in terms of emotionally and and the support that</div><div id="00:56:44.920" class="transcript_line"> the arts and the culture aspect get it hasn&#039;t changed at all they&#039;ve built a lot of big buildings</div><div id="00:56:49.720" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s still no support there would be the sum up the summation of what you know what i&#039;m</div><div id="00:56:53.720" class="transcript_line"> trying to say there&#039;s nothing there for us we&#039;re still on our own as as in the pub we&#039;re still on</div><div id="00:56:59.560" class="transcript_line"> our own trying to trying to put the gigs on and the pandemic obviously has smacked hit the</div><div id="00:57:06.120" class="transcript_line"> shit out of you up i guess i mean the pandemic funding from welsh government was incredible</div><div id="00:57:11.640" class="transcript_line"> absolutely i cannot fault them for grassroots music venues it was phenomenal we actually came out with</div><div id="00:57:16.920" class="transcript_line"> a pandemic in a financially similar situation but with the recording studio in the basement and new</div><div id="00:57:22.920" class="transcript_line"> floors that we had been funded during the lockdown you know so it&#039;s it was quite good for us we</div><div id="00:57:28.600" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t you know at no point were we at risk of losing the venue because the welsh funding was so</div><div id="00:57:32.520" class="transcript_line"> great okay but just gonna over to gary ask him similar how do you think newport&#039;s changed and</div><div id="00:57:40.600" class="transcript_line"> um well i i wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable commenting on on what it&#039;s like now because i don&#039;t go out</div><div id="00:57:46.840" class="transcript_line"> and you know i visit family but i don&#039;t go into town very much although i have you know i it&#039;s</div><div id="00:57:51.080" class="transcript_line"> only been four years since you left no yeah i know and actually when i when i do go back when i when</div><div id="00:57:55.640" class="transcript_line"> i you know do drive down the road and go back there i&#039;ve been into town it&#039;s nice to see that</div><div id="00:58:00.600" class="transcript_line"> you know there&#039;s that that it that newport isn&#039;t existing in kind of this isolated you know sort of</div><div id="00:58:08.040" class="transcript_line"> bubble and they&#039;re at you know like in other places they&#039;re really nice little coffee shops</div><div id="00:58:12.040" class="transcript_line"> cropping up and and um you know little eateries and things like that and and that&#039;s that&#039;s always</div><div id="00:58:17.640" class="transcript_line"> nice to see but i but i agree with sam i mean my experience is that newport you know new buildings</div><div id="00:58:22.360" class="transcript_line"> cropping up and things like that but but what newport is to me is not like buildings or anything</div><div id="00:58:28.280" class="transcript_line"> like that it&#039;s about attitudes and and the people and and newport kind of newport does quite well</div><div id="00:58:34.760" class="transcript_line"> for it&#039;s you know maybe not financially but does quite well for itself as the forgotten underdog</div><div id="00:58:39.960" class="transcript_line"> you know newport newport sort of grinds along that&#039;s what it does and that that&#039;s one of the</div><div id="00:58:45.960" class="transcript_line"> big attractions of it to me is like you know i mean i might not be easily identifiable anymore</div><div id="00:58:53.640" class="transcript_line"> as so so much as you know now i work in the arts and all that kind of stuff and</div><div id="00:58:59.160" class="transcript_line"> rather than signing on and getting pissed like i did in my teens and 20s now i you know i have</div><div id="00:59:04.440" class="transcript_line"> made quite a decent living for some you know in quite an i have quite an interesting job so</div><div id="00:59:10.520" class="transcript_line"> um but at the same time i do kind of feel that um i&#039;m everything i am is because of my</div><div id="00:59:17.560" class="transcript_line"> newport upbringing and my newport you know formative years of teens and 20s yeah it&#039;s</div><div id="00:59:23.560" class="transcript_line"> absolutely made me who i am and um and everything i&#039;ve achieved in my career i suppose is about um</div><div id="00:59:32.280" class="transcript_line"> just like putting your head down and getting on with it and working hard and like you know going</div><div id="00:59:37.880" class="transcript_line"> back to what sam said i mean you know the the pub&#039;s going to exist and bands are going to come</div><div id="00:59:43.240" class="transcript_line"> there and people are going to be creative and regardless of whether the arts council or</div><div id="00:59:47.240" class="transcript_line"> welsh government pays any attention and that&#039;s what newport and wales arts review was built</div><div id="00:59:51.400" class="transcript_line"> despite everybody you know books council arts council um you know wealth writers you know of</div><div id="00:59:59.480" class="transcript_line"> the of the generation up um all saying that like you know there&#039;s no space for what for what you&#039;re</div><div id="01:00:04.760" class="transcript_line"> doing there and 10 years later we&#039;re read by 250 000 people in 200 countries and it&#039;s and that&#039;s</div><div id="01:00:10.920" class="transcript_line"> because that the people who set up was actually from newport and i&#039;m i&#039;m absolutely convinced of</div><div id="01:00:15.400" class="transcript_line"> that and we just decided we&#039;re going to do this because it&#039;s what we want to do and we&#039;re going</div><div id="01:00:19.320" class="transcript_line"> to work hard at it and it&#039;s going to be brilliant and we&#039;re going to do it in spite of the naysayers</div><div id="01:00:25.960" class="transcript_line"> and the and being ignored by the people with the purse strings even though we do get public funding</div><div id="01:00:31.720" class="transcript_line"> but we had we i know that we had to fight 10 times harder than you know any magazine in</div><div id="01:00:37.560" class="transcript_line"> aberystwyth or bangor or cardiff for that matter um to get to get what we deserve i think i think</div><div id="01:00:43.400" class="transcript_line"> what gary says there in spite that&#039;s that&#039;s the important thing there is people in newport are</div><div id="01:00:47.800" class="transcript_line"> doing it in spite of the public funding that&#039;s available not because of it yeah it&#039;s a new port</div><div id="01:00:53.320" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a you know it&#039;s it is a new port attitude and i don&#039;t mean to be tribal about it but</div><div id="01:00:57.800" class="transcript_line"> living in calif as i do i&#039;m really happy here we&#039;re all happy here but i do feel like i live</div><div id="01:01:01.960" class="transcript_line"> abroad you know i i don&#039;t feel like i&#039;m living foreign country i do i absolutely do and and i</div><div id="01:01:08.360" class="transcript_line"> and i absolutely feel that way you know whether i&#039;m walking down cabridge road and it&#039;s full of</div><div id="01:01:13.160" class="transcript_line"> you know middle working class voices and working class shops or whether i&#039;m walking up to a bar</div><div id="01:01:18.600" class="transcript_line"> in pont canna and everybody sort of bbc middle class and welsh language and crackac and all that</div><div id="01:01:23.560" class="transcript_line"> you know i no matter where i am i feel like i&#039;m visiting um and when it&#039;s interesting what you</div><div id="01:01:28.520" class="transcript_line"> just said actually because it reminded me of when i was young and and and the doll&#039;s first started</div><div id="01:01:33.720" class="transcript_line"> out because actually nobody gave a shit about any of the bands in south wales and you know once you</div><div id="01:01:42.120" class="transcript_line"> start to create a little scene and it&#039;s got value they start they start they start becoming</div><div id="01:01:47.480" class="transcript_line"> interested so it&#039;s actually about the whales out if you just make something that&#039;s good</div><div id="01:01:52.040" class="transcript_line"> and ignore everybody and they will eventually take notice yeah yeah young people are going to</div><div id="01:01:57.160" class="transcript_line"> be creative basically you know they&#039;re going to make music they&#039;re going to write they&#039;re going</div><div id="01:02:00.360" class="transcript_line"> to make art and and for the sake of it as well you know like we didn&#039;t we never set up the review to</div><div id="01:02:07.640" class="transcript_line"> make money it was because we wanted to um to write about stuff we wanted to be heard yeah</div><div id="01:02:13.480" class="transcript_line"> we wanted to have a voice and you know we&#039;d all been to other places in wales and sent our stuff</div><div id="01:02:18.120" class="transcript_line"> in and there was no way in so set up your own thing and i think that obviously not exclusively</div><div id="01:02:22.840" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s a certain newport attitude to that is just like get it done and get it done now just do it</div><div id="01:02:32.680" class="transcript_line"> one of the things i was going to say which ties into something say i was saying earlier about um</div><div id="01:02:37.720" class="transcript_line"> how you know the noughties became slowly became the time in newport i felt that people just started</div><div id="01:02:42.840" class="transcript_line"> looking back on the 90s and that&#039;s an excellent point yeah but also it started to apologize</div><div id="01:02:47.720" class="transcript_line"> something yeah something that just was a kind of exciting time that&#039;s what i think that&#039;s when it</div><div id="01:02:55.640" class="transcript_line"> when it kind of happened but also something that i was only thinking about since i was thinking</div><div id="01:02:59.640" class="transcript_line"> about um coming and doing this podcast was um you know i used to dj um in the noughties in the</div><div id="01:03:06.040" class="transcript_line"> basement stuff like that i mean i you know i dj&#039;d a little bit i was part of like four</div><div id="01:03:11.400" class="transcript_line"> team a four guy team of dj&#039;s and i was definitely fourth of the i&#039;d prefer to be like out on the</div><div id="01:03:18.280" class="transcript_line"> floor i mean first best dj in newport but but one of the one of the things i was i was thinking</div><div id="01:03:24.520" class="transcript_line"> about was how um the kind of attitudes towards music i think in general may be changed in the</div><div id="01:03:30.920" class="transcript_line"> in the noughties um i was just kind of thinking about it and how it was kind of in in in the like</div><div id="01:03:38.200" class="transcript_line"> those last days of the big of the mega clubs which are all gone now apart from like in london</div><div id="01:03:42.920" class="transcript_line"> and manchester and stuff but those big mega clubs that are all closed now and clubs like the basement</div><div id="01:03:48.040" class="transcript_line"> which you know had like a 500 600 capacity or whatever it was and we used to dj it there and i</div><div id="01:03:53.800" class="transcript_line"> and i&#039;m thinking back on it like how uh there was a kind of snobbery about music which i saw change</div><div id="01:04:01.400" class="transcript_line"> through that decade whereas which had kind of sort of two things about it like like you know</div><div id="01:04:08.680" class="transcript_line"> buying the sort of 2006 2007 you could fill a dance floor playing whitney houston in an indie</div><div id="01:04:14.440" class="transcript_line"> club whereas there&#039;s no way you could have got away with doing that 10 years earlier but at the</div><div id="01:04:18.440" class="transcript_line"> same time like you weren&#039;t going to get any interest from playing you know like joseph k or</div><div id="01:04:23.080" class="transcript_line"> the bush tetras whereas you could have done that in 98 99 they were people who like you know had</div><div id="01:04:29.640" class="transcript_line"> their special edition rough trade stuff they knew those bands and people didn&#039;t you know you just</div><div id="01:04:34.600" class="transcript_line"> get people looking at you weird if you put anything like that on in so so there was kind of a flip</div><div id="01:04:39.560" class="transcript_line"> thing of like it was really cool that you could get away with playing just great pop music that</div><div id="01:04:44.200" class="transcript_line"> everybody loved and you didn&#039;t have to be ashamed of like i want to dance with somebody there&#039;s a</div><div id="01:04:48.360" class="transcript_line"> great floor filler you could actually play it in a dj set and nobody would be like throwing beer cans</div><div id="01:04:53.240" class="transcript_line"> at you um but at the same time there was a kind of loss of depth i think when it came to club music</div><div id="01:04:58.920" class="transcript_line"> like you know nobody was like oh my god you i can&#039;t believe you played that jam b-side</div><div id="01:05:04.520" class="transcript_line"> you know it was like it had to be the hits you know but um so i think the noughties was</div><div id="01:05:09.720" class="transcript_line"> tying in with that thing about it becoming an age of nostalgia it also kind of swapped a sort of</div><div id="01:05:16.280" class="transcript_line"> maybe musical snobbery gradually for something that was a bit more inclusive and then became like</div><div id="01:05:22.840" class="transcript_line"> eventually becomes like all you&#039;re playing is kook&#039;s naive and fucking kings of leon</div><div id="01:05:27.320" class="transcript_line"> and everything dies but but there was a moment there where you could play fiery furnaces and</div><div id="01:05:32.760" class="transcript_line"> whitney houston there was a moment there was a window and it was pure joy yeah um that&#039;s</div><div id="01:05:39.720" class="transcript_line"> something we still do on saturdays we we can literally flip and it&#039;s brilliant you can flip</div><div id="01:05:46.600" class="transcript_line"> from lizzo to jerry cinnamon to whitney houston to andrew wk to something else super cool a niche</div><div id="01:05:56.680" class="transcript_line"> and then back into paramour and as long as you chuck in some my chemical romance at the end</div><div id="01:06:00.680" class="transcript_line"> everyone&#039;s going home happy it&#039;s it&#039;s a saturdays are a very strange night in the club it&#039;s</div><div id="01:06:05.960" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s called bangers and it doesn&#039;t matter what the genre is if it&#039;s a banger it gets played</div><div id="01:06:09.320" class="transcript_line"> i think that&#039;s to do with uh the death of try do you know have you heard of a writer called</div><div id="01:06:13.960" class="transcript_line"> barney hoskins anybody has a music writer that is before your time a big big writer the enemy</div><div id="01:06:20.040" class="transcript_line"> back in the day and i i got him in once to do a guest lecture for me and uh he&#039;s really</div><div id="01:06:26.600" class="transcript_line"> really smart barney and he kind of explained really well what he thought was like the death of</div><div id="01:06:32.760" class="transcript_line"> we call it the death of culture but he said culture now is just you know</div><div id="01:06:36.200" class="transcript_line"> they just have it you know it&#039;s just like there it is just big you know you know you know but</div><div id="01:06:41.320" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like like guy was saying he used to be some niche culture it&#039;s so much cultural capital</div><div id="01:06:49.160" class="transcript_line"> maybe i&#039;m going at my own arse here but i just thought you know we don&#039;t need we can&#039;t kind of</div><div id="01:06:52.840" class="transcript_line"> relax and just become you know part of the white noise you have to have to have a voice you have</div><div id="01:06:58.280" class="transcript_line"> to kind of develop something interesting</div><div id="01:07:18.360" class="transcript_line"> you</div></div></p>
