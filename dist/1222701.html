We always used to go to Dinness Powers for Seder.</div><div id="00:00:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Different to today because even today I take services now and I conduct a Seder night service</div><div id="00:00:21.200" class="transcript_line"> so the people who are in the service can understand what&#039;s going on. In those days we didn&#039;t understand</div><div id="00:00:27.680" class="transcript_line"> what was going on. It was just all read in Hebrew. Nobody understood anything and we did what we did.</div><div id="00:00:33.760" class="transcript_line"> That was the way that it was done. There was more time spent asking people to be quiet and stop talking</div><div id="00:00:38.720" class="transcript_line"> than actually doing the service. As youngsters and I was the youngest of three we always used to have</div><div id="00:00:45.120" class="transcript_line"> to ask the four questions and that was a daunting task for anybody growing up especially in front</div><div id="00:00:50.960" class="transcript_line"> of all your aunts and uncles and cousins and I wouldn&#039;t have not done it for the world.
