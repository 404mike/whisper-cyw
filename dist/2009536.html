We were still getting Guardian reporters turning up and it was a very very strange</div><div id="00:00:29.200" class="transcript_line"> time to be alive. I honestly don&#039;t know because I&#039;ve been asked this question a lot of like loads</div><div id="00:00:34.320" class="transcript_line"> of students want to do documentaries on the TJ&#039;s years and things like that and I no matter how</div><div id="00:00:39.520" class="transcript_line"> hard I think about it like none of the bands went on to be absolutely stellar. I mean Catatonia did</div><div id="00:00:46.480" class="transcript_line"> really well but none of them went on to be like your kind of like U2 Ed Sheeran level none of</div><div id="00:00:51.920" class="transcript_line"> them did that.

I couldn&#039;t tell you</div><div id="00:01:01.760" class="transcript_line"> why the world&#039;s press decided to descend on Newport for two years it was really weird and even being</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> involved in it like we&#039;d get a call you know that the Guardian wants to come and interview you and</div><div id="00:01:12.960" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d be like why why do they care? I mean even like talking to the 60 foot dolls and things they no</div><div id="00:01:18.800" class="transcript_line"> one knew why it got that big or what on earth you know was the catalyst for that no one could put</div><div id="00:01:25.040" class="transcript_line"> their finger on it. It just happened and it was really strange. I mean we were in TJ&#039;s the one</div><div id="00:01:29.600" class="transcript_line"> night and like there&#039;s just literally reporters from major newspapers just turning up in TJ&#039;s on</div><div id="00:01:36.080" class="transcript_line"> a Friday night to ask people like what&#039;s it like living here and you&#039;re like I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:40.320" class="transcript_line"> the same as living in any other large town in Britain in the 90s it&#039;s a bit shit and a bit all</div><div id="00:01:44.720" class="transcript_line"> right it&#039;s very very odd. So I know they did um I think it was the NME decided to bring 100 numbers</div><div id="00:01:51.440" class="transcript_line"> in Newport from the phone directory without looking at the names and see how many rock stars</div><div id="00:01:55.360" class="transcript_line"> they could get hold of and they actually managed to get hold of Mike Cole completely randomly by</div><div id="00:02:01.040" class="transcript_line"> choosing a random number and it was like yeah you probably within 100 numbers you probably did have</div><div id="00:02:06.480" class="transcript_line"> a good chance of finding someone that was in a band but they managed to get hold of the biggest</div><div id="00:02:10.080" class="transcript_line"> band from Newport and he absolutely swears that he never gave his parents number out to anyone</div><div id="00:02:15.360" class="transcript_line"> so there&#039;s no way they would have like known to do it and things very odd.</div><div id="00:02:22.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s quite a few La Pop Gigs that stand out.
