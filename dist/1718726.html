    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So the house that you&#039;re living in now was part of the estate, the Billit&#039;s estate, is that right?</div><div id="00:00:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes indeed.</div><div id="00:00:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, built when?</div><div id="00:00:11.120" class="transcript_line"> This one&#039;s 1868. So they seem to have building periods with the various estates.</div><div id="00:00:18.320" class="transcript_line"> The land here is quite unusual because effectively there&#039;s only been three</div><div id="00:00:23.600" class="transcript_line"> three ownerships of the land since the dissolution.</div><div id="00:00:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Eventually the crown sold off the land here to a chap called William Fowler who was from Shrewsbury,</div><div id="00:00:35.040" class="transcript_line"> he was the provost of Shrewsbury, quite an important man on the council of the marches,</div><div id="00:00:40.960" class="transcript_line"> and he was a serial buyer of monastic land. He lived at a place called Harnage Grange in</div><div id="00:00:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Shropshire which was formerly part of Bedford&#039;s survey, and he bought in 1665.</div><div id="00:00:57.520" class="transcript_line"> His family, his successors, were here tottering on and his estate eventually collapsed about 1820.</div><div id="00:01:06.880" class="transcript_line"> Then Thomas Wilson came who was a London solicitor, seemed to be quite a go-ahead sort of chap,</div><div id="00:01:13.600" class="transcript_line"> and what we can see from the records got himself into a deal with Lord Portman to build a market</div><div id="00:01:19.920" class="transcript_line"> in what we would now call Portman Street in London, and went bankrupt. So he went off to</div><div id="00:01:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Australia to Adelaide where he became, he was the second mayor of Adelaide, so he made a new</div><div id="00:01:35.120" class="transcript_line"> life for himself, very successful, and we still have some contact with his descendants in Australia,</div><div id="00:01:40.960" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s a nush within the Phillips family who were mill owners in Stockport, and they were here</div><div id="00:01:50.080" class="transcript_line"> until 1959 when this property was sold out of the estate. The two houses were sold and bought by</div><div id="00:02:01.600" class="transcript_line"> a well-known local character called Mercer Griffiths who lived in the house next door to me,</div><div id="00:02:08.160" class="transcript_line"> and she bought both houses. He bought one because she wanted some accommodation for her parents,</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and she thought she might live in the other one. Well, this one was £350</div><div id="00:02:23.120" class="transcript_line"> because it had a bit more land next door which was only £300. That&#039;s the history of these two houses.</div><div id="00:02:30.400" class="transcript_line"> The build time is the 1860s which was quite significant because the Phillips were</div><div id="00:02:38.720" class="transcript_line"> obviously very proactive on the estate at that time, which was certainly not true of</div><div id="00:02:44.640" class="transcript_line"> many of the years when the Fowlers were here. The estate seemed to be very badly managed from</div><div id="00:02:52.640" class="transcript_line"> about 1750 onwards and went into a long, long period of decline, but the Phillips were</div><div id="00:03:00.400" class="transcript_line"> initially absent landlords, most of them were absentee landlords most of the time, and they</div><div id="00:03:09.360" class="transcript_line"> really dropped to grips from the 1850s onwards, and they did a lot of building and rebuilding.</div><div id="00:03:16.320" class="transcript_line"> The first estate houses they built were the Lye who went on to comprise</div><div id="00:03:24.240" class="transcript_line"> their little pairs of cottages.</div><div id="00:03:31.200" class="transcript_line"> They would go back to 1840s shortly after they arrived, but their main expansion seemed to have</div><div id="00:03:38.880" class="transcript_line"> been in the 1860s when they built schools, they built three pairs of houses like this,</div><div id="00:03:47.760" class="transcript_line"> this pair which eventually became Piccadilly. I&#039;m not quite sure why Piccadilly, except that</div><div id="00:03:56.880" class="transcript_line"> I think they had connections with what I suspect they had a London home in Piccadilly because two</div><div id="00:04:02.480" class="transcript_line"> of their children were christened in St James&#039;s Church Piccadilly, Paddock down near the Union,</div><div id="00:04:10.480" class="transcript_line"> and the Cymdee cottage, if you come across Cymdee cottage up at the back end of the valley,</div><div id="00:04:17.760" class="transcript_line"> up towards Brookersany, that&#039;s been converted into a single house.</div><div id="00:04:26.320" class="transcript_line"> These were 1860s. What was the purpose of the estate building for workers presumably?</div><div id="00:04:32.560" class="transcript_line"> For workers, yes, certainly these were quite large by the standards of the time.</div><div id="00:04:43.520" class="transcript_line"> The Wernock cottage and Lye cottage was another pair of cottages as you see coming into the village.</div><div id="00:04:49.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now one, were very small. At one time there was about 12 people living in one of the Lye</div><div id="00:04:56.240" class="transcript_line"> cottages which is two up, two down, no privy up the backs of the thing, so it was relatively basic.</div><div id="00:05:06.080" class="transcript_line"> But these were better. Also in the 1850s they rebuilt the Abbey farms, it was known,</div><div id="00:05:13.440" class="transcript_line"> which we now call Home Farm, and that was the model farm for the estate and there were all</div><div id="00:05:20.480" class="transcript_line"> the best practices of agriculture were on display there. There&#039;s a splendid range of buildings,</div><div id="00:05:28.080" class="transcript_line"> coach house, coachman&#039;s accommodation, stabling, etc etc, wonderful buildings, but sadly</div><div id="00:05:34.720" class="transcript_line"> not fit for purpose anymore for modern agriculture.</div></div></p>
