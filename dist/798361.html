    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My favourite ciders are what I call Herefordshire style, but I&#039;d say that the Welsh ciders are</div><div id="00:00:10.120" class="transcript_line"> traditionally of Herefordshire style rather than South West style or Eastern County style.</div><div id="00:00:17.440" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re fairly what I call beefy ciders. There&#039;s a lot going on in your mouth. I use pure wild</div><div id="00:00:25.160" class="transcript_line"> yeast fermentations with our products and I believe that although it can give you more</div><div id="00:00:30.720" class="transcript_line"> spoilage, it also gives you a much better depth of flavour in the product. You draw out the tannins,</div><div id="00:00:39.320" class="transcript_line"> you draw out the acids, you have a well-balanced... I like really, really dry ciders. I don&#039;t want</div><div id="00:00:47.280" class="transcript_line"> anything to be complicated by sweetness really. The same broadly with the Perry, you know, the</div><div id="00:00:53.880" class="transcript_line"> really dry, crisp... I quite like quite acidic products. I made some cider this year of out of</div><div id="00:01:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Broxwood Foxwell which the juice has come out and it&#039;s bright pink at the moment. Really,</div><div id="00:01:09.840" class="transcript_line"> really bright pink. Don&#039;t know what it&#039;ll be like by the time it&#039;s fermented, but it&#039;s...</div><div id="00:01:16.360" class="transcript_line"> and I love that, but it&#039;d be way too acidic for some people. So there are a million and one</div><div id="00:01:22.600" class="transcript_line"> different ways to make cider. You know, everyone makes it differently and you can choose according</div><div id="00:01:30.200" class="transcript_line"> to what product you want to make and what you believe in at the end of the day. Like most people,</div><div id="00:01:35.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve done Peter Mitchell&#039;s cider making course, spent a week with him. I came away with some</div><div id="00:01:41.560" class="transcript_line"> useful information, but I don&#039;t make my cider his way. I have very, very little in common. In fact,</div><div id="00:01:47.840" class="transcript_line"> we both start with apples. There&#039;s really very, very little in common between how he makes his</div><div id="00:01:53.040" class="transcript_line"> and how I make mine, but I have to say I prefer drinking mine. I prefer the world yeast,</div><div id="00:01:57.840" class="transcript_line"> I prefer the depth. That&#039;s how I like it.</div></div></p>
