    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:06.200" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m speaking to Wendy Lonsdale, who has memories of her parents during the war.</div><div id="00:00:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Wendy, what do you want to tell me?</div><div id="00:00:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was born in 1941, so I was always called a war baby.</div><div id="00:00:21.640" class="transcript_line"> My mother used to, we lived actually in Porta Gueste and we had an antique business in Port</div><div id="00:00:30.960" class="transcript_line"> Madoc.</div><div id="00:00:33.120" class="transcript_line"> So when the phony war came, my mother panicked and thought that the Germans were going to</div><div id="00:00:39.920" class="transcript_line"> land on Black Rock Sands.</div><div id="00:00:43.480" class="transcript_line"> And so she started taking all her valuable antiques down into the cellar until I think</div><div id="00:00:49.800" class="transcript_line"> my father told her not to be so silly.</div><div id="00:00:53.480" class="transcript_line"> So that was the first story that I can recall.</div><div id="00:00:58.160" class="transcript_line"> And I do remember that my father was in the Home Guard in the first few years of the war</div><div id="00:01:03.560" class="transcript_line"> and he was stationed up below Snowdon, near Capelkirig, guarding the line, the pipeline,</div><div id="00:01:17.120" class="transcript_line"> which was water.</div><div id="00:01:19.160" class="transcript_line"> I gather it was water.</div><div id="00:01:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:21.560" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t hear very much about that.</div><div id="00:01:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And then at the beginning of the war, anybody who had a house with a spare bedroom was told</div><div id="00:01:32.840" class="transcript_line"> they had to take members of the services or they had to have somebody to live with them.</div><div id="00:01:43.440" class="transcript_line"> So my mother decided, or evacuees, so my mother said, oh, well, we&#039;ve got the premises,</div><div id="00:01:49.120" class="transcript_line"> above the shop.</div><div id="00:01:50.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll go down to the shop and live over the shop in Port Madduck and we&#039;ll let a family</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> come and live in our house in Borthogest.</div><div id="00:02:01.480" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not quite sure how long we were there, but I was born over the shop.</div><div id="00:02:06.800" class="transcript_line"> And I remember my mother saying to her mother, well, I don&#039;t remember this, but she told</div><div id="00:02:12.280" class="transcript_line"> me this, that, oh, I can&#039;t possibly have a baby over the shop.</div><div id="00:02:17.240" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmother apparently said, you&#039;d be surprised where you can have a baby.</div><div id="00:02:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So during the war, obviously, I was a baby.</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> And my mother took me on the, I think we must have had a, we went by taxi, I think, to Liverpool,</div><div id="00:02:36.440" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s where her mother and father lived in Liverpool, but not in Liverpool itself,</div><div id="00:02:42.640" class="transcript_line"> out in Great Crosby.</div><div id="00:02:45.320" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother apparently used to say, they&#039;d telephone and say, do you think it&#039;s safe</div><div id="00:02:49.600" class="transcript_line"> to come?</div><div id="00:02:51.200" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmother said, well, there haven&#039;t been any bombs recently.</div><div id="00:02:55.080" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;re safe to come.</div><div id="00:02:56.460" class="transcript_line"> So then apparently we were, I was taken as a baby in arms up to Liverpool.</div><div id="00:03:02.360" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as we got there, the bombs started dropping.</div><div id="00:03:06.720" class="transcript_line"> And at nearly the end of the war, my father had then been called up because he was older.</div><div id="00:03:13.140" class="transcript_line"> He was called up and he was in the Royal Corps of Signals and doing, learning how to do</div><div id="00:03:20.500" class="transcript_line"> codes and things like that.</div><div id="00:03:21.860" class="transcript_line"> And he was, I remember he was in Scarborough.</div><div id="00:03:26.020" class="transcript_line"> And for some reason we went to stay in Scarborough.</div><div id="00:03:28.820" class="transcript_line"> We went on the train.</div><div id="00:03:30.380" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going on the train and all the soldiers on the train, sort of making</div><div id="00:03:37.760" class="transcript_line"> a big fuss of me because I was a little girl.</div><div id="00:03:41.140" class="transcript_line"> And we got to Scarborough and stayed there a few days, I suppose.</div><div id="00:03:47.220" class="transcript_line"> Those are my earliest memories.</div><div id="00:03:49.340" class="transcript_line"> You told me one memory about your mother and the knives.</div><div id="00:03:52.740" class="transcript_line"> And yes, so because it was an antique shop, she had a lot of, well, knives, very obviously</div><div id="00:03:59.060" class="transcript_line"> very dangerous knives from the Far East.</div><div id="00:04:03.060" class="transcript_line"> And there were Dutch commandos stationed, I think near Harlech.</div><div id="00:04:09.420" class="transcript_line"> And they came into the shop and wanted to know if she had any sharp knives because we&#039;ll</div><div id="00:04:18.420" class="transcript_line"> get the so-and-so&#039;s.</div><div id="00:04:20.580" class="transcript_line"> They were going out to the Far East.</div><div id="00:04:22.660" class="transcript_line"> They were stationed.</div><div id="00:04:23.660" class="transcript_line"> And she sold them, the knives.</div><div id="00:04:25.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yeah, she sold whatever she had.</div><div id="00:04:29.580" class="transcript_line"> She was glad to get rid of them, I think.</div><div id="00:04:33.780" class="transcript_line"> What else was?</div><div id="00:04:35.180" class="transcript_line"> You had, your mother had quite a busy wartime.</div><div id="00:04:38.980" class="transcript_line"> There were other memories?</div><div id="00:04:40.820" class="transcript_line"> And the other, yes, well, so then talking about the being, because I was born in, over</div><div id="00:04:46.700" class="transcript_line"> the shop, as it were, the house was, she obviously...</div><div id="00:04:51.140" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, I stopped the tape for a moment.</div><div id="00:04:53.820" class="transcript_line"> And Wendy&#039;s going to continue.</div><div id="00:04:56.100" class="transcript_line"> Just to say that a family came from London and lived in our house during the war.</div><div id="00:05:03.380" class="transcript_line"> Evacuees.</div><div id="00:05:04.380" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose you&#039;d call them evacuees, but yes, it was a family.</div><div id="00:05:09.540" class="transcript_line"> It was instead of having soldiers, I suppose, because otherwise we&#039;d have had soldiers living</div><div id="00:05:14.380" class="transcript_line"> in it.</div><div id="00:05:15.380" class="transcript_line"> And it was a very nice bungalow in Borthogest.</div><div id="00:05:21.140" class="transcript_line"> So thank you, Wendy.</div><div id="00:05:22.140" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for your wonderful memories of the war and your mother&#039;s war as well.</div><div id="00:05:27.780" class="transcript_line"> So did she survive it all and the antique shop stayed open after the war?</div><div id="00:05:33.780" class="transcript_line"> Indeed, yes, until 1950s.</div><div id="00:05:35.980" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was lovely.</div><div id="00:05:37.980" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much.</div><div id="00:05:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for doing that.</div></div></p>
