You used to see the red squirrels on the way home from school.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There were those things that I think we remembered more.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to remember things like Christmas in the school.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Mrs Phillips used to bring along her little bag of one shilling coins to give us all.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The other thing we had in the village was a youth club organized by the vicar.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> In most places, in most communities, the youth club was a facility to get people off the streets.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Youth club in the Abbey was the night when everybody came down to the village and messed around outside of the hall more than the events that the vicar was trying to get us involved with.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the old Phillips hall then.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a good time.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned the Abbey, Abbey Kimhir Hall and Mrs Phillips bringing the Christmas treats down to the school.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there any other relationships or memories from the hall?</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> When the Fenners took it over, it was immediately after or one after the Phillips left.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the Fenner family. Martin Fenner was in school with us at that time.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go and play in the hall and kind of have brilliant times running around this stairway.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go down one stairway, round and down another one and things like that.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to mess around there.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things we used to do in the summer, particularly in youth club night, was to have little raids over the wall into the garden.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> At the time, the garden used to have its aspelliary apples and things like that and plums on the wall on the inside.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a little bit naughty.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was things like that really that kept us amused.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose when you&#039;re very young, big events tend to pass you by a little bit.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the village centre was different a little bit.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> At the time, the big conch trees were still there.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one big one right on the bend.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Just next to the pub there.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there was another one.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I think you can still see this big stump of it.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a big white stump at the entrance to Owen Farm.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> You can see a massive tree stump.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pretty sure that must still be the old very large chestnut tree that was there.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Then obviously, a couple of years ago, the current owners of the hall took the big sequoias, the big valentonias, those massive trees.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> There were two or three big trees growing just by the entrance.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> As you&#039;re facing the church, there&#039;s an entrance going in for the hall at the bottom.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> On the right-hand side there, there were two or three massive trees, very, very tall.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They got the spongy bark that you can punch.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very good.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We also, I suppose a bit later on, particularly the lads from Home Farm had got an Austin 7 car, which they modified to be able to take in the building.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They shortened the wheelbase, made it narrower and shorter.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They stripped the body off and put a box on the back so they could clean out the buildings, I think was the original plan.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It was horrendous really, because we used to take it out on the forestry roads and wander around the forestry roads with it.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Really, you sat on the petrol tank of it, and it&#039;s still in front of you.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Was this Mellie and his brother?</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was Colin at the time and Mell, I think.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But Mellie probably remembers his little Austin 7 that they used to rent.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We also, somebody gave us, I think it was some, Tom Griffith from Compoi, gave us his motorbike.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t really have bicycles at home for some reason.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But when it was slightly older, we had this motorbike that we used to mess around again on the forest roads, around because you didn&#039;t have to worry about licenses and things like that.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a bit of a wreck as well.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember at the end, the cable on the accelerator for it had come off and it was screwed to the lid of the petrol tank for you to adjust the speed.</div></div></p>
