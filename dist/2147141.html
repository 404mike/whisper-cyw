What did you do?</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Human beings.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Flowers.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Natural things.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> River, tree.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I learned painting.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I don&#039;t have any practice.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be that good.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to love glass painting.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to love embroidery, knitting, crochet.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in those days there wasn&#039;t anything ready made.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to make our bed sheets with embroidery, with the flowers.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my hobbies.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And can you... Discipline.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I just want to talk about also discipline.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Pardon?</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Discipline.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very, very disciplined people.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> My father, especially like I said, he wouldn&#039;t let me waste my time.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He was such a lovely father.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He never touched me.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But I knew how far I can go.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And without their permission though,</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> my mother was a very simple woman.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Not simple in that way, but a very easy going person.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But we did have respect.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Respect for our elder people.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And still I&#039;m teaching my children the same.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> In the street, wherever we live, they can&#039;t call anybody by the name.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> When I first came here, people used to call me Mrs. Khan, Mrs. Khan.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t understand that because in our culture you call everybody auntie or uncle.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So this type of discipline, not going out after 7 o&#039;clock, staying home,</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t give a setback, respect your elder, whatever they say, obey it.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the lifestyle.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I appreciate it.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m in favour of that.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Though we are not having that now.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But life is changing.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Things are changing.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was very disciplined society at that time.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were just talking about it.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It teaches you respect, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It teaches you respect from being very, very young.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And you carry that respect everywhere you go.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And whatever you do, whether it&#039;s work, whether it&#039;s school, whether it&#039;s play, all of that.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s different now.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the same.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> How different is it now?</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> How different?</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> There is no tolerance.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there is no tolerance.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody is punching on you.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you are a human being, if you say something, you don&#039;t know how they will take it.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ve got to be trying to please everyone.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you think something is wrong, you can&#039;t say nothing.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Like in our society, if somebody from the next door neighbour, if they saw us,</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> we are doing something wrong, they come to us and say, listen, stop it now.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was enough for us.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But nowadays, I can&#039;t even say anything to my own children, children, because they don&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the difference.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They haven&#039;t got any tolerance, any patience.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They want everything according to their own wishes.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I agree.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You were speaking about how your family used to gather.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Joint family.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Joint family system.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> What kind of traditions and celebrations do you remember?</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It is, joint family system in one way, it is excellent.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But there are other difficulties as well.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came here.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, at home.</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> At home is different.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you speak about that please?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> At home is different because you are living in that system and you accept everything.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you are used to it.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> For example, if I&#039;m living with my uncle or aunties, they are more responsible than my parents towards me.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know if they are stopping me from something, it&#039;s actually their duty.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s my duty as well to respect their views.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the joint family system.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They care about us.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> For example, if mom and dad gone somewhere, they look after us.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother or my aunties, they are like our own mothers.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> There is no difference between your parents and your aunties.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I respect that.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But there are a few things that are unacceptable in the joint family system.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, not at that time, because I was little and I think it&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I think it&#039;s too much because one or two people are struggling to live in that society.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> To live in the joint family system, but they are forced to live there.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I wouldn&#039;t live on my own.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I find it very, because when I came here, my mother-in-law, my three sisters-in-law, my one brother-in-law,</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> we were nine or eight people in the same house.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I never feel any difference, but there was complication as well.</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Criticizing all the time, expecting you to do so much.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you are not capable, you are not feeling well, but you&#039;ve got to please them.</div><div id="00:14:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So there are good things and bad things about the joint family system.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But I liked it.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So what made you come to the UK?</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I married. My husband was my mother&#039;s first cousin.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I married to him.</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There was only three or four years difference.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was engaged to him when I was twelve years old.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I was twenty-five, he came here in 1960s, I think.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after fifteen years, he went back.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I finished all my education and everything, so I married him.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I came in 1975 to this country.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you study as well when you were here?</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Bristol Uni for a couple of courses because while I was working,</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a teacher and then I went for different courses to improve my qualification as well.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my qualification was from back home.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was one year course for approval of my qualification.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had done that. And then after that, I was a qualified teacher.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Before that, they were paying me unqualified status.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, I went for the study.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I taught in Nash College as well for two years, A level, Urdu.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So when did you come to Newport?</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came to Newport, 1975.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, okay. So you came straight to Newport.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Straight here and since then, I&#039;m still here.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I see, I see. So what was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> My parents. After my marriage, three years after my father passed away,</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> very young, because I think he was about 45 or something, he had breast cancer.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I couldn&#039;t go. After his death, I thought there is no point going now.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I called my mother. My mother was here, but she wasn&#039;t happy here.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So she stayed for a couple of months and then she went back.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, my friends, my status as well, because I was a lecturer back home.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I came here, I was just a housewife for 18 years.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The most thing which I missed, everybody knows me, Jimmy Khan&#039;s wife.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody knows me, who I was. And that was a very big shock for me.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Adnan&#039;s mom, Jimmy&#039;s wife, that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I went out. I started teaching and everything.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And now they recognize me by my own personality, my own name.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And my recognition was approved.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. How did you get here? Was it by sea or by air?</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you get into the UK? Was it by plane or by a bus?</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I came from Kabul by plane.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> You know how much was the ticket at that time? 80 pounds.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> 80 pounds was the ticket.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Return ticket 80 pounds.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So then what was the best thing about the journey?</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Only having my husband. Because I love my husband.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from that, I don&#039;t think I like anything here.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> At the beginning, now it&#039;s my home.</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a big shock. A casual shock.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Lifestyle, language, because it doesn&#039;t matter how educated you are,</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> but when you come here, the accent and the language was a barrier.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So it took a long time for me to achieve all this.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there something easy? What was the easiest thing to get used to when you were here?</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> At that time, I don&#039;t think, because you&#039;re young, you don&#039;t think like that.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I never thought of that, because I think I was much better over there.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Now it&#039;s different because my health is deteriorating and then I think,</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> oh, NHS is alright, the doctor&#039;s approach is alright, because Pakistan is getting worse.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Opposite now. So the difference is now.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But at that time, I don&#039;t think, no, personally, I wasn&#039;t happy when I came.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody to talk, nobody to share your experience.</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very lonely when I came here.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And because you are a man, it&#039;s different for you, but for a woman,</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> living with in-laws, it&#039;s a very hard job.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to sit in my room, in the window, and cry for hours and hours,</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> because there was nobody who can I talk to.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very, very difficult.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So at that time, no, I don&#039;t think I was impressed.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t communicate with my parents, because letter writing was,</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> it took 15 days from here to send a letter.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And if they give me answer on the spot, another 15 days.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So in one month, we received one letter, and sometime,</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> this letter disappeared during the posting.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was very hard, very hard. It wasn&#039;t easy.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Where in Newport did you live?</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Harrow Road.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But you know the mosque?</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So what started to help you getting used to the place around that time?</div><div id="00:21:20.000" class="transcript_line"> What was helping you?</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing. I was so naive, I didn&#039;t realize.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Nowadays, the girls come, they know everything, they go out.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought after the bridge, you know the Harrow Road bridge,</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> everything is finished.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Never go out, never talk to anybody, because the language communication.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I speak Pashto, and I speak Urdu, while the whole community, they are Punjabi speaker.</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So, and I was so scared to talk to them, because if I say something,</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> perhaps it will pass on to my in-laws, and they&#039;ll say, oh, you talk to them.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know if I&#039;m in trouble, where shall I go?</div><div id="00:22:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But God helped me during that time, because my husband was a very nice, good person,</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was like a pillar for me, a support.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t need anyone. I used to talk to him.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I know they were upside down, but nobody else was there.</div><div id="00:22:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And around that time, of course, because it&#039;s early, there&#039;s not that many services and things like that just yet.</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So then, as you started to get older, and you&#039;re studying,</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> this is when you were studying and getting your qualification, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> After you got your qualification, what did you do then, what happened?</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, when I underestimated myself for a long period,</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> when I applied for the job, teaching job, I thought I wouldn&#039;t be able to get it.</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was in 1992.</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But when they selected me, I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I got the job, and then I thought, oh, I won&#039;t be, because, again, the language, it was accent and everything.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, oh, it&#039;s very hard.</div><div id="00:23:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I told my husband, I said, I shouldn&#039;t be going for it.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, no, go on. And if you don&#039;t like it, you can quit.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first day I went, and after that, for 27 years, I was stuck there.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was highly qualified, because I had got my BA in psychology, history, and Urdu.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had done my master in Urdu. Then I had done my BA Bachelor of Education.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So, in my two years&#039; lecturership experience, everything.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But, again, it&#039;s low confidence, because living with the in-laws, they put me under everything.</div><div id="00:24:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t do nothing, you can&#039;t do nothing, you can&#039;t do nothing. And that was, I convinced myself.</div><div id="00:24:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But then, it&#039;s like, after I achieved whatever I wanted, I came off to the shelf slowly and gradually.</div><div id="00:24:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So, lots of confidence. But still, my husband was very, very, you can say, too much supportive.</div><div id="00:25:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He never let me face the reality of the life. Whatever I asked, oh, how you could do this?</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll do it for you.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was after he passed away nearly nine years now, eight years now.</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I realize I need so many things to know, which in his presence, I never tried.</div><div id="00:25:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he was doing everything for me. And my children are the same now. They are doing it for me. Mom will do it.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I think now I&#039;m learning more than before.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I ask about another friend? Who was your first friend? Besides your husband, of course. Who was your first friend?</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Here?</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry to say that. They are people, I know them. I can&#039;t call them friends.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Friends are those who are in bad or good. They are with you.</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I got these different groups and joining them, but I can&#039;t call them, you know, like in English word, yes, you can call them friend.</div><div id="00:26:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But our cultural background, I got only one friend, which is in Pakistan, and she lives a thousand miles away from me.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But if I call her, I need this, she&#039;ll say, okay. I call her a friend.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So, they are good people. We are meeting every day. We are joining our different celebrations and everything.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But those are the people, I know them, they know me. I&#039;m sorry, but I can&#039;t call them friends. Am I right or wrong?</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;re right.</div><div id="00:27:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, we can pass some time with them. I can understand that. But I can&#039;t call them when I need them.</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Or they can&#039;t call me when they need me. Perhaps it&#039;s me. Not them, they are openly, but I am so hesitant to go forward and say, oh, she&#039;s my friend, she&#039;ll do it for me.</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I still, I got, there is a reluctant, what if I ask for something and they deny? No, so the best thing is not to ask.</div><div id="00:28:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, because these small things which you think make you a friendship, no, I don&#039;t think so. Yes, they are nice people. They are good.</div><div id="00:28:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They are good. We are meeting each other every day. We are sharing our happiness. We are sharing our sorrows. But friend is something different.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my definition of a friendship. Perhaps I&#039;m very extremist.</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it makes sense. I think it makes sense. Yes.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Speaking about a friend at home. I can&#039;t trust anyone. That&#039;s the problem.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you keep in touch? Are you still in touch with your friend in Pakistan, of course?</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I, every other, you can say every 15 days, I ring her. And if she rang me, if she won&#039;t hear from me, she phoned me. So we are in contact.</div><div id="00:29:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ll give you one example. My husband passed away. We bought a house there in Pakistan. And there was installment given to him.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And she realized and she said, Jahan, now your husband is gone. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to come here and live here.</div><div id="00:29:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the point buying a house here? I said, yes, you&#039;re right. I said, what can I do? She said, don&#039;t worry.</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So she sold my house. She put the money on the side. When I went there, she said, here&#039;s your house money. You can keep it.</div><div id="00:29:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can call a best friend there. Otherwise I&#039;d be lumbered up with all that.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to have accounts there. She closed every account. She said, look, we are the same age. I don&#039;t know how long I will live.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want after me that you&#039;ll have problem. She got one daughter and she said, here&#039;s your money, here&#039;s your only account, every detail. She said, that&#039;s yours.</div><div id="00:30:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So after finding a friend like that, then you&#039;re comparing with others. It&#039;s not the same. So we are in touch all the time.</div><div id="00:30:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the fifth class, which is, I think, about 10 years old. And we are friends up to now.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why that makes sense. It makes a lot of sense.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> If we can talk about traditions, is there any traditions that you&#039;ve kept here while you&#039;re here?</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Preserved, are there traditions that you&#039;ve made an effort to make sure they stay with you and you share with the younger generation, with your kids as well?</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There are lots of traditions, but I think it&#039;s very hard to keep them.</div><div id="00:31:09.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was young, my problem is I&#039;m very open. I won&#039;t say anything which does not comply with my lifestyle.</div><div id="00:31:27.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was young, I used to respect all the traditions, everything. But now, by the passing of time, the children are growing.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s very hard. It is very hard because sometimes I think other Asian people won&#039;t agree with that.</div><div id="00:31:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s very hard to force my children to my old tradition.</div><div id="00:32:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d love to ask them to follow it, but if they can&#039;t, because they haven&#039;t seen that culture, they haven&#039;t seen that society,</div><div id="00:32:21.000" class="transcript_line"> expecting from them to behave in that way is very hard.</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So, for example, mixed marriages, whether you call it racist or bias or whatever it is, it&#039;s very hard.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But now is the time you&#039;ve got to accept it. You can do nothing.</div><div id="00:32:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I would like to be very religious. Some people are lucky. They can do it.</div><div id="00:32:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s imposing on them. It&#039;s not working or forcing them to accept something which they are not familiar with.</div><div id="00:33:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Religion is alright, but other things. And I don&#039;t think I&#039;m that traditional person. I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:33:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you have to change with the time, with the situation.</div><div id="00:33:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So apart from that, it&#039;s only like Eid or our religious things, Ramazan. I follow them, and I&#039;m a good example.</div><div id="00:33:43.000" class="transcript_line"> If they learn from me, yes. If they can&#039;t, I can&#039;t force them.</div><div id="00:33:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the more you&#039;re forcing someone, the more they start hating it, because they think that you are putting something on them which they don&#039;t like.</div><div id="00:34:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So giving them a good example and expecting that they will learn, respect for others, yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:34:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t stand any disrespect. I respect everyone and I want them to respect me.</div><div id="00:34:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So respect, respect the elder and respect your views, respect other people&#039;s views.</div><div id="00:34:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I think by the passing of time, I&#039;m changing a lot. I&#039;m learning, we&#039;ve got to do this, we&#039;ve got to do this.</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you talk about Eid or Ramazan or celebrations at home when you were younger?</div><div id="00:34:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s different. It&#039;s lovely over there, yes.</div><div id="00:34:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because over there, if it&#039;s Ramazan, even in Pakistan, different parts are celebrating in different ways.</div><div id="00:35:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Like in Punjab, they openly eat everything if they are not fasting.</div><div id="00:35:12.000" class="transcript_line"> In Peshawar, for 30 days, they don&#039;t open the shops. The shops are closed.</div><div id="00:35:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you&#039;ve got a child in the house and if he&#039;s hungry, you can&#039;t go to the shop and you can&#039;t buy anything.</div><div id="00:35:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they know it&#039;s Ramazan and you shouldn&#039;t be coming out for the food.</div><div id="00:35:34.000" class="transcript_line"> While in Punjab, they are not that strict.</div><div id="00:35:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think, especially in our area, they are very strict.</div><div id="00:35:49.000" class="transcript_line"> In Ramazan, each celebration is you are going to your uncle, auntie&#039;s houses, different colored clothes.</div><div id="00:35:58.000" class="transcript_line"> If you wear different colored clothes here outside, everybody will be looking at you, but you&#039;re wrong.</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So yes, it&#039;s more interesting, more beautiful way of celebrating.</div><div id="00:36:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But now we are doing it here as well. Like we had recently in Coffee and Love, we had a lovely party, Eid party.</div><div id="00:36:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There in Cardiff, they are celebrating Eid Mela. So, yes.</div><div id="00:36:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like in your grandmother&#039;s house as well?</div><div id="00:36:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like in your grandmother&#039;s house in celebrations or when your aunties used to come over and when your uncles used to come over?</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In Ramazan, actually, we are up before the dawn and we eat whatever we like.</div><div id="00:36:50.000" class="transcript_line"> For example, nowadays the children are more modern. They are having porridge or vita biks.</div><div id="00:36:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But in Pakistan, you make paratha, which is flat bread with butter in it and all this heavy food, which they don&#039;t eat.</div><div id="00:37:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Fruit, tea, coffee, light breakfast.</div><div id="00:37:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because if you do your breakfast, then you won&#039;t be able to sleep or anything.</div><div id="00:37:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So then is the Fajr Namaz, pray, first pray. After that, we don&#039;t eat anything till the dusk, you can say, until the sun sets.</div><div id="00:37:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, if you look at it, Ramazan means a simple lifestyle.</div><div id="00:37:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But we are making a feast out of it, like making picores and making kebabs and this and that.</div><div id="00:37:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, it&#039;s not that. You should have something simple, food, which you can digest properly.</div><div id="00:38:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So in my house, when they were young, I used to do everything. But now, it&#039;s only me and my daughter. We are living together.</div><div id="00:38:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not fasting because I&#039;m diabetic, insulin dependent. And she is fasting.</div><div id="00:38:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So she wakes up in the morning, she had breakfast, whatever, a piece of bread and cup of tea.</div><div id="00:38:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the night, just whatever is ready, she cooks, she eats that.</div><div id="00:38:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But some people, where they got little children or big family, they got a big feast.</div><div id="00:38:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the way they celebrate their Ramazan.</div><div id="00:38:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t mean that they eat less, but they eat so much and then they end up in the bed.</div><div id="00:38:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But five times pray is essential for Ramazan.</div><div id="00:38:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They eat so much that they are unable to pray.</div><div id="00:39:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Not necessarily about Ramadan, but mostly about Pathan and about Pakistan.</div><div id="00:39:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember the music? What was the music like growing up when you were younger?</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to listen to the music and my music was on a big blast in my room.</div><div id="00:39:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And people next door, they were, come on, turn it down, turn it down. I was young, I never realized that.</div><div id="00:39:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s all Indian music, Pakistani music, razzle, lovely music.</div><div id="00:39:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the instrument, it&#039;s the wording.</div><div id="00:39:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I always liked the wording, the poetry, good poetry.</div><div id="00:39:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So this type of music I liked.</div><div id="00:39:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And our Pathan, they got their traditional music.</div><div id="00:39:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That is something different with the Dhaaf and Dholki.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a two-sided drum type thing.</div><div id="00:40:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So colorful clothes and...</div><div id="00:40:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re singing like a Thondule?</div><div id="00:40:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Dholki we call it Dholak.</div><div id="00:40:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So then has it changed? Has music changed now?</div><div id="00:40:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so. But in those days, every hotel, they got gramophone,</div><div id="00:40:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and with a full blast gramophone, industry, everything.</div><div id="00:40:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I notice there&#039;s change now. They won&#039;t do that now. I don&#039;t know why.</div><div id="00:40:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But have they got the television?</div><div id="00:40:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So instead of listening to the music, they are more interested in watching the television. Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Just this last section now.</div><div id="00:40:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you kept any kind of family heirlooms, family photographs or ornaments?</div><div id="00:41:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Have we got them?</div><div id="00:41:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, have you kept any?</div><div id="00:41:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Not few, very little number of photographs yet.</div><div id="00:41:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in those days, camera was very expensive.</div><div id="00:41:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go to the studio.</div><div id="00:41:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Five rupees, which is I think 0.5,</div><div id="00:41:24.000" class="transcript_line"> pence you can say.</div><div id="00:41:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And all these in the front of the photograph are like this, or like holding your hand.</div><div id="00:41:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I got few. Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Why are they important to you?</div><div id="00:41:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because those are my parents.</div><div id="00:41:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my dad&#039;s photo.</div><div id="00:41:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my mom&#039;s photograph.</div><div id="00:41:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my uncle and auntie&#039;s.</div><div id="00:41:52.000" class="transcript_line"> My childhood photograph, when I was 12 I think.</div><div id="00:41:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s emotional.</div><div id="00:42:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Are we okay to use them as part of the People&#039;s Collection as well?</div><div id="00:42:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there any?</div><div id="00:42:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in my album.</div><div id="00:42:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, if you&#039;re able to bring some or arrange a time that we can take photos of them and use them as part of the...</div><div id="00:42:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, no problem.</div><div id="00:42:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:42:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then is there anything else you&#039;d like to share at all?</div><div id="00:42:18.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s lovely questions.</div><div id="00:42:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It reminds me a lot of things.</div><div id="00:42:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And good memories.</div><div id="00:42:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:42:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:42:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.
