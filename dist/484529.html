Cardiff Cardinal 25th anniversary</div><div id="00:00:06.160" class="transcript_line"> project. Interviewer Steve Fletcher. The venue is the Swicker office and the date</div><div id="00:00:13.980" class="transcript_line"> is Wednesday the 12th of... 12th... 13th. 13th of November. Interviewer E Graham Hogg</div><div id="00:00:25.560" class="transcript_line"> better known as Hoggy. Graham, could you spell your name for the record please?</div><div id="00:00:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Well Hoggy is H-O-W-G-E but my yeah Graham is G-R-A-E-M-E. It&#039;s Graham Hogg.</div><div id="00:00:38.480" class="transcript_line"> Graham Hogg. So... Graham Hogg is a Scots. So Hoggy, how did you first get into Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Carnival? Well... How did I first get into Carnival? Well I suppose I was... I got into... I&#039;m a stilt</div><div id="00:00:57.740" class="transcript_line"> walker and most of my contact with Cardiff Carnival has been as a stilt performer,</div><div id="00:01:03.320" class="transcript_line"> dancer, whatever. And I went to Bristol to study circus in the late 80s and I...</div><div id="00:01:17.380" class="transcript_line"> in the 80s there&#039;s like a big kind of like weird alternative circus scene sort of</div><div id="00:01:22.180" class="transcript_line"> kicking off. A lot of connections with travellers and things like travellers were</div><div id="00:01:26.380" class="transcript_line"> painting their buses and becoming circuses and in that era full-time was</div><div id="00:01:31.560" class="transcript_line"> non-accredited so it was much more independent, running their own courses,</div><div id="00:01:35.460" class="transcript_line"> their own kind of tutors and their own style of doing things and really good</div><div id="00:01:39.600" class="transcript_line"> mix. It was really good scene. It was in St Paul&#039;s and when I went there I know I</div><div id="00:01:43.620" class="transcript_line"> studied a bit of everything, bit of clowning and mass work, juggling and all these things</div><div id="00:01:48.820" class="transcript_line"> and no one was doing stilts at all. Literally the stilts were the wooden stilts</div><div id="00:01:53.540" class="transcript_line"> you held on there in the cupboard. No one was interested in them whatsoever and</div><div id="00:01:59.340" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been doing... I&#039;ve done some stilts actually previous to that when I lived in</div><div id="00:02:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Wales actually. I lived in Mid Wales and lived in in Hengindob Wells and there was a</div><div id="00:02:06.500" class="transcript_line"> street theatre group there called What the Dickens, called Chris Orenzella.</div><div id="00:02:09.960" class="transcript_line"> They still have a Dickens festival every year.</div><div id="00:02:13.520" class="transcript_line"> Well the Victorian festival, I lived in Hengindob Wells and that festival would</div><div id="00:02:17.240" class="transcript_line"> happen. I saw it like you know probably five years and I was just a you know a</div><div id="00:02:21.840" class="transcript_line"> bit of a dropout, a bit of a dope smoking dreadlocks. I didn&#039;t really have much</div><div id="00:02:26.920" class="transcript_line"> interest in performance and enjoying What the Dickens, learned stilts and</div><div id="00:02:30.440" class="transcript_line"> then developed this kind of you know appetite for street</div><div id="00:02:34.600" class="transcript_line"> performance and saw a lot of performers at that festival, actually good staff, people like</div><div id="00:02:37.920" class="transcript_line"> Dave Sullivan and that who was really good still walk and classic old-school</div><div id="00:02:41.720" class="transcript_line"> kind of proper street busker. Very limited skills, very basic</div><div id="00:02:46.160" class="transcript_line"> show but he had the whole way of getting a big crowd around and you know</div><div id="00:02:50.120" class="transcript_line"> generating a sort of pattern for the crowd which is a kind of formula with what</div><div id="00:02:53.040" class="transcript_line"> street stuff follows really and has followed since. So anyway, so Kenzie</div><div id="00:02:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Bristol, loads of circus going off, everyone wanting to do trapeze, everyone</div><div id="00:03:01.200" class="transcript_line"> juggling but no one was doing stilts and so I was kind of interested in stilts and</div><div id="00:03:05.760" class="transcript_line"> then I bumped into this other guy Kevin who people said to me, oh Kev&#039;s into stilts, you know she</div><div id="00:03:10.640" class="transcript_line"> woke up with him. So we sort of met, talked and stuff. This is Kevin Dennis.</div><div id="00:03:16.520" class="transcript_line"> So this is Kevin Dennis, yeah from Hoggy and Kev. Kevin Hoggy, usually Kevin Hoggy isn&#039;t it.</div><div id="00:03:23.280" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so then I remember Kev saying oh there&#039;s this performance in the</div><div id="00:03:29.320" class="transcript_line"> centre of town that&#039;s they call it Stilt Walkers, they&#039;re interested in doing it</div><div id="00:03:33.840" class="transcript_line"> and I said yeah, yeah okay let&#039;s go. So we went to the Onfini on the quayside there in the centre of town</div><div id="00:03:38.880" class="transcript_line"> and it was an artist called Keith Kahn who was designing this big sort of carnival</div><div id="00:03:45.560" class="transcript_line"> performance thing, flying costumes, flying costumes flying to him,</div><div id="00:03:49.520" class="transcript_line"> something that I can&#039;t remember. You probably remember more about it. You say you were there.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No I saw it, it was a huge outdoor, multimedia outdoor celebration in the Lois Antitheter with an audience of about</div><div id="00:04:02.640" class="transcript_line"> 4-5,000 people. Yeah, I remember the two, they&#039;re two like king cranes to hold the sort of these flying things</div><div id="00:04:09.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah which were hanging on either side. So me and Kev, so no one else came, just me and Kev</div><div id="00:04:14.640" class="transcript_line"> at this kind of audition. Keith was there and I think he was a stilt walker I think. It danced up on stilts</div><div id="00:04:21.040" class="transcript_line"> and he had these kind of black, tall thin black costumes. It was like essentially a skirt, a long skirt</div><div id="00:04:26.120" class="transcript_line"> from your waist down to the bottom of the stilts and then a burka over the top. So it was a burka, no arms</div><div id="00:04:30.440" class="transcript_line"> or anything, no sleeves. And we devised this sort of step, this kind of slow motion rocking step in the</div><div id="00:04:38.200" class="transcript_line"> in the Arnolfini Theatre that he liked. He said okay I want you two to wear these black costumes and come on</div><div id="00:04:43.160" class="transcript_line"> from stage right so it&#039;s the audience&#039;s left at a certain point during the show. What did you represent?</div><div id="00:04:49.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I guess they were female characters, burkas. But I remember a lot of people</div><div id="00:04:54.760" class="transcript_line"> really remembered that moment, a lot of people that it really impacted with them mostly when</div><div id="00:04:59.560" class="transcript_line"> everything goes quiet and then these two figures kind of come rocking on and go across stage.</div><div id="00:05:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Years and years later we looked through the Arnolfini&#039;s archive and there was a photo</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> documentation of it and stuff in their archive and things you know, tracked it down. I didn&#039;t get any</div><div id="00:05:12.840" class="transcript_line"> copies of stuff but um so that was the first time I&#039;d done stuff. I&#039;d sort of seen suddenly how</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> stilts could potentially had for kind of outdoor visual impact you know because you&#039;re high up</div><div id="00:05:27.560" class="transcript_line"> and everyone can see you and then all those things. So I kind of got a sense of it. So I</div><div id="00:05:30.520" class="transcript_line"> remember going back to the Arnolfini bar with Kevin and showing him all these drawings and</div><div id="00:05:34.200" class="transcript_line"> sketches that I&#039;d made of kind of stilt ideas, stilt costumes. The weird thing was I was thinking</div><div id="00:05:38.760" class="transcript_line"> about the other day is looking back on them they were all pretty cheesy actually, all like really</div><div id="00:05:42.600" class="transcript_line"> quite daft, things like people on top of toad stools and things like fake legs and things.</div><div id="00:05:47.640" class="transcript_line"> Pretty awful most of them actually and in a way they were kind of like a premonition of like the</div><div id="00:05:53.080" class="transcript_line"> walkabout industry really that sort of that fired off like 10 years later.</div><div id="00:05:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I mean I watched some of these they just they&#039;re kind of cheesy costumes. Me and Kev,</div><div id="00:06:04.520" class="transcript_line"> so we started our working relationship there and then Kev disappeared to France and work in</div><div id="00:06:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Malibu and he came back and we did a St Paul&#039;s. He came back and we&#039;d started doing stuff with</div><div id="00:06:17.240" class="transcript_line"> Bristol School of Samba as stilt dancers, me and Kev.</div><div id="00:06:23.720" class="transcript_line"> No we weren&#039;t because we did a St Paul&#039;s carnival in Bristol</div><div id="00:06:29.320" class="transcript_line"> and we went to the mass camp which is like in the Albany Centre at the time.</div><div id="00:06:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Alan May was around.</div><div id="00:06:38.360" class="transcript_line"> Garfield was the other guy that was in St Paul&#039;s then.</div><div id="00:06:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Samo, Samba wasn&#039;t playing.</div><div id="00:06:42.840" class="transcript_line"> No, but Bristol were then one of the sort of top Samba groups.</div><div id="00:06:46.840" class="transcript_line"> There was only a few then.</div><div id="00:06:47.640" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t they perform on the back of a lorry because they do that in St Paul&#039;s, it drives me nuts.</div><div id="00:06:51.880" class="transcript_line"> There were, yeah St Paul&#039;s did have lorries. Now it&#039;s all gone sort of like you know electric</div><div id="00:06:56.520" class="transcript_line"> carts and things it&#039;s kind of like portable sound system and stuff and but then it was a lot of</div><div id="00:07:01.480" class="transcript_line"> lorries and sound systems and lorries and things yeah. So we did this, so we remember we had quite</div><div id="00:07:07.080" class="transcript_line"> a few kids from sub-school and we sort of you know we made some stilts we taught them and we</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> had to design kind of you know eight costumes and that&#039;s when I came out with this kind of</div><div id="00:07:16.040" class="transcript_line"> headdress thing on the beak. So it&#039;s four bits of rattan cane bent over to a beak sort of taped</div><div id="00:07:21.800" class="transcript_line"> together. Other bits of put inside like a wire framework and then you just basically colour the</div><div id="00:07:28.120" class="transcript_line"> sticks so you don&#039;t make any sides or you don&#039;t make it solid. It&#039;s just you know ribbon colours</div><div id="00:07:34.520" class="transcript_line"> the sticks tassels at the back some eyes and then it sits on top of your head and it and the way</div><div id="00:07:39.400" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s designed was it was going to rat a square hole that you put your round head in. So for years</div><div id="00:07:46.360" class="transcript_line"> after designing that headdress that would give me like chronic every time I played the zombie</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> zombie character it would give me like sort of chronic headache because of this awkward fit.</div><div id="00:07:56.200" class="transcript_line"> So we went through like a long you know quite a few years of doing it as a kind of a ritual it</div><div id="00:08:00.360" class="transcript_line"> would be like it was a pain thresh we had to go through you had to get the headache you had to</div><div id="00:08:03.720" class="transcript_line"> kind of go beyond it you had to kind of trance trance out into the so that was with the jumbies</div><div id="00:08:09.240" class="transcript_line"> the jumbies were of course the jumbie of course is a moco jumbie so moco jumbie is the</div><div id="00:08:14.280" class="transcript_line"> rresti indian trinidadian or rresti indian kind of striped man character on stilts moco jumbie.</div><div id="00:08:21.800" class="transcript_line"> So we whilst we&#039;re developing these headdresses you know they&#039;re kind of like they became bird</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> characters and they&#039;re very portable costumes so you could have them take the headdress off</div><div id="00:08:29.080" class="transcript_line"> stuff it with a bit of ripstop tassels on your feet that go in your bag the wings with like</div><div id="00:08:33.960" class="transcript_line"> bamboo sticks with you know feathers underneath roll up going stilts. I remember you used to come</div><div id="00:08:38.040" class="transcript_line"> over on the train and have a meeting. Yeah we neither me nor Kev ever drove so we we just went</div><div id="00:08:43.160" class="transcript_line"> everywhere and bus yeah so that was our style was to have like very minimal costumes or things that</div><div id="00:08:48.840" class="transcript_line"> we could build and we went to places so we could design stuff out of cardboard or other types of</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> materials and stuff you know so that so we did st paul&#039;s which was okay I was still very green</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> then and and kev had done malabar and stuff so he knew how to really come up with that.</div><div id="00:09:03.400" class="transcript_line"> Well malabar he went off so malabar i think was one of the big big outdoor french street</div><div id="00:09:08.040" class="transcript_line"> street companies you know based in um the southern town you know the southern um</div><div id="00:09:16.360" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s it called Montpellier yeah Montpellier in Montpellier um and they you know they you know</div><div id="00:09:22.920" class="transcript_line"> they did things that like huge big they&#039;re big fire and water fire and ice show thing involved</div><div id="00:09:27.880" class="transcript_line"> like these two massive big processions that have started independently of each other so the reds</div><div id="00:09:33.160" class="transcript_line"> and the blacks all start off in some square somewhere the big crowd gathers and then they</div><div id="00:09:36.360" class="transcript_line"> they start parading but then in a different part of town there&#039;s this big white encampment with all</div><div id="00:09:42.360" class="transcript_line"> the white characters and stuff you know and they kind of do like a little parade around a square</div><div id="00:09:46.040" class="transcript_line"> and then the reds invade and then with the ship and this is huge you know I know it&#039;s all photos</div><div id="00:09:50.440" class="transcript_line"> yeah huge amount of pyrotechnics all all strapped onto their stilts and things you know</div><div id="00:09:54.600" class="transcript_line"> let them off as they go around firecrackers let off germs on their stilts you know throw</div><div id="00:09:58.680" class="transcript_line"> fireworks at each other and stuff you know it was crazy so when he came back from that all kind of</div><div id="00:10:02.840" class="transcript_line"> fired up and had a lot of ideas about what he wanted to do you know so i was still quite agreeing</div><div id="00:10:05.960" class="transcript_line"> when we did the first st paul&#039;s carnival um but then so we did that and then sam bristol sam said</div><div id="00:10:14.600" class="transcript_line"> oh we&#039;ve done this kind this carnival in cardiff so you should come up for that so that&#039;s when we</div><div id="00:10:20.600" class="transcript_line"> that was the columbus that was 1993 yeah that was the first time we were involved in in cardiff</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> when we were yeah we were the sort of wings yeah so it&#039;s sort of you know quite brightly coloured</div><div id="00:10:34.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah quite brightly coloured but we had that thing as well where we weren&#039;t really you know</div><div id="00:10:38.520" class="transcript_line"> we were kind of we just came with bristol so we were sort of we realized it was sort of crashing</div><div id="00:10:42.440" class="transcript_line"> the party a little bit you know we weren&#039;t sure whether you know there was a permission thing and</div><div id="00:10:45.720" class="transcript_line"> whether we could where we could go and not go and stuff um and so yeah we just did the thing where</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> you run a crowd you can go to the front and run at crowds and really sort of stir things up</div><div id="00:10:55.240" class="transcript_line"> on the street and have that kind of freedom of movement leading craze and sort of being</div><div id="00:10:58.520" class="transcript_line"> pathfinders and yeah so yeah pioneers they&#039;re out there front sort of you know john the baptist</div><div id="00:11:04.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah here comes the parade yeah and good at clearing crowds and we&#039;ve done you know we&#039;ve done</div><div id="00:11:09.720" class="transcript_line"> by that time we were both quite confident i suppose already you know we&#039;ve done glass</div><div id="00:11:13.240" class="transcript_line"> for me a few times and we felt you know sort of quite accomplished in our in our ability because</div><div id="00:11:17.320" class="transcript_line"> like i said about you know the circus scene no one was doing them you see no one was doing stilts at</div><div id="00:11:22.120" class="transcript_line"> all they just weren&#039;t interested in them it didn&#039;t and our thing about stilts was that we didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:11:26.760" class="transcript_line"> see them as a circus skill like that was street performance yeah they we were both aware after</div><div id="00:11:31.880" class="transcript_line"> we looked into quite quickly that they were not they just didn&#039;t fit really in the world of circus</div><div id="00:11:36.920" class="transcript_line"> you did have the guys with stripy trousers you know you did have circus families</div><div id="00:11:40.600" class="transcript_line"> who would all walk in sort of 10 foot stills ever but for us it was like well actually these</div><div id="00:11:44.840" class="transcript_line"> are these are something else completely different these these belong in some other context yeah um</div><div id="00:11:49.560" class="transcript_line"> so once we could did a couple of carnivals we thought you know actually carnival is really</div><div id="00:11:52.840" class="transcript_line"> an interesting context for them to be and you know yeah because you&#039;ve got like the visual impact of</div><div id="00:11:57.160" class="transcript_line"> the the costumes and things and the whole form of the parade and as a giant big piece of theatre</div><div id="00:12:03.880" class="transcript_line"> you know so that appealed to us much more still walking traditions in carnivals throughout the</div><div id="00:12:08.520" class="transcript_line"> world yeah that&#039;s where they appear yeah yeah um so yeah we became interested in that and we for</div><div id="00:12:14.120" class="transcript_line"> us it was a perfect kind of platform for sort of devising our ideas and developing our</div><div id="00:12:19.080" class="transcript_line"> our approach to all the stuff we did on on stills you know i mean in a way like you know the card</div><div id="00:12:25.640" class="transcript_line"> the card if the carnivals are probably the the only paid gigs we ever did we kept working together</div><div id="00:12:31.800" class="transcript_line"> the rest of the time we you know we would literally make up a costume for an event or</div><div id="00:12:38.440" class="transcript_line"> person would do it once and that was it we you know and this is before the whole walkabout</div><div id="00:12:41.960" class="transcript_line"> industry really kicked off and so we felt like we were kind of like quite we were not any you know</div><div id="00:12:46.600" class="transcript_line"> we were kind of pathfinders in another sense then as well kind of going right ahead a lot of ideas</div><div id="00:12:51.800" class="transcript_line"> were taken and used by other people later on who took you know massive commercial like the high</div><div id="00:12:55.720" class="transcript_line"> wise high wise rubber all those guys that was a direct copy i think of an early thing that me and</div><div id="00:13:00.440" class="transcript_line"> kev did this kind of thing or gactic where we we use rats rat and cane with bin liners over the</div><div id="00:13:06.520" class="transcript_line"> top and if you heat if you heat bin liners um plastic bin liners with um you know like a</div><div id="00:13:13.160" class="transcript_line"> heat gun and it shrinks and becomes like a skin you can get it really tight over forms and stuff</div><div id="00:13:17.960" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s super light so we&#039;d you know literally we could travel around and just make things out of</div><div id="00:13:22.840" class="transcript_line"> wire frames and then use bin line and then create these big wings and weird horns and things like</div><div id="00:13:26.760" class="transcript_line"> that you know we did like that when we traveled around and body paints as well i remember you</div><div id="00:13:29.720" class="transcript_line"> guys were very much into body paint yeah i mean yeah yeah body paint yeah i always hated body paint</div><div id="00:13:34.360" class="transcript_line"> actually weirdly enough and funny because kev kev was born in africa actually he&#039;s born in kenyon</div><div id="00:13:39.800" class="transcript_line"> and um so his skin he could he had this kind of smooth skin i always remember in dressing

and we said what you got in mind they</div><div id="00:15:12.360" class="transcript_line"> said well they just kind of want something like vultures or something so we we um design these</div><div id="00:15:17.080" class="transcript_line"> costumes that i was you know or even to this day i&#039;ve always been the things i&#039;ve most been happy</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> with in terms of my actual my own costume my own actual design for this costume we had a ratan</div><div id="00:15:25.800" class="transcript_line"> headdress it&#039;s like the jumbies but they they sat on top on your head so it&#039;s like a vulture&#039;s beak</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and then a big white ruff around the neck again just black black clothes but then with a backpack</div><div id="00:15:36.280" class="transcript_line"> that elevated the wings up only about a foot just above your head height because vultures have got</div><div id="00:15:39.880" class="transcript_line"> a thing where their heads are lower than their wings so if you look at pictures it&#039;s like um</div><div id="00:15:44.360" class="transcript_line"> back to backpack with with the wings attached up here and then the wings are sticks of bamboo</div><div id="00:15:49.800" class="transcript_line"> going out either side with sticks coming down that you then hold the wings up and i found like a</div><div id="00:15:56.600" class="transcript_line"> drawing of a condor eagle and then enlarged it up so scaled it up till it was like sort of 15</div><div id="00:16:03.560" class="transcript_line"> feet wide on and then drew it out on a single sheet of muslin wow so painted the feathers in</div><div id="00:16:08.600" class="transcript_line"> like pva with gaps in between painted it all black so it was like this exact bird frame that</div><div id="00:16:13.960" class="transcript_line"> just then was attached to the the thing and you could if you had the sticks up and you can move</div><div id="00:16:18.600" class="transcript_line"> it it was like incredibly mobile and if you let go of it just draped down the back so for stilt</div><div id="00:16:23.160" class="transcript_line"> walk it was just a dream would these be duro stilts or would these now they were always peg stilts</div><div id="00:16:27.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah we never we never worked in duro stilts duro stilts went out then in those early days</div><div id="00:16:31.640" class="transcript_line"> but when they did come out and then with the walkabout boom started and and people started</div><div id="00:16:36.120" class="transcript_line"> to kind of exploit the ability to stand still that was kind of yeah it&#039;s kind of game over for us</div><div id="00:16:42.200" class="transcript_line"> we never I mean I have worked on them recently constant motion really you seem to be yeah yeah</div><div id="00:16:47.800" class="transcript_line"> constant constant motion you&#039;re balancing you can use you can work much faster you can do</div><div id="00:16:52.120" class="transcript_line"> certain you know it&#039;s much greater range of moves and stuff yeah you can really run</div><div id="00:16:56.120" class="transcript_line"> I remember moves where you&#039;re using one leg and another leg yeah yeah you can hop on legs and</div><div id="00:17:01.480" class="transcript_line"> and hopping yes lots of one legs yeah bending forwards and holding it and</div><div id="00:17:05.480" class="transcript_line"> dual stilts by contrast it&#039;s literally just like standing on it it&#039;s like standing on a mini you</div><div id="00:17:09.160" class="transcript_line"> know kind of step that finding a super high wall to get stilted up or a van you&#039;re off another</div><div id="00:17:15.080" class="transcript_line"> roof of a van yeah with high enough stilts you did like a van or garage roof yeah usually like a bin</div><div id="00:17:19.400" class="transcript_line"> like a big great big wheelie bin with quite a good height you asked me the other day about high stilts</div><div id="00:17:24.760" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t really do much on high stilts 10 foot or two meters I think the highest we ever went up</div><div id="00:17:29.560" class="transcript_line"> to you know it&#039;s like walking in mud you know steps are much slower you know and it&#039;s quite scary</div><div id="00:17:34.360" class="transcript_line"> actually are quite scary so after 93 I think you take the sex through your other you know</div><div id="00:17:40.040" class="transcript_line"> carded carnival history well I mean when we when I think we I think we made a big impression on you</div><div id="00:17:44.920" class="transcript_line"> when we did the columbus thing because I remember I fell in love with the John B&#039;s I&#039;m the first to admit</div><div id="00:17:49.080" class="transcript_line"> it was really good to get that kind of reception and something we understood the</div><div id="00:17:52.280" class="transcript_line"> the whole street parade thing and um so I in my memory I remember that we kind of became we became</div><div id="00:17:58.200" class="transcript_line"> involved every year there for quite a few years yeah but it&#039;s been quite hard to sort of pin down</div><div id="00:18:02.360" class="transcript_line"> the dates I think the year after it I think I did but I definitely did um definitely did freedom</div><div id="00:18:07.160" class="transcript_line"> blues altogether um what costumes were playing and then well uh freedom blues that was when we</div><div id="00:18:15.160" class="transcript_line"> used cardboard and we sort of built a whole all the people that were going to be on stilts so I</div><div id="00:18:19.800" class="transcript_line"> guess we came up and and people signed up to do stills and then we did workshops and train you</div><div id="00:18:24.120" class="transcript_line"> know taught people and train them and yeah and had a capacity of um you know whatever half a dozen</div><div id="00:18:29.240" class="transcript_line"> to a dozen sort of still walkers and Reese would have been around at that time yeah Reese and Cora</div><div id="00:18:33.240" class="transcript_line"> is in that pictures as well Kevin&#039;s daughter yeah um Reese was really you know he was very young at</div><div id="00:18:39.240" class="transcript_line"> that time wasn&#039;t he yeah and he was super able he got up and he was running around you know he&#039;s</div><div id="00:18:43.240" class="transcript_line"> model student in a lot of ways and you were like beatboxers in cardboard yeah we sort of</div><div id="00:18:48.600" class="transcript_line"> and yeah I think we&#039;re sort of pastiche in youth culture we were trying to get Mickey out yeah</div><div id="00:18:53.880" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s right it was big big big records that we threw out yeah yeah I mean I sort of love</div><div id="00:19:00.760" class="transcript_line"> cannabis leaf sort of things and all hats and yeah things you know things like we sort of said shitty</div><div id="00:19:05.400" class="transcript_line"> sort of like stussy and this sort of stuff stussy but sort of shitty cardboard and uh kind of like</div><div id="00:19:11.720" class="transcript_line"> logos and graphics so yeah it&#039;s kind of maybe like sort of pastiche of sort of I think we got</div><div id="00:19:16.120" class="transcript_line"> we got a picture on one of the local papers here I think in front of the big museum in between the</div><div id="00:19:20.840" class="transcript_line"> columns and it said something like you know sort of self-mockery that youth culture sort of self</div><div id="00:19:24.840" class="transcript_line"> mocking itself you know so someone kind of got it in a nice friendly sort of way yeah yeah yeah</div><div id="00:19:30.280" class="transcript_line"> um that was really good fun it was very cartoonish I thought yeah because you know again it&#039;s that</div><div id="00:19:34.760" class="transcript_line"> thing about particularly for certain material just using like sheet cardboard yeah making</div><div id="00:19:38.680" class="transcript_line"> shorts and sort of solid costumes out of cardboard so a lightweight they&#039;re kind of you know disposable</div><div id="00:19:43.720" class="transcript_line"> you know</div><div id="00:19:57.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah so cardboard you know against that thing about having a simple</div><div id="00:20:00.680" class="transcript_line"> medium you&#039;re working with you know carbon what can you do with it you know</div><div id="00:20:04.280" class="transcript_line"> you may make some sort of pumps some big white pumps out of cardboard and</div><div id="00:20:09.160" class="transcript_line"> um so that was then so that was yeah that was freedom freedom blues and then also gaden</div><div id="00:20:15.800" class="transcript_line"> um and then we&#039;re doing a group as well where there was kids young kids who wanted different kind of car</div><div id="00:20:23.240" class="transcript_line"> related bits and bobs and costumes one one kid had like you wanted to be like sort of burst tire so</div><div id="00:20:29.080" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s in this kind of costume which is a tire all in shreds and stuff and quite young kiddy and another</div><div id="00:20:36.280" class="transcript_line"> guy had like a sort of coffin on his back it was like a speaker so it was like a coffin that was</div><div id="00:20:39.560" class="transcript_line"> on a backpack made out of like sheet um that printing aluminium sheet material would david</div><div id="00:20:45.960" class="transcript_line"> be in that one did he come across him was he was he the guy that was in the sammer band</div><div id="00:20:52.760" class="transcript_line"> yes that&#039;s right yeah he was around then he&#039;s one of the faces that I remember I remember him liking</div><div id="00:21:00.600" class="transcript_line"> him getting his own stilts and then being in the sound you know just being in the sammer group but</div><div id="00:21:04.280" class="transcript_line"> on stilts you know sort of taken to them so he was around then um so that was all together yeah</div><div id="00:21:09.880" class="transcript_line"> I remember I remember like having to spend so much time getting out of the people&#039;s costumes</div><div id="00:21:15.160" class="transcript_line"> ready for that one and I didn&#039;t know what I was going to do and then I actually in the end just</div><div id="00:21:18.840" class="transcript_line"> had like black and white stripes with four legs and my face was sort of like a crossings like a</div><div id="00:21:23.720" class="transcript_line"> zebra crossing but my I remember my my sort of my my like or black trousers sort of split</div><div id="00:21:29.720" class="transcript_line"> right by my balls so the whole that parade my balls just kind of hanging out</div><div id="00:21:37.320" class="transcript_line"> of this costume yeah hopefully no one spotted them it was never part of the design you know</div><div id="00:21:44.200" class="transcript_line"> um so yeah so when I yeah so when we&#039;ve looked at um images and stuff and it looks like I was</div><div id="00:21:48.520" class="transcript_line"> I was here for a few but um I guess it was such a big sort of time in my life I remember it being</div><div id="00:21:54.520" class="transcript_line"> much more I think Kevin Kevin carried on after me much more you know yes but so I only thought I</div><div id="00:21:59.240" class="transcript_line"> did a few I think I came filmed but you carried on a long tradition of a long journey in carnival</div><div id="00:22:05.160" class="transcript_line"> and and elsewhere was your next step after Cardiff Trinidad and Peter Minchel the guru of the mass</div><div id="00:22:13.080" class="transcript_line"> the masquerade yeah because I think we went I think to Trinidad 96 I think that was the year</div><div id="00:22:18.520" class="transcript_line"> we went so you could probably cross reference it for finding out what what year he did read um</div><div id="00:22:24.200" class="transcript_line"> but yeah we we got some money from I think Arts Council something those awards for all type things</div><div id="00:22:31.880" class="transcript_line"> sort of still at workshops and all these things we&#039;re trying to do in Bristol which you know we</div><div id="00:22:36.360" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t get together and we had a bit of money at the end of it a few thousand and I said to Kev</div><div id="00:22:40.200" class="transcript_line"> come let&#039;s just go you know let&#039;s we&#039;ve got contacts there we can get something to crash let&#039;s just go</div><div id="00:22:44.600" class="transcript_line"> and and try and be involved in it so and you say it was Maryanne Roberts who made the initial</div><div id="00:22:48.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think she made the connection see it she might have had a family home in um</div><div id="00:22:53.320" class="transcript_line"> port of Spain where we spent we did stay for one or two days and then she she sort of tried to get</div><div id="00:22:57.320" class="transcript_line"> us into the the Minchel camp basically in the into the mass camp what was that experience like being</div><div id="00:23:02.280" class="transcript_line"> part of yeah yeah it was pretty mind-blowing actually um looking back I mean it was I mean</div><div id="00:23:09.240" class="transcript_line"> I just remember spending the whole time in the shade I just remember never actually being out in</div><div id="00:23:13.320" class="transcript_line"> the sun because it was just so hot just too hot um when we got into the mass camp we sort of drive</div><div id="00:23:20.040" class="transcript_line"> out of town it&#039;s like this big sort of hangar airplane hangar military thing it was just</div><div id="00:23:24.360" class="transcript_line"> saving such a huge scale um they kind of knew we were still walkers but but to get to stay there</div><div id="00:23:32.360" class="transcript_line"> in the actual mass camp and just sort of literally crash crash out rough on the floor on the cardboard</div><div id="00:23:36.600" class="transcript_line"> and forward a sort of sheet over you get fed there sleep on the shelves sometimes yeah we found a</div><div id="00:23:41.320" class="transcript_line"> few places but then they were kind of they belonged to certain people so you&#039;d go out and</div><div id="00:23:45.080" class="transcript_line"> sort of sleep on the shelf and then you know after an hour someone would come in tapping</div><div id="00:23:49.960" class="transcript_line"> you know to get off got to get off their place and you know so we came lower in the packing order</div><div id="00:23:55.160" class="transcript_line"> there so it rose up through the ranks of costume assembling because the foreman who ran the place</div><div id="00:24:00.200" class="transcript_line"> Murph I think he sort of took us he liked us you know we&#039;re quite hard workers and</div><div id="00:24:04.920" class="transcript_line"> and actually were quite able so we can&#039;t start we ended up doing all these really fancy head</div><div id="00:24:08.440" class="transcript_line"> dresses and things and um and then we didn&#039;t really ever know what how whether we were going</div><div id="00:24:13.880" class="transcript_line"> to get to be in the parade you know because it&#039;s one of the things where we were sort of</div><div id="00:24:18.520" class="transcript_line"> hoping to sort of find a way of being involved in it but but every all the costumes are</div><div id="00:24:21.800" class="transcript_line"> prescriptive they&#039;re all designed and made and the people buy them you know and there might be</div><div id="00:24:25.800" class="transcript_line"> hundreds and hundreds of them but they&#039;re still designed and they&#039;re very particular as you know</div><div id="00:24:30.200" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like a very particular theme and that that year the theme was red and all the same red</div><div id="00:24:34.520" class="transcript_line"> and all these costumes at year were these kind of like characters of handbags and</div><div id="00:24:38.200" class="transcript_line"> royal sort of looking costumes and things you know gentlemen women and</div><div id="00:24:42.760" class="transcript_line"> nothing big at all no backpacks nothing like that just all really quite simple kind of ball almost</div><div id="00:24:48.520" class="transcript_line"> um sort of costumes and then sort of the day before we someone said oh um yeah Peter&#039;s he&#039;s</div><div id="00:24:55.080" class="transcript_line"> going to let you lead he&#039;s going to let you lead the parade and this is Peter Mitchell this is a</div><div id="00:25:00.120" class="transcript_line"> guru man who&#039;s well open to olympic games effectively yeah yeah so you&#039;re going to</div><div id="00:25:08.040" class="transcript_line"> lead Peter Mitchell&#039;s 1960 1996 that&#039;s extraordinary yeah and what were the costumes</div><div id="00:25:13.960" class="transcript_line"> how did the costumes arrive and then because so yeah i think we&#039;d i think we must have got up on</div><div id="00:25:18.920" class="transcript_line"> stilts during the the time we were there just to sort of show our skills off now we because they</div><div id="00:25:24.920" class="transcript_line"> had while we were there another little tangent actually is that there was a stilt group there</div><div id="00:25:30.360" class="transcript_line"> in in port of spain dragon&#039;s yard guy called dragon quite famous yeah yeah yeah and so marion</div><div id="00:25:36.440" class="transcript_line"> took us down to meet them and that was a big thing as well that was a big thing was dragons still</div><div id="00:25:41.080" class="transcript_line"> going i haven&#039;t heard about it i think i don&#039;t know i think kev&#039;s more you know kept in contact</div><div id="00:25:46.120" class="transcript_line"> with people they kept his eye on people they might have even come to europe at some point definitely</div><div id="00:25:49.480" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve been to liverpool yeah so we went down to that yard met him and and we sort of turned up</div><div id="00:25:55.080" class="transcript_line"> you know these kind of white boys with their kind of metal stilts you know all the kids were laughing</div><div id="00:25:58.280" class="transcript_line"> at us and that was amazing seeing them and they were these tiny little kids you know as high as</div><div id="00:26:02.760" class="transcript_line"> my kind of shoulders on on 10 foot stilts and doing some amazing moves and things it was quite</div><div id="00:26:08.280" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s that&#039;s that german photographer was out there at that time stephan and i have just written</div><div id="00:26:11.960" class="transcript_line"> it down moko juby&#039;s book we used to have a book here we were we were there when he was there and</div><div id="00:26:16.840" class="transcript_line"> he asked us i mean kev relishes this story more than me but there was this one shot when all the</div><div id="00:26:21.160" class="transcript_line"> kids are taking a rest yeah and they&#039;re all sitting on this huge wall of this i know the</div><div id="00:26:25.400" class="transcript_line"> photograph of which you speak and he asked us to not we were sitting down at the end and he asked</div><div id="00:26:29.800" class="transcript_line"> us to get out of the photo he asked us to step out of the way</div><div id="00:26:39.800" class="transcript_line"> so yeah we said it was nice to have that other little connection there what was the experience</div><div id="00:26:43.800" class="transcript_line"> on the day like i mean so coming back to the day so then they said oh yeah these costumes arrived</div><div id="00:26:47.560" class="transcript_line"> and they were literally just trousers long trousers and a long sleeve top with a little</div><div id="00:26:51.960" class="transcript_line"> red hat and that was kind of it you know that was it but but at the same time i think you know</div><div id="00:26:57.560" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s sometimes that&#039;s it isn&#039;t it you do less you do more with less you know you just have</div><div id="00:27:01.240" class="transcript_line"> something simple you know they&#039;re like jester sort of type thing so so yeah i mean um we sort</div><div id="00:27:06.680" class="transcript_line"> of assembled on the day of about 11 o&#039;clock and and like i said to the other day you know we did

class="transcript_line"> maximum energy all day which is a 12 hour day</div><div id="00:27:21.400" class="transcript_line"> so if i ever went back i still feel like i need to have one more go at it because you know</div><div id="00:27:25.560" class="transcript_line"> because i can still actually get up and stuff now and bust pretty good moves i think</div><div id="00:27:29.240"

festival that&#039;s right so we</div><div id="00:33:05.240" class="transcript_line"> actually designed these costumes and sent them off you know it&#039;s getting it was one of those ways of</div><div id="00:33:08.680" class="transcript_line"> trying to get work in those days we sort of thought what what need what who wants a giant</div><div id="00:33:12.760" class="transcript_line"> walks that walking camera a film festival so we sort of and all the film passes we sent</div><div id="00:33:17.720" class="transcript_line"> sent the imagery to only two ever got back london film festival we opened in empire in the empire</div><div id="00:33:24.440" class="transcript_line"> unless a square one year these giant still cameras which is a crazy story but then and then</div><div id="00:33:29.320" class="transcript_line"> abariss with film festival welsh international film festival said will you prepare to come up</div><div id="00:33:33.320" class="transcript_line"> for 10 days and um and work so we did that and and each after we finished doing our appearances</div><div id="00:33:39.720" class="transcript_line"> in the evening at the in the in the club that was the headquarters whatever all this office</div><div id="00:33:44.120" class="transcript_line"> there was this really good vibe of people hanging around and nothing to do and we thought wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:33:47.720" class="transcript_line"> it be good to have like a club where you could sort of hang around and show films and stuff and</div><div id="00:33:51.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s where we got this idea of like a cinema as social wow in abariss with and then yeah and</div><div id="00:33:55.320" class="transcript_line"> we came back to bristol and then we we had a sort of loft space that we did these kind of legal</div><div id="00:34:00.600" class="transcript_line"> screenings and stuff in club rhombus but we did that for about a year and then then this this venue</div><div id="00:34:06.040" class="transcript_line"> closed down that we that was a cinema and we thought let&#039;s try and take it on in my own sort</div><div id="00:34:09.880" class="transcript_line"> of cinema thing i said it was a 98 so so the long story around from there is that we so i stopped</div><div id="00:34:15.880" class="transcript_line"> kev carried on but i can pretty much stop doing any carnival um even st paul&#039;s and stuff and</div><div id="00:34:20.520" class="transcript_line"> i kept us still get up almost religiously every year at st paul&#039;s and stuff i&#039;ve always thought</div><div id="00:34:24.200" class="transcript_line"> was amazing you know but i just couldn&#039;t i just changed my whole area of you know work in a way</div><div id="00:34:29.560" class="transcript_line"> you know and didn&#039;t do it for years and years and years until um the earthquake in struck haiti and</div><div id="00:34:35.640" class="transcript_line"> and a group of people at the cube thought that we should be good idea to try and take out like a</div><div id="00:34:38.920" class="transcript_line"> mobile cinema which consisted of a video projector and dvds and a screen and and they just show films</div><div id="00:34:45.560" class="transcript_line"> for the camps where people have been the home people in the camps and people are homeless</div><div id="00:34:50.040" class="transcript_line"> um and and a lot of children are family-less you know orphans and stuff yeah horrendous kind</div><div id="00:34:55.720" class="transcript_line"> of circumstances and um so what work with the audience so i was in the third we sent</div><div id="00:35:02.120" class="transcript_line"> earthquake survivors what do they watch we sent we sent three groups the first year they went was</div><div id="00:35:06.360" class="transcript_line"> very shortly after the earthquake and that was quite hard um and then there&#039;s another group and</div><div id="00:35:10.280" class="transcript_line"> then i was in the third group by the time we went they&#039;d established what worked really well with</div><div id="00:35:13.880" class="transcript_line"> the audience and stuff but it was things like the red balloon um this kind of new guinea film</div><div id="00:35:18.840" class="transcript_line"> ballon d&#039;or um kirk who saw stress kind of films and stuff you know so and they&#039;d watch the same</div><div id="00:35:24.760" class="transcript_line"> film over and over again you know and always laugh at the same points and and and stuff and</div><div id="00:35:29.880" class="transcript_line"> but um but it so happened that when we went it was carnival season you see and i knew that we</div><div id="00:35:34.840" class="transcript_line"> were going to be there in carnival season and um i&#039;d heard a little bit about this kind of famous</div><div id="00:35:41.320" class="transcript_line"> carnival in jackmail which is in the south south of the the port of prince which is struck by</div><div id="00:35:47.160" class="transcript_line"> that area got hit by the carnival the most it&#039;s on like a beginning of a peninsula and on the</div><div id="00:35:51.480" class="transcript_line"> northern part of that is port of prince and leogan where we were based for the first few weeks and</div><div id="00:35:56.520" class="transcript_line"> then on the southern part of that peninsula there&#039;s um a place called jackmail and um and</div><div id="00:36:03.560" class="transcript_line"> this has got quite a famous carnival quite a famous um sort of really raw almost african</div><div id="00:36:10.040" class="transcript_line"> you know very non-commercialized um no toys i mean carnival and so the carnival when we were there</div><div id="00:36:17.560" class="transcript_line"> that was the like the year before the carnival had been cancelled throughout the whole of haiti</div><div id="00:36:22.040" class="transcript_line"> because of the earthquake that&#039;s how bad the earthquake was the cancel the carnival had been</div><div id="00:36:25.400" class="transcript_line"> cancelled which is like cancelling christmas here you know cancelling every calendar and you know all</div><div id="00:36:30.120" class="transcript_line"> in one can you imagine so so when the carnival was on this was the first time it had been back on</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> again so they were coming back with a really big a big party you know um so so i knew that</div><div id="00:36:40.600" class="transcript_line"> we were going to be there for the carnival so it kind of reignited that interest in</div><div id="00:36:45.080" class="transcript_line"> in it i suppose didn&#039;t know what to expect um but it was a pretty immense kind of folk</div><div id="00:36:51.480" class="transcript_line"> occasion really um just such massive sort of participation and in it from people you know</div><div id="00:36:57.800" class="transcript_line"> you know um there was also some um traditional um characters i mean you mentioned the black</div><div id="00:37:06.200" class="transcript_line"> jude the man with the mysterious box and the devils take us through those yeah um so i mean</div><div id="00:37:12.280" class="transcript_line"> they so there was a route they parade they do follow a route and when we they had the carnival</div><div id="00:37:16.680" class="transcript_line"> we went down to this area we had this guy called michelle who who was who showed us around and he</div><div id="00:37:21.400" class="transcript_line"> was really good he was like kind of fixer in a way and translator and stuff and we took us down</div><div id="00:37:25.400" class="transcript_line"> this big camp bit and there were all these paper mache style kind of costumes and things you know</div><div id="00:37:30.200" class="transcript_line"> so that we that we just didn&#039;t know what form it would take didn&#039;t know how would they be parading</div><div id="00:37:34.440" class="transcript_line"> with big backpacks was it you know kind of traditional characters didn&#039;t really know much</div><div id="00:37:37.640" class="transcript_line"> about it so when we when i first saw that i thought okay right i thought okay that&#039;s they</div><div id="00:37:42.120" class="transcript_line"> do that here the tradition of these kind of big big heads and these kind of sculptures almost</div><div id="00:37:46.360" class="transcript_line"> people just carry you know and really intricately made and painted you know really um very kind of</div><div id="00:37:51.960" class="transcript_line"> literal in the sense you know not not gestural that really solid kind of characters and</div><div id="00:37:56.360" class="transcript_line"> and each one illustrates a bit from some folk story or some voodoo god or godess or something</div><div id="00:38:01.720" class="transcript_line"> um and then so they have that and they all get paraded and then there&#039;s kids versions of it</div><div id="00:38:06.920" class="transcript_line"> and stuff and but then they have these these devils which which people walk around and which are</div><div id="00:38:11.240" class="transcript_line"> which are effectively that style of making but just the head it&#039;s like a big horned you know</div><div id="00:38:17.400" class="transcript_line"> um devil headdress but then the rest of the the rest of the costume might be just boots</div><div id="00:38:23.160" class="transcript_line"> you know tasselie tunic trousers but then these wings that they have which are kind of wings that</div><div id="00:38:28.760" class="transcript_line"> want to kind of a backpack but they&#039;re like big flaps of wood so they they can slap them they can</div><div id="00:38:33.640" class="transcript_line"> snap them behind like a bit like the crocodile in a way in punch and judy&#039;s kind of thing that snaps</div><div id="00:38:38.840" class="transcript_line"> they kind of clacker and they they kind of go along and clack them and um and then they parade</div><div id="00:38:44.280" class="transcript_line"> they kind of parade in single file so they do this thing where they kind of all follow each other</div><div id="00:38:47.560" class="transcript_line"> around you know um but i mean you know i can&#039;t even begin to i mean there&#039;s just so many there&#039;s</div><div id="00:38:52.680" class="transcript_line"> this kind of free agent characters around around there&#039;s just another group which they all like</div><div id="00:38:55.640" class="transcript_line"> this they were based on a general some famous historic general who is either a good guy or a</div><div id="00:39:00.200" class="transcript_line"> bad guy i&#039;m not quite sure what he what he did and um they have all these kind of big lips and they</div><div id="00:39:05.640" class="transcript_line"> and you know these kind of military tops medals and stuff and then they just do these dances and</div><div id="00:39:09.800" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s big groups of guys who are all doing that one character again moving in single file</div><div id="00:39:14.680" class="transcript_line"> but just doing these very particular dances and things you know um so it&#039;s just so much going on</div><div id="00:39:21.480" class="transcript_line"> it was just hard to kind of keep you know keep keep keep on top of it all and um and then ones</div><div id="00:39:25.400" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;ll describe yesterday thing with a sort of like a single uh a line of guys all next standing next</div><div id="00:39:30.040" class="transcript_line"> to each other walking along sort of barefoot but just kind of paint painted white with these placards</div><div id="00:39:35.160" class="transcript_line"> around but just moving really like ghosts just really silently so down the street what do they say</div><div id="00:39:38.920" class="transcript_line"> on the placard i&#039;m an ex i think she&#039;s got freedom liberty you know because of course haiti&#039;s got</div><div id="00:39:43.320" class="transcript_line"> comment yeah because they have that there&#039;s a lot there is a deep awareness there of them having</div><div id="00:39:47.560" class="transcript_line"> come from slaves and it was the first black country wasn&#039;t it absolutely it&#039;s got an incredible</div><div id="00:39:52.600" class="transcript_line"> history and um and then the voodoo is another big movement out there as well um you know in the</div><div id="00:39:58.520" class="transcript_line"> in the parade you&#039;d get actually some christian groups who are sort of very evangelical women in</div><div id="00:40:03.080" class="transcript_line"> white and singing singing they&#039;ve got christian songs and things across this yeah yeah because</div><div id="00:40:07.400" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s that whole cocktail of religion there yeah cocktail of religion and superstition</div><div id="00:40:11.800" class="transcript_line"> so the christians got involved but on their own terms yeah exactly yeah yeah on their own terms</div><div id="00:40:15.560" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t really enter into the but then but then right next to them would be this this crazy</div><div id="00:40:21.480" class="transcript_line"> you know voodoo group everyone&#039;s just going wild and they&#039;re turning these kind of effigies of</div><div id="00:40:25.880" class="transcript_line"> things along and they&#039;re running around and and uh it&#039;s amazing um and voodoo out there is is kind</div><div id="00:40:31.240" class="transcript_line"> of like a kind of alternative it&#039;s like a kind of a it&#039;s like they&#039;re i don&#039;t know it&#039;s kind of</div><div id="00:40:36.440" class="transcript_line"> i mean it&#039;s a pagan thing but it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s hard again it&#039;s hard to sort of describe the kind of</div><div id="00:40:42.680" class="transcript_line"> the context of it there because it&#039;s much more to do with with tolerance and</div><div id="00:40:46.360" class="transcript_line"> everyone being equal and being welcomed so i went to voodoo ceremony and it was like</div><div id="00:40:50.520" class="transcript_line"> it was like a kind of a rave meets kind of a you know knees up in a pub it&#039;s like a community</div><div id="00:40:55.640" class="transcript_line"> sing sing song community get together uh community piss up you know one&#039;s drinking</div><div id="00:40:59.960" class="transcript_line"> rum and dancing and socializing and and yeah i mean i&#039;ve got some music i&#039;ve got some recordings</div><div id="00:41:09.400" class="transcript_line"> of the drumming and stuff but yeah i mean yeah literally like again like i said to you</div><div id="00:41:13.240" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a stage of the drummers it&#039;s about 20 maybe and um there&#039;s one guy that&#039;s the</div><div id="00:41:19.400" class="transcript_line"> main lead drummer and when they start they just start this kind of very fast tempo and that&#039;s it</div><div id="00:41:23.400" class="transcript_line"> it just stays at that tempo solidly for like four hours and then they take a break and then</div><div id="00:41:29.160" class="transcript_line"> then it starts again same time during that period that the people who are possessed come</div><div id="00:41:34.200" class="transcript_line"> yes the women are kind of parading around singing and then and then priests and</div><div id="00:41:37.240" class="transcript_line"> precesses are there so the women are part of the voodoo group that of the temple that you&#039;re in</div><div id="00:41:44.040" class="transcript_line"> and this one they had white with bits of pink clothes on and then towards the end of the second</div><div id="00:41:51.080" class="transcript_line"> session they kind of go into the chances and things yeah so people come into the middle and</div><div id="00:41:54.200" class="transcript_line"> circle around and then well more than no one got possessed but um you can see them sort of trying</div><div id="00:41:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and then oh no okay and then sort of shuffling off because you know they&#039;d like they&#039;d failed you know</div><div id="00:42:05.640" class="transcript_line"> so yeah that was quite amazing the um the jackmill carnival yeah you know again i&#039;d like to go again</div><div id="00:42:13.160" class="transcript_line"> actually i think it&#039;d be really nice to now haven&#039;t done it once to kind of go again and see</div><div id="00:42:18.120" class="transcript_line"> see how it works there&#039;s there&#039;s um there&#039;s a group out there doing like these puppets</div><div id="00:42:22.360" class="transcript_line"> the french group that doing these you know ones that go on backpacks and the heads go up really</div><div id="00:42:25.800" class="transcript_line"> high and you and then they have the big hands and the sleeves and you sort of walk along with them you know</div><div id="00:42:30.520" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;d say one of the joys of this anniversary project is getting to reconnect with people</div><div id="00:42:36.760" class="transcript_line"> like yourself who haven&#039;t seen for going on for 20 years and what i find is that you know i think</div><div id="00:42:43.400" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve already in a during our exhibition at the carlis story uh ogee&#039;s going to come along and</div><div id="00:42:48.840" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll make a presentation with uh sound recordings and the rest of it based on his experiences in</div><div id="00:42:54.600" class="transcript_line"> haiti and the jack and the carnival in particular but i think we have sort of decided that we need</div><div id="00:43:01.000" class="transcript_line"> to go and visit that and see whether that can&#039;t be the basis of some form of collaborative and</div><div id="00:43:07.480" class="transcript_line"> intercultural exchange in the future i mean in swicker we haven&#039;t done that since 2005</div><div id="00:43:14.360" class="transcript_line"> when i went to trinidad last and worked with the blue devils traditional character up on the</div><div id="00:43:21.640" class="transcript_line"> mountain behind port of spain uh paramin and then we brought them over and we did all kinds of things</div><div id="00:43:29.560" class="transcript_line"> so um i can&#039;t say this has been the most fascinating conversation it&#039;s been absolutely</div><div id="00:43:34.920" class="transcript_line"> wonderful and i would like to end by saying ogee you are a carl hero thank you very much</div><div id="00:43:40.520" class="transcript_line"> for all your memories it&#039;s a pleasure thank you very much</div></div></p>
