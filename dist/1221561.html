We had a special dispensation that we didn&#039;t have to go into chapel.</div><div id="00:00:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, I&#039;ll be able to get my letters written on a Sunday morning.</div><div id="00:00:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Instead of wasting time in chapel, I&#039;ll stay in the classroom and write my letters, which was fine.</div><div id="00:00:19.920" class="transcript_line"> And of course, when it came to the religious instructions,</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> I was allowed to sit at the back and get on with other homework.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t force me to take part at all.</div><div id="00:00:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I was the only one who didn&#039;t attend chapel, which was rather remarkable,</div><div id="00:00:35.440" class="transcript_line"> but nobody held it against me.

I didn&#039;t worry me.</div><div id="00:00:44.640" class="transcript_line"> And I even went on to become head boy of the house, so it certainly didn&#039;t inhibit me in any way.</div><div id="00:00:50.880" class="transcript_line"> And of course, the name was a bit of a giveaway, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:53.920" class="transcript_line"> Sherman was not exactly a Welsh name, so they knew that I was different.</div><div id="00:00:58.480" class="transcript_line"> And we did have three or four other boys there who were all refugees.</div><div id="00:01:03.040" class="transcript_line"> So I wasn&#039;t exactly alone. One was a cousin of mine, Tom Adler.</div><div id="00:01:07.360" class="transcript_line"> He had the button factory in Merthyr, which, and then there was another chap, Henry Kurtzman.</div><div id="00:01:12.640" class="transcript_line"> They had OP chocolates. And there was another one, Bobby Gregory.</div><div id="00:01:16.960" class="transcript_line"> And they had a glove factory, Planet Gloves.</div><div id="00:01:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Although Tom and Henry had left by the time I came there,</div><div id="00:01:23.520" class="transcript_line"> I was contemporary with Bobby Gregory, and he was one of my best friends.</div><div id="00:01:27.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any dispensations at all when you were at Macefield House or Lamonia School?</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> No, no.
