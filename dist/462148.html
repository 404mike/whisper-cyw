Well I voted no, I don&#039;t know what anybody else in the family voted.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fear I think really, because you didn&#039;t know what you were getting into.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can&#039;t say I remember a lot about the individuals on the television, but I do remember the debates going on.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course after I&#039;d voted no, we had Margaret Thatcher for a long time and I thought to myself,</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> if she had been there before the referendum had come up I wouldn&#039;t have voted no at the second.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But then of course we had another chance, so I voted the right way that time.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember sitting up and watching the results coming in.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the Rhondda results were coming in quite late.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were all, well what have we voted for, you know?</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was yes, so yeah. I do remember that.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember the celebrations about that.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But I suppose television had an influence then to the extent that it was sort of, it did influence me on which way to vote the first time.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it influenced me the second time I think, Mrs Thatcher did that.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was interesting to see.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always wished they had a DVD or a video of the results coming in because the excitement was really tense and dramatic.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was very good.</div></div></p>
