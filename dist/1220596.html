    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have memories of going to the synagogue when you were a young child?</div><div id="00:00:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:00:04.720" class="transcript_line"> What are the memories that stand out for you most?</div><div id="00:00:09.720" class="transcript_line"> Sort of sitting in the pews.</div><div id="00:00:13.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a typical traditional style synagogue with a balcony.</div><div id="00:00:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Very, very old.</div><div id="00:00:28.560" class="transcript_line"> And completely traditional.</div><div id="00:00:31.240" class="transcript_line"> And they had their own rabbi there who had a wonderful voice.</div><div id="00:00:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And again, one of the things outstanding memories is the fact that the Salvation Army were next</div><div id="00:00:50.720" class="transcript_line"> door.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> When they played, you could hear them playing in the synagogue.</div><div id="00:01:00.440" class="transcript_line"> On one occasion, part of the ceremony, it&#039;s where the reader falls down on his knees and</div><div id="00:01:15.240" class="transcript_line"> unfortunately fell and caught his head on the corner.</div><div id="00:01:21.360" class="transcript_line"> The outcome being that he was killed.</div><div id="00:01:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I was sent running down to the doctors, who was a Jewish doctor, who was just a matter</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> of a few hundred yards away.</div><div id="00:01:36.360" class="transcript_line"> And that sticks out in my memory.</div><div id="00:01:39.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not surprised.</div><div id="00:01:40.280" class="transcript_line"> How old would you have been then?</div><div id="00:01:43.200" class="transcript_line"> I suppose about eight to ten.</div><div id="00:01:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Are there any festivals or holy days that stick in your mind?</div><div id="00:01:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Well yes.</div><div id="00:01:58.240" class="transcript_line"> The New Year and the Day of Atonement were the main ones.</div><div id="00:02:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Festival of Lights, Chanukah.</div><div id="00:02:10.640" class="transcript_line"> These are joyous ones.</div><div id="00:02:14.640" class="transcript_line"> No, those are the ones that stick out anyway.</div><div id="00:02:19.640" class="transcript_line"> So you went to Hader, but at the other synagogue?</div><div id="00:02:27.640" class="transcript_line"> At the other synagogue, yes.</div><div id="00:02:29.640" class="transcript_line"> And how were you received there?</div><div id="00:02:32.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fine.</div><div id="00:02:33.640" class="transcript_line"> Because all the children went there from you?</div><div id="00:02:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:37.640" class="transcript_line"> So you had your bar mitzvah at your own synagogue, but you were...</div><div id="00:02:41.640" class="transcript_line"> No, no, because by the time my bar mitzvah had come around, I believe the other one had</div><div id="00:02:47.640" class="transcript_line"> closed.</div><div id="00:02:48.640" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:02:49.640" class="transcript_line"> So that would have been early 50s?</div><div id="00:02:53.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, early 50s.</div><div id="00:02:55.640" class="transcript_line"> So your bar mitzvah was in the newer building?</div><div id="00:03:00.640" class="transcript_line"> No, it was a temporary building that we hired because the main synagogue had been bombed</div><div id="00:03:10.640" class="transcript_line"> in the wall.</div><div id="00:03:11.640" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:03:12.640" class="transcript_line"> That was called Goat Street.</div><div id="00:03:14.640" class="transcript_line"> Goat Street was bombed in what, 1941 or something?</div><div id="00:03:19.640" class="transcript_line"> 41, 42.</div><div id="00:03:20.640" class="transcript_line"> So you would have been very young then, just a few years old, but can you remember what</div><div id="00:03:26.640" class="transcript_line"> happened after Goat Street was bombed?</div><div id="00:03:29.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they then moved to...not Union Street, Costina Street, where they took a building</div><div id="00:03:42.640" class="transcript_line"> over.</div><div id="00:03:43.640" class="transcript_line"> They had there a mikvah and a killing pen for chickens.</div><div id="00:03:51.640" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:53.640" class="transcript_line"> And on a Sunday it was my job to pick up the chickens for the family, which made me feel</div><div id="00:04:01.640" class="transcript_line"> very sick.</div><div id="00:04:03.640" class="transcript_line"> After they&#039;d been killed?</div><div id="00:04:06.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:04:07.640" class="transcript_line"> And what, your mum had to prepare them then?</div><div id="00:04:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:11.640" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:04:12.640" class="transcript_line"> So the mikvah and the killing place was used by both synagogues?</div><div id="00:04:19.640" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:04:20.640" class="transcript_line"> There was only one mikvah that I&#039;m aware of.</div><div id="00:04:24.640" class="transcript_line"> No, the other one.</div><div id="00:04:29.640" class="transcript_line"> I honestly can&#039;t answer that.</div><div id="00:04:32.640" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:04:33.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s something I didn&#039;t partake of.</div><div id="00:04:37.640" class="transcript_line"> Would you have known what the burial arrangements were for each of the synagogues?</div><div id="00:04:41.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was no, just one...</div><div id="00:04:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Just one burial ground.</div><div id="00:04:45.640" class="transcript_line"> One burial ground.</div></div></p>
