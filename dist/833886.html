    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I live in your studio.</div><div id="00:00:22.360" class="transcript_line"> It is my uncle, D.A. Williams, who probably heard of, referred to, what he brought Joseph</div><div id="00:00:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Herman to Austria-Germany.</div><div id="00:00:32.680" class="transcript_line"> And when Herman first came here, he stayed with him in the cottage in Audfell Street.</div><div id="00:00:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was from there that he took the fancy to the world of Austria-Germany.</div><div id="00:00:42.680" class="transcript_line"> So he was my mother&#039;s brother.</div><div id="00:00:43.680" class="transcript_line"> My uncle then became the, eventually over many years, owned the studio and added the</div><div id="00:00:44.680" class="transcript_line"> studio to his home.</div><div id="00:01:16.680" class="transcript_line"> When he came, it was 1945, then he was about 18 months in the Pennabonk den.</div><div id="00:01:23.680" class="transcript_line"> He stayed about three weeks with my uncle in this little cottage, coming at first for</div><div id="00:01:30.680" class="transcript_line"> just a few weeks holiday.</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> But he took a fancy to the people that he&#039;d met when they went pubbing or met people in</div><div id="00:01:39.680" class="transcript_line"> the street.</div><div id="00:01:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Everybody seemed friendly.</div><div id="00:01:42.680" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m told, and so he thought he would stay a little longer.</div><div id="00:01:45.680" class="transcript_line"> And he then went to the Pennabonk inn, where they&#039;d been for a drink, and stayed in a</div><div id="00:01:53.680" class="transcript_line"> rented, what we call the ballroom, other times called the ballroom, a large room.</div><div id="00:01:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Nothing has ever been a ballroom in a pub, very top floor.</div><div id="00:02:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And he stayed there for a few, I think about a year.</div><div id="00:02:09.680" class="transcript_line"> He saw this place, the studio, we now call it the studio, but it wasn&#039;t called the studio</div><div id="00:02:14.680" class="transcript_line"> then, looking out of the window of the Pennabonk, the side window, he saw it amongst the weeds.</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> I think he bought it from the Gulf Estate.</div><div id="00:02:30.680" class="transcript_line"> It was, it was at the time some sort of storage.</div><div id="00:02:38.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know quite who would use it as storage, but it was some sort of storage, wartime</div><div id="00:02:42.680" class="transcript_line"> storage, but foodstuff.</div><div id="00:02:44.680" class="transcript_line"> And before that it had been a pub for like three years.</div><div id="00:02:52.680" class="transcript_line"> You were to tell me earlier on about the different renovations that you&#039;ve done to the property.</div><div id="00:02:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you go through how much this building has changed since Joseph found it?</div><div id="00:03:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Well Joseph changed it a bit because he added an extension to the pop factory rooms where</div><div id="00:03:13.680" class="transcript_line"> he would have had his studio, he had his studio.</div><div id="00:03:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And then the extension was a further room at the back, bedroom upstairs, and a bathroom</div><div id="00:03:29.680" class="transcript_line"> at the showroom downstairs.</div><div id="00:03:31.680" class="transcript_line"> So he would have added the extension.</div><div id="00:03:36.680" class="transcript_line"> As time went by, I went to both the building, he then changed things like putting different</div><div id="00:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> flooring, the flooring and the extension, and putting the staircase that was an adivine</div><div id="00:03:49.680" class="transcript_line"> before.</div><div id="00:03:50.680" class="transcript_line"> So over the years then we have arrived, the walls were substandard and therefore had to</div><div id="00:04:00.680" class="transcript_line"> be, I couldn&#039;t support the roof so we did lots of replaced windows and things like that.</div><div id="00:04:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Really, just the size of the studio room.</div><div id="00:04:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where we&#039;re sitting now.</div><div id="00:04:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Which I did really regret but we didn&#039;t have a fortune at the time.</div><div id="00:04:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Not now either.</div><div id="00:04:22.680" class="transcript_line"> We never liked it at all.</div><div id="00:04:25.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was such an interesting building.</div><div id="00:04:27.680" class="transcript_line"> It was interesting during my uncle&#039;s time actually because he added some finer points,</div><div id="00:04:34.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, what I am, suspended ceilings and documented a little bit.</div><div id="00:04:42.680" class="transcript_line"> I was always regretted not having a character.</div><div id="00:04:46.680" class="transcript_line"> And we saw villages of the Rortyne staircase.</div><div id="00:04:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Really, it was there before but the Rortyne wasn&#039;t there before.</div><div id="00:04:54.680" class="transcript_line"> It was for Herman to store his canvases in a loft.</div><div id="00:04:59.680" class="transcript_line"> So sorry.</div><div id="00:05:02.680" class="transcript_line"> You see the building is almost in two, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Two parts to it.</div><div id="00:05:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, really.</div><div id="00:05:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe the building today?</div><div id="00:05:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s more of a conventional dwelling than it was in the past.</div><div id="00:05:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, it is more of a conventional dwelling.</div><div id="00:05:26.680" class="transcript_line"> How did you actually meet Joseph?</div><div id="00:05:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I met him obviously through my family, my auntie.</div><div id="00:05:34.680" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s really when I met him in North Fuller Street.</div><div id="00:05:40.680" class="transcript_line"> But I was only ten years of age so I was not so taken much, what is it, this strange couple.</div><div id="00:05:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Strange, unusual.</div><div id="00:05:52.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I like to call them.</div><div id="00:05:55.680" class="transcript_line"> And that their accents were different.</div><div id="00:05:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Joseph&#039;s aunt, Katrice, his wife.</div><div id="00:06:03.680" class="transcript_line"> What was your, if you can remember really, what was your image of them before when you did meet them?</div><div id="00:06:09.680" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned that they were strange.</div><div id="00:06:14.680" class="transcript_line"> I was a pretty busy little girl.</div><div id="00:06:16.680" class="transcript_line"> I was always, not staying for very long.</div><div id="00:06:20.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t recall telling my mum how they were strange.</div><div id="00:06:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And that they were dramatic clocks.</div><div id="00:06:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember the dramatic long black clocks.</div><div id="00:06:30.680" class="transcript_line"> In fact, they must have made quite an impact because I still love a clock.</div><div id="00:06:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think they impact their confidence.</div><div id="00:06:42.680" class="transcript_line"> They were different, they were very different.</div><div id="00:06:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Not so much confidence, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:47.680" class="transcript_line"> But certainly they were communicative.</div><div id="00:06:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Made an effort to communicate.</div><div id="00:06:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Even with awkward ten year olds.</div><div id="00:07:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Interested in that, interested in everything.</div><div id="00:07:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Did your relationship change over time?</div><div id="00:07:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, when you&#039;re an adolescent you don&#039;t get much time when you talk about yourself.</div><div id="00:07:19.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember meeting them in a cinema.</div><div id="00:07:22.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a cinema.</div><div id="00:07:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And they would sit, there were chelins in the front stalls.</div><div id="00:07:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Where all the young children sat and were very noisy.</div><div id="00:07:35.680" class="transcript_line"> And then there were running nines, there were running sixes at the back.</div><div id="00:07:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And the running nines upstairs in the back.</div><div id="00:07:42.680" class="transcript_line"> You can tell a long story.</div><div id="00:07:44.680" class="transcript_line"> And I always, I can&#039;t understand why Joel and Katra always sit in the chelins of the children.</div><div id="00:07:53.680" class="transcript_line"> So they stood up because they were not afraid to be different.</div><div id="00:07:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Thinking about it now, they were not going to be who they were going to be in the conventions or whatever.</div><div id="00:08:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I felt that was a freedom about them.</div><div id="00:08:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe, if we look at more us again lights now,</div><div id="00:08:18.680" class="transcript_line"> can you describe us again like in Joseph&#039;s day?</div><div id="00:08:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:08:28.680" class="transcript_line"> The mines were tight.</div><div id="00:08:32.680" class="transcript_line"> My father was a farmer.</div><div id="00:08:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Many people have heard about miners.</div><div id="00:08:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I lived very close to the dead on a farm.</div><div id="00:08:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Evacuees, I can&#039;t remember, this is the end of the time that you had evacuees.</div><div id="00:09:01.680" class="transcript_line"> I obviously remember it as a very happy, very happy day.</div><div id="00:09:04.680" class="transcript_line"> An interesting day, an interesting, very happy day.</div><div id="00:09:09.680" class="transcript_line"> But Katra was also a farmer as well.</div><div id="00:09:14.680" class="transcript_line"> In the village, in the miners.</div><div id="00:09:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think, did this again change when Joseph arrived?</div><div id="00:09:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s a pretty dramatic statement.</div><div id="00:09:29.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it changed or not much.</div><div id="00:09:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps having heard what my family say, what my marital answer,</div><div id="00:09:43.680" class="transcript_line"> that answer is something that I tried to emulate and not all that successfully,</div><div id="00:09:49.680" class="transcript_line"> that like-minded people came together.</div><div id="00:09:52.680" class="transcript_line"> So there was an interest in the, not so much in the visual arts,</div><div id="00:09:58.680" class="transcript_line"> but there was an interest, there were interest in discussion groups.</div><div id="00:10:07.680" class="transcript_line"> So looking back, I think, my family would be involved and would be going to discussion groups</div><div id="00:10:12.680" class="transcript_line"> and would be interested in the news and interested in what&#039;s going on in current affairs, in literature.</div><div id="00:10:20.680" class="transcript_line"> And I know, I can remember, would provoke a lot of laughter.</div><div id="00:10:25.680" class="transcript_line"> They had a book reading club, of course it wasn&#039;t a club,</div><div id="00:10:29.680" class="transcript_line"> it was just coming together, Mr. George, I was in that, and he&#039;d take us home.</div><div id="00:10:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Where they read us classics and it would perhaps be called a prejudice or something.</div><div id="00:10:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And they would all wait for George to read.</div><div id="00:10:44.680" class="transcript_line"> They would all be actually hysterical because George would read in this Polish Jewish accent, you know.</div><div id="00:10:52.680" class="transcript_line"> So they were, this is something I&#039;m dying to emulate, but I can, they were interested in lots of things.</div><div id="00:11:00.680" class="transcript_line"> They were not narrow-minded or, I don&#039;t know, it is fine to, it&#039;s like you&#039;ve got minds.</div><div id="00:11:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And they were stimulating people when they were interested in things.</div><div id="00:11:18.680" class="transcript_line"> And I thought we actually lost that when I think of the last, I don&#039;t know, when I over dramatized time.</div><div id="00:11:32.680" class="transcript_line"> So do you think that was lost when Joseph left?</div><div id="00:11:36.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was actually, maybe he&#039;d been a catalyst in some way because he had something of what to offer.</div><div id="00:11:44.680" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think up to that point perhaps some, you know, people may not have heard of Todd Starr or Bozak.</div><div id="00:11:52.680" class="transcript_line"> So perhaps he stretched, stretched them a little bit.</div><div id="00:11:58.680" class="transcript_line"> But as they also stretched him, so he did describe him.</div><div id="00:12:03.680" class="transcript_line"> He introduced him also to radical child, you know.</div><div id="00:12:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Because he was very curious. I remember there being very, very curious people here in the country.</div><div id="00:12:18.680" class="transcript_line"> She wanted to, I wonder if she wanted to come to a funeral, she wanted to go to a Welsh chapel and do a funeral service.</div><div id="00:12:27.680" class="transcript_line"> And she came to the farm and she came in a red dress.</div><div id="00:12:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And my mother was mortified. She came in a red dress.</div><div id="00:12:36.680" class="transcript_line"> So my mother had a coat she thought an awful lot about, so it was an Astrakhan coat.</div><div id="00:12:42.680" class="transcript_line"> So she lent her the Astrakhan coat and put over the red dress to go to the funeral.</div><div id="00:12:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they have any political influence in the area?</div><div id="00:12:53.680" class="transcript_line"> I think they came together, again, just me, I think they came together because of a political interest.</div><div id="00:13:01.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s what introduced everyone, was we brought them together.</div><div id="00:13:07.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that they came, my uncle and I went to meet them in Brecon, they went on holiday in Brecon,</div><div id="00:13:14.680" class="transcript_line"> because of the Contest in the Communist Party.</div><div id="00:13:17.680" class="transcript_line"> So, that again was the start.</div><div id="00:13:21.680" class="transcript_line"> They were very, very politically aware.</div><div id="00:13:29.680" class="transcript_line"> But as many as, well anyway.</div><div id="00:13:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Did they get involved with the government?</div><div id="00:13:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I think so, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:43.680" class="transcript_line"> I think they certainly got involved with discussion groups, or the event at the Beverly Hall of plays.</div><div id="00:13:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:54.680" class="transcript_line"> And again, looking maybe at Joseph&#039;s work, do you think he captured the spirits of this again, wife?</div><div id="00:14:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Of the people in the industry of the area.</div><div id="00:14:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sometimes I think so, he&#039;s sombre.</div><div id="00:14:12.680" class="transcript_line"> But I just love his work, I mean, sombre or not.</div><div id="00:14:18.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got a drawing there, I think that&#039;s of my aunt.</div><div id="00:14:22.680" class="transcript_line"> And she was so thankful I saved it, my aunt, I just love it so much.</div><div id="00:14:27.680" class="transcript_line"> She was mentally handicapped, and she was on the file, and I think that really captures the spirit.</div><div id="00:14:37.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that really captures it.</div><div id="00:14:39.680" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s sad in a way as well.</div><div id="00:14:44.680" class="transcript_line"> But to me, of course, obviously, I see it as a sadness.</div><div id="00:14:49.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lady who was in...</div><div id="00:14:51.680" class="transcript_line"> He says in this interview that he says something in this interview,</div><div id="00:14:55.680" class="transcript_line"> and that happened to me quite recently, it was still a joke.</div><div id="00:14:59.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was called the 6th of October, 1945.</div><div id="00:15:04.680" class="transcript_line"> It is maybe clarity from the speakers, my aunt, Joseph Herman, and the history of Williams.</div><div id="00:15:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And the 12th of October was transmitted Pacific service.</div><div id="00:15:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Pacific service, what?</div><div id="00:15:21.680" class="transcript_line"> What he says about...</div><div id="00:15:26.680" class="transcript_line"> What he says about Ashwagandhas and why he came.</div><div id="00:15:36.680" class="transcript_line"> It says here, yes, I came here from London, but more interesting are the reasons why I came.</div><div id="00:15:41.680" class="transcript_line"> For quite a long time I had wanted to draw and paint Maynard.</div><div id="00:15:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But I couldn&#039;t make up my mind which place to choose.</div><div id="00:15:52.680" class="transcript_line"> This is the reason he came to Ashwagandhas.</div><div id="00:15:55.680" class="transcript_line"> But the bombardment of London destroyed the hospital which my wife was attending for treatment at the time,</div><div id="00:16:01.680" class="transcript_line"> and I was forced to make up my mind quickly.</div><div id="00:16:03.680" class="transcript_line"> A friend gave me the address of a hospital in this district, and so we came down here to Bethlehem.</div><div id="00:16:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Originally it was only for a month, but it was a really steep climb.</div><div id="00:16:14.680" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t the Maynard he says that really attracted him first, but it was the actual surroundings.</div><div id="00:16:23.680" class="transcript_line"> He found that compared with other Maynard localities in Belgium, particularly the first two,</div><div id="00:16:33.680" class="transcript_line"> that there was no colour.</div><div id="00:16:35.680" class="transcript_line"> There was colour in the building, there was colour in the stone.</div><div id="00:16:39.680" class="transcript_line"> He still got it in the summer.</div><div id="00:16:43.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s coming everywhere in November.</div><div id="00:16:47.680" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t come until the great rains, and the sun was shining.</div><div id="00:16:51.680" class="transcript_line"> You could see the colour in the building.</div><div id="00:16:54.680" class="transcript_line"> So he says that he long wanted to get Maynard, but was attracted in the rest of the structure, the location itself.</div><div id="00:17:04.680" class="transcript_line"> And do you believe that he captured this in the Maynard?</div><div id="00:17:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes I do. Not the colour.</div><div id="00:17:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Actually not the colour.</div><div id="00:17:19.680" class="transcript_line"> I think he captured something.</div><div id="00:17:23.680" class="transcript_line"> I love his figures.</div><div id="00:17:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I have found them very sombre, with those two women gossiping there.</div><div id="00:17:32.680" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re so...</div><div id="00:17:35.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t forget.</div><div id="00:17:37.680" class="transcript_line"> We call them a material in the sense that they...</div><div id="00:17:42.680" class="transcript_line"> You know what they are, and you can almost join in their conversation.</div><div id="00:17:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I feel I know what they&#039;re talking about.</div><div id="00:17:50.680" class="transcript_line"> The dramatic and bold. I love their boldness.</div><div id="00:17:57.680" class="transcript_line"> And if you look at that painting as well, that drawing, they look at you.</div><div id="00:18:04.680" class="transcript_line"> I think he looks...</div><div id="00:18:07.680" class="transcript_line"> He looks sad and sombre and dignified.</div><div id="00:18:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is the dignity of the Maynard.</div><div id="00:18:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever meet the Boomsbury set, the group he came around with?</div><div id="00:18:30.680" class="transcript_line"> I saw lots of people, but I wouldn&#039;t have known at the time where they were.</div><div id="00:18:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Lots of people really, and I did still join.</div><div id="00:18:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t cheered on that often, really.</div><div id="00:18:43.680" class="transcript_line"> As an adolescent, you&#039;ve got many other things to pursue.</div><div id="00:18:53.680" class="transcript_line"> To give people that didn&#039;t meet Joseph Hellman the understanding of who he was</div><div id="00:19:00.680" class="transcript_line"> and what he meant to the people in this degree.</div><div id="00:19:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Is there any particular story that comes to mind, any kind of antidote?</div><div id="00:19:14.680" class="transcript_line"> I actually use his own work, his own words.</div><div id="00:19:21.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very complimentary, but it talks about his colour.</div><div id="00:19:26.680" class="transcript_line"> It also talks about how friendly the people were.</div><div id="00:19:31.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re no stranger here, and called him Joe Bach affectionately.</div><div id="00:19:36.680" class="transcript_line"> He was known as Joe Bach.</div><div id="00:19:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I always start off with saying that he thought...</div><div id="00:19:44.680" class="transcript_line"> He was a very famous man, very famous artist.</div><div id="00:19:48.680" class="transcript_line"> He thought so much of us together was a special dream, and he used his own words.</div><div id="00:19:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you have a general feeling of other people in the area about Joseph?</div><div id="00:20:02.680" class="transcript_line"> At a certain age.</div><div id="00:20:06.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember him for his eccentricities, I think, of dress.</div><div id="00:20:11.680" class="transcript_line"> They used to call this place the Pink House, because it was obviously a pale tenacotter.</div><div id="00:20:21.680" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re sure that your painting has a pale tenacotter.</div><div id="00:20:26.680" class="transcript_line"> So in the 40s.</div><div id="00:20:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Especially in the Breshoff Halles.</div><div id="00:20:32.680" class="transcript_line"> People asked me, oh, you&#039;re living in the Pink House.</div><div id="00:20:39.680" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s someone else who said, my mother used to wash the sheets.</div><div id="00:20:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Have you interviewed her?</div><div id="00:20:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Betty Hawking.</div><div id="00:20:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Betty Davis.</div><div id="00:20:55.680" class="transcript_line"> She said that they had red sheets.</div><div id="00:21:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So they were not afraid of different people.</div><div id="00:21:07.680" class="transcript_line"> People seemed to have a lot of affection for people.</div><div id="00:21:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you think they were a bit reluctant at first, when they first came here, a little bit?</div><div id="00:21:19.680" class="transcript_line"> At the time, no.</div><div id="00:21:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps it&#039;s because perhaps they were invited here in the first instance.</div><div id="00:21:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Invited here.</div><div id="00:21:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And they knew that the mining community was very strong.</div><div id="00:21:36.680" class="transcript_line"> And they were invited here by members of the mining community, by people who played prominent roles.</div><div id="00:21:42.680" class="transcript_line"> There was a passport, wasn&#039;t it, and having a very welcoming time.</div><div id="00:21:50.680" class="transcript_line"> I think there must have been some influence.</div><div id="00:21:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Because I also like the Breshoff Halles.</div><div id="00:22:02.680" class="transcript_line"> But he has the talent.</div><div id="00:22:04.680" class="transcript_line"> I like the Breshoff Halles.</div><div id="00:22:06.680" class="transcript_line"> So, wouldn&#039;t I, if it hadn&#039;t been for them, I don&#039;t know, really.</div><div id="00:22:15.680" class="transcript_line"> I think there must have been tremendous influence.</div><div id="00:22:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Because I was extremely proud of them, proud of my husband and my husband.</div><div id="00:22:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Because they were different.</div><div id="00:22:25.680" class="transcript_line"> And when they were young, they were very different.</div><div id="00:22:32.680" class="transcript_line"> It seemed to be glamour, it wasn&#039;t glamour.</div><div id="00:22:35.680" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, it seemed to be different and they had a glamourous, I think it was a little bit of a mess.</div><div id="00:22:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And then there were books, although...</div><div id="00:22:45.680" class="transcript_line"> I had a lot of books as well.</div><div id="00:22:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But I needed to inherit any.</div><div id="00:22:55.680" class="transcript_line"> So, so many.</div><div id="00:22:58.680" class="transcript_line"> So, if he indeed influenced them, then certainly they influenced me.</div><div id="00:23:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they influenced me politically.</div><div id="00:23:08.680" class="transcript_line"> So they influenced me specifically.</div><div id="00:23:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Okay, now I can see it.</div><div id="00:23:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes?</div><div id="00:23:17.680" class="transcript_line"> Psychology, sociology, literature.</div><div id="00:23:21.680" class="transcript_line"> They were very...</div><div id="00:23:24.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean, would that person think that the miners would not normally be into it all?</div><div id="00:23:31.680" class="transcript_line"> He?</div><div id="00:23:32.680" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:23:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:23:34.680" class="transcript_line"> I think they would have been motivated by the...</div><div id="00:23:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Politically motivated anyway.</div><div id="00:23:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Before he came, politically motivated.</div><div id="00:23:45.680" class="transcript_line"> And it happened about the same time that we did...</div><div id="00:23:49.680" class="transcript_line"> The Silent Village was filmed here.</div><div id="00:23:52.680" class="transcript_line"> It was...</div><div id="00:23:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Have you heard of Silent Village?</div><div id="00:23:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Silent Village, what is that?</div><div id="00:24:00.680" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether I begin to tell you about that.</div><div id="00:24:02.680" class="transcript_line"> This is what this interview with Tarvan Davis is actually all about.</div><div id="00:24:07.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that...</div><div id="00:24:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And my uncle, I think he was the chairman of some lodges at the time.</div><div id="00:24:19.680" class="transcript_line"> And he talks about...</div><div id="00:24:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Tarvan Davis talks about really...</div><div id="00:24:27.680" class="transcript_line"> He says on the radio that you will have seen Kungier,</div><div id="00:24:31.680" class="transcript_line"> which is the village of Kungier, which is part of the Strickland.</div><div id="00:24:34.680" class="transcript_line"> You will have seen it.</div><div id="00:24:36.680" class="transcript_line"> The picturesque village of Kungier, he describes it.</div><div id="00:24:39.680" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:24:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And it comes as a small rural appendage, which is supposed to be, but it is.</div><div id="00:24:44.680" class="transcript_line"> I was rigged on this.</div><div id="00:24:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Just rows of cottages and small houses.</div><div id="00:24:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Kungier is famous.</div><div id="00:24:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s false papers.</div><div id="00:24:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Probably many of the listeners at the moment have seen it.</div><div id="00:24:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you may have seen it.</div><div id="00:24:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Not under its own name, of course, but representing another village,</div><div id="00:25:02.680" class="transcript_line"> the name of which really resounded throughout the world not so very long ago,</div><div id="00:25:06.680" class="transcript_line"> the village of Lydysing in Czechoslovakia,</div><div id="00:25:10.680" class="transcript_line"> where one of the most ruthless of Nazi crimes of the whole world took place.</div><div id="00:25:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, did you see anything here in the Strickland nice that the film depicting,</div><div id="00:25:22.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, the undying village of the people of Lydysing</div><div id="00:25:25.680" class="transcript_line"> and what the Nazis did to them was actually made?</div><div id="00:25:29.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what this interview is really about.</div><div id="00:25:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Why did they come to a Strickland nice where the director was Humphrey Jennings,</div><div id="00:25:44.680" class="transcript_line"> the famous director now, so to say, of documentaries in particular?</div><div id="00:25:49.680" class="transcript_line"> So my son tells me.</div><div id="00:25:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And my auntie says that he was notified by the miners&#039; head office in Cardiff</div><div id="00:25:57.680" class="transcript_line"> saying that Humphrey Jennings or the crown filming was coming down to see them</div><div id="00:26:03.680" class="transcript_line"> because he was looking for a location to film the tragedy of Lydysing.</div><div id="00:26:07.680" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose my auntie&#039;s job was to look for, to get in touch with the Czech delegation in London</div><div id="00:26:14.680" class="transcript_line"> to give them detailed information about villages around here that met standards in Lydysing.</div><div id="00:26:21.680" class="transcript_line"> And Jennings came here and he liked us from here and liked the miners</div><div id="00:26:28.680" class="transcript_line"> and he filmed the southern villages.</div><div id="00:26:31.680" class="transcript_line"> In fact, he had said that one of the things that Strickland was becoming part of the political side of things,</div><div id="00:26:38.680" class="transcript_line"> that Strickland was supposed to be, was a communist, if anyone remembers, strong communist party here.</div><div id="00:26:46.680" class="transcript_line"> But links to the chapel in the communist party, so that you found that deacons in the chapel,</div><div id="00:26:55.680" class="transcript_line"> no, not capitals, no, performance chapels, were also members of the communist party, unopened here.</div><div id="00:27:01.680" class="transcript_line"> And you found that fascinating, unexpected.</div><div id="00:27:07.680" class="transcript_line"> So I think it is politics.</div><div id="00:27:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Maybe that&#039;s influenced me throughout my life too because I&#039;ve spent a lifetime in the Labour Party at least.</div><div id="00:27:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh. I&#039;m the thing about you now, I&#039;m the thing about you.</div><div id="00:27:27.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just thinking when Joseph moved back to London and left the studio, your uncle and auntie acquired the building,</div><div id="00:27:40.680" class="transcript_line"> did they buy building of Joseph?</div><div id="00:27:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, according to my aunt and auntie, they bought it from, not from Joseph, but from Catria.</div><div id="00:27:52.680" class="transcript_line"> It was Catria and two were parted by them.</div><div id="00:27:58.680" class="transcript_line"> There were both of them living in London, living in different places in London.</div><div id="00:28:02.680" class="transcript_line"> He was living, I think, in the Edith Roadhouse in Fulham and she was, I think she had a flat.</div><div id="00:28:10.680" class="transcript_line"> You had a park or something.</div><div id="00:28:15.680" class="transcript_line"> And you mentioned that your uncle and auntie owned a farm before that.</div><div id="00:28:20.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, I lived in a farm, it was like Ben&#039;s place.</div><div id="00:28:24.680" class="transcript_line"> And the breakers were ready, but I can&#039;t be doing the makes.</div><div id="00:28:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you know why they wanted to buy this building?</div><div id="00:28:35.680" class="transcript_line"> They were, they were now in London.</div><div id="00:28:38.680" class="transcript_line"> They were very sentimental, I think they wanted a home in Stoke-Ellis anyway.</div><div id="00:28:43.680" class="transcript_line"> I think that the home, they were very happy here, their friendship with, friendship with John.</div><div id="00:28:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Very, very happy, this is very exciting times for them.</div><div id="00:28:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I should have mentioned that they had some wonderful associations with the building.</div><div id="00:29:01.680" class="transcript_line"> I know that my uncle did that when we came at weekends and holidays,</div><div id="00:29:05.680" class="transcript_line"> we were always pottering and doing things.</div><div id="00:29:07.680" class="transcript_line"> He did the staircase there and he would try your place and he did lots of things himself.</div><div id="00:29:12.680" class="transcript_line"> He made the clothes.</div><div id="00:29:15.680" class="transcript_line"> And that was like...</div><div id="00:29:16.680" class="transcript_line"> And it required more of a garden, so the garden we were drawing by buying house opposite.</div><div id="00:29:22.680" class="transcript_line"> And the gardens are in front, so it required a piece to go so that there&#039;s land around.</div><div id="00:29:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Or a three-site.</div><div id="00:29:32.680" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, I think they became very sentimental about it.</div><div id="00:29:38.680" class="transcript_line"> And they renamed it the studio.</div><div id="00:29:40.680" class="transcript_line"> It was called Tatcha.</div><div id="00:29:44.680" class="transcript_line"> I want to call it a factory pop.</div><div id="00:29:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But we listened to it.</div><div id="00:29:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And how did you feel when you acquired this building?</div><div id="00:29:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I inherited it.</div><div id="00:29:59.680" class="transcript_line"> So one of six, four were of my immediate family, including me.</div><div id="00:30:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And we bought the other two out of cousins.</div><div id="00:30:10.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy to have it because I spent many, many happy years visiting the place</div><div id="00:30:18.680" class="transcript_line"> during my aunt and auntie&#039;s lifetime.</div><div id="00:30:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Especially in the last ten years with my aunt before she died.</div><div id="00:30:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And in fact we used to call the place the Clemling because, you know...</div><div id="00:30:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And we should have called it something else because we&#039;re men.</div><div id="00:30:37.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re men.</div><div id="00:30:38.680" class="transcript_line"> We live in Farty.</div><div id="00:30:39.680" class="transcript_line"> We all come over here.</div><div id="00:30:40.680" class="transcript_line"> But the world&#039;s too right to the glass of wine.</div><div id="00:30:42.680" class="transcript_line"> My bottle&#039;s of wine to fill it.</div><div id="00:30:45.680" class="transcript_line"> So we were wonderful times here.</div><div id="00:30:48.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve locked his things, you know.</div><div id="00:30:50.680" class="transcript_line"> May it continue.</div><div id="00:30:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:58.680" class="transcript_line"> I stopped in the armadillo and said, Joe, have you seen Peggy and Dave or something like that?</div><div id="00:31:05.680" class="transcript_line"> He looked at you.</div><div id="00:31:07.680" class="transcript_line"> That is because perhaps he was an artist.</div><div id="00:31:11.680" class="transcript_line"> He really looked.</div><div id="00:31:12.680" class="transcript_line"> You could see him looking.</div><div id="00:31:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:31:18.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one thing to remember, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it is dead things.</div><div id="00:31:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Observing.</div><div id="00:31:29.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never noticed anyone else, but that.</div><div id="00:31:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Closely observing everything.</div><div id="00:31:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps not only the way they looked at him.</div><div id="00:31:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Into the soul.</div></div></p>
