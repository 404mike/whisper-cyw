So Lucy, how did you become involved with Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:40.160" class="transcript_line"> I became involved with Cardiff Carnival through the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> So I was doing my Masters in Arts Management there and we had to do a professional placement and I chose to go with Swicker Carnival.</div><div id="00:00:53.240" class="transcript_line"> So I know for a fact that you were very helpful helping us do research into various income streams and crowdfunding.</div><div id="00:01:02.160" class="transcript_line"> But as part of your time with Gloria Swicker, of course, you took part on an extensive and immersive basis at the carnival camp.</div><div id="00:01:13.720" class="transcript_line"> What was that like as an experience?</div><div id="00:01:16.600" class="transcript_line"> It was absolutely brilliant. It was something I didn&#039;t expect at all.</div><div id="00:01:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Bearing in mind that we&#039;ve been trained on very dry, very management style stuff to then go and get stuck in was really great.</div><div id="00:01:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Stuck on as well actually.</div><div id="00:01:31.600" class="transcript_line"> The amount of glue I went through, I&#039;m not surprised.</div><div id="00:01:33.600" class="transcript_line"> It was amazing. I always liked arts and design and stuff.</div><div id="00:01:37.600" class="transcript_line"> But to actually get there, to go and get involved with everyone and to get to make my own costume was amazing.</div><div id="00:01:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Tell us a bit more about your costume because what can I say?</div><div id="00:01:45.600" class="transcript_line"> It was a beautiful costume, well made.</div><div id="00:01:49.800" class="transcript_line"> Where did the idea come from and how did you make it?</div><div id="00:01:52.800" class="transcript_line"> The idea came from Adrian.</div><div id="00:01:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Adrian, lead designer, designed the basic shape for me because he had something in his mind and then set me to it.</div><div id="00:02:03.800" class="transcript_line"> So it was a main fan and then with three fans at the back.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all in shades of yellow and gold and black with a massive big yellow feather headdress.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great. It took me pretty much the length of the whole camp to make it.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I took it all the way from the very beginning through making the shape of a fibreglass pole and attaching it to the backpack</div><div id="00:02:37.200" class="transcript_line"> and doing all the fabric and the design and then gluing on infinite amounts of feathers and sequins and varying forms of glitter.</div><div id="00:02:46.200" class="transcript_line"> How are your glue gun burns?</div><div id="00:02:47.200" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re just about healed. I did lose a pair of jeans though.</div><div id="00:02:51.200" class="transcript_line"> Were you in them at the time?</div><div id="00:02:54.200" class="transcript_line"> No, I spotted them later. I was like, oh my leg&#039;s sparkling.</div><div id="00:02:58.200" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh wait, no, that&#039;s still glue from glitter everywhere.</div><div id="00:03:03.400" class="transcript_line"> My flat was permanently glittery for the whole time. I think I worked at Twicker.</div><div id="00:03:08.400" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the camp aspires to be and is a genuinely sort of happy place.</div><div id="00:03:15.400" class="transcript_line"> What would you describe, I suppose on one level, you were in the inner sanctum with the seamstress and those who know how to make big things.</div><div id="00:03:24.400" class="transcript_line"> In the even larger room next to you were the community groups working away.</div><div id="00:03:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Give us a clue as to what did it feel like to be there? What was the ambience like? What was the noise like? What were the noise levels like?</div><div id="00:03:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Art was brilliant. Everyone was just so excited about it all the time. Everyone was so happy to be there and so keen to be involved.</div><div id="00:03:44.600" class="transcript_line"> There was such a range of people, I think.</div><div id="00:03:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I always loved the friendly rivalry between different costumes and who had the most feathers and the sequins and the glitter and who looked more fabulous.</div><div id="00:03:56.800" class="transcript_line"> It was just a great atmosphere. Everyone wanted to be so colourful and so flamboyant and so fun. It was just sort of buzzing the whole time.</div><div id="00:04:03.800" class="transcript_line"> Life-affirming?</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, definitely, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Sounds good. Of course, the great day dawned and a bit like today, it was a beautiful, beautiful sunny day.</div><div id="00:04:13.800" class="transcript_line"> You put on this amazing creation.</div><div id="00:04:17.800" class="transcript_line"> I did.</div><div id="00:04:18.800" class="transcript_line"> How windy was the day? What were the ups and downs? What challenges did you face, Lucy?</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> What challenges did you face?</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Parading this large-scale backpack costume through the city centre.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, small spaces were always an issue for me. Any height restrictions were a bit of a...</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it was actually amazing. I did wake up the morning of Carnival and go, oh dear God, what have I signed up for?</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I was like, no, actually, the minute I got that costume on and I got out that door, it was so much fun.</div><div id="00:04:50.200" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it was a bit windy. I think coming round by the Goody Hoo was a battle against the elements.</div><div id="00:04:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I nearly went sideways at one point because I basically had a massive wind sail.</div><div id="00:05:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Last scene, heading in the Barry direction, Lucy Price.</div><div id="00:05:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I also got stuck on a lamppost at one point. That was a highlight. That&#039;s how big the costume was.</div><div id="00:05:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:05:13.200" class="transcript_line"> But no, it was...</div><div id="00:05:14.200" class="transcript_line"> How did you get yourself un-extricated from a lamppost?</div><div id="00:05:17.400" class="transcript_line"> Luckily, some person by helped me out.</div><div id="00:05:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Petch was there as well. Petch was in a costume like mine. She managed to help me out.</div><div id="00:05:25.400" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, there was a moment when I was just like, oh no, try and dance it off.</div><div id="00:05:30.400" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it was awesome.</div><div id="00:05:32.400" class="transcript_line"> And it was, yeah, like I said, I was a bit nervous to start with.</div><div id="00:05:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Then it was kind of, I think, once you get into the spirit of it and that sort of energy that goes round</div><div id="00:05:39.400" class="transcript_line"> and everyone&#039;s sort of, especially when everyone&#039;s lined up ready to go before the Carnival starts, that&#039;s just...</div><div id="00:05:44.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a feverish expectation about the place, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:47.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been an out-of-body experience.</div><div id="00:05:49.600" class="transcript_line"> And the great Cardiff public, how did they react to you?</div><div id="00:05:52.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was lovely. Everyone was so excited to see everyone and people out in the world.</div><div id="00:05:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Were people asking you to stop and post photographs?</div><div id="00:05:59.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:00.600" class="transcript_line"> That sounds nice.</div><div id="00:06:01.600" class="transcript_line"> A lot of pictures. A lot of pictures. I had to put my best cheesy grin on.</div><div id="00:06:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:06:05.600" class="transcript_line"> Try not to blink too much, which I always do.</div><div id="00:06:07.600" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, no, it was brilliant. It was lovely. The atmosphere was just, everyone was so...</div><div id="00:06:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Everyone in the crowd was just so happy and so joyous. It was nice.</div><div id="00:06:18.800" class="transcript_line"> So Carnival, very positive experience. If you had to sum it up in a few words...</div><div id="00:06:25.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t do this to me.</div><div id="00:06:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay, if you didn&#039;t have to sum it up in a few words...</div><div id="00:06:30.800" class="transcript_line"> I had a paragraph when I said...</div><div id="00:06:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Carnival was just amazing. It was just so sort of immersive and so like...</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Just so much joy and fun and happiness I think it brings.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That amount of colour and glitter in anyone&#039;s life is...</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got to be a good thing.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s got to be. I had an amazing time when I was here.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Bless you. Well, thank you for all your contribution, not only in Carnival, but to the company as a whole.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I hereby declare that you, Lucy Price, are a Carnival hero. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yay, thank you.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve now entered history.</div></div></p>
