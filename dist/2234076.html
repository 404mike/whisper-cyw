And the main revenue stream was from the cigarette paper.</div><div id="00:13:22.040" class="transcript_line"> The estate was packed with refugee firms.</div><div id="00:13:26.040" class="transcript_line"> General Paper and Box.</div><div id="00:13:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Metal Products Brackets, Triforce Brackets Limited.</div><div id="00:13:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Planet Gloves.</div><div id="00:13:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Aerozip Fasters.</div><div id="00:13:38.040" class="transcript_line"> Opie Chocolate.</div><div id="00:13:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Burlington Gloves and Burlington Fabrics.</div><div id="00:13:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Wine Brothers.</div><div id="00:13:46.040" class="transcript_line"> Stuart Singham.</div><div id="00:13:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Triforce was an important employer in South Wales and one that fellow refugees could benefit from.</div><div id="00:13:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Refugees elsewhere often faced unfamiliar employment prospects.</div><div id="00:14:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Fanny Huchstetter was originally a civil servant in Stuttgart,</div><div id="00:14:06.040" class="transcript_line"> but in Wales she worked as a chambermaid at the Hand Hotel in Llangollen.</div><div id="00:14:11.040" class="transcript_line"> Her son, Ernie Hunter, describes how she dealt with it.</div><div id="00:14:15.040" class="transcript_line"> She buckled down to it, it&#039;s as simple as that, and from what I gather did whatever was needed,</div><div id="00:14:21.040" class="transcript_line"> even though she was most certainly not used to it.</div><div id="00:14:25.040" class="transcript_line"> So how efficient she was, I do not know,</div><div id="00:14:29.040" class="transcript_line"> because she was certainly not used to that sort of work, doing it at all.</div><div id="00:14:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Some refugees fully immersed themselves in Welsh cultural life.</div><div id="00:14:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Kate Bossagryffeths learnt the language and even published novels, short stories and non-fiction books in Welsh.</div><div id="00:14:47.040" class="transcript_line"> She never lost her German accent though, as Hiany Gryffith, her son, remembers.</div><div id="00:14:52.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I mean, Welsh to outsiders would be difficult to understand because of the accent until they tuned into it.</div><div id="00:15:04.040" class="transcript_line"> The o would always be pronounced as oof.</div><div id="00:15:08.040" class="transcript_line"> So wedi is a word that comes up often, I&#039;ve gone rewediment, or vediment, that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:15:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Forget that, she didn&#039;t lose her German accent.</div><div id="00:15:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Events on the continent, however, were never far away.</div><div id="00:15:30.040" class="transcript_line"> From the beginning of the war, all adult Germans and Austrians living in Britain were classified as so-called enemy aliens.</div><div id="00:15:38.040" class="transcript_line"> Some were jailed, but initially most were permitted to live freely, albeit with certain restrictions.</div><div id="00:15:45.040" class="transcript_line"> George Sherman explains how refugees at Driforest coped with the government-mandated curfew.</div><div id="00:15:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And you had to be in your house by seven o&#039;clock and you were not allowed out after seven.</div><div id="00:15:57.040" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of my friends were Czech, and of course they weren&#039;t subject to the curfew,</div><div id="00:16:03.040" class="transcript_line"> because the Czechs were allies and the Austrians weren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:16:07.040" class="transcript_line"> So mostly the visitors came to my parents because they were free to walk around in the evening and my parents weren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:16:16.040" class="transcript_line"> So this went on, there was a different night.</div><div id="00:16:19.040" class="transcript_line"> It worked like a railway timetable.
