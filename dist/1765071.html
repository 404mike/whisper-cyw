    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Lewis of Vancouver at her home on June the 28th 1974. Now Mrs Lewis you were born in</div><div id="00:00:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Patagonia South America of Welsh parents. Yes I was. And would you like to tell me a bit about</div><div id="00:00:18.920" class="transcript_line"> your parents and how they came out to Patagonia? Yes they came out to Patagonia under the vessel</div><div id="00:00:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Vesta. It was called Vesta and they were there a couple of years before I was born. What was</div><div id="00:00:33.800" class="transcript_line"> your father&#039;s name? My father&#039;s name was Peter Jones. My mother Mary Jones. And where have they</div><div id="00:00:40.080" class="transcript_line"> come from in Wales? Well father come from Mold and mother come from Abergillw. They had moved</div><div id="00:00:53.240" class="transcript_line"> they went to Staffordshire in England where my father worked. And then of course they heard of</div><div id="00:01:01.400" class="transcript_line"> these people going to Patagonia. They were just married the day or so before. They heard of these</div><div id="00:01:08.480" class="transcript_line"> going to Patagonia. So he said well we&#039;ll just sell out and go with them to this new country,</div><div id="00:01:15.560" class="transcript_line"> make a start. So they got down there and there was nothing in the port, nothing there at all,</div><div id="00:01:22.800" class="transcript_line"> only a few corrugated houses, zinc houses. Which port is this? Madryn. In Patagonia. Yes in Patagonia.</div><div id="00:01:31.400" class="transcript_line"> Well then it was sometime after that there was no no trains or anything there, nothing at all. So</div><div id="00:01:40.360" class="transcript_line"> they were going to build this railway. So father went out with them and of course he was the first</div><div id="00:01:46.280" class="transcript_line"> engineer on that railway from Madryn to Trelleu in the valley. And he was on that railway the whole</div><div id="00:01:57.320" class="transcript_line"> time he was there until we left to come to Canada. I forget now how many years it was now, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:04.080" class="transcript_line"> just remember. However when we were leaving in his honour they gave us, put his first-class</div><div id="00:02:15.040" class="transcript_line"> coach on to take us as a family to the coast. Yes. They were only presidents and things that</div><div id="00:02:23.960" class="transcript_line"> rode on that coach but it was in honour of my father&#039;s work with the company. Now where were</div><div id="00:02:31.840" class="transcript_line"> you born? I was born in Port Madryn. Yes. And would you like to tell us where in Port Madryn</div><div id="00:02:38.600" class="transcript_line"> you were born? Well there was no place, it&#039;s only, there&#039;s just a sea and a few space and then the</div><div id="00:02:44.520" class="transcript_line"> hills you see. Yeah. Well of course it&#039;s one of these caves in the hills that I was born. And</div><div id="00:02:50.240" class="transcript_line"> was that where your parents were living at the time? That&#039;s where mother lived yes. That&#039;s where</div><div id="00:02:54.840" class="transcript_line"> they lived. There was no other place for them to live at the time. And then there was another thing,</div><div id="00:03:00.040" class="transcript_line"> there was no water there, no fresh water. So they had to have that brought in over the hills from</div><div id="00:03:07.440" class="transcript_line"> the Chippewa River to Port Madryn for drinking water. And they had to do the best they could out</div><div id="00:03:17.880" class="transcript_line"> of some more, what we&#039;d call them sluice in Canada where the water stood you know. And mother said</div><div id="00:03:26.880" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the only thing they had to wash a few clothes. And when were you born there? Oh I was born there</div><div id="00:03:36.360" class="transcript_line"> in 1887. Yes. The 7th of May 1887. I was told in later years that I was the first white child born</div><div id="00:03:46.400" class="transcript_line"> there. In Patagonia. In Patagonia. In Madryn. I see. Yes. And I don&#039;t know if I should say that here. Yes.</div><div id="00:03:59.240" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if I should say that mother was very ill. Yes. Yes. Of course mother was very ill and</div><div id="00:04:05.480" class="transcript_line"> there was no one there to help at all. So of course she nursed me and she had a very bad gathered</div><div id="00:04:14.320" class="transcript_line"> breast. Nine gathers on her breast. No doctors. Until finally they heard there was a doctor coming</div><div id="00:04:23.200" class="transcript_line"> through from Royal Magro and they stopped him and he lanced these for her. Yes I was called Margaret</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Anne Jones but they told me afterwards I should have been called Margaret Madryn Jones being as I</div><div id="00:04:42.800" class="transcript_line"> was born in Madryn. Many Welsh people do in fact have their middle name, are given their middle name</div><div id="00:04:51.640" class="transcript_line"> after the place where they are born. That&#039;s right there&#039;s an awful lot of them that you know that.</div><div id="00:04:57.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes. However there was a boy that was born in Trelleuw. He was born on Christmas Day and they</div><div id="00:05:07.520" class="transcript_line"> called him John Christmas Jones. Yes. Welsh was the language spoken mostly. Of course my mother</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t speak Welsh she just understood it so we all spoke English in house. And how did you learn</div><div id="00:05:28.160" class="transcript_line"> to speak Welsh? Well by being among the Welsh people. I really never was very good at speaking</div><div id="00:05:36.200" class="transcript_line"> Welsh but I understood everything they said but yet I sang in Welsh and our choirs are all Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:43.880" class="transcript_line"> Could you say a few words for us in Welsh now then? Well I should say siad ach i hiddu.</div><div id="00:05:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Pa&#039; i aith o chi&#039;n siarad yn yr ysgol?</div><div id="00:05:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Spanish.</div><div id="00:05:54.880" class="transcript_line"> A chi&#039;n cael eich dysgu trwy&#039;r iaith ysbeineg?</div><div id="00:05:59.880" class="transcript_line"> O&#039;r ddraed inni.</div><div id="00:06:00.880" class="transcript_line"> Y dim Cymraeg o gwbl?</div><div id="00:06:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Na&#039;r Cymraeg o gwbl.</div><div id="00:06:04.720" class="transcript_line"> Athro ysbeineg oedd gyda chi felly neu Cymro oedd yr Athro?</div><div id="00:06:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Mi oedd yn un Cymro arllall yn Sbaenid. Edward o&#039;r temps aldereti.</div><div id="00:06:15.720" class="transcript_line"> A beth oedd enw&#039;r Cymro?</div><div id="00:06:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes that&#039;s it. An Athro Cymraeg oedd Aro Jones. Well Edward o&#039;r temps aldereti he was the head</div><div id="00:06:27.560" class="transcript_line"> teacher. Aro Jones was like under him you see. And so Aldereti said that we would have to</div><div id="00:06:35.240" class="transcript_line"> speak Spanish and play Spanish and everything when we were in the grounds, while we were</div><div id="00:06:40.240" class="transcript_line"> in the grounds. So we used to play, now one thing we used to play, there were two rows</div><div id="00:06:46.760" class="transcript_line"> of us girls like this. And the one would come and say, o we bwendisus senorita, tra la</div><div id="00:06:53.800" class="transcript_line"> la la la la la. And then we&#039;d go and say, ke keria sus senorita? Mantantirulirula,</div><div id="00:07:07.680" class="transcript_line"> yo keria una de sus ijas. Tra la la la la la. Then they&#039;d say, kual de elias keria usted?</div><div id="00:07:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Jo keria a Maria. Tra la la la la la la. That&#039;s how we played.</div><div id="00:07:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Very good. Did you play any games in Welsh at all?</div><div id="00:07:29.240" class="transcript_line"> No I can&#039;t remember ever playing anything in Welsh. No. You see we went and out the</div><div id="00:07:34.840" class="transcript_line"> teacher told us while in the grounds it was all Spanish. Didn&#039;t want anything else. See?</div><div id="00:07:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Although you had to speak Spanish in school, you spoke Welsh in the church.</div><div id="00:07:46.280" class="transcript_line"> Well the services, I tell you we had English services in our church in the morning for</div><div id="00:07:53.800" class="transcript_line"> those that didn&#039;t understand the Welsh. I see.</div><div id="00:07:57.960" class="transcript_line"> And then at night it was a Welsh service. Of course there were some Englishmen living</div><div id="00:08:04.280" class="transcript_line"> in Traleo too you see. And one man&#039;s name was Mr. Theobald. Well he was a real Englishman.</div><div id="00:08:11.280" class="transcript_line"> He had a store there. Well he used to come to our church. Well he wouldn&#039;t come if he</div><div id="00:08:15.880" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t understand it. So they had English in the morning and then Welsh service at night.</div><div id="00:08:23.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And did you attend both services usually? Oh yeah. Three times a day they sent a school</div><div id="00:08:31.800" class="transcript_line"> at two o&#039;clock from two to four. Come home and of course mum would be home. She&#039;d have</div><div id="00:08:39.080" class="transcript_line"> our tea ready. And after tea we were back in church at six o&#039;clock. How far away from</div><div id="00:08:45.800" class="transcript_line"> the church did he live? Oh well no distance from the church. No. No. Why did your father</div><div id="00:08:51.320" class="transcript_line"> decide to leave Patagonia? Well he didn&#039;t want for one thing for his daughter to move</div><div id="00:09:00.800" class="transcript_line"> to Maria Spaniard. I see. And the other was that the boys when they become the age of</div><div id="00:09:08.640" class="transcript_line"> eighteen they would enrol them into the army. And father didn&#039;t want that either. He said</div><div id="00:09:18.320" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t mind if it was just the British or the Americans but not for the Spanish army.</div><div id="00:09:25.320" class="transcript_line"> And were there any other reasons? Yes. A father was one of the first ones going into the</div><div id="00:09:34.320" class="transcript_line"> valley and he was promised a piece of land. I don&#039;t remember now how large but it was</div><div id="00:09:40.520" class="transcript_line"> quite a farm. Was this in Chiboot? Yes in Chiboot. And he was promised land and he never</div><div id="00:09:47.840" class="transcript_line"> got. Well before we left Patagonia we were in the village of Patagonia. And we were in</div><div id="00:09:55.360" class="transcript_line"> the village of Patagonia. We had some friends in the Spanish army and one was the commander</div><div id="00:09:59.240" class="transcript_line"> of the barracks. Great friend of ours. Was he a Spaniard? Yes he was a Spaniard. He came</div><div id="00:10:04.840" class="transcript_line"> to see us and he said Mr Jones why are you leaving our beautiful country? Well father</div><div id="00:10:14.240" class="transcript_line"> said one thing he said I never got the land that they promised me. Oh well he would see</div><div id="00:10:22.240" class="transcript_line"> about that. But then it was too late because they arranged to come to Canada by that time.</div><div id="00:10:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes father made it in mind to come to Canada. I was fifteen years old about two days after</div><div id="00:10:44.040" class="transcript_line"> we got started for Liverpool on board. And how long did it take you to get to Liverpool?</div><div id="00:10:51.240" class="transcript_line"> It took us a month. And were the conditions bad on the boat? No they were very good really.</div><div id="00:10:58.440" class="transcript_line"> They were very pleasant you know. When of course when they come to the equator they</div><div id="00:11:03.560" class="transcript_line"> had to put canvas all over the top of the boat. It was so hot. But otherwise it was</div><div id="00:11:08.840" class="transcript_line"> just fine. My sister was only nine months old and she started to learn to walk on board</div><div id="00:11:16.840" class="transcript_line"> and walk as well as she could because she&#039;d tumbled down on the boat you know swinging.</div><div id="00:11:22.840" class="transcript_line"> When you got to Liverpool what happened? Well when we got to Liverpool we had the three</div><div id="00:11:30.080" class="transcript_line"> days to stay in Liverpool. But father wanted to go and see his sister living eight miles</div><div id="00:11:38.080" class="transcript_line"> out to Liverpool. So we spent one night at my aunt&#039;s and then we went across to Birkenhead</div><div id="00:11:47.800" class="transcript_line"> to see my father&#039;s brother living over there. And then we came back again to Liverpool in</div><div id="00:11:59.280" class="transcript_line"> time to catch the boat for Canada. And we were back. And we were back to the boat. And</div><div id="00:12:07.640" class="transcript_line"> we had to wait around until twelve o&#039;clock that night and the train would be going east.</div><div id="00:12:16.840" class="transcript_line"> We got as far as Winnipeg. I believe it. No we got as far as Winnipeg. But on the way</div><div id="00:12:26.520" class="transcript_line"> before landing in Winnipeg there was a little baby girl that had died. And they stopped</div><div id="00:12:32.280" class="transcript_line"> off there to bury her in Ottawa. Then between Ottawa and Winnipeg there was a little girl</div><div id="00:12:43.240" class="transcript_line"> born on the train. Yes the father and the mother&#039;s name was William Thomas. And the</div><div id="00:12:51.640" class="transcript_line"> daughter, well she did live there in Victoria. Whether she&#039;s there now I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:12:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Now did you bring with you from South America any of your possessions? Oh yes. Yes. My mother</div><div id="00:13:10.520" class="transcript_line"> brought a sewing machine. A hand sewing machine. And of course the clock. You have the clock</div><div id="00:13:19.800" class="transcript_line"> here now? Yes we have the clock here now. And where was it made? It was really in the</div><div id="00:13:29.120" class="transcript_line"> UK in England. But it was made for a company in Chubut. Fabricado para Juan Iyichos. And</div><div id="00:13:38.600" class="transcript_line"> what is the name? Buenos Aires. Yes the people had quite a hard time when they first came</div><div id="00:13:45.920" class="transcript_line"> out of Canada. They weren&#039;t prepared for the severe winters. We thought we were bringing</div><div id="00:13:51.960" class="transcript_line"> good warm coats out from Patagonia. But there were only summer coats compared to the ones</div><div id="00:13:58.520" class="transcript_line"> they used in Canada. Where exactly did you settle then in Canada? Well we settled 17</div><div id="00:14:06.880" class="transcript_line"> miles out of Salkoos. It was named Llewellyn Settlement. Even to this day it&#039;s called Llewellyn</div><div id="00:14:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Settlement. That was one settlement. There was another settlement a little bit east of</div><div id="00:14:21.560" class="transcript_line"> the settlement. And it was called Atwater. Still called Atwater. And did your father</div><div id="00:14:28.800" class="transcript_line"> farm the land? Yes. Then father took up this land and he farmed. Until after the world</div><div id="00:14:38.960" class="transcript_line"> war because he was growing a lot of grain that time and he was able to sell it at a</div><div id="00:14:44.420" class="transcript_line"> good price because of the war. What did you do when you first came out to Saskatchewan?</div><div id="00:14:51.560" class="transcript_line"> I really didn&#039;t do anything. Did you help on the farm? Well yes of course I had to</div><div id="00:15:01.640" class="transcript_line"> help on the farm. Especially when dad cut in the grain and he only had a knox team and</div><div id="00:15:08.480" class="transcript_line"> they went fast enough so I had to walk near them to give them a poke every once in a while</div><div id="00:15:16.180" class="transcript_line"> to make them go a little faster to run the binder. And what about your husband? When</div><div id="00:15:23.420" class="transcript_line"> did you meet your husband? Oh well that&#039;s quite a different story. It seems that he</div><div id="00:15:29.620" class="transcript_line"> had been in when he was in Montana and he&#039;d come over to see his uncle, the man that brought</div><div id="00:15:35.380" class="transcript_line"> him out from Wales. And he found out that there was quite a colony and so he couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:15:43.380" class="transcript_line"> find the post office, well in post office he wanted to find it. So the first house he</div><div id="00:15:49.580" class="transcript_line"> came to from his uncle&#039;s was our house. And of course he got off there and of course he</div><div id="00:15:59.820" class="transcript_line"> asked mom the directions to the post office. Well he stayed for a little while. I wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:16:06.060" class="transcript_line"> home at the time but he stayed for a little while and when I got home he was a bronco</div><div id="00:16:12.020" class="transcript_line"> tied right to the doorknob almost and I couldn&#039;t get in because of this awful animal that was</div><div id="00:16:19.020" class="transcript_line"> tied there. And I went into the house there and saw this little fellow, cowboy hat, high</div><div id="00:16:26.020" class="transcript_line"> heeled shoes, boots you know. Well my first, my first idea was him I thought, my he&#039;s a</div><div id="00:16:33.900" class="transcript_line"> funny looking little fellow. However it seems that he was a very nice little fellow. And</div><div id="00:16:41.860" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d, I don&#039;t know whether he had any ideas about me or not, I don&#039;t know. But he did</div><div id="00:16:48.260" class="transcript_line"> come back again and settled just in the next farm to us. Well his partner left him so he</div><div id="00:16:58.020" class="transcript_line"> was all alone there. Father went down there one day to see this bachelor and so he said</div><div id="00:17:05.420" class="transcript_line"> to him, well there&#039;s no issue living down here all alone, you might as well come and</div><div id="00:17:09.260" class="transcript_line"> live with us. That&#039;s how I met my husband. Help it to be. And when you married him did</div><div id="00:17:18.940" class="transcript_line"> you move back to his farm? No, no it wasn&#039;t his farm really, he only rented it. He rented</div><div id="00:17:25.380" class="transcript_line"> it from a man called Coslet Thomas. Another Welshman? Another Welshman, yes. Because he&#039;d</div><div id="00:17:32.740" class="transcript_line"> gone into town, into the little town of Bangor to open a store. That was his work in South</div><div id="00:17:39.260" class="transcript_line"> America, store keeper. Coslet Thomas? Yes Coslet Thomas, yes. And what about the Welsh</div><div id="00:17:48.220" class="transcript_line"> community in Saskatchewan? Did you find that you all met together and spoke Welsh to each</div><div id="00:17:55.380" class="transcript_line"> other? Oh yes, we had Welsh services and choirs, choirs worth listening to. Welsh choirs. Yes,</div><div id="00:18:05.460" class="transcript_line"> we did. We had, we&#039;re just real Welsh colony. Did you always sing in Welsh in the choir?</div><div id="00:18:12.740" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes I always sang in Welsh. Well nearly I don&#039;t think we ever did sing English, we</div><div id="00:18:20.460" class="transcript_line"> all sang Welsh you know. Can you remember any of the songs that you would have sung?</div><div id="00:18:28.460" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll put some of them.</div><div id="00:18:47.460" class="transcript_line"> When did you leave the Welsh community in Saskatchewan? In 1907, I went to Maple Creek, Saskatchewan.</div><div id="00:18:55.460" class="transcript_line"> We lived there for some time. Why did you leave? Well because my husband, he was more</div><div id="00:19:02.460" class="transcript_line"> western than anything else, he&#039;d been used to cowboying you see. And he wanted to get</div><div id="00:19:08.180" class="transcript_line"> back to that kind of work. What did you think of Wales when you first visited it in 1963?</div><div id="00:19:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh I loved it. Yes it was very nice. First I went to Holywell and then they took me all</div><div id="00:19:23.180" class="transcript_line"> around through Carnarvon Sheer and all over and then I went to Carnarvon Castle and many</div><div id="00:19:32.860" class="transcript_line"> other places before I left. From there I went to London. And even though that was your first</div><div id="00:19:42.180" class="transcript_line"> visit after living overseas for so many years, do you still feel that you are Welsh? Well</div><div id="00:19:49.900" class="transcript_line"> very much so. Very much so. That&#039;s one thing that&#039;s in my blood. Why is this?
