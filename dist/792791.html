    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your name?</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Ian. I live in Bangor. And in Bangor I grow fruit trees.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been growing trees there for probably 30 years or so.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Prior to that I used to work in Canada in the woods.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was Mr Organic at that time, shall we say, in the area.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And about 15 years ago I found, or rather I took credit for the discovery of the Bardsey Island apple avalanche.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And that really sort of led to a resurgence of Welsh varieties.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And now that&#039;s all I do. I only produce Welsh varieties of apple and other fruit.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a friend called Andy and we used to creep around looking.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go in our old orchards, for example, old abandoned orchards, old stately homes and stuff.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And looking for old trees that were still alive and doing well.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> If a tree was 100 years old, let&#039;s say, and still producing and still healthy and producing good fruit,</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> it would obviously be a good candidate to produce and grow in North Wales.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because prior to that there was no written knowledge about how fruit trees were doing North Wales or Wales in general.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the people that wrote the books, they all came from Kent, the Garden of England, where all the big time experts are.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So me and Andy were creeping about, used to creep about.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And one summer or autumn he was working on Bardsey Island, ringing birds.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s a migratory stop and there&#039;s the oldest bird observatory in Britain, in Bardsey Island apparently.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And someone said, go to that old apple tree by that house, mate, and put some apples in the mist net, you know, a funnel shaped thin net to catch the birds, which they can ring.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And he did that and didn&#039;t recognise what the apples were, ground in this strange little island.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And the tree had been smashed and battered against the wall of the house.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And despite that, the fruit were really clean and really good.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So he brought them to me, the fruit, I didn&#039;t know, going to the local experts supposedly, I didn&#039;t know what they were.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But I sent the fruit then to the National Fruit Collection.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> This is just one and a half fruit really by then.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And the experts there proclaimed that it was a unique variety.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And since then it&#039;s been genetically fingerprinted so that we know that it is.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how the Bardsey Island apple, the avalently, came about.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Interestingly, we just spoke to Emily from the Clamberis Cider Society.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And Andy was living in one little shed on the island.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Emily was living in another and they got it together.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it might well be maybe Emily and all her charms should take the credit for the discovery of the apple.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it was me that then started to propagate the tree and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it really.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, so for three or four years I started making Bardsey apple trees.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Making them at my own expense, going to the island collecting little titty bits of salt burnt wood.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And buying root stops and grafting them.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;d make the trees, sell the trees and then give all the money to the trust that run the island.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> People would just make their checks out to the Bardsey Island Trust.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did that for three or four years, which was fine by me.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I started making the Bardsey apple and surprisingly selling them very well.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then people started saying, oh, they&#039;ve got rare apples in their garden.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got old apples or things like that.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I started then doing sort of academic research and gradually over the years accumulated a collection of 50 or so perhaps, something like that.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And gone wider now.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean the other big thing is the Denby plum, which is the only Welsh plum, which is about to get its PGI protected geographic indication status.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think this year I&#039;m going there on Sunday to find that out.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that would be good because it would be a big deal for Denby.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Denby needs something. It&#039;s a ghost town really.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Just because they&#039;ve either been bred or evolved or been found, that they do well in this climate.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> When I say this climate, I don&#039;t necessarily mean Clambereth youth hostel because no one lives above here.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> People used to grow fruit around here.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think my theory is that once Lord Penryn financed the railway from basically from Penryn to the rest of the world,</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Carrie&#039;s slate, you then got empty wagons bringing all kinds of other English produce.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So any Welsh orchards would have faded away.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there were commercial orchard projects in De Frenc Onwy Valley.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There were commercials growing there I believe.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> They would just get swamped with imports.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I discovered another word.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I, by various ways, I&#039;ve resurrected old varieties.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they&#039;re interesting from a cultural point of view with the big C.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And from a cultural point of view with the little C, they grow here.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Most varieties from England or other foreign countries won&#039;t do here.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s too cold, it&#039;s too wet, it&#039;s too damp.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The soil&#039;s too poor. They don&#039;t ripen. There&#039;s not enough sunlight.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you get varieties that do well here, then you don&#039;t have to spray them.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people want to grow things organically and they think that&#039;s just letting them grow, not spraying them.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But it doesn&#039;t work like that. You have to grow things organically.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The number one thing is to plant the right varieties for your area.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, at Pant D, there&#039;s a big cider orchard that&#039;s got two and a half thousand trees at Penangreis, Jalisarn Penangreis Way.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got about a thousand of my trees.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s good to see how each of those does in comparison with each other.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And also in comparison with standard cider varieties.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And for example, Gwech Namil, better than a thousand, Sikno Ferver, that is their favourite up there.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So that does really well and it has a lot of juice, so it&#039;s good for cider.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> All the others up there, all of mine are doing well.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean in comparison, or the Avalon Lee Bards is doing well for sweet cider.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> In comparison with most of the English ones, which are doing terribly, they&#039;re from Somerset or Devon or somewhere much a nicer climate than the North Wales have to offer.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a good, with Richard up there, his mistakes are good as a knowledge base.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go there and you can compare different varieties.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully your Roche Perry project is doing that sort of thing as well, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately that will take time before we get any results of that.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I would have suggested when the project was set up, it would have been good to have someone or people going around looking at existing trees and existing, you could get a lot of knowledge from that.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t get any knowledge from a two-year-old tree at all, we don&#039;t get any fruit.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas I don&#039;t think there was part of this project, was there?</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think of people going around looking, I mean someone could have come to me and gone through my computer records and hard copy records and then had a list of people that had bought trees off me and then they could have gone around Wales.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> If they were old records, like paper records, they could have gone around seeing how those trees were doing rather than, well both are good to plant trial orchards but also visiting existing trees.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m not a cider producer and most of these varieties I would say nobody knows because they haven&#039;t been around, they&#039;ve been around but neglected, they haven&#039;t been planted.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean that&#039;s what I said, you could have done with someone from the Royal Parry people, have gone around to have found that out.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My trouble is I sell a bunch of trees to someone and then I rarely hear from them again and then also it&#039;s realistically going to take ten years before planting a tree and the tree is then getting to its maximum cropping potential.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we actually know how it does. For example, Guachnamil, the favourite at Pant D, the mother tree that I have has become strongly biennial. Loads of fruit one year, nothing the next.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well that doesn&#039;t matter to me because I&#039;m only really producing wood and knowledge when I grow a tree.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re planting a commercial plantation you don&#039;t want your trees to become biennial which they don&#039;t, it takes a few years and obviously a few years of neglect before they get these biennial habits.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If they are strongly biennial it makes them, you will be less inclined to plant them because you will have years with almost zero crop. A lot of side of the trees are biennial.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve just grafted, I don&#039;t know, 2,300 trees, something like that. That&#039;s really intense. Not just doing the grafting but preparing everything and this year I changed my system totally as well of how to grow the trees.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have a typical time. From November onwards I spend a lot of time packaging trees and sending them off. I&#039;m primarily now an internet business.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to supply all the garden centres in the area and I&#039;ve gradually stopped doing that. I still deal with the public, I get a lot of public come round.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t work five days a week, I mean I work seven days a week sometimes. I don&#039;t have any regular, it always seems to be stuff to do.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well now I can have a little break. The grafting is done. Over this weekend I repaired problems with the irrigation system so now I could have a couple of weeks off, which I probably will.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But there again I&#039;ve got to repair polytunnels, you know, winter damage. I still haven&#039;t had time to do that yet.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> If you go to my website now there&#039;s not much that I&#039;ve got left. So hopefully sales are peaking off.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> People buy the trees all year round. You go to B&amp;Q, people buy pots of plants with lovely pretty little flowers on. We&#039;re not meant to do that. If you plant them the flowers die.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> People are out of touch with seasonality and out of touch with plant physiology. You should plant things when they&#039;re dormant.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> In garden centres people buy them with apples on, which you shouldn&#039;t do that. I used to obviously, being a proper nursery man, rub out any small fruit because they&#039;d do well when they were planted.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But then I realised that if you leave the fruit on people buy them more. So I stopped doing that, which is bad really. There&#039;s marketing and that.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The trees that I&#039;ve grafted can sit there. Summer&#039;s starting to move but there&#039;s a month or so of just rubbing out growth on the rootstocks to force the sap up into the scion with the piece of wood I&#039;ve grafted on.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> In the summer I try and do something with my boys if that&#039;s possible, go away somewhere. Well I force myself to go. I pay people to look after the place.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I will lose trees to an extent and lose business to an extent but I don&#039;t really care. I&#039;d rather have my life rather than the work situation.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I don&#039;t have land, I don&#039;t have a great big tractor that could plough up a field and I could stick all the trees in and walk away.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I just have a reclaimed swamp with a lot of builders&#039; rubble on top of it. So it&#039;s not an ideal situation at all.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> If you want to be successful as a farmer or a grower, the best thing to do is inherit your father&#039;s farm. And I didn&#039;t do that, I made a mistake there.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite often unfortunately community groups end up in pretty useless places to plant the trees, like this place here is to be honest.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting to find out what goes wrong with the trees but when you&#039;re given pieces it&#039;s hard to find pieces of land.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The good lands are all tied up by the farmers as a rule. That&#039;s a major problem.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Also a major problem with community groups is it often ends up one or two people doing it. And then if there&#039;s one or two people sort of fade away, the trees are just left.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve just spent some time at Moylakee and I&#039;ve said I&#039;d go back there and help them. These are trees that I supplied them about 15 years ago and they&#039;re terrible.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And over the years people have come, took an interest and then faded away. And I go there every couple of years and offer advice and do stuff.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Usually unpaid, gets a bit depression really after a while.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s the nature of community projects. I&#039;m not running them down but often they get the worst land.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Here I would say it&#039;s unsuitable but it was available obviously. Where they planted at Moylakee was unsuitable but available.</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s often the problem. Land in this country, good land, is hard to come by. I mean I don&#039;t have any.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I donated a load of trees to the surgery in Clamberis. There&#039;s not a great place because I think they get vandalised quite easily.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Some that, and then you get counsel. The trouble is, especially with fruit trees, it requires quite a lot of knowledge, quite a lot of prior knowledge.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So really you could say that the first few generations of trees you buy could well be destined to failure.</div><div id="00:17:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The first trees I planted I got from the skip behind Moylakee where they&#039;d thrown them out thinking this is great, I&#039;m getting trees for nothing.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it probably took ten years for me growing those unsuitable trees I&#039;ve got to grow to find out that they were disease prone.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That I&#039;d chosen them. Even if I&#039;d bought them they would have been the wrong ones.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve got community groups, people at large, commercial people like Richard of Pandy, he planted two and a half thousand cider trees.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s already replaced over a thousand of those, grabbed them up with a thousand of mine, Welsh ones are more suitable.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I would say almost everybody is destined to make mistakes. If you go to a garden centre they&#039;re bloody useless, they don&#039;t know anything.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If you go to Liddell&#039;s or Tesco&#039;s to buy your trees where people buy them now, they know nothing.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They know nothing and you won&#039;t even, you would just, people just assume that what are in Tesco&#039;s in the fruit section are ones that will grow in your garden.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Why wouldn&#039;t they? And they don&#039;t. Especially in North Wales or Wales in general.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah I would say whoever plants their trees their first one or two orchards are going to be a steep learning curve as a rule.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously there&#039;s more knowledge out there now, like with you lot, with me to an extent I suppose.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> People will come to me and say I want some trees for Clamberis and I now have a bit of an idea.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas prior to that they would sell you, the garden centres sell you the trees that people know.</div><div id="00:19:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The trees that grow in up here on the shelves in Tesco&#039;s. Read your books, read your books.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But some people would do that. There&#039;s plenty of stuff online obviously.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately people starting off aren&#039;t aware of the problems.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t know anything, chances are you will assume that you could just go to a garden centre, pay your money and plant the tree.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the garden centre staff now are totally untrained as a rule. They will know nothing either.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You ideally go online and there&#039;s plenty of stuff there.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean I spent a lot of years collecting varieties from places with a Celtic climate.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I&#039;ve still got a lot of Irish apples, a lot of Devon Cornwall apples, a lot of Scottish ones that have all got comparable climates to here.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> To test them, to see how, and that&#039;s what I used to do.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was making a collection of disease resistant varieties that would do well in Wales.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> With the discovery of the Avowentley, Bardsley Island apple, I then changed my direction because I then started to sell Welsh ones.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the Welsh ones of course just because they happen to have come from Wales doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they would do in all of Wales.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales really varies climatically like the Monmouth ones. Monmouth is the same as England, it has been isn&#039;t it, in its day.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;ve got altitude differences. You&#039;ve got the highest mountain, the lowest beaches.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got Snowdon just behind us and you&#039;ve got Anglesey just down there.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Sea level is only four or five miles away.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So what might do well in Carnarvon might not do well where we are now for example.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> To do your research, the trouble with doing research is you often have to be pre-warned as to what you&#039;re looking for and you might not know that.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a lady, she bought trees off me in the past and she was commercial and she wanted 25 of these, 25 of that and 50 Bakers Delicious.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said why on earth would you want 50 Bakers Delicious?</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re an early apple and they go off in a couple of weeks.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got 50 trees, you&#039;ve got 100 pounds, that&#039;s 5,000, that&#039;s five tonnes of apples which you&#039;ve got to get rid of in two weeks or something.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;d done all her research and asking around and it turned out Bakers Delicious did well where she lived and everybody liked it.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But she didn&#039;t realise it&#039;s a bit like having 5,000 lettuces.</div><div id="00:22:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a problem if you grow something like that, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re much better off spreading something out.</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;d done her research but not quite enough.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the trouble.</div><div id="00:23:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a difficult problem and I&#039;ve made more mistakes than anybody I&#039;m sure over the years, planted inappropriate things.</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you can then get a little bit of knowledge and you find that, like I say, that a variety might be disease resistant but the season is very short so you can only have a few of those.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Or it might be biennial.</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You could easily end up planting four or five orchards sequentially one after the other, gradually improving how you do it.</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But after you&#039;ve done four or five you&#039;re probably dead.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lifetime gone, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So all this stuff, it&#039;s really protracted.</div><div id="00:23:50.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why your two-year project is you need to spend the rest of your life doing this.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure you can&#039;t face it but that&#039;s what you should do.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And even then when you do that then you get climate change so Wales will soon no longer have a Welsh climate.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s something else to consider.</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re now 22 days in advance of what we used to be.</div><div id="00:24:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m grafting 22 days earlier.</div><div id="00:24:19.000" class="transcript_line"> This is, we&#039;ve got lots of records of national fruit collection and stuff of when things flower and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re 22 days earlier.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That makes it, it&#039;s not as simple as 22 days.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not as simple as grafting 22 days earlier because last year I grafted, it was really hot, I panicked, I grafted early then it got really cold and I lost quite a few hundred trees because of that.</div><div id="00:24:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got things like diseases changing.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Brown rock millennia is devastating all the plums and damsons around here.</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m selling the denby plum as a disease resistant plum.</div><div id="00:25:03.000" class="transcript_line"> If conditions change then it might, the denby plum, it&#039;s the same thing that&#039;s produced in the 1780s that hasn&#039;t changed.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But millennia, the disease can change, the climate can change so that it could therefore make that plum variety susceptible.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So nobody knows. It&#039;s a difficult problem.</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a long term project but the climate and the world might be changing quicker than our knowledge can evolve.</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a happy note there for you.</div><div id="00:25:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my neighbour used to sell carpets.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> His hobby, and I&#039;ve worked through trees in his garden, was raising pigeons.</div><div id="00:25:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s an internationally famous and successful pigeon racer.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got about 300 in his loft.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to him, why don&#039;t you stop selling carpets and concentrate on your pigeons?</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said it would probably, he would lose his hobby and it would become a job.</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was up to me. It&#039;s a job. I don&#039;t really, it&#039;s my job now.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That makes it different, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:26:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t go to Canada, I used to work in Canada every year. I don&#039;t go there anymore.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I do this. I don&#039;t know why I do it.</div><div id="00:26:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had my son working for me the last couple of weeks. That&#039;s been really good.</div><div id="00:26:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s just got a degree from Cardiff in music composition.</div><div id="00:26:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be great if he took it over to an extent but I rather doubt it.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Kids don&#039;t want to do that sort of stuff anymore.</div><div id="00:26:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I do it because people ring me up and you have to do it sort of thing.</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve never worked so much in my life as constantly, I&#039;ve never done that before.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to do more exciting things.</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d go to Canada, make my money and then do whatever.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Travel the world or try and change it.</div><div id="00:27:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not doing that at the moment.</div><div id="00:27:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I would like to, I would really like to go down to Kent or wherever</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and see how the big boys do it. But there&#039;s such a leap.</div><div id="00:27:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m only backyard really.</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I did go to a Kent grower, friend of a friend, and he&#039;d been there.</div><div id="00:27:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;d been there five generations.</div><div id="00:27:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s had three farms, huge, huge, huge.</div><div id="00:27:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And within a few sentences I knew I was in another league.</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what he was talking about.</div><div id="00:28:01.000" class="transcript_line"> There are no courses in pirmology.</div><div id="00:28:05.000" class="transcript_line"> As far as I did look, I looked quite hard a few years ago.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not worried about getting some certificate to hang on the wall,</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got enough of that stuff.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not worried about academic qualifications,</div><div id="00:28:19.000" class="transcript_line"> but I just thought if I tagged along and went down there for a couple of weeks somewhere,</div><div id="00:28:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I just couldn&#039;t find anything.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I was quite shocked really.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And maybe that&#039;s how it is.</div><div id="00:28:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe there are other courses.</div><div id="00:28:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I did look.</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a course in September, Welsh Perry one,</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> which I signed up for, said I was interested.</div><div id="00:28:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But then having looked at the website of the people doing it,</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s all very permacultury, which is all very well,</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> but probably might not go to that.</div><div id="00:28:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But otherwise, yeah, I&#039;d like to go down to Kent to see.</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s Mickey Mouse and it about, or small scale.</div><div id="00:29:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s the big industrial scale, and not much in between.</div><div id="00:29:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d like to, there&#039;s lots to learn out there, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:29:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And with everything in life, the more you know, the more you know there is to know.</div><div id="00:29:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You can do it like I do it, just trial and error.</div><div id="00:29:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that implies that most of the things you do are wrong,</div><div id="00:29:32.000" class="transcript_line"> which is fair enough, it&#039;s how you learn.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I would like to go in some courses like Pershaw College.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I rung them up and there was nothing there.</div><div id="00:29:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The local college, the North Wales one, at Northop, they ring me up.</div></div></p>
