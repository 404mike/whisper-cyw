    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Carter Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Jane</div><div id="00:00:08.360" class="transcript_line"> Winterbottom. Today&#039;s date is the 13th of October 2015 and the location of the interview</div><div id="00:00:15.520" class="transcript_line"> is the Swiffer office. Jane, before we start, would you be kind enough to spell your name</div><div id="00:00:20.720" class="transcript_line"> in full please?</div><div id="00:00:22.160" class="transcript_line"> J-A-N-E-W-I-N-T-E-R-B-O-W-T-O-N.</div><div id="00:00:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much. Jane, can you remember when you first made contact with Carter Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was through a friend of mine who was involved with it anyway. She wanted someone,</div><div id="00:00:37.600" class="transcript_line"> they needed people in the carnival so I volunteered. I did the workshops, made, what year was it,</div><div id="00:00:45.800" class="transcript_line"> do you know, it was 2010?</div><div id="00:00:48.600" class="transcript_line"> 2010, yes.</div><div id="00:00:51.080" class="transcript_line"> So me and a friend went to the workshops and we made our ladies in waiting costume, did</div><div id="00:00:55.600" class="transcript_line"> the carnival. I also did a St. David&#039;s Day parade as well because they were short of</div><div id="00:01:00.720" class="transcript_line"> people so I volunteered for that and then got involved with the swicker, you know, the</div><div id="00:01:07.200" class="transcript_line"> carnival workshops.</div><div id="00:01:08.200" class="transcript_line"> Got it. In the St. David&#039;s Day parade, were you a red dragon in big wings?</div><div id="00:01:12.200" class="transcript_line"> I was a red dragon.</div><div id="00:01:13.200" class="transcript_line"> Was it sunny that St. David&#039;s Day?</div><div id="00:01:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:01:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:01:17.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a lovely day actually, yes, it was really good. It was the first sort of</div><div id="00:01:22.360" class="transcript_line"> time I&#039;d done the actual parade and it was really exciting.</div><div id="00:01:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Excellent. Of course, with wings on, they&#039;re relatively light and reasonably good in a</div><div id="00:01:30.960" class="transcript_line"> high wind but of course...</div><div id="00:01:31.960" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit windy and they were going over our faces a bit so we had to...</div><div id="00:01:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Veiled dragons present stumbling into a manhole.</div><div id="00:01:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was good fun. There was a good crowd actually watching us so that makes a difference.</div><div id="00:01:45.960" class="transcript_line"> But from a relatively light pair of wings, you progressed in your carnival career to</div><div id="00:01:53.560" class="transcript_line"> wearing a much bigger costume. Would you care to tell us...</div><div id="00:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was a football. A very heavy football.</div><div id="00:02:00.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great, lovely. I was a football.</div><div id="00:02:02.560" class="transcript_line"> I was a football.</div><div id="00:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> The main football, which was very heavy. I had it on my shoulders.</div><div id="00:02:08.560" class="transcript_line"> On a backpack?</div><div id="00:02:10.160" class="transcript_line"> On a backpack, yes, which is quite hard to keep up actually. You don&#039;t realise as you&#039;re</div><div id="00:02:17.160" class="transcript_line"> walking, it&#039;s very heavy. You put it on, you think, oh, it&#039;ll be fine. And then as you&#039;re</div><div id="00:02:21.160" class="transcript_line"> walking, because it&#039;s quite a long route, you&#039;re walking for about at least an hour.</div><div id="00:02:25.160" class="transcript_line"> 90 minutes is quite normal.</div><div id="00:02:27.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, an hour and a half. And you&#039;re supposed to try and do it...</div><div id="00:02:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Including getting ready because of course you&#039;ve got to get it all new.</div><div id="00:02:32.160" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got your face paint done, you&#039;ve got to get everything set up as well. So you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:02:35.160" class="transcript_line"> been on for a long time and it gets heavier as you go, definitely. And I think it was</div><div id="00:02:40.160" class="transcript_line"> raining then as well, so everything was wet and everything was coming off.</div><div id="00:02:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Slowly disintegrating in the parade.</div><div id="00:02:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, slowly, leaving a trail of glitter and sequins as we walked along. But no, because</div><div id="00:02:52.160" class="transcript_line"> all the face paint was going as well because everything was in face paint and of course</div><div id="00:02:55.160" class="transcript_line"> it was raining.</div><div id="00:02:56.160" class="transcript_line"> It starts to run. It&#039;s a good look.</div><div id="00:02:58.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is a good look.</div><div id="00:03:00.160" class="transcript_line"> And what music were you dancing to?</div><div id="00:03:02.160" class="transcript_line"> It was the...</div><div id="00:03:04.160" class="transcript_line"> Wonder Brass?</div><div id="00:03:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Wonder Brass, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:03:08.160" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:03:09.160" class="transcript_line"> They keep us going. Good morale, so everyone&#039;s having a dance. So yeah, you&#039;ve got to dance</div><div id="00:03:14.160" class="transcript_line"> with your back.</div><div id="00:03:15.160" class="transcript_line"> And you were sort of like the mothership to a satellite.</div><div id="00:03:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I had a lot of little couples behind me.</div><div id="00:03:20.160" class="transcript_line"> You had a lot of little couples behind you, but they weren&#039;t all back backs.</div><div id="00:03:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were just dressed up and they just had little sort of...</div><div id="00:03:26.160" class="transcript_line"> If I understand correctly, I think this was entirely attributed to the fact, was it the World Cup?</div><div id="00:03:29.160" class="transcript_line"> The World Cup, yes it was.</div><div id="00:03:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. So it wasn&#039;t completely random.</div><div id="00:03:33.160" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it had a meaning.</div><div id="00:03:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</div><div id="00:03:36.160" class="transcript_line"> But after your adventures in Carnival, you then got involved with our regular performance</div><div id="00:03:42.160" class="transcript_line"> group, the Carnival crew.</div><div id="00:03:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Tell us more about that. How did you get involved and what were your experiences?</div><div id="00:03:46.160" class="transcript_line"> That was through Caroline again.</div><div id="00:03:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:49.160" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s got a lot to answer for, hasn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:03:51.160" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a hefty recruiter.</div><div id="00:03:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Right, right.</div><div id="00:03:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, after that experience, I just thought, yeah, actually I quite like it.</div><div id="00:03:57.160" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="00:03:58.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="00:03:59.160" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I started doing the bells, which was great.</div><div id="00:04:04.160" class="transcript_line"> There was me and about three others doing the bells.</div><div id="00:04:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:04:07.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course, people doing drums and things like that.</div><div id="00:04:09.160" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember my first gig, but we did a couple.</div><div id="00:04:14.160" class="transcript_line"> We did a parade in Newport.</div><div id="00:04:16.160" class="transcript_line"> We did Barry, an evening performance in Barry.</div><div id="00:04:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Festival No. 6 as well.</div><div id="00:04:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s talk about Festival No. 6.</div><div id="00:04:25.160" class="transcript_line"> So this is a wonderful and award winning festival in Portmurray in North Wales,</div><div id="00:04:30.160" class="transcript_line"> which if people don&#039;t know is the fabulous sort of folly on a grand scale by the architect William Clough Ellis.</div><div id="00:04:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s an amazing place.</div><div id="00:04:38.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just so beautiful, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Totally random, but just amazing.</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Random in a carnivalesque way.</div><div id="00:04:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:04:44.160" class="transcript_line"> It sort of speaks to carnival, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, totally.</div><div id="00:04:47.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just quirky and eccentric.</div><div id="00:04:49.160" class="transcript_line"> Statues everywhere, nice colors, nice shapes.</div><div id="00:04:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:04:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:55.160" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, so you&#039;d been in the carnival crew the very first time that Swicker played Festival No. 6.</div><div id="00:05:01.160" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, unless I&#039;m mistaken, you were at the front of the parade, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:05:07.160" class="transcript_line"> In mara-katu dresses, very brightly colored dresses.</div><div id="00:05:09.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were.</div><div id="00:05:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Very much sort of opening the space.</div><div id="00:05:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think the bells were at the front.</div><div id="00:05:14.160" class="transcript_line"> I think Sally then us, the bells, yes, and then the drummers.</div><div id="00:05:19.160" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, we were in the front of the parade, but that was amazing as well.</div><div id="00:05:23.160" class="transcript_line"> That was brilliant.</div><div id="00:05:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Coming down into the piazza.</div><div id="00:05:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and then up onto the stage.</div><div id="00:05:28.160" class="transcript_line"> But the reaction was brilliant.</div><div id="00:05:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I really enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:05:30.160" class="transcript_line"> I think we did two days, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:05:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:05:33.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the big contribution that Swicker makes is the carnival.</div><div id="00:05:36.160" class="transcript_line"> But of course, then you took in other performances in the piazza, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:05:40.160" class="transcript_line"> All kinds of stuff.</div><div id="00:05:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:05:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Which was absolutely smashing.</div><div id="00:05:43.160" class="transcript_line"> I know.</div><div id="00:05:44.160" class="transcript_line"> We did have a little bit of sun, but basically it was raining and we were camping.</div><div id="00:05:48.160" class="transcript_line"> We were camping in a waterlogged field.</div><div id="00:05:50.160" class="transcript_line"> We were camping in a waterlogged field.</div><div id="00:05:52.160" class="transcript_line"> How was it for you?</div><div id="00:05:53.160" class="transcript_line"> My tent leaked and I was soaking, so it was all right.</div><div id="00:05:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Trench foot, you know.</div><div id="00:05:57.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a British festival experience, a Welsh festival experience.</div><div id="00:06:00.160" class="transcript_line"> Definitely trench foot.</div><div id="00:06:01.160" class="transcript_line"> I remember in the first year, we were incredibly lucky because whilst you&#039;re right, it was the wettest festival number six we&#039;ve ever done.</div><div id="00:06:08.160" class="transcript_line"> I remember arriving on a Thursday evening.</div><div id="00:06:10.160" class="transcript_line"> It was totally bucketing down.</div><div id="00:06:13.160" class="transcript_line"> And this carried on without stop.</div><div id="00:06:15.160" class="transcript_line"> All the way through Friday.</div><div id="00:06:17.160" class="transcript_line"> And then weirdly, in a very nice sort of way, 10 minutes before we opened the van to get the first costume off out for the carnival parade in the Saturday afternoon, suddenly the sun came out.</div><div id="00:06:28.160" class="transcript_line"> And then 10 minutes afterward, put the last costume away, the sun disappeared again.</div><div id="00:06:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And so that was great news for the carnival number six at the festival.</div><div id="00:06:39.160" class="transcript_line"> I can just remember one odd moment where I&#039;m at the front trying to make sure that there&#039;s some space for us to march into and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:06:46.160" class="transcript_line"> And looking back and just looking and seeing yourselves, the carnival crew in the beautiful Brazilian style Maracatu costumes and looking up and seeing these hundreds of people and even more watching.</div><div id="00:06:57.160" class="transcript_line"> And then realizing that over to a person, whilst from the ankles upwards, everybody looked very carnival.</div><div id="00:07:04.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course, everybody had on the same footwear which they survived, which is that everybody, Sally and the dancers had different colored wellies on.</div><div id="00:07:13.160" class="transcript_line"> So it was a beautiful, sunshiny carnival parade in Wellington Boots, which I thought in our 26 year history was a first.</div><div id="00:07:21.160" class="transcript_line"> So yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:07:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember we were in wellies.</div><div id="00:07:25.160" class="transcript_line"> All the crowds as well.</div><div id="00:07:27.160" class="transcript_line"> We lived in wellies for that weekend.</div><div id="00:07:29.160" class="transcript_line"> No, it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:30.160" class="transcript_line"> That was fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you very much for your carnival memories.</div><div id="00:07:34.160" class="transcript_line"> My pleasure.</div><div id="00:07:35.160" class="transcript_line"> And well, you shall be entering history towards the end of the month.</div><div id="00:07:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Lovely. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:07:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Jane.</div><div id="00:07:42.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s okay. Thank you.</div></div></p>
