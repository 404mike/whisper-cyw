    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Mae&#039;r investidur yn...</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Wel, beth yw hynny yn y lles?</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Y lles.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> O, byddai wedi bod yn ystod ymlaen.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Byddai wedi bod yn ystod ymlaen.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Ie.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember, was there anybody else with you?</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I would imagine my father would have watched that.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember who was with me,</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;m sure my father would have watched it,</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> because he was interested in history, you see.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember being impressed with the fashion.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The Queen&#039;s hat was like surrounded,</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve seen pictures of it yourself.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And the canopy was very modern,</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> and chairs, I think the people were allowed to keep the chairs afterwards,</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> very plain, but very stark really, very modern for the time.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And yet you&#039;re in this historic castle that was so old.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was very nice, the weather was nice I think as well.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember Princess Anne&#039;s dress as well,</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> it was just the style at that time, very clear cut.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think they had pastel colours, the royal family,</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> in their sort of light summer coats.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember also when the Queen brought Charles to the different areas</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> to present him to the people, I remember that bit clearly.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course from the paper beforehand,</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew that they were going to be coming by train</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and being in a siding somewhere, and overnight.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think there were some demonstrations against it as well.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Some Welsh, I don&#039;t know whether it was Cymdeithas yr Iaith,</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> or some of those didn&#039;t agree with it, and this kind of thing, I remember that.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there was some, I&#039;m not sure, did a bomb go off,</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> or something in the run-up to this,</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> or there was some worry about it anyway, something like that.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember seeing in the month leading up to the ceremony on television?</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was a lot on television.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I think as details emerged of who would be invited,</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and some of the councillors and people like that from every part of Wales.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And what Lord Snowdon was going to wear,</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> was he Constable of the Castle or something,</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was in this, I think it was Green Velvet or something.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no precedent really for somebody like him,</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> because I think he had organised it because he was Welsh</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was part of the Royal Family then, you see.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I remember as details emerged, that&#039;s what I remember,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> in the paper probably, and oh yes, I wish I&#039;d got that investiture thing really.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll have a look afterwards, I&#039;ll just see if there is one place it might be.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I remember the paper and I kept all this,</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and also the timetable and who was doing what,</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> that kind of thing would have come from the paper.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> In terms of some of the objections that you mentioned,</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> where did you hear about those?</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they would have been in the paper rather than television,</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> because they may not have been on the British television,</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> but they certainly would have been on the Welsh television,</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> but we didn&#039;t have that, you see.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So it must have been the newspaper I think.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> As a Welsh woman, how did the ceremony make you feel?</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I felt...</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t disagree with it.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t disagree at all.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because after all, we are a United Kingdom, aren&#039;t we now?</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, no, I didn&#039;t disagree with it at all really.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I just didn&#039;t want any accidents to happen or anything like that.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t mind if somebody objected,</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t want any violence or anything like that, do you know?</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there any sort of street parties and things going on in this area?</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they weren&#039;t in my little hamlet when I lived then.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Erm, no.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The only street party I ever remember was...</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Let me see. What was that about?</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was the Golden... The Silver Jubilee.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> The Silver Jubilee of the Queen.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That would have been...</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was soon after I came to live here.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had a street party just here.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> For the children, mainly.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just the children.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know in school we&#039;d made little crowns with gold paper</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and cut them out, sort of.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They were quite intricate actually.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite small and just like that, like a saucer size.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I made one myself and I put it on the table as a decoration.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a table decoration, you know.</div></div></p>
