    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is risk, this pandemic is risk. When the war was, because at least we could leave the house,</div><div id="00:00:05.520" class="transcript_line"> we could go out and move on rations and everything. You know, two ounces of butter for a week or</div><div id="00:00:14.080" class="transcript_line"> half a pound of sugar. Oh yeah. And you could see it coming when there was war. It was different.</div><div id="00:00:21.440" class="transcript_line"> You knew all the noise. The pandemic is just silent. It&#039;s horrible. Oh yes, yes, that&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:00:29.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s um, oh yeah, it was um, I&#039;m living there. But then, then at 20 I got married. Yeah. And I was</div><div id="00:00:39.920" class="transcript_line"> living just where I&#039;m almost living now. I&#039;m, now I&#039;m in Christina Street. I was living in the next</div><div id="00:00:46.160" class="transcript_line"> street, Angelina Street, when I was 20. Just after I got married, I was lucky enough, well not</div><div id="00:00:53.360" class="transcript_line"> lucky enough. A friend of mine who had gone to school with and been real friends with, she died young.</div><div id="00:01:00.720" class="transcript_line"> She was my brother&#039;s age, just right, about 22, 23. She died and I had this house that she had lived in.</div><div id="00:01:08.400" class="transcript_line"> And I lived there, 20 years old. I lived there and then my life went on from there.</div><div id="00:01:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so what about that thing about then getting married and family and stuff like that, Laura?</div><div id="00:01:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I only had one son. Yeah. Only had one son. And as a matter of fact, I&#039;ve ended up with like,</div><div id="00:01:32.640" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t know how many. So, as a matter of fact, there&#039;s a thing out. Oh, I was, it was my birthday on</div><div id="00:01:44.080" class="transcript_line"> on Sunday. Go on, I&#039;ve got to ask you, how old were you on Sunday? I was 93.</div><div id="00:01:52.240" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d never believe it talking to you. Trust me, you&#039;d never believe it. Well, as a matter of fact,</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> I know I&#039;m a great, great, great, great grandmother. And I get annoyed because I&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:02:06.640" class="transcript_line"> one granddaughter that is Facebook mad. Right. She can&#039;t put the phone down until it ends.</div><div id="00:02:13.680" class="transcript_line"> And every year they do give me a party for children, you know, and we generally go like</div><div id="00:02:19.840" class="transcript_line"> to a Chinese restaurant or somewhere where we all go, you know, have a big party of our</div><div id="00:02:24.720" class="transcript_line"> names. But I haven&#039;t done that for the last two years because I can&#039;t stand all that nonsense.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But apparently they got me because I&#039;ve had some of my friends who sent me a card. I had, I took</div><div id="00:02:38.400" class="transcript_line"> the cards down. I had 27 cards and I still have, I still have four more since I took them down.</div><div id="00:02:46.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Oh, well, I should imagine there&#039;s a lot of people that do know me. And of course,</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a bingo fan. My bingo&#039;s closed down, you know, not since I was going to bingo,</div><div id="00:02:58.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, even this year, last year, you know, till it was locked down and whatever.</div><div id="00:03:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m well known in a few places. And I&#039;m the last left of my class in school. I can name every</div><div id="00:03:13.680" class="transcript_line"> one of my friends I went to school with. Some of them went years and years ago. The last one went</div><div id="00:03:20.240" class="transcript_line"> last year, a boy that lives by me, me and him. Well, we always used to laugh together</div><div id="00:03:27.280" class="transcript_line"> because both of our birthdays were in February. And he passed through, I should say, Christ</div><div id="00:03:33.360" class="transcript_line"> read, just anyway, you left. Another one went just before him, a Spanish boy that lived down in West</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Close. There was only three left from my class. And now there&#039;s only me, all the boys and all the</div><div id="00:03:49.280" class="transcript_line"> girls are gone. There are a few a bit older than me, but it wasn&#039;t like either going to my school,</div><div id="00:03:56.800" class="transcript_line"> going to St. Mary&#039;s or some other or brought up in Ely, you know. I can name about two or three.</div><div id="00:04:04.400" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re just a bit older, about my age. And of course, one in Ely, one in Fairwater.</div><div id="00:04:14.720" class="transcript_line"> I think I got friends, a friend, a great friend of mine, she&#039;s here every week. She&#039;s 88.</div><div id="00:04:21.040" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t think it, you know, to fear. And, well, there&#039;s a few of us knocking on, but I</div><div id="00:04:27.440" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t think there&#039;s any at the moment who can name as old as me. Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:04:35.600" class="transcript_line"> My mum always used to say, you&#039;re as old as you allow yourself to be.</div><div id="00:04:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I try to keep your grey matter going. My legs are letting me down at the</div><div id="00:04:47.680" class="transcript_line"> moment. And I&#039;m trying all things. As a matter of fact, my ex daughter-in-law, she brought me</div><div id="00:04:53.280" class="transcript_line"> an exercise pedal. Right. That&#039;s what she brought on Saturday for me.</div><div id="00:05:00.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve already got that resistive one, you put your feet on. I&#039;ve got a massage chair</div><div id="00:05:07.520" class="transcript_line"> and none of them seems to be doing my legs much good. But none of it&#039;s hurting your mind,</div><div id="00:05:13.440" class="transcript_line"> I can tell that. I still get open about it. If I&#039;ve got my trolley with me, I still get open about.</div><div id="00:05:20.880" class="transcript_line"> But I haven&#039;t been out since I was in for the six months, you know, the first lockdown we had.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And Chris the Kid says, no, mum, be careful, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. I went out twice, I went out</div><div id="00:05:37.040" class="transcript_line"> twice that week. And that was the first time since this last lockdown. Oh, I know. And little do</div><div id="00:05:43.200" class="transcript_line"> they know we got more stamina than them. That&#039;s right. You&#039;ve been making for Darwin, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:05:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Darwin&#039;s my uncle. Gwen was my auntie. I can picture Gwen, I can picture her husband as well.</div><div id="00:05:55.360" class="transcript_line"> I can see me as the relative of me. Yeah. I worked with them. Darwin worked in a colonial centre.</div><div id="00:06:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right. Yeah. Well, that&#039;s where I worked. That&#039;s why I was so well known,</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> because I worked there when I was 18. That was when I had my son. And that was the first job I</div><div id="00:06:16.560" class="transcript_line"> had after I had my son. The colonial centre, the colonial centre was really important.</div><div id="00:06:22.880" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I knew a lot of the men, you know, because the store-wings used to come there,</div><div id="00:06:30.720" class="transcript_line"> when they were brought up the shifts, they&#039;d have a room at the colonial centre. And I used to serve</div><div id="00:06:36.880" class="transcript_line"> them, you know, I had the shift that I used to do breakfast, and then the shift I used to do that</div><div id="00:06:41.520" class="transcript_line"> evening meal. Yeah. I think, I&#039;m not sure, I don&#039;t think Darwin, I don&#039;t think Darwin</div><div id="00:06:51.360" class="transcript_line"> worked in the office there when I was working there. I know he worked there when Mr Pencil,</div><div id="00:06:57.120" class="transcript_line"> this guy Mr Pencil, was the boss, you know, the manager of the club. And Mr Abel from Barre,</div><div id="00:07:05.760" class="transcript_line"> he worked there. Yeah, yeah. Did you know anything about the Abel family? Oh, yeah,</div><div id="00:07:12.240" class="transcript_line"> God, yeah, Barre families, we know more. I mean, you know, it&#039;s, you know. Henry and the two boys,</div><div id="00:07:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Henry and, oh, Freddie, yeah, Freddie Abel. Yeah, Freddie Abel, yeah. Yeah. I also knew another</div><div id="00:07:28.880" class="transcript_line"> family, with the two boys, always worked in the grocery shops, the cut food. Yep. You know, yeah,</div><div id="00:07:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Charlie and, oh, they were great boys, and they worked in the grocery shop in Louisa Street,</div><div id="00:07:44.240" class="transcript_line"> and then they came on, they came and they worked in a shop in Duke Street. And, oh, they were part</div><div id="00:07:49.840" class="transcript_line"> of the, part of the box then, two boys. I remember I went to a party down in Barre one night, me and</div><div id="00:07:58.400" class="transcript_line"> my husband were invited, and one of the chapters was there. Yeah. I don&#039;t know if it was Charlie or,</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> or, oh, I used to go to the Casa Blanca. It was a church originally. Yeah. That&#039;s what you&#039;re talking</div><div id="00:08:12.240" class="transcript_line"> about. Yep. In Mount St. Louis Square. Mount St. Louis Square is originally a church, and the chapter</div><div id="00:08:18.720" class="transcript_line"> was run by the owner, a very shy, very an Arab man. Yeah, but there was a few clubs at the time,</div><div id="00:08:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Silver Clark had one in, at the bottom of the dock, at the pier, that was, oh, I forget the name of it.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s another one, you had the North Star in James Street.</div><div id="00:08:42.880" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s another one on the other side of James Street, because my husband</div><div id="00:08:47.280" class="transcript_line"> was a doorman there. Oh, there&#039;s a few clubs, oh, the Casa Blanca, yeah, we always used to get there</div><div id="00:08:55.200" class="transcript_line"> on the trade, you know, Saturday. Great music, great music. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, it&#039;s a small</div><div id="00:09:03.680" class="transcript_line"> world, isn&#039;t it? It is, isn&#039;t it? I mean, that&#039;s the thing, that&#039;s the thing. Yeah, what better use</div><div id="00:09:10.480" class="transcript_line"> the Casa Blanca? I mean, I was speaking, I was speaking to someone not long ago who lives up the</div><div id="00:09:15.920" class="transcript_line"> valleys, up in Pont Neprethe, and he used to say, once a month, he used to go to Cardiff,</div><div id="00:09:26.320" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d go to, he&#039;d go to the Casa Blanca. Oh, yeah. Because people, it&#039;s an old white guy,</div><div id="00:09:32.960" class="transcript_line"> people would say to him, oh, you went down there. You know, and he said to me, he said,</div><div id="00:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never been more welcomed, and when I walked in after, I hadn&#039;t been there for a month,</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> people go, well, you&#039;ve been. You know, and he said, friendly, never believe just how friendly</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> people were, as long as you treated them as you wanted them to treat you. That&#039;s always been my</div><div id="00:10:04.960" class="transcript_line"> motto, treat people as you would like to be treated yourself. And funny thing, like even when</div><div id="00:10:10.800" class="transcript_line"> I was young, most weekends, you get a lot from the valleys coming down, especially like on match</div><div id="00:10:19.280" class="transcript_line"> nights, you&#039;d end up with the same cat where you was having, you know, you&#039;d come from your club and</div><div id="00:10:24.960" class="transcript_line"> go for a supper with salmon, yams, or any of them Indian restaurants, and a lot of people from the</div><div id="00:10:31.680" class="transcript_line"> valleys, the men used to come down, you know, on a Saturday, a Friday, Saturday,</div><div id="00:10:37.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah, you&#039;d get a lot of the valley people. Well, I think on Wednesday or certain days,</div><div id="00:10:43.120" class="transcript_line"> the mothers used to come shopping, you know, demand expenses and all them places.</div><div id="00:10:48.960" class="transcript_line"> A lot of Welsh girls, valleys, you know, duff boys and people from Cargis. Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, as a matter of fact, one time, it was when I was pregnant and I had a few friends</div><div id="00:11:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I used to go up to Mount Kinash occasionally on a Sunday because I had friends there.</div><div id="00:11:13.920" class="transcript_line"> And well, I think his, I think his, you know, both names was Pendlecuyber.</div><div id="00:11:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Pendlecuyber, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:20.560" class="transcript_line"> They had some friends there and a few times I went up there, Mount Kinash,</div><div id="00:11:27.360" class="transcript_line"> and we stayed friends for years, for years, only like, it&#039;s only about,</div><div id="00:11:33.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t just been alive for about 20 years, but other than that, I was in touch with them,</div><div id="00:11:38.640" class="transcript_line"> always send a Christmas card to Davises because one of them had a mixed race baby.</div><div id="00:11:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:49.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;s a few, I think, up there, valleys there, like that, Iris Williams, a singer.</div><div id="00:11:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:11:56.160" class="transcript_line"> And what about you?

My kids, my grandkids.</div><div id="00:12:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s a few in my family now, you know, blue eyed.</div><div id="00:12:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:18.420" class="transcript_line"> Some of that blonde hair, they&#039;re gone dark now, but I got a few that got blue eyes.</div><div id="00:12:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Never believe it. Oh, Hitler must be turning in his bloody grave.</div><div id="00:12:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t make a remark, you know, a remark about someone because of their race,</div><div id="00:12:33.280" class="transcript_line"> because you never know who you&#039;re standing next to at the bar.</div><div id="00:12:37.200" class="transcript_line"> It could be their stepbrother, step sister, just because they&#039;re white, don&#039;t mean a thing.</div><div id="00:12:42.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s true that, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:44.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s a few people who can call it out like that, you know.</div><div id="00:12:48.260" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve got cousins and they are white, you know, that&#039;s on this dresser&#039;s side, you know.</div><div id="00:12:54.660" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a lot, like my family, I said to them, there was one year yesterday,</div><div id="00:13:00.980" class="transcript_line"> I said, you don&#039;t know half of my family, they&#039;re white.</div><div id="00:13:04.900" class="transcript_line"> You know, some of them will say, you know, oh, we got cousins and it&#039;s on the day,</div><div id="00:13:10.020" class="transcript_line"> you know, we got cousins of the color, of the color, as they call it.</div><div id="00:13:13.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:15.140" class="transcript_line"> And yet I think they&#039;re out of view, they&#039;re a bit racist, you know, what they&#039;re like.</div><div id="00:13:19.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, it&#039;s, you know, we&#039;ve had it, we&#039;ve had it all our lives, you know, it&#039;s,</div><div id="00:13:23.860" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not like it&#039;s a shock to us.</div><div id="00:13:27.060" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:13:28.260" class="transcript_line"> Talking about, and that&#039;s a, there&#039;s a subject that I always ask people about,</div><div id="00:13:32.660" class="transcript_line"> because I think the bay is kind of special about this, funerals.</div><div id="00:13:39.540" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Funerals like, you know, your-</div><div id="00:13:42.500" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god, I always say whenever I go to, you know, if it&#039;s someone I know,</div><div id="00:13:48.580" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I can&#039;t go to funerals like I used to, but if it&#039;s someone I know, whatever,</div><div id="00:13:54.180" class="transcript_line"> I always say, whether they love you or hate you in this day, you always get a good send off.</div><div id="00:14:01.940" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;d be some fabulous funerals, like my husband, you know, I buried my husband,</div><div id="00:14:06.340" class="transcript_line"> and they carried him from, I just live like a block away from the church,</div><div id="00:14:11.060" class="transcript_line"> but they carried him, you know, around to the church, and all the respect you get.</div><div id="00:14:16.820" class="transcript_line"> And well, my godson, that&#039;s the only time I&#039;ve been out, except twice I&#039;ve been out since then,</div><div id="00:14:25.540" class="transcript_line"> two Saturdays ago, when we were outside at the church clapping, you know, at his cottage,</div><div id="00:14:31.860" class="transcript_line"> where the earth went up Butte Street, it stopped at the church for like about 10 minutes,</div><div id="00:14:36.900" class="transcript_line"> where we were all out there clapping, and he was my godson, he was 72 years old,</div><div id="00:14:41.940" class="transcript_line"> he got buried two weeks ago. But if he&#039;d have been, if that had been a burial in the church,</div><div id="00:14:49.780" class="transcript_line"> my god, our church gets full. Oh, and they&#039;re on the stage as well as in our seated, all outside.</div><div id="00:14:58.020" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;ve never seen funerals like it. And I can remember going to a few funerals,</div><div id="00:15:04.580" class="transcript_line"> little bit back with the jazz band as well. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that&#039;s right. Yeah,</div><div id="00:15:12.020" class="transcript_line"> people for the orders of the crew, the jazz band. Yeah. And some with the horses, you know,</div><div id="00:15:20.420" class="transcript_line"> but oh, oh, God, few rules that Tiger Bay, they&#039;re most talked about.</div><div id="00:15:25.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, dear me.

Yeah, good job. Good job. We can have a laugh about it. I think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:15:49.460" class="transcript_line"> me going because I&#039;ve always had a sense of humor. I sit here sometimes laughing to me,</div><div id="00:15:56.740" class="transcript_line"> like a lot of people say, you know, I thought even when, you know, when my husband was alive,</div><div id="00:16:01.940" class="transcript_line"> years ago when he&#039;s younger, and because he always cleaned the the holes in the ships,</div><div id="00:16:08.100" class="transcript_line"> you know, he worked on the dock there. Yeah. And there was times like when he&#039;d go to Milford Haven</div><div id="00:16:13.140" class="transcript_line"> for about a week and then come on the weekend and go back down. And if you say, Oh,</div><div id="00:16:18.500" class="transcript_line"> you know, being on your own, I can&#039;t sleep on my own. You know, when people say, Oh,</div><div id="00:16:24.260" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t you get lonely? No, it don&#039;t bother me. Because I, you know, I like my own company.</div><div id="00:16:32.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You know, I sat with you tonight. So I watched this thing. I watched this thing,</div><div id="00:16:40.900" class="transcript_line"> like Father Ted, you know, and then killing programs. And I sit here and I laugh in my head</div><div id="00:16:48.260" class="transcript_line"> off. And I think to myself, Oh, it&#039;s a good job. I can have a laugh, you know, the way things are</div><div id="00:16:54.260" class="transcript_line"> at the moment, you know, if you didn&#039;t laugh, you&#039;d cry, you know. Yeah. And I&#039;ve got a friend,</div><div id="00:17:00.500" class="transcript_line"> my friend I&#039;ve had for about 50 years from London. And she was on the phone singing me</div><div id="00:17:06.340" class="transcript_line"> Happy Birthday on Sunday. And she&#039;s like me, we always have a laugh, you know, conversation.</div><div id="00:17:14.180" class="transcript_line"> And like we both say to each other, good job, we got a sense of humor. You know, that keeps us</div><div id="00:17:19.620" class="transcript_line"> going. I say, Oh, I say, give me our young days, coming home from school, swinging on the lamppost,</div><div id="00:17:29.620" class="transcript_line"> playing gobs in the gutter, playing in the park. We used to have come from another school out in</div><div id="00:17:35.780" class="transcript_line"> the street. And we&#039;d have days when we&#039;d be playing coke, you know, for each other, you know,</div><div id="00:17:43.140" class="transcript_line"> see who&#039;s going to win the game and whatever. Oh, our school days, oh, the kids today, oh,</div><div id="00:17:50.100" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like to be happy. I mean, if you fell out with someone, you&#039;d have</div><div id="00:17:54.500" class="transcript_line"> a fist fight and that&#039;d be it. We&#039;d be friends the next minute. But now they&#039;re killing each other.</div><div id="00:18:01.380" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, they come home from school and have a, you know, spend the next, till about</div><div id="00:18:07.380" class="transcript_line"> six or seven o&#039;clock with friends. And I&#039;ve been about down our park, we&#039;d go because we had lots</div><div id="00:18:13.060" class="transcript_line"> of things put on there. And, you know, if not, you&#039;d go somewhere, you could go to the pictures,</div><div id="00:18:19.620" class="transcript_line"> you could go to the bug house, go to the bug house for bloody nothing for six months, go to the</div><div id="00:18:24.900" class="transcript_line"> dental and then other picture houses. God, we had lovely nights when we were kids.</div><div id="00:18:32.740" class="transcript_line"> I can remember, I can remember football matches in the street and in the park.</div><div id="00:18:40.660" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and you&#039;re talking about that football match, that big cricket match. Yeah. But you could</div><div id="00:18:48.100" class="transcript_line"> play a game of cricket on the street, you know, I remember them hopscotch games.</div><div id="00:18:56.100" class="transcript_line"> Running through the square, one, two, three, whatever. Oh, we were fit though,</div><div id="00:19:01.460" class="transcript_line"> weren&#039;t we? Let&#039;s be fair, we were fit. Yeah. You know, you consider people like the Erskins and</div><div id="00:19:09.140" class="transcript_line"> Billy Boston and Clive Sullivan and Freeman and all of those. So much talent, so much talent.</div><div id="00:19:15.860" class="transcript_line"> Well, they&#039;re great friends and my better comes every Sunday, you know, because we&#039;re great</div><div id="00:19:20.100" class="transcript_line"> friends, going to bring one up together, Johnny Freeman&#039;s sister. Very sense, more or less like</div><div id="00:19:25.860" class="transcript_line"> a part of my family, you know. And Dana, oh, Dana&#039;s mum was one of my bestest friends I ever had.</div><div id="00:19:36.340" class="transcript_line"> So I come to be Dana&#039;s brother&#039;s godmother. She&#039;s a great friend. So I was hard spoken when she</div><div id="00:19:43.620" class="transcript_line"> came. She lived with us for a while, Dana&#039;s mother. And we were more like family, you know,</div><div id="00:19:50.100" class="transcript_line"> we always have been, you know. But I think that&#039;s the thing, you know, when we say, we say cousins,</div><div id="00:19:57.220" class="transcript_line"> and some are, but others aren&#039;t, but they might as well be. You&#039;ve got families no relation to you,</div><div id="00:20:04.980" class="transcript_line"> they aren&#039;t nearer to you, you know, than your own family. Yeah. Like Dana&#039;s family, you know,</div><div id="00:20:11.060" class="transcript_line"> and a few families that, you know, I&#039;m really close to. Yeah. And people still treat, I mean,</div><div id="00:20:19.860" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you experienced this, but people still treat you with respect because you&#039;re older.</div><div id="00:20:25.380" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And we&#039;re an auntie and uncle, that thing, you know. Yeah, often when we&#039;re out.</div><div id="00:20:33.860" class="transcript_line"> Well, my granddaughter, who both, she always buy my birthday cake and she always makes a big</div><div id="00:20:40.260" class="transcript_line"> fuss and gets something that she hasn&#039;t done before. Well, the Christmas cake that she</div><div id="00:20:46.500" class="transcript_line"> ordered, what she went to pay for, she bought this cake, she told me. The cake is half the size</div><div id="00:20:52.980" class="transcript_line"> this year of a television screen. Big square cake. Roughly. And to tell you the size of it.</div><div id="00:21:01.060" class="transcript_line"> And she said when she went to pay for it, well, she&#039;d spoken to, because in the end,</div><div id="00:21:09.460" class="transcript_line"> I think it was out on Facebook. Right. Because there are a lot of people that know me and she</div><div id="00:21:14.180" class="transcript_line"> was to put on about why Nana is going to be 93, blah, blah. Yeah. And this person,</div><div id="00:21:24.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known him, he was born in a house just a few, well, his back gate, you&#039;re going to come out</div><div id="00:21:32.100" class="transcript_line"> his back gate, right onto my front door. Right. Just three of us said. And so I&#039;ve known him since</div><div id="00:21:37.860" class="transcript_line"> he was born. And I haven&#039;t seen him for three years. He&#039;s grown up now and he&#039;s got children</div><div id="00:21:43.300" class="transcript_line"> of his own. And I was out a couple of back last year. And because often, you know, people shout,</div><div id="00:21:50.100" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Auntie Laura. And I don&#039;t know who they are because I haven&#039;t seen them since they&#039;re teenagers.</div><div id="00:21:54.900" class="transcript_line"> You know? Yeah. And then this chap said to me, I come up to the test room, he said to me, I&#039;m</div><div id="00:22:00.180" class="transcript_line"> Auntie Laura. He had these two children with him. And I looked at him. I said, oh, I said, I know</div><div id="00:22:04.820" class="transcript_line"> your face. I said, but you said I&#039;m Rashid. Oh, I said, you know, because I haven&#039;t seen him for</div><div id="00:22:10.100" class="transcript_line"> years. Yeah. And me and his mum, you know, we were great friends in my neighbours, neighbours from</div><div id="00:22:14.820" class="transcript_line"> down the docks, you know, so I moved up here. And I was getting a taxi home, you know, because I had</div><div id="00:22:21.140" class="transcript_line"> my trolley with me. And he walked me around because he was going around that same street as well.</div><div id="00:22:26.420" class="transcript_line"> And he said, well, you&#039;re going to have to go, I said, I&#039;m going to go get my taxi, that. So he</div><div id="00:22:30.660" class="transcript_line"> walked me there and he paid the taxi driver. He said, you know, he said, that&#039;s, you know,</div><div id="00:22:35.700" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s my Auntie Laura does? He said, whatever. Well, then, you know, the same boy now, he must</div><div id="00:22:40.980" class="transcript_line"> have seen on Facebook, whatever, it was my birthday or whatever. And I don&#039;t know if he had arranged</div><div id="00:22:48.660" class="transcript_line"> to meet my granddaughter or what, but anyhow, when she went to college school, you know, she got the</div><div id="00:22:55.540" class="transcript_line"> cake. And he was there. I don&#039;t know if it was chance or whether they made some arrangements.</div><div id="00:23:03.060" class="transcript_line"> And he would never pay for the cake. He said, I&#039;m paying for the cake for Auntie Laura. And he paid</div><div id="00:23:09.380" class="transcript_line"> for the cake. Because I said so when she was here on Sunday, Saturday was, Sunday was my birthday,</div><div id="00:23:15.140" class="transcript_line"> but Saturday we had a bit of a do. And I said to her on Sunday, when she&#039;s telling me, right,</div><div id="00:23:21.620" class="transcript_line"> I said, I said, well, I&#039;m sitting, she said 15 pounds. Oh my God. Yeah. He said, he said, no,</div><div id="00:23:30.820" class="transcript_line"> he said, Auntie, Auntie Laura&#039;s cake, which he did. And, but Laura, how many kids have</div><div id="00:23:39.540" class="transcript_line"> women said that weren&#039;t even their kids? Yeah. Oh, you&#039;d feed anybody, wouldn&#039;t you? You know,</div><div id="00:23:47.460" class="transcript_line"> funny, even today, if you know someone, you know, once a meal or whatever. But I used to have a lot</div><div id="00:23:53.700" class="transcript_line"> of kids in the house because I had the string out the back, you know, and so they&#039;d all come,</div><div id="00:23:58.900" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I had to treat it. They used to climb. Oh yeah. All their kids, my grandkids,</div><div id="00:24:07.460" class="transcript_line"> too, you know, friends, they&#039;ve all, that&#039;s how they remember me, you know, Auntie Laura.</div><div id="00:24:14.020" class="transcript_line"> But I am seeing them since they&#039;re youngsters, you know, like don&#039;t recognize them, half of them.</div><div id="00:24:20.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. But that&#039;s how it was, wasn&#039;t it? You know, all your doors always open,</div><div id="00:24:26.980" class="transcript_line"> but that, oh, now you&#039;ve got to make sure your door is closed.</div><div id="00:24:31.220" class="transcript_line"> Imagine someone sat there at the Norwegian church, that cafe where the Norwegian church is now,</div><div id="00:24:40.740" class="transcript_line"> not where it was, you know, and it&#039;s, and they&#039;re looking at all of those shops and restaurants and</div><div id="00:24:46.980" class="transcript_line"> all of that. What would you say to them? They&#039;re tourists. What would you say to them about</div><div id="00:24:53.620" class="transcript_line"> the docks and Butetown and the bay that you would want them to know about the people?</div><div id="00:25:02.500" class="transcript_line"> What would you say to them? Well, there&#039;s so much I can say now about it because, well,</div><div id="00:25:08.580" class="transcript_line"> sometimes I like to say that they wouldn&#039;t like what is changed much now, but</div><div id="00:25:16.180" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not the same. We do have a few, you know, of us, like Dana, they moved, like she&#039;s down</div><div id="00:25:25.620" class="transcript_line"> the docks, what&#039;s your, the Greenstone now, but like there are a few, I mean, where I am now,</div><div id="00:25:32.660" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I can name even five of the old neighbours, you know, that live around by me.</div><div id="00:25:42.820" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s changed so much that, like I got, where I am, I&#039;m right in the heart of High Street now,</div><div id="00:25:52.580" class="transcript_line"> High Street. But you&#039;d find more people down the dockshelves where I, you know, was living in</div><div id="00:26:02.580" class="transcript_line"> Stewart Street when I was younger. There are more down there that did live in Tiger Bay, you know,</div><div id="00:26:11.380" class="transcript_line"> but more people down there who might be interested to speak to you or whatever. But</div><div id="00:26:18.820" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s not much I can say. The only thing was we were all happy. We were all like one big,</div><div id="00:26:26.580" class="transcript_line"> oh, we&#039;re like a cold, you know, what&#039;s your last name? Mixing everything.</div><div id="00:26:32.340" class="transcript_line"> Melding pot, they used to call it. We were all like one big family.</div><div id="00:26:37.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You know, everyone helping each other, all happy, happy days for us children.</div><div id="00:26:44.580" class="transcript_line"> I always remember, I&#039;m so glad that I was brought up here. I don&#039;t think you&#039;d be happier anywhere else.</div><div id="00:26:54.580" class="transcript_line"> Right. Thanks, kid. It was a pleasure speaking to you. Thank you.</div><div id="00:26:59.620" class="transcript_line"> Pleasure as well.</div><div id="00:27:00.660" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Bye now.</div><div id="00:27:01.860" class="transcript_line"> All the best, bye bye.</div><div id="00:27:03.540" class="transcript_line"> Bye.</div></div></p>
