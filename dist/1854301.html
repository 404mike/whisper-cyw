Birth, family, he was born in 1911,</div><div id="00:01:08.520" class="transcript_line"> and he was a Jewish-Polish artist who was remembered for his depictions</div><div id="00:01:14.680" class="transcript_line"> in the Welsh mining community in Estegdanais.</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> He was born in Warsaw, Poland, in January 1911.</div><div id="00:01:21.640" class="transcript_line"> The eldest of three children, they were very, very poor,</div><div id="00:01:25.320" class="transcript_line"> he went to school until the age of 12,</div><div id="00:01:28.360" class="transcript_line"> and then later became an apprentice printer.</div><div id="00:01:32.120" class="transcript_line"> He attended the Warsaw School of Art, what I gleaned, from 1930 to 1932,</div><div id="00:01:40.200" class="transcript_line"> and exhibited for the first time in Warsaw in 1932.</div><div id="00:01:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Now, Warsaw at that time and Poland was very anti-Semitic.</div><div id="00:01:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Very, very, you know, the Germans and the Nazis didn&#039;t invent anti-Semitism.</div><div id="00:01:55.800" class="transcript_line"> No, it was rife in Poland, and particularly in Warsaw.</div><div id="00:02:01.160" class="transcript_line"> So in 1938, that&#039;s a year before the outbreak of the Second World War,</div><div id="00:02:08.200" class="transcript_line"> at the age of 27, he fled Poland for Belgium</div><div id="00:02:14.280" class="transcript_line"> because there was a mountain of anti-Semitism in Poland.</div><div id="00:02:19.360" class="transcript_line"> And of course, as I said, this is prior to the outbreak of the...</div><div id="00:02:22.440" class="transcript_line"> one year before the outbreak of World War II.</div><div id="00:02:25.320" class="transcript_line"> The following year, the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, and the war broke out.</div><div id="00:02:33.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was in Belgium now,</div><div id="00:02:35.600" class="transcript_line"> and he rather liked the expressionist artist of Belgium.</div><div id="00:02:41.040" class="transcript_line"> He was in Brussels, actually.</div><div id="00:02:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Rather than that, in other words, he thought intellectual artists</div><div id="00:02:51.040" class="transcript_line"> of Paris, the impressionists.</div><div id="00:02:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So he was allowed to be in Belgium.</div><div id="00:02:57.720" class="transcript_line"> And there was one story that he says he liked the police in Brussels.</div><div id="00:03:02.800" class="transcript_line"> He said he would walk the streets and talk to the police, and they were rude.</div><div id="00:03:07.840" class="transcript_line"> He would have stayed in Belgium, actually.</div><div id="00:03:09.920" class="transcript_line"> But of course, the following year, anti-40 Nazi Germany invaded Belgium,</div><div id="00:03:15.760" class="transcript_line"> and so he had to flee again, and he fled through France.</div><div id="00:03:19.480" class="transcript_line"> And he had a good luck, because he was travelling through France.</div><div id="00:03:23.160" class="transcript_line"> Travelling from somewhere called June...</div><div id="00:03:29.800" class="transcript_line"> June, July...</div><div id="00:03:32.440" class="transcript_line"> June, July...</div><div id="00:03:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very odd name.</div><div id="00:03:35.600" class="transcript_line"> June, July Rice, I think her name was.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> An American gave him a lift as far as Bordeaux,</div><div id="00:03:42.240" class="transcript_line"> and in Bordeaux, he heard that there were ships going from La Rochelle to Canada</div><div id="00:03:47.640" class="transcript_line"> for members of the Polish army who had fled Poland to join the British army.</div><div id="00:03:54.360" class="transcript_line"> So he actually got on that ship, but it was obvious that he wasn&#039;t a soldier.</div><div id="00:03:59.560" class="transcript_line"> But he thought it was first...</div><div id="00:04:01.880" class="transcript_line"> He was misled and thought it was going to Canada, but he ended up in Liverpool.</div><div id="00:04:06.200" class="transcript_line"> The words of a soldier went for the army, the British army,</div><div id="00:04:09.680" class="transcript_line"> but he was told to report to the consul in Glasgow,</div><div id="00:04:14.280" class="transcript_line"> so he got a hitchhiked to Glasgow.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was in Glasgow in 1940, and there was quite a number of refugees there,</div><div id="00:04:22.960" class="transcript_line"> and quite a number, actually, of Jewish refugees.</div><div id="00:04:26.640" class="transcript_line"> And they had even met up with an old friend,</div><div id="00:04:30.080" class="transcript_line"> a younger uncle, Adla.</div><div id="00:04:34.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so sorry, his Jewish name&#039;s hopelessly...</div><div id="00:04:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Difficult, yes.</div><div id="00:04:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Adla, and he&#039;s quite a famous artist, and he knew him in Warsaw.</div><div id="00:04:46.720" class="transcript_line"> So he became very friendly with him.</div><div id="00:04:49.440" class="transcript_line"> He taught a bit of art, he exhibited in Edinburgh,</div><div id="00:04:53.120" class="transcript_line"> and there he met Katriona MacLeod.</div><div id="00:04:57.760" class="transcript_line"> She was an heiress from the Isle of Skye.</div><div id="00:05:00.960" class="transcript_line"> She liked his art, she followed him to Glasgow,</div><div id="00:05:03.280" class="transcript_line"> persuaded him to take her as a student,</div><div id="00:05:07.680" class="transcript_line"> but he wouldn&#039;t, but he eventually married her.</div><div id="00:05:11.040" class="transcript_line"> So he was married in 1943, I think, to Katriona MacLeod.</div><div id="00:05:17.360" class="transcript_line"> But before that, actually, in 1942,</div><div id="00:05:21.360" class="transcript_line"> he had heard from the British Red Cross that all his family,</div><div id="00:05:26.560" class="transcript_line"> every member of his family had been destroyed</div><div id="00:05:30.560" class="transcript_line"> in the Holocaust.</div><div id="00:05:34.720" class="transcript_line"> The Jews in Warsaw had been herded into a ghetto,</div><div id="00:05:38.320" class="transcript_line"> and in the ghetto, they were then persuaded after a while,</div><div id="00:05:42.560" class="transcript_line"> look, we&#039;ll take you to a camp, but they didn&#039;t know what a camp was.</div><div id="00:05:46.640" class="transcript_line"> But fortunately, he thought it was a...</div><div id="00:05:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Fortunately, they didn&#039;t get to Auschwitz,</div><div id="00:05:51.360" class="transcript_line"> but they were cast in the vans.</div><div id="00:05:54.560" class="transcript_line"> All his family.</div><div id="00:05:56.640" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t believe these things.</div><div id="00:05:57.600" class="transcript_line"> There was no one. He was the only survivor.</div><div id="00:06:01.840" class="transcript_line"> They were all murdered.</div><div id="00:06:04.960" class="transcript_line"> He was a dissented man because he had a very, very bad breakdown,</div><div id="00:06:09.840" class="transcript_line"> and Adlaen lived through that.</div><div id="00:06:12.240" class="transcript_line"> And then, as I said, he later, just a year later,</div><div id="00:06:16.560" class="transcript_line"> he married Katriona, Katriona,</div><div id="00:06:20.400" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s called her Katriona, which I&#039;ve just forgotten.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they went to London.</div><div id="00:06:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Now Katriona was pregnant in London,</div><div id="00:06:30.480" class="transcript_line"> and there was a lot of bombing, because what type?</div><div id="00:06:33.360" class="transcript_line"> So he was advised now to come to Wales</div><div id="00:06:37.440" class="transcript_line"> by a friend called David Martin,</div><div id="00:06:41.840" class="transcript_line"> who also was very friendly with David Alexander Williams,</div><div id="00:06:46.160" class="transcript_line"> a carpenter in a scheduling colony.</div><div id="00:06:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Now, it&#039;s very difficult for me at first to sort of to reconcile this.</div><div id="00:06:53.600" class="transcript_line"> How come that a carpenter working in a scheduling colony</div><div id="00:07:00.240" class="transcript_line"> was also a friend of David Martin?</div><div id="00:07:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Who is David Martin?</div><div id="00:07:08.480" class="transcript_line"> He was a journalist.</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> He already met Herman in Glasgow</div><div id="00:07:14.160" class="transcript_line"> because he worked for the Daily Express in Glasgow.</div><div id="00:07:18.400" class="transcript_line"> So he was Jewish.</div><div id="00:07:20.400" class="transcript_line"> So I thought David Martin is not a Jewish name.</div><div id="00:07:23.440" class="transcript_line"> I discovered, because I&#039;m nauseous,</div><div id="00:07:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I discovered that he, I was intrigued by it actually,</div><div id="00:07:29.680" class="transcript_line"> David Martin was Ludwig Denzel.</div><div id="00:07:34.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m mispronouncing that, I can tell you.</div><div id="00:07:36.960" class="transcript_line"> And born in Budapest, but educated in Berlin,</div><div id="00:07:42.800" class="transcript_line"> but a whole family got out of Europe,</div><div id="00:07:46.560" class="transcript_line"> and his parents went to London,</div><div id="00:07:48.160" class="transcript_line"> and he left Berlin in 1934 to Israel,</div><div id="00:07:52.640" class="transcript_line"> and then he was with the International Brigade</div><div id="00:07:55.120" class="transcript_line"> and the Spanish Civil War.</div><div id="00:07:56.800" class="transcript_line"> So he was, but he was a writer.</div><div id="00:07:59.840" class="transcript_line"> He came to London.</div><div id="00:08:01.200" class="transcript_line"> How did a writer who was Jewish</div><div id="00:08:03.840" class="transcript_line"> become friendly with David Alexander Williams?</div><div id="00:08:07.840" class="transcript_line"> It may be because they shared left-wing politics.</div><div id="00:08:11.840" class="transcript_line"> It may be because he was a writer,</div><div id="00:08:14.800" class="transcript_line"> and David Alexander Williams became quite well known</div><div id="00:08:18.560" class="transcript_line"> as a short story writer.</div><div id="00:08:21.920" class="transcript_line"> Much of his work was published.</div><div id="00:08:24.880" class="transcript_line"> So David Martin, of course, wrote Tiger Bay,</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> the book Tiger Bay, and had come to us to recognise.</div><div id="00:08:33.280" class="transcript_line"> I know in his biography he mentions that he stayed</div><div id="00:08:36.880" class="transcript_line"> with David Alexander Williams,</div><div id="00:08:40.880" class="transcript_line"> and his friend Peggy, Dialect, we called him,</div><div id="00:08:43.680" class="transcript_line"> in Otfellow Street, David Martin had.</div><div id="00:08:47.120" class="transcript_line"> So I had a contact with David, I made the connection,</div><div id="00:08:50.880" class="transcript_line"> David Martin had told Joseph Herman,</div><div id="00:08:54.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll go to Wales, we&#039;ll be quiet.</div><div id="00:08:57.280" class="transcript_line"> You like the people of Wales.</div><div id="00:09:01.440" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how it all began,</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> that he came to a Scottish.</div><div id="00:09:06.480" class="transcript_line"> But he met Dialect in Brecon,</div><div id="00:09:09.520" class="transcript_line"> and this is what he says actually,</div><div id="00:09:11.520" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t know how he came to Brecon,</div><div id="00:09:12.880" class="transcript_line"> but in his own words.</div><div id="00:09:16.080" class="transcript_line"> My Scottish wife, Tationa, was pregnant and needed,</div><div id="00:09:19.600" class="transcript_line"> so the doctor said, to get away from Walthon, London,</div><div id="00:09:24.080" class="transcript_line"> and get some restful nights.</div><div id="00:09:27.120" class="transcript_line"> A journalist friend, David Martin,</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> just back from Wales, suggested that we go there.</div><div id="00:09:35.600" class="transcript_line"> I cannot say how or why we arrived in Brecon.</div><div id="00:09:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Brecon at that time was as noisy as Piccadilly Circus.</div><div id="00:09:44.560" class="transcript_line"> American soldiers and girls and laughter</div><div id="00:09:48.080" class="transcript_line"> from the small hours each night.</div><div id="00:09:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Then on our first night arrived unexpectedly in Otfell,</div><div id="00:09:55.440" class="transcript_line"> a strange visitor, a carpenter.</div><div id="00:09:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Who worked in a connery was also a short story writer,</div><div id="00:10:03.360" class="transcript_line"> Dy Alex Williams.</div><div id="00:10:05.040" class="transcript_line"> He arrived with his blonde and friendly wife, Peggy.</div><div id="00:10:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Apparently my London friend wrote to Dy Alex,</div><div id="00:10:12.400" class="transcript_line"> told him about our well-abouts,</div><div id="00:10:14.880" class="transcript_line"> and asked him to get in touch with us.</div><div id="00:10:18.880" class="transcript_line"> So, I think I&#039;ve told you all about David Martin now,</div><div id="00:10:23.520" class="transcript_line"> who was the link between the two.</div><div id="00:10:29.520" class="transcript_line"> And really, I suppose that this time I should make another connection</div><div id="00:10:32.560" class="transcript_line"> before I say where he came to win in Astran,</div><div id="00:10:36.080" class="transcript_line"> and that is the connection inside a village.</div><div id="00:10:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Now Dy Alex had been the liaison.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Dy Alex now, a short story writer, carpenter.</div><div id="00:10:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Colerty, right?</div><div id="00:10:49.840" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d also been the liaison via the miners federation</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> with the Czech government in London,</div><div id="00:11:01.200" class="transcript_line"> the Czech legation.</div><div id="00:11:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Arranging some sort of,</div><div id="00:11:07.200" class="transcript_line"> and arranging for them,</div><div id="00:11:09.200" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re bringing together the villagers and miners in Cwmgyedd</div><div id="00:11:14.240" class="transcript_line"> to do a re-enactment of literacy.</div><div id="00:11:16.240" class="transcript_line"> So he doesn&#039;t feature in the film,</div><div id="00:11:20.240" class="transcript_line"> but he was the link,</div><div id="00:11:21.680" class="transcript_line"> and with Humphrey Jennings, the director.</div><div id="00:11:24.560" class="transcript_line"> So the link between the three, getting them together.</div><div id="00:11:28.240" class="transcript_line"> So he was very passionate about the side of the village.</div><div id="00:11:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Very proud of the villagers, it isn&#039;t bad.</div><div id="00:11:34.800" class="transcript_line"> So he had told David Martin about it,</div><div id="00:11:38.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, many, many times.</div><div id="00:11:40.080" class="transcript_line"> David Martin was also intrigued by the whole thing,</div><div id="00:11:43.280" class="transcript_line"> being Jewish.</div><div id="00:11:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And David Martin told Joseph Herman the story,</div><div id="00:11:50.640" class="transcript_line"> the side of the village.</div><div id="00:11:52.240" class="transcript_line"> When again Joseph Herman met with Dy Alex,</div><div id="00:11:57.200" class="transcript_line"> he also told him again about the side of the village.</div><div id="00:12:00.560" class="transcript_line"> So he was very keen to come to the village,</div><div id="00:12:04.880" class="transcript_line"> to come to Estrikenais for several reasons,</div><div id="00:12:07.600" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s one of the reasons actually,</div><div id="00:12:09.440" class="transcript_line"> because he had known beforehand of the story of the side of the village.</div><div id="00:12:14.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the connection again, a connection, right?</div><div id="00:12:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And that connection is Dy Alex bringing Joseph Herman here,</div><div id="00:12:20.800" class="transcript_line"> and Dy Alex being the liaison or the contact between the groups.</div><div id="00:12:26.480" class="transcript_line"> Byard actually, Dy Francis in the Miners Federation</div><div id="00:12:31.040" class="transcript_line"> asked him to do that.</div><div id="00:12:34.880" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s in Estrikenais,</div><div id="00:12:35.840" class="transcript_line"> so he comes first of all to stay with David Pecky in Arford Street,</div><div id="00:12:41.200" class="transcript_line"> two up, two down, or one up, one down.</div><div id="00:12:45.280" class="transcript_line"> It was very, very small, no bathroom or anything.</div><div id="00:12:48.800" class="transcript_line"> Catriona was an heiress actually,</div><div id="00:12:51.200" class="transcript_line"> from a very, very rich whiskey family in the highland sky.</div><div id="00:12:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I say that once he came,</div><div id="00:13:00.960" class="transcript_line"> he was so happy that he was welcomed by everyone,</div><div id="00:13:07.120" class="transcript_line"> and he has supposedly said,</div><div id="00:13:09.680" class="transcript_line"> allegedly, I haven&#039;t seen this written down,</div><div id="00:13:11.840" class="transcript_line"> but I heard that he said,</div><div id="00:13:13.520" class="transcript_line"> I do not have to explain my life to these people,</div><div id="00:13:17.520" class="transcript_line"> because they know.</div><div id="00:13:19.520" class="transcript_line"> But people after the making of the side of the village were very,</div><div id="00:13:22.640" class="transcript_line"> especially in Miners, very anti-fascist.</div><div id="00:13:27.040" class="transcript_line"> And he was also, but it&#039;s in the book that he said,</div><div id="00:13:29.520" class="transcript_line"> I found all that I required.</div><div id="00:13:32.160" class="transcript_line"> So he stayed with Peck and Dave,</div><div id="00:13:33.920" class="transcript_line"> we call them Peck and Dave, right?</div><div id="00:13:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Dy Alex and his wife,</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> for about three weeks.</div><div id="00:13:40.320" class="transcript_line"> And then he decided to stay,</div><div id="00:13:42.560" class="transcript_line"> and he moved to the Pennebott, Pennebott Inn.</div><div id="00:13:46.640" class="transcript_line"> The Hodges were the landlords,</div><div id="00:13:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Roy Hodges and his wife.</div><div id="00:13:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Is it Hodges? Hodges, sorry.</div><div id="00:13:58.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure.</div><div id="00:14:00.080" class="transcript_line"> In the Pennebott, and they rented</div><div id="00:14:03.360" class="transcript_line"> a living room, a bedroom, and a ballroom.</div><div id="00:14:06.960" class="transcript_line"> John asked me if they did in the ballroom,</div><div id="00:14:09.200" class="transcript_line"> but he painted there.</div><div id="00:14:11.680" class="transcript_line"> And while they were there,</div><div id="00:14:12.880" class="transcript_line"> they were there for about 18 months before</div><div id="00:14:14.480" class="transcript_line"> they decided, the Hodges decided to move</div><div id="00:14:17.680" class="transcript_line"> and go farming.</div><div id="00:14:19.040" class="transcript_line"> And they became quite friendly at that time,</div><div id="00:14:22.160" class="transcript_line"> and he didn&#039;t want to stay there,</div><div id="00:14:23.840" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t want to stay there with new landlords.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But while they were there,</div><div id="00:14:29.200" class="transcript_line"> he painted in oil, Katria, his wife,</div><div id="00:14:33.840" class="transcript_line"> and that portrait is still there.</div><div id="00:14:36.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s now with the National Library in Aberystwyth.</div><div id="00:14:41.040" class="transcript_line"> He also painted three,</div><div id="00:14:44.800" class="transcript_line"> or drew, painted one and drew,</div><div id="00:14:47.520" class="transcript_line"> three characters who featured</div><div id="00:14:50.160" class="transcript_line"> in the sign of village.</div><div id="00:14:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And he did that when he was in the Pennebott.</div><div id="00:14:56.080" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve seen the sign of village,</div><div id="00:14:57.440" class="transcript_line"> they really are very striking.</div><div id="00:15:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I have seen it.</div><div id="00:15:01.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve seen it, you know,</div><div id="00:15:02.720" class="transcript_line"> there was a Llew North, we called him,</div><div id="00:15:04.960" class="transcript_line"> his name was Llew Chords,</div><div id="00:15:06.080" class="transcript_line"> but he was from the North,</div><div id="00:15:07.360" class="transcript_line"> and was known as Llew North.</div><div id="00:15:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Very charismatic, the three that do it.</div><div id="00:15:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Then there was Henry John Williams,</div><div id="00:15:15.920" class="transcript_line"> and Henry John Williams,</div><div id="00:15:18.720" class="transcript_line"> his drawing of Henry John Williams</div><div id="00:15:22.320" class="transcript_line"> is in a private collection in Estred.</div><div id="00:15:25.280" class="transcript_line"> And then Sid Bowen, another one,</div><div id="00:15:30.720" class="transcript_line"> a very, as I say, very striking looking,</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> very Hollywood looking,</div><div id="00:15:37.120" class="transcript_line"> considering there were no professional actors</div><div id="00:15:39.760" class="transcript_line"> in the film, astounding.</div><div id="00:15:42.480" class="transcript_line"> And that drawing is also in a private collection</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> in Estred.</div><div id="00:15:48.080" class="transcript_line"> And those were,</div><div id="00:15:50.560" class="transcript_line"> not what you would expect Joseph Herman to have done,</div><div id="00:15:53.040" class="transcript_line"> because we see his art as monuments,</div><div id="00:15:59.680" class="transcript_line"> in a sense, to something.</div><div id="00:16:01.920" class="transcript_line"> So this is before his method changed.</div><div id="00:16:05.920" class="transcript_line"> So these three portraits were most definitely done</div><div id="00:16:09.600" class="transcript_line"> when he was in the Pennebott.</div><div id="00:16:12.640" class="transcript_line"> Then up on the side of the Pennebott,</div><div id="00:16:14.480" class="transcript_line"> you can see out in two,</div><div id="00:16:17.120" class="transcript_line"> what was then called Goff Buildings,</div><div id="00:16:19.600" class="transcript_line"> now called Rested Vowr,</div><div id="00:16:22.720" class="transcript_line"> and he saw Nestling in the Weeds, I always say,</div><div id="00:16:26.400" class="transcript_line"> an old pop factory.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was not a news, I think, it was a storage.</div><div id="00:16:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And Catrier bought the old pop factory</div><div id="00:16:38.400" class="transcript_line"> and they converted it into a dwelling, of course,</div><div id="00:16:42.960" class="transcript_line"> and a studio for each,</div><div id="00:16:44.320" class="transcript_line"> because Catrier was also an artist, Catrier Herman.</div><div id="00:16:49.200" class="transcript_line"> She was quite a flamboyant and lively character, actually.</div><div id="00:16:52.880" class="transcript_line"> In her own right, she was quite startling.</div><div id="00:16:57.440" class="transcript_line"> And very friendly and loved as strict and nice.</div><div id="00:17:04.080" class="transcript_line"> So they settled there, and it&#039;s there in the studio,</div><div id="00:17:08.560" class="transcript_line"> they remained until 1955,</div><div id="00:17:11.920" class="transcript_line"> and their marriage broke up,</div><div id="00:17:13.520" class="transcript_line"> and they went their different ways,</div><div id="00:17:15.920" class="transcript_line"> and that was 1955.</div><div id="00:17:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And the time, the studio was built</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> by a builder, Islwyn Thomas,</div><div id="00:17:24.400" class="transcript_line"> and also a lot of the carpentry work</div><div id="00:17:28.880" class="transcript_line"> and the fish pond was done by the Roberts Brothers,</div><div id="00:17:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Dai Roberts in particular,</div><div id="00:17:37.200" class="transcript_line"> and his wife, Nancy, was there every day as a companion.</div><div id="00:17:44.480" class="transcript_line"> And so that Carole, Carole Roberts, Carole Rouser,</div><div id="00:17:47.920" class="transcript_line"> do you know her?</div><div id="00:17:51.440" class="transcript_line"> She was more or less brought up there,</div><div id="00:17:52.880" class="transcript_line"> so I always say if people want to know</div><div id="00:17:54.960" class="transcript_line"> exactly what went on in the studio,</div><div id="00:17:57.440" class="transcript_line"> who came there, who were their friends, etc.,</div><div id="00:18:00.880" class="transcript_line"> they would only have to ask Carole.</div><div id="00:18:04.240" class="transcript_line"> She lives in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:18:05.760" class="transcript_line"> and she knows quite a lot about their lives in the studio,</div><div id="00:18:11.200" class="transcript_line"> and particularly Catrier, she was very well fond of Catrier.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Catrier, as I said, was quite a personality.</div><div id="00:18:17.200" class="transcript_line"> She loved children,</div><div id="00:18:19.280" class="transcript_line"> and she had organised on one occasion</div><div id="00:18:21.920" class="transcript_line"> the children of the building, Leicester Fowl now,</div><div id="00:18:25.920" class="transcript_line"> to perform Cinderella.</div><div id="00:18:32.880" class="transcript_line"> And we tried to track down the cast, actually.</div><div id="00:18:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Cinderella was merely his,</div><div id="00:18:37.040" class="transcript_line"> since she now lives in Washington.</div><div id="00:18:39.680" class="transcript_line"> So just difficult to track down.</div><div id="00:18:41.760" class="transcript_line"> To have a re-enactment of Cinderella</div><div id="00:18:44.320" class="transcript_line"> with everybody being very much older,</div><div id="00:18:47.680" class="transcript_line"> very, very.</div><div id="00:18:48.320" class="transcript_line"> And Carole, she was the musical director.</div><div id="00:18:53.200" class="transcript_line"> She was a very good pianist.</div><div id="00:18:56.480" class="transcript_line"> So she was very lively, very colourful.</div><div id="00:18:59.680" class="transcript_line"> I know she made for me,</div><div id="00:19:00.880" class="transcript_line"> because I lived on a farm from the end,</div><div id="00:19:03.920" class="transcript_line"> she made for me a marionette,</div><div id="00:19:05.280" class="transcript_line"> a little puppet theatre.</div><div id="00:19:06.720" class="transcript_line"> I played with,</div><div id="00:19:09.920" class="transcript_line"> I was an only child as well,</div><div id="00:19:11.760" class="transcript_line"> and I played until it collapsed.</div><div id="00:19:15.360" class="transcript_line"> So she was very friendly,</div><div id="00:19:16.480" class="transcript_line"> and she loved Mr. Gullness.</div><div id="00:19:18.960" class="transcript_line"> He immersed himself in life here.</div><div id="00:19:22.320" class="transcript_line"> He came to the Melfer Hall</div><div id="00:19:24.480" class="transcript_line"> for one of the concerts.</div><div id="00:19:25.520" class="transcript_line"> He was chair of the choir,</div><div id="00:19:31.600" class="transcript_line"> the Mr. Gullness Mewroch Choir,</div><div id="00:19:33.120" class="transcript_line"> which at that time,</div><div id="00:19:35.520" class="transcript_line"> rehearsed and performed at Melfer Hall.</div><div id="00:19:40.640" class="transcript_line"> He had many friends.</div><div id="00:19:42.320" class="transcript_line"> He had Leo Morgan, the photographer,</div><div id="00:19:44.640" class="transcript_line"> T.J. Davies, the photographer.</div><div id="00:19:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Dianna and Peggy,</div><div id="00:19:49.040" class="transcript_line"> they went to London in 1950,</div><div id="00:19:53.200" class="transcript_line"> because from a captain in the mines,</div><div id="00:19:55.120" class="transcript_line"> he became then an exhibition officer</div><div id="00:20:01.280" class="transcript_line"> for the newly formed National Court Board.</div><div id="00:20:04.160" class="transcript_line"> I lived in London.</div><div id="00:20:05.760" class="transcript_line"> That was a leap, I know.</div><div id="00:20:07.600" class="transcript_line"> So they went up close from there on,</div><div id="00:20:11.280" class="transcript_line"> about that time on.</div><div id="00:20:12.240" class="transcript_line"> T.J. Davies, Leo Morgan,</div><div id="00:20:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Menna Gully,</div><div id="00:20:18.800" class="transcript_line"> she was a very big friend of Herman,</div><div id="00:20:21.040" class="transcript_line"> and Herman painted her in the nude.</div><div id="00:20:23.760" class="transcript_line"> And that also is in a private collection</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> in Ystrak-an-Lest.</div><div id="00:20:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there are some really lovely stories,</div><div id="00:20:31.200" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t tell them, actually.</div><div id="00:20:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Naughty stories, really, about him.</div><div id="00:20:36.080" class="transcript_line"> He was very naughty.</div><div id="00:20:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Very lively, very naughty.</div><div id="00:20:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:40.800" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll leave it at that.</div><div id="00:20:42.240" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll leave it at that.</div><div id="00:20:43.200" class="transcript_line"> But she left in 1949,</div><div id="00:20:45.120" class="transcript_line"> because her husband,</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> who was a lecturer,</div><div id="00:20:46.880" class="transcript_line"> philosopher in Swansea,</div><div id="00:20:48.960" class="transcript_line"> went to lecture in Keele University,</div><div id="00:20:51.280" class="transcript_line"> and from Keele to Ulster,</div><div id="00:20:54.080" class="transcript_line"> and much later on to Cambridge,</div><div id="00:20:56.080" class="transcript_line"> where she then met up with Joseph Herman</div><div id="00:20:58.320" class="transcript_line"> when he was living in Suffolk.</div><div id="00:20:59.840" class="transcript_line"> So they were lifelong friends.</div><div id="00:21:01.920" class="transcript_line"> She wrote many novels,</div><div id="00:21:05.920" class="transcript_line"> and she was fearless.</div><div id="00:21:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Very interesting, Talita.</div><div id="00:21:09.520" class="transcript_line"> So it would be lovely if you could</div><div id="00:21:12.240" class="transcript_line"> have many artist friends there,</div><div id="00:21:13.920" class="transcript_line"> you know,</div><div id="00:21:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Mary Falk is another</div><div id="00:21:20.320" class="transcript_line"> woman artist.</div><div id="00:21:21.840" class="transcript_line"> She came to the studio</div><div id="00:21:23.680" class="transcript_line"> and remained a lifelong friend.</div><div id="00:21:26.880" class="transcript_line"> People who were politically motivated.</div><div id="00:21:29.600" class="transcript_line"> It was a very politicised time, actually.</div><div id="00:21:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:34.080" class="transcript_line"> So many of them would be</div><div id="00:21:35.920" class="transcript_line"> from the left wing.</div><div id="00:21:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Diana himself had been a member</div><div id="00:21:39.920" class="transcript_line"> of the Communist Party</div><div id="00:21:41.840" class="transcript_line"> until the 1950s,</div><div id="00:21:43.120" class="transcript_line"> and the Soviet invasion of Hungary,</div><div id="00:21:49.200" class="transcript_line"> and then he came out of the Communist Party.</div><div id="00:21:52.400" class="transcript_line"> So people who were very, very left wing.</div><div id="00:21:57.440" class="transcript_line"> Another big friend of his was Jim Lewis.</div><div id="00:21:59.920" class="transcript_line"> He was a lovely chap.</div><div id="00:22:01.440" class="transcript_line"> He had shopped Jim on the square</div><div id="00:22:04.320" class="transcript_line"> in his Gendwin arms.</div><div id="00:22:05.920" class="transcript_line"> That area was called the square,</div><div id="00:22:08.080" class="transcript_line"> and it was very important for</div><div id="00:22:09.760" class="transcript_line"> protests and things</div><div id="00:22:12.800" class="transcript_line"> throughout the 20th century.</div><div id="00:22:14.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, big protests always there.</div><div id="00:22:16.960" class="transcript_line"> I know that.</div><div id="00:22:17.600" class="transcript_line"> The square.</div><div id="00:22:18.100" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard something there now.</div><div id="00:22:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:20.160" class="transcript_line"> I want to have something to</div><div id="00:22:23.040" class="transcript_line"> to get people to remember that.</div><div id="00:22:24.400" class="transcript_line"> A bench or a plaque would say something,</div><div id="00:22:26.800" class="transcript_line"> you know.</div><div id="00:22:27.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was seriously just called Red Square.</div><div id="00:22:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Because Jim himself was very left wing</div><div id="00:22:35.920" class="transcript_line"> in the shop.</div><div id="00:22:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Shopped Jim Bach.</div><div id="00:22:40.080" class="transcript_line"> So there was Jim,</div><div id="00:22:41.360" class="transcript_line"> there was Llew,</div><div id="00:22:42.640" class="transcript_line"> TJ Davis,</div><div id="00:22:44.400" class="transcript_line"> and lots more.</div><div id="00:22:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Everybody seemed to welcome him</div><div id="00:22:46.960" class="transcript_line"> back to Port of the Welfare Hall.</div><div id="00:22:52.400" class="transcript_line"> Also they had many visitors</div><div id="00:22:53.920" class="transcript_line"> or Carol Rosa tells me,</div><div id="00:22:55.440" class="transcript_line"> many visitors who were</div><div id="00:22:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Jewish artists and writers.</div><div id="00:23:02.640" class="transcript_line"> One in particular, Martin Bloch.</div><div id="00:23:04.400" class="transcript_line"> Also,</div><div id="00:23:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Chlediwr,</div><div id="00:23:08.400" class="transcript_line"> but from Silesia,</div><div id="00:23:09.920" class="transcript_line"> from Poland or Hungary.</div><div id="00:23:14.480" class="transcript_line"> So she in part could fill you in</div><div id="00:23:17.280" class="transcript_line"> about lots of those intellectuals,</div><div id="00:23:19.760" class="transcript_line"> really,</div><div id="00:23:21.120" class="transcript_line"> who gathered in the studio.</div><div id="00:23:23.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a very lively place.</div><div id="00:23:25.200" class="transcript_line"> It was very fair.</div><div id="00:23:27.440" class="transcript_line"> Now, why did he stay?</div><div id="00:23:28.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know,</div><div id="00:23:29.200" class="transcript_line"> I think I answered that as a question</div><div id="00:23:31.520" class="transcript_line"> I put as well to my son.</div><div id="00:23:32.880" class="transcript_line"> Why did he stay?</div><div id="00:23:33.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, one would be friendships.</div><div id="00:23:37.600" class="transcript_line"> The way that he actually,</div><div id="00:23:38.960" class="transcript_line"> they did embrace</div><div id="00:23:40.640" class="transcript_line"> and immerse themselves in village life.</div><div id="00:23:43.440" class="transcript_line"> But another thing I think is most important</div><div id="00:23:45.440" class="transcript_line"> is the time.</div><div id="00:23:49.120" class="transcript_line"> It is a time of, say, 1945</div><div id="00:23:51.840" class="transcript_line"> of post-war optimism.</div><div id="00:23:54.880" class="transcript_line"> A rebirth, as he himself called it,</div><div id="00:23:56.960" class="transcript_line"> a rebirth.</div><div id="00:23:58.080" class="transcript_line"> It is the time of the</div><div id="00:24:01.440" class="transcript_line"> newly formed</div><div id="00:24:02.240" class="transcript_line"> National Health Service, NHS.</div><div id="00:24:06.720" class="transcript_line"> It was the active government.</div><div id="00:24:09.120" class="transcript_line"> The welfare state.</div><div id="00:24:11.680" class="transcript_line"> So you had a lot of joy,</div><div id="00:24:13.360" class="transcript_line"> a lot of looking forward to</div><div id="00:24:15.520" class="transcript_line"> a new order, shall we say,</div><div id="00:24:19.600" class="transcript_line"> a new time.</div><div id="00:24:20.720" class="transcript_line"> So there was that optimism.</div><div id="00:24:22.800" class="transcript_line"> There was the friendship.</div><div id="00:24:25.280" class="transcript_line"> And so it was time.</div><div id="00:24:26.880" class="transcript_line"> He was in the, as were Roberts,</div><div id="00:24:29.120" class="transcript_line"> and then,</div><div id="00:24:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Bill Roberts is quite a well-known Welsh artist</div><div id="00:24:33.440" class="transcript_line"> from Neath.</div><div id="00:24:34.960" class="transcript_line"> All right?</div><div id="00:24:35.920" class="transcript_line"> And he was a very good friend as well.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Sir Leifold, another good friend.</div><div id="00:24:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And Will Roberts said, well, yes,</div><div id="00:24:43.120" class="transcript_line"> he was here at the right time,</div><div id="00:24:45.840" class="transcript_line"> in the right place,</div><div id="00:24:47.200" class="transcript_line"> at the right time.</div><div id="00:24:50.160" class="transcript_line"> And I thought that was, well,</div><div id="00:24:55.520" class="transcript_line"> when you really have to examine the time</div><div id="00:24:57.680" class="transcript_line"> to understand that, you know.</div><div id="00:25:00.640" class="transcript_line"> And how everybody celebrated this,</div><div id="00:25:03.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, this new order.</div><div id="00:25:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Order, yeah, a new era.</div><div id="00:25:08.320" class="transcript_line"> A new era.</div><div id="00:25:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t have to be seen again.</div><div id="00:25:12.800" class="transcript_line"> So I covered where he lived.</div><div id="00:25:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Not at finish and say,</div><div id="00:25:17.120" class="transcript_line"> well, what did he think of us?</div><div id="00:25:20.640" class="transcript_line"> Many, many,</div><div id="00:25:25.920" class="transcript_line"> many, many books written about him, actually.</div><div id="00:25:27.920" class="transcript_line"> And things like that.</div><div id="00:25:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, in 1946, really,</div><div id="00:25:31.680" class="transcript_line"> when he came to Britain,</div><div id="00:25:33.360" class="transcript_line"> he spoke six languages.</div><div id="00:25:35.520" class="transcript_line"> But when he came to Britain,</div><div id="00:25:36.480" class="transcript_line"> he didn&#039;t speak English,</div><div id="00:25:37.360" class="transcript_line"> but he picked it up very quickly.</div><div id="00:25:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Not, he said, Welsh is too difficult, he said.</div><div id="00:25:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Part is six, he wrote in the Welsh review.</div><div id="00:25:45.200" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll just take it.</div><div id="00:25:47.360" class="transcript_line"> X class, that was called,</div><div id="00:25:48.640" class="transcript_line"> the mining village.</div><div id="00:25:50.640" class="transcript_line"> And in his own words,</div><div id="00:25:52.560" class="transcript_line"> the mining village differs from others I know.</div><div id="00:25:55.440" class="transcript_line"> First of all, in its colour,</div><div id="00:25:57.360" class="transcript_line"> violet roofs at the foot of green hills,</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> pyramids of black tips surrounded by cloud,</div><div id="00:26:05.520" class="transcript_line"> by trees the colour of dark bottles.</div><div id="00:26:09.920" class="transcript_line"> When the sun appears and gills the air,</div><div id="00:26:13.680" class="transcript_line"> the streets otherwise,</div><div id="00:26:15.360" class="transcript_line"> only from grey, become copper brown.</div><div id="00:26:19.600" class="transcript_line"> There you are,</div><div id="00:26:20.640" class="transcript_line"> said a man with a soft voice of secrecy to me.</div><div id="00:26:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Such is life, yeah, mostly grey,</div><div id="00:26:26.240" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s also a drop of gold.</div><div id="00:26:30.080" class="transcript_line"> For weeks I wandered here in the hills,</div><div id="00:26:32.560" class="transcript_line"> in the little streets,</div><div id="00:26:34.160" class="transcript_line"> looking at the landscape,</div><div id="00:26:36.080" class="transcript_line"> looking at walls and at men,</div><div id="00:26:37.840" class="transcript_line"> at pits from far and near,</div><div id="00:26:40.480" class="transcript_line"> sketching and talking to miners</div><div id="00:26:42.640" class="transcript_line"> on the surface and on the ground,</div><div id="00:26:44.560" class="transcript_line"> at work and at rest,</div><div id="00:26:46.560" class="transcript_line"> studying their movements</div><div id="00:26:48.560" class="transcript_line"> and their appearance.</div><div id="00:26:51.840" class="transcript_line"> The miner is a man of a strickeness.</div><div id="00:26:56.240" class="transcript_line"> In his appearance on the workforce site</div><div id="00:26:58.080" class="transcript_line"> like other workers,</div><div id="00:26:59.520" class="transcript_line"> the miner is more impressive and singular.</div><div id="00:27:04.480" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I thought of old Egyptian carvings</div><div id="00:27:08.400" class="transcript_line"> walking between sky and earth,</div><div id="00:27:12.240" class="transcript_line"> or of dark locks fashioned into glorious human shapes,</div><div id="00:27:17.280" class="transcript_line"> or of heavy logs in which a primitive hand</div><div id="00:27:21.040" class="transcript_line"> had tried to synthesise the pride of human labour,</div><div id="00:27:24.640" class="transcript_line"> and a calm force which promises to guard its dignity.</div><div id="00:27:31.360" class="transcript_line"> It would be true to say that the miner</div><div id="00:27:34.240" class="transcript_line"> is a walking monument to labour.</div><div id="00:27:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Now what&#039;s extraordinary that he could write like that,</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> so poetically,</div><div id="00:27:44.640" class="transcript_line"> and in short the time.</div><div id="00:27:46.880" class="transcript_line"> I say because his visits to the strickeness library</div><div id="00:27:49.920" class="transcript_line"> in the mine as well.</div><div id="00:27:50.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he used to like to visit as well.</div><div id="00:27:55.200" class="transcript_line"> I forgot about the two I should have finished there,</div><div id="00:27:58.880" class="transcript_line"> that when he was in the studio,</div><div id="00:28:00.320" class="transcript_line"> he painted the parlours for the Festival of Britain,</div><div id="00:28:04.720" class="transcript_line"> for the pavilion of islands minerals,</div><div id="00:28:08.160" class="transcript_line"> it is called,</div><div id="00:28:08.720" class="transcript_line"> the Festival of Britain 1951,</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> which made him quite famous,</div><div id="00:28:13.280" class="transcript_line"> they were huge and it became quite famous.</div><div id="00:28:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Can I say something quickly about</div><div id="00:28:17.600" class="transcript_line"> obviously the Joseph Herman Foundation</div><div id="00:28:19.280" class="transcript_line"> to put onto the edge,</div><div id="00:28:20.320" class="transcript_line"> yes, yes.</div><div id="00:28:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Just to say how his heritage then is being,</div><div id="00:28:24.400" class="transcript_line"> is being preserved and remembered in the area to this day.</div><div id="00:28:28.080" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t show you any person,</div><div id="00:28:30.400" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ll tell you,</div><div id="00:28:31.920" class="transcript_line"> people used to say to me,</div><div id="00:28:33.040" class="transcript_line"> and by that time I owned the studio,</div><div id="00:28:35.440" class="transcript_line"> because Diana bought the studio</div><div id="00:28:38.800" class="transcript_line"> when he was living in London,</div><div id="00:28:39.840" class="transcript_line"> so I had a home here as well,</div><div id="00:28:42.320" class="transcript_line"> and I inherited the studio.</div><div id="00:28:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So people used to say,</div><div id="00:28:48.400" class="transcript_line"> and I knew,</div><div id="00:28:49.440" class="transcript_line"> I knew of course I was in Portis,</div><div id="00:28:51.040" class="transcript_line"> but I didn&#039;t think of doing anything,</div><div id="00:28:53.520" class="transcript_line"> but people said,</div><div id="00:28:54.720" class="transcript_line"> well, you know,</div><div id="00:28:55.200" class="transcript_line"> people must recognise and realise</div><div id="00:28:56.800" class="transcript_line"> just as significant this is,</div><div id="00:28:59.200" class="transcript_line"> well, I could see significance as 20th century,</div><div id="00:29:03.360" class="transcript_line"> mid-20th century,</div><div id="00:29:04.480" class="transcript_line"> just like the sign of village,</div><div id="00:29:05.760" class="transcript_line"> two events in town,</div><div id="00:29:07.600" class="transcript_line"> which would get interested.</div><div id="00:29:12.080" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m talking to Anne about it,</div><div id="00:29:13.840" class="transcript_line"> when we were walking along the street,</div><div id="00:29:15.360" class="transcript_line"> from the cross actually,</div><div id="00:29:16.560" class="transcript_line"> right up to the welfare hall.</div><div id="00:29:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Now Anne and I were both on the board</div><div id="00:29:20.960" class="transcript_line"> of the Miners Welfare Hall,</div><div id="00:29:23.520" class="transcript_line"> and I said,</div><div id="00:29:24.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what to do,</div><div id="00:29:25.440" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t join,</div><div id="00:29:26.240" class="transcript_line"> just because John Marley,</div><div id="00:29:28.000" class="transcript_line"> listen to our conversation,</div><div id="00:29:29.840" class="transcript_line"> he added,</div><div id="00:29:30.480" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s do something with children,</div><div id="00:29:33.200" class="transcript_line"> there are people.</div><div id="00:29:35.360" class="transcript_line"> So we, let&#039;s go in and ask,</div><div id="00:29:37.120" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s a good idea.</div><div id="00:29:38.720" class="transcript_line"> So I always say,</div><div id="00:29:40.400" class="transcript_line"> it was all down to John Marley.</div><div id="00:29:46.320" class="transcript_line"> And so we went,</div><div id="00:29:47.360" class="transcript_line"> and the hall saw wind,</div><div id="00:29:48.560" class="transcript_line"> and we said we should do something,</div><div id="00:29:49.840" class="transcript_line"> and he crossed our trains,</div><div id="00:29:51.520" class="transcript_line"> and he said,</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> yes, we should actually.</div><div id="00:29:53.520" class="transcript_line"> I tell you what,</div><div id="00:29:54.240" class="transcript_line"> he said, I&#039;ll get an artisan residence,</div><div id="00:29:57.200" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ll find a school around here,</div><div id="00:29:59.680" class="transcript_line"> an artisan residence,</div><div id="00:30:01.360" class="transcript_line"> and we did that,</div><div id="00:30:02.240" class="transcript_line"> and it was Cynllais School,</div><div id="00:30:03.760" class="transcript_line"> it was the first school.</div><div id="00:30:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Schools, the names of schools</div><div id="00:30:06.880" class="transcript_line"> come out of the heart.</div><div id="00:30:08.640" class="transcript_line"> So it was then,</div><div id="00:30:10.320" class="transcript_line"> I should say,</div><div id="00:30:11.360" class="transcript_line"> part of the board of the Miners Welfare Hall,</div><div id="00:30:15.040" class="transcript_line"> right?</div><div id="00:30:15.760" class="transcript_line"> The Miners Welfare Hall is the father.</div><div id="00:30:21.520" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:30:21.840" class="transcript_line"> It began there.</div><div id="00:30:24.080" class="transcript_line"> So if Alan and I had just been us,</div><div id="00:30:27.360" class="transcript_line"> we would have been on the board of the hall.</div><div id="00:30:30.240" class="transcript_line"> We probably would have done every school,</div><div id="00:30:32.160" class="transcript_line"> eventually, in Ystrak-y-Garnais.</div><div id="00:30:34.880" class="transcript_line"> But wind met Caroline Davies,</div><div id="00:30:40.080" class="transcript_line"> who was the Arts Development Officer</div><div id="00:30:41.760" class="transcript_line"> for Swansea City.</div><div id="00:30:44.480" class="transcript_line"> And she said,</div><div id="00:30:47.200" class="transcript_line"> and he told her what we were doing,</div><div id="00:30:48.960" class="transcript_line"> and she knew of Joseph Herman,</div><div id="00:30:50.480" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;d actually written a children&#039;s book</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> for schools on Joseph Herman.</div><div id="00:30:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She said,</div><div id="00:30:56.480" class="transcript_line"> can we join you?</div><div id="00:30:58.080" class="transcript_line"> So she brought her friend.</div><div id="00:30:59.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we found a committee,</div><div id="00:31:01.600" class="transcript_line"> sort of,</div><div id="00:31:03.040" class="transcript_line"> not independent of the board,</div><div id="00:31:04.640" class="transcript_line"> but a sort of appendage or something,</div><div id="00:31:06.880" class="transcript_line"> you know, someplace.</div><div id="00:31:08.960" class="transcript_line"> There were board members as well.</div><div id="00:31:11.120" class="transcript_line"> It grew, it grew.</div><div id="00:31:12.480" class="transcript_line"> And we thought we would</div><div id="00:31:13.920" class="transcript_line"> sort of make it a more formal,</div><div id="00:31:15.840" class="transcript_line"> by 2004,</div><div id="00:31:17.920" class="transcript_line"> because now we were doing</div><div id="00:31:18.960" class="transcript_line"> schools, residencies,</div><div id="00:31:21.360" class="transcript_line"> and with Caroline Davies&#039; help now,</div><div id="00:31:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Caroline Davies,</div><div id="00:31:27.600" class="transcript_line"> because she, as Arts Development Officer,</div><div id="00:31:30.640" class="transcript_line"> she had contacts with the Arts Development Officers</div><div id="00:31:33.600" class="transcript_line"> for Wales, Ceredigion,</div><div id="00:31:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Cymraedyn, Yn y Potamboedd,</div><div id="00:31:37.040" class="transcript_line"> you know.</div><div id="00:31:38.400" class="transcript_line"> So we thought it would grow that way.</div><div id="00:31:40.640" class="transcript_line"> So we became,</div><div id="00:31:42.960" class="transcript_line"> we thought we&#039;d formalise things</div><div id="00:31:44.320" class="transcript_line"> and became a company limited by guarantee,</div><div id="00:31:47.040" class="transcript_line"> a charitable status.</div><div id="00:31:49.520" class="transcript_line"> And so it goes on.</div><div id="00:31:50.880" class="transcript_line"> And then we found there was some money</div><div id="00:31:52.880" class="transcript_line"> with Spirit European Funding.</div><div id="00:31:56.560" class="transcript_line"> We employed a project manager</div><div id="00:31:59.760" class="transcript_line"> over Agriphus for two years anyway.</div><div id="00:32:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Then after the Blue Tate,</div><div id="00:32:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Tate Bittin contacted us.</div><div id="00:32:10.960" class="transcript_line"> By that time, Eleanor,</div><div id="00:32:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Eleanor, Ylbina was involved in,</div><div id="00:32:14.880" class="transcript_line"> and the telephone came,</div><div id="00:32:16.080" class="transcript_line"> the phone came from the Tate</div><div id="00:32:18.160" class="transcript_line"> to the Miners Welfare Hall.</div><div id="00:32:19.920" class="transcript_line"> And we heard about it,</div><div id="00:32:21.280" class="transcript_line"> we thought it must be a joke.</div><div id="00:32:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t possibly be true.</div><div id="00:32:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Tate Bittin, Roedd y,</div><div id="00:32:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Bittin asked us to give it.</div><div id="00:32:29.200" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:32:30.640" class="transcript_line"> No, impossible.</div><div id="00:32:31.840" class="transcript_line"> We sat in it for two days.</div><div id="00:32:33.120" class="transcript_line"> And we had, yeah, we tried,</div><div id="00:32:34.640" class="transcript_line"> you see what it is.</div><div id="00:32:35.360" class="transcript_line"> And it was indeed Tate Bittin asked us</div><div id="00:32:38.080" class="transcript_line"> to get involved in this project.</div><div id="00:32:42.160" class="transcript_line"> And we thought that took two years.</div><div id="00:32:44.240" class="transcript_line"> And that indeed helped it to grow,</div><div id="00:32:49.040" class="transcript_line"> to really become different,</div><div id="00:32:53.520" class="transcript_line"> more known about.</div><div id="00:32:56.640" class="transcript_line"> And then, when Eleanor was project manager,</div><div id="00:32:59.440" class="transcript_line"> wanted everything to be bilingual.</div><div id="00:33:01.520" class="transcript_line"> I think we were producing things.</div><div id="00:33:04.560" class="transcript_line"> We were having grants, you know,</div><div id="00:33:06.160" class="transcript_line"> we were always looking for grants,</div><div id="00:33:07.760" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:33:10.560" class="transcript_line"> It becomes, oh, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:33:14.240" class="transcript_line"> I like breezes, I am.</div><div id="00:33:15.760" class="transcript_line"> So difficult.</div><div id="00:33:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:17.840" class="transcript_line"> But during Owen Lepis&#039;s time,</div><div id="00:33:21.200" class="transcript_line"> which was funded by the European Fund,</div><div id="00:33:25.760" class="transcript_line"> he told us about the Nationalist Devon.</div><div id="00:33:28.080" class="transcript_line"> This would be 2007.</div><div id="00:33:31.280" class="transcript_line"> It was a long time ago.</div><div id="00:33:33.280" class="transcript_line"> So why not have a sponsor,</div><div id="00:33:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Dev is a Bobble,</div><div id="00:33:36.800" class="transcript_line"> just sponsor in it.</div><div id="00:33:37.760" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s the people&#039;s choice</div><div id="00:33:41.120" class="transcript_line"> in Lle Celf, in the art pavilion,</div><div id="00:33:43.600" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the last day of the Nusenegwod.</div><div id="00:33:46.400" class="transcript_line"> And they wrote it all week</div><div id="00:33:48.560" class="transcript_line">

I,</div><div id="00:33:53.040" class="transcript_line"> I think we have gone all over the place.</div><div id="00:33:56.880" class="transcript_line"> You have no idea.</div><div id="00:33:57.600" class="transcript_line"> From banks to teleconvery,</div><div id="00:34:01.840" class="transcript_line"> to the town council,</div><div id="00:34:02.880" class="transcript_line"> oh, and more and

because before we became involved in the Tate,</div><div id="00:34:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Tate incentives and in the book shop.</div><div id="00:34:19.840" class="transcript_line"> And there was an article by Rowan Williams</div><div id="00:34:21.680" class="transcript_line"> and his interest in art.</div><div id="00:34:23.120" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, well, well.</div><div id="00:34:26.880" class="transcript_line"> So I wrote to him and asked him</div><div id="00:34:28.240" class="transcript_line"> if he&#039;d become a patron.</div><div id="00:34:29.520" class="transcript_line"> I said, you don&#039;t know this.</div><div id="00:34:30.640" class="transcript_line"> And he wrote back to me and said,</div><div id="00:34:32.000" class="transcript_line"> you honor me.</div><div id="00:34:35.200" class="transcript_line"> So we, now with the prizes and this,</div><div id="00:34:38.720" class="transcript_line"> we asked him if he would come</div><div

id="00:34:49.920" class="transcript_line"> And he came on his own on the train.</div><div id="00:34:52.240" class="transcript_line"> No entourage, no security men.</div><div id="00:34:55.760" class="transcript_line"> So for the first time then, I think,</div><div id="00:34:58.800" class="transcript_line"> the ice dead man took us very seriously</div><div id="00:35:00.720" class="transcript_line"> because we had the Archbishop of Canterbury.</div><div id="00:35:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and he was absolutely fantastic.</div><div id="00:35:05.920" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a lovely man.</div><div id="00:35:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I met him a few times.</div><div id="00:35:08.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s absolutely

bubble</div><div id="00:35:17.680" class="transcript_line"> sponsored or supported by Joseph Herman.</div><div id="00:35:21.280" class="transcript_line"> It was the Joseph Herman Art Award.</div><div id="00:35:27.360" class="transcript_line"> There was a bubble.</div><div id="00:35:28.240" class="transcript_line"> So the Joseph Herman Art Award at the top.</div><div id="00:35:30.800" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s thanks to Rowan Williams</div><div id="00:35:34.400" class="transcript_line"> setting up to give the prize.</div><div id="00:35:37.360" class="transcript_line"> Amazing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:38.560" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, things like that</div><div id="00:35:43.360" class="transcript_line"> are things
