    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Track 5. The almost lifeless lake at Glaslin.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Glaslin is what&#039;s known in conservation terms as oligotrophic, which basically means it&#039;s nutrient poor.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no inlet to it, it&#039;s rainwater fed, so obviously we&#039;ve got a lot of rain here.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why Wales is so green. The rainwater trickles through the peat and the heather moorland into this little glacial depression.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because of this, barely anything can survive in its clear waters.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> However, one specially adapted species, with a few years of evolution behind it,</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> fucks this trend, as Clive Faulkner and then his colleague Tammy Stretton reveal.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> In the lake here beside me there&#039;s a beautiful fern.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not a fern like you would know. It looks like a leek or a tuft of something.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a peculiar looking thing, it looks like a little sprout.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But this fern is growing on the bottom of the lake.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a very ancient sort of plant.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Before ferns it evolved millions and millions of years ago.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the dinosaurs, so far back in time that actually it was the most complex sort of plant on the planet.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And in those days they grew as mighty forests.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And as the plants have evolved over the millennia,</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve seen more and more complicated species come along and they&#039;ve pushed out these ancient species.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ve moved them to the most extreme locations.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And so now that particular sort of plant, a quillwort as it&#039;s called now,</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> has been pushed to the most extreme places on the top of a mountain at the bottom of a lake.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And there they persist to be spotted by the canny eye of the careful observer.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s a fantastic story.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t tend to generally see it obviously because it&#039;s in the water,</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> but if there&#039;s been a kind of a storm or strong winds like we&#039;ve got today,</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> you can get it washed up on the shoreline. So it&#039;s worth having a look out on the shore for it.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> At first glance the wildlife around the lake may appear relatively minimal too.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But take a look in the small pools and waterlogged areas within the heather.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And you may discover a dark world.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> If you are an insect anyway.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And the pools themselves can provide habitats for frogs and toads,</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> for dragonflies and damselflies, and some unusual plants as well.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> In the blanket bog areas there&#039;s a little plant called a sundew, which is very, very tiny,</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s insectivorous and it&#039;s got sticky little globules on it, which it catches insects.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Now it doesn&#039;t rely on those completely.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It still photosynthesises like other plants do, getting the energy from the sun.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But because bogs are very nutrient poor, they supplement their diet, if you like, with insects.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Turn right along the northern edge of the lake and cross over a small wooden boardwalk bridge.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Continue ahead through a metal gate and pass the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust plaque on your right.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Shortly after, listen to track 6, besides the small sign directing walkers to the viewpoint.</div></div></p>
