Yeah so</div><div id="00:14:44.120" class="transcript_line"> something good to you? Yeah.

Do you</div><div id="00:18:43.480" class="transcript_line"> remember the Barclay? Yeah. It was about half the size of this wasn&#039;t it? I think it could fit the</div><div id="00:18:48.920" class="transcript_line"> Barclay in the main room here. Yeah. Did you ever do anything with Alan Bishop? No. No not Alan Bishop.</div><div id="00:18:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Right I&#039;ve got a question for you.

Yeah. I&#039;m off to Glastonbury tomorrow</div><div id="00:20:13.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be seeing lots of live music and there&#039;s actually an Elvarna an Elvis themed band</div><div id="00:20:20.920" class="transcript_line"> so have you ever heard of the band Nirvana? No. No well they were a famous kind of grunge band</div><div id="00:20:26.200" class="transcript_line"> in the 90s so it&#039;s Elvis meets Nirvana so they play half Elvis songs and half Nirvana.</div><div id="00:20:33.880" class="transcript_line"> Very odd but you&#039;d probably love it actually. Yeah you would. So he&#039;s kind of like a preacher</div><div id="00:20:39.640" class="transcript_line"> almost isn&#039;t he? The lead singer so they do Nirvana songs but in the style of Elvis.</div><div id="00:20:46.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have to show you it to explain it to you but it&#039;s very good fun. I&#039;ll try and get a video if</div><div id="00:20:52.520" class="transcript_line"> I go and see them and then next time I see you I&#039;ll show you. So what else have you got planned</div><div id="00:20:57.240" class="transcript_line"> for this year? Any other trips? You&#039;ve been to Poland? You&#039;ve gone to Port Cor? Not yet.</div><div id="00:21:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t know what. The end of September I&#039;m not sure what. It&#039;s usually around the 26th of September</div><div id="00:21:16.440" class="transcript_line"> my wedding anniversary but you&#039;ve upgraded this year haven&#039;t you? You were telling me? Yeah. Well</div><div id="00:21:22.280" class="transcript_line"> have you upgraded too? VIP tickets isn&#039;t it? Yeah VIP very important Presley. Yeah. Nice.</div><div id="00:21:47.480" class="transcript_line"> What does that get you then? I&#039;m not sure. No you&#039;ll probably get a good view of the stage I&#039;d imagine</div><div id="00:21:55.640" class="transcript_line"> and maybe meet a couple of the performers or something like that. Have you already got your</div><div id="00:22:01.560" class="transcript_line"> tickets for all the shows? Yeah the office where Chris sorts out, it&#039;s all booked up, it&#039;s all people.</div><div id="00:22:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh so someone books it for you but then they make sure you can go to all the shows? Yeah. Lovely</div><div id="00:22:20.280" class="transcript_line"> answer because it&#039;s really hard to get tickets for those shows. So you must go to every show don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:22:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Do you ever get sick of it? No. No not me. Do you have fish and chips on the on the beach</div><div id="00:22:35.160" class="transcript_line"> front while you&#039;re there? Oh yeah I haven&#039;t played there.

Do</div><div id="00:22:48.920" class="transcript_line"> you ever go there for a show? That&#039;s in the pavilion. You go to the pavilion you don&#039;t go to high tide.</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll show where we are this year. No. You know where you where I met you by the stalls where</div><div id="00:23:08.520" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re buying your belt. High tide is one of those marquees there I think. Yeah. Not sure when</div><div id="00:23:16.200" class="transcript_line"> somebody said the fish going. Yeah that was on the news. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s gone yet though.</div><div id="00:23:23.720" class="transcript_line"> No not this year, not this year. But um they&#039;re thinking of selling off the land aren&#039;t they? Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:30.040" class="transcript_line"> Be such a shame. But the whole of that weekend you just see Elvis&#039;s walking everywhere don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:23:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Have you ever been to Graceland? No. Is that somewhere you&#039;d like to go? Yeah. You went there on</div><div id="00:23:47.960" class="transcript_line"> holiday didn&#039;t you? I&#039;ve been to Graceland twice. Memphis is it? Yeah Memphis, Tennessee. Apparently</div><div id="00:23:54.760" class="transcript_line"> his house is totally untouched. It&#039;s just as it was the way he&#039;s after. I watched um one of his final</div><div id="00:24:02.360" class="transcript_line"> performances the other day and it&#039;s stunning. I can&#039;t remember where it was at. It&#039;s like an</div><div id="00:24:07.720" class="transcript_line"> inside the theatre and um he&#039;s looking a little bit worse for wear but his voice is better than</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> ever. It was just a stunning performance. It&#039;s an unchanged melody isn&#039;t it? Yeah. It&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:24:23.080" class="transcript_line"> The king isn&#039;t he? All right maybe well is there anything else you&#039;d like to talk about?</div><div id="00:24:28.760" class="transcript_line"> No. You don&#039;t want to ask us anything because you didn&#039;t know. Had you met Michael before today?</div><div id="00:24:36.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve met a few times over the years haven&#039;t we? Yeah. Yeah. So we see that much. No. I say hello</div><div id="00:24:41.800" class="transcript_line"> if I&#039;m walking past but. And honestly he does really like films and quite often he finds me up to</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> remind me that there&#039;s a Rocky is on again or something. Yes. Yeah. I get reminders when</div><div id="00:24:56.120" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re doing a repeat. Yeah. What&#039;s your favourite film would you say?</div><div id="00:25:02.040" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s a hard question because I struggle to answer it. I like them all. Yeah. Favourite</div><div id="00:25:08.760" class="transcript_line"> genre? Do you like action films? Yeah. Yeah I love films. That&#039;s probably my favourite interest.</div><div id="00:25:19.240" class="transcript_line"> Sounds as if you&#039;re quite happy with your home life with your cat and your films.</div><div id="00:25:25.320" class="transcript_line"> And your cup of coffee is it? You&#039;d sit down with a cuppa? Yeah. And a glass of water. Glass</div><div id="00:25:30.120" class="transcript_line"> of water. Right. Okay. That&#039;s all you need isn&#039;t it? Is a cat and a good film. That&#039;s a nice sorted</div><div id="00:25:36.120" class="transcript_line"> for me. Do you cook for yourself? Yeah. I haven&#039;t been bothered because it&#039;s been too hot. Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:42.920" class="transcript_line"> Funny enough. Yeah. It does affect people doesn&#039;t it? Yeah. You don&#039;t want to stand there a heartbeat</div><div id="00:25:49.320" class="transcript_line"> in this weather. No. I&#039;ve been forcing my girlfriend or my fiance as you say to watch</div><div id="00:25:55.160" class="transcript_line"> Lord of the Rings films at the moment. It&#039;s the first time she&#039;s actually properly paid attention.</div><div id="00:26:00.440" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s actually enjoying them. I forced her to sit through them twice before but this time I think</div><div id="00:26:06.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve stocked them to enjoy them. Have you ever seen those films? Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit?</div><div id="00:26:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I&#039;ve seen them but. They&#039;re a bit long aren&#039;t they Ant? Yeah. Not your thing. No they&#039;re not for everyone.</div><div id="00:26:20.520" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re fantasies and a quiet taste. Yeah. Is there something like Rocky or? Horror films and stuff.</div><div id="00:26:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Listen, you and I are just in the cinema at the moment. Maybe doing all the Indiana Jones</div><div id="00:26:35.240" class="transcript_line"> things. Okay. Yeah yeah. I look forward to seeing that. Looks good doesn&#039;t it? Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah I love the old Indiana Jones films. Do you ever go to the cinema then? Oh it&#039;s twice as expensive.</div><div id="00:26:48.280" class="transcript_line"> To its length is it? Yeah. What horror films do you like? I quite like horror films.</div><div id="00:26:59.960" class="transcript_line"> I get all the wall of ideas at 13th. There&#039;s a lot of them out there. Yeah. They&#039;re almost comedy some of them.</div><div id="00:27:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever seen Hereditary? No. That&#039;s one of the recent horrors I watched and it&#039;s pretty terrifying.</div><div id="00:27:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you come across that that&#039;s worth a watch. Halloween? Did you see the Halloween films?</div><div id="00:27:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I see them but. Yeah. Not bad. Obviously you see Jamie most weeks but this is your opportunity to</div><div id="00:27:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you&#039;d like to ask Jamie? Not at all. It could be anything. Anything you want.</div><div id="00:27:38.200" class="transcript_line"> No? That&#039;s fair enough. Maybe then if you&#039;d like to do this again at some point maybe we can</div><div id="00:27:44.840" class="transcript_line"> jot down some ideas or get some photos together that we can discuss. Yeah. Only if you&#039;re</div><div id="00:27:50.280" class="transcript_line"> comfortable with it though mate. Yeah. Yeah that might be a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. All right well</div><div id="00:27:56.760" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re reaching the half hour mark so I think we&#039;ll call it a day there yeah. Yeah. And we&#039;ll</div><div id="00:28:02.120" class="transcript_line"> maybe do this again but thank you very much for coming. Bye. And yeah okay bye-bye everyone.</div><div id="00:28:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Have you enjoyed it? Yeah. Yeah you&#039;ve enjoyed it? Yeah. A little bit different isn&#039;t it? Yeah.</div><div id="00:28:15.880" class="transcript_line"> All right then. Very interesting chapter support Anthony so it&#039;s good to hear your story as it is.</div></div></p>
