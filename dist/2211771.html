    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So thank you again for coming back in for a second time.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, just really grateful to have you here.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So my first question is, can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my experience coming to Wales, it&#039;s really nice to place this one.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales, especially where I live right now and the town where I live right now.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more of a family-oriented, community-oriented place.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You have easy access to the beautiful beaches here.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You have easy access to... I mean, where I am is in town.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I could easily access everywhere I want to go.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And that is more important to me because I&#039;m a single mom.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t drive. So that is really essential to me as well.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> To roam around without being restricted or being deprived of where you want to go, bringing your child to different places to explore and to learn heritage and culture here as well.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So is that different from other places you&#039;ve lived in terms of being able to walk around?</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Where I lived before in Dubai, you have also freedom there.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Dubai is not like the other country that they said you are deprived to do something.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> No, Dubai is an open country also. So you are able to do the worst.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s different when Dubai is a more desert place.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But this one, I now understand the balance of me living in a desert place and then coming down here in Wales where you got...</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The beautiful thing about this, I always joke with my friends, the beautiful thing here, you got the four seasons in one day.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You got the sunny day, you got the rainy day, you got the windy day, you got the autumn, except the winter.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But you got the autumn, the sunny and the spring in just one day here in Wales.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You got the sunny, you got the rain, you got the wind.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can&#039;t ask for more for that.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And you want to go to the beaches. So it&#039;s nice, it&#039;s accessible.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You want to go by bus.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> For me, it&#039;s very important to me that I&#039;m able to explore different places in my own comfortable time, in my own way.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That I don&#039;t have to rely on me driving, looking for parking.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very, very essential for me as a mother to bring my child accessible to these different places.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> That she able to learn also to maneuver in the country.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up and she was able to maneuver on her own, use the public transportation and learning about the places here.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one thing for me, it&#039;s really important.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> My experience to Wales when it comes to culture.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales people are very, I say, talkative.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re very friendly, not talkative in a bad way, but talkative.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> When you try to communicate, they will inform you in a way they can.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re very accommodating.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the difference.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> My experience and also my experience in some Midlands places, they see you as your color.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But here, I feel more safer here.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel more freedom here.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the really important thing that I can express myself here.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t feel like, how do you say it, I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m reserved.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m being a love note here.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to say what I like to say.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to express what I like to do.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to showcase my talent here.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to showcase my painting here.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And they are embracing.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Simple painting, they accept it, put it.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only place that I&#039;ve done what you call this one.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve experienced that kind of, you know, it puts you like you are included, you know, not an outcast.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the right term.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You feel included in the community, not an outcast.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so nice to hear.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m really glad that&#039;s your experience.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really, really kind of magical to hear actually.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned painting.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell us more about that?</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I do some painting and I showcase it to different painting gallery that they do exhibit there.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of my painting got sold, but this time I said I don&#039;t want it to be sold.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want it to be in auction.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What I wanted right now is that I wanted people to see this one, to see it, more people to see it.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one person who could have it.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m glad somebody liked my painting, but this time I wanted more to be reaching people, you know, to see the different culture or background with my painting.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;ve learned that this is what they can picture what is in my painting.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, for example, if I paint the beautiful scenery of a rice field, the beautiful scenery of a sunset on the rice field, so they would they would picture that this person because it&#039;s because I know selling a painting is nice.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was thinking it&#039;s a part of me.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an extension of me.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Those paintings that I have is an extension of me.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I wanted to be displayed only.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of people could see it, not just one person in their house could see it.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I understand that I appreciate that they like their painting.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I want it now.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> This time I&#039;ve learned I don&#039;t I don&#039;t want selling it.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want the value of the money anymore.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I want it more reaching people, you know, because one time I was in the background.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the I was in the gallery.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And there are people there that was standing in my painting and I was there.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t know who was the painter of that.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was just on the back.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said most of my paintings said angels.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s anonymous.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said, oh, this painting is so vibrant.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The color is rich, they said.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And this like the person who paint this one has a lot of has a lot of color.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You can feel, they said, you can feel the vibe of this person with this greenery color and then this silhouette sunset on the painting.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said you can feel the person, you know, you can understand the person feeling with this one.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was on the back listening to this one and they said it&#039;s refreshing.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> At the same time, it makes you think deeper on that painting.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, and then I said, so it it it give them something like, you know, something to think, you know, I remember the girl said when that when that painting was being showcased.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I said, I think it was I forgot the date, but I&#039;m pretty sure that on that time that painting when that painting was was being shown, I said to I said to myself.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I said to myself, now I don&#039;t want to sell it because see they they they how is it like I see the painting they they take the part of the paint.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> How you say I don&#039;t know how to explain that, but it&#039;s like they the person looking on on your painting, they captivated by your feeling.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So it not this only the painting, but they feel you.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s that&#039;s one thing that I&#039;ve never thought that they could feel through my painting.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They could feel the first the one who painted it.</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was she was she was right when she said this person was having these two paintings together, the green scenery and the lush of this painting.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the sunset. It&#039;s she she have this this positive thing of the better future.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And yet you have this she have this painting of you know of of of what&#039;s called this one of her of her mind, you know.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said I said how on earth they they could they could they could think on that way.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in though in some of the painting that they could analyze, that&#039;s the right word to my painting, they could analyze the feeling of the of the painter or how she was trying or what she was feeling when she&#039;s painting it.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because that that was to I paint because me when I feel sad, my granddad, me and my granddad, and if I for example, come on, if I got scold by my mom or if my mom doing something or my dad doing something and and they want to, you know, and then my dad said, come on, come on, don&#039;t mess with your dad.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s do painting or don&#039;t get upset. Let&#039;s do painting now.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what&#039;s exactly what&#039;s what they make me the reason why I start painting is that when I feel upset or when I want to boost my my mood, I go in painting, then I feel relaxed, then I feel better, then I then I then my mood change, then I can express myself on the painting, then I&#039;m not things that I&#039;m not able to say I&#039;m able to speak, I&#039;m able to do it.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to do it on my painting. It&#039;s like it&#039;s an extension of my thought. My painting is extension of my thought. That&#039;s exactly how how how how I how I do painting. That&#039;s why this time I don&#039;t I tell to them to I don&#039;t want to sell it.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I just I want people to see that and reach that and see interpret how they want to interpret it. And if they see good in it, and then I want them to see the good in it and apply it to them.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, yeah. Beautiful. Thank you.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so curious to see one of your paintings.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I can see one.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the one that was been displayed.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the one that been sold.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the one that was been sold.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> That one. But I show it to you where it was been. I think I take picture of it.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to do abstract as well.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Abstract is when I wanted my daughter to, to, to paint.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted to learn the abstract way.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This one.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the first time they said that invited me to to paint for it.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I to to display for it.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, Oh, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the you know, it will be like good to sell or like that.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said to me, Oh, good to I don&#039;t know somebody would like like to see it.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. Just put it in.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve never thought it would be like sold.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was even I was even shocked that it was been sold.</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Got lots of picture, but I could find it.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of it, the two that was in the exhibit.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I screen shot it.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember I screen shot it.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of the paintings also that I did is I give it.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I make it as a gift.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m wondering with the.</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You just told me about painting and why you like painting, what painting gives you.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is some of my favorite things.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> This one.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> This one&#039;s dying.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And this one.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s another one.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But this is what the one back home.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Before I left, I did some painting there.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one that I paint here when I when I stay in Wales.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> This one.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that&#039;s the one when I stood.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That was exactly where it was placed.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was behind them and I was listening to their conversation when they&#039;re looking at this one.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You said you see the rich color of this, you know, and then next to it, you see the the the person who was</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> feeling of this one having this silhouette picture, the silhouette painting.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was the one when she said to me, when you are free, can you send me a text to go with the picture?</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so because when I said, but I wanted it, I wanted it on the back of the painting, I said.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t want it to be in in the in the painting in front of the painting, but I want it to be in the back.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s my logo there.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an angel.</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is then the angel ring.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that&#039;s that was the one that I was standing and then, oh, she they how on earth they would analyze the the because you can see two different.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The rich vibrant color of the green, you know, and then this one.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But I when I explain this to them, this is the rice field of my granddad.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the rice field where I grew up and this is this tiny house is the rice field on that.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So people were after their work, after their work, after they&#039;re doing all the rice field working, they stay on that one.</div><div id="00:15:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They drink, they dance, they play guitar.</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They watch that sun, you know, they watch the silhouette there because that were exactly where the where you can see the sun.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Where you can see the sun goes down.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That exactly the place where that house that NEPA house is located.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And that exactly when I when I when I paint this one, I picture of my granddad.</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I picture the time that I&#039;ve spent with my granddad and the place that he he he gave to us.</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, this this is the land that he gave to my parents, you know, to my from my ancestral.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So when this one when I stood here said what they when they asked me what was the what was the concept of the painting?</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to give me what was said.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we want you to showcase a place where you where you are where you are like your happy place or like your memorable place.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then that&#039;s what I that&#039;s this is the painting that I did on that time that I said this is where my childhood mostly and my my whenever whenever not my whole childhood.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But whenever I go to the province with my granddad, this is where the happiest place that I am stayed in the province with my granddad.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s that&#039;s that&#039;s exactly the one said.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So this this silhouette, people stay staying there.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> People might those farmers staying there just to drink and sip their coffee or their their their native the you know,

with with feeling even the whole day work.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But seeing this kind of scenery after work and having just a simple food and they go home relaxed, they&#039;re not tired, able to to to feel comfortable.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I could able to bring happiness in their home, you know, that exactly how I feel because they go home.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They get a little bit down.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They laughing.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They are the wife sitting next to the husband.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandma was sitting next to my granddad, just watching and talking, you know, playing the guitar and all that stuff.</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s really, really one of the plays that if I think if I look at this, it makes me it makes my heart like filled with air.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s how I could say it.</div><div id="00:18:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like I I was filled with air, you know, whenever I look at this one, I feel happy.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel fond about it.</div><div id="00:18:58.000"

you describe a place or a time in your life that&#039;s important to you?</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> This this feels like.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s yes.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s one of the important.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one of the important.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it&#039;s it&#039;s very ironic because they said, what is the most one of the most important place to you?</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I always say it&#039;s home, you know, home, because I always think that I&#039;ve never come from a broken family.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I grew up with a family, though I came from an arranged marriage.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But before that happened, I grew up in a in a house that that I have a mom, I have a dad.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I grew I wake up in the morning.</div><div id="00:19:49.000"

you now?</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it still that memory of being being younger or when you think of home, do you think of where you live now?</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Or to be honest with you, I still think of back home as my home.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But at the moment, we are we are living here.</div><div

now it&#039;s like you&#039;re building your new home again.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, Wales for me is also I could consider it as a comfortable home for me as well.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that is also Wales for me.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel I feel I told you I feel I don&#039;t feel outcasted here.</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel like I&#039;m I&#039;m included.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel like I&#039;m important, especially when when they say, oh, Angel, we are going to have an exhibit and one of your painting was being chosen to put in there.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like they don&#039;t need to do that one.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t. But, you know, to feel included in something, it&#039;s like it&#039;s it&#039;s make your heart fond, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it makes it makes you give good mood.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s that&#039;s because I did painting, but I put my painting on the in to give it to a friend or give it to.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t really keep some of my paintings.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I came to Wales, I didn&#039;t know Wales or England, the whole England, love art.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that one. The whole especially Wales, they have an art museum here.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that one, that I have I that one of my painting was being chosen and that one of some of my painting was being sold.</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I never thought of it, you know, that, oh, I could I could I could be I could my painting could be included.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I thought it&#039;s just for the big, you know, big people who have likes.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Though I don&#039;t use I don&#039;t use all painting.</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I use acrylic. You know, some some some people they said all painting is more valuable, you know, but me using acrylic painting and then people able to appreciate it.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I do the texture painting and people said that when they feel it, they feel the hand of the painter.</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s that&#039;s that&#039;s what makes me my heart, you know, fun like, oh, my Lord, how on earth they could do my painting, they could express the the the the and they could explain or they how I feel or what they see through my painting.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So they could like it&#039;s like the soul, you know, it&#039;s like it&#039;s like it&#039;s if all my painting is this the they looking to my soul, they look at their inner inner inner part of you.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I feel about it, because it&#039;s not only one time to time that I stand behind my painting and some people were standing on it.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, it&#039;s somebody would like, is this for sale? Is this for sale? So no, it wasn&#039;t included in the sale.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And then one of my painting was it was in the big wall, but my painting, they put it on the middle because the story stands the story of that that painting stand.</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was I was really shocked that they picked that one. And I said, I feel privileged and I feel honored that all the big painting, it was my painting that was being put in the middle because the story of it was captivating.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And so I&#039;m one of that one was sold in auction and that was been taken. That&#039;s why this time I want it. No, I&#039;m not going to sell it. I just let people enjoy to look at it.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It&#039;s amazing. I&#039;m wondering if you remember from last time that with this interview, there&#039;ll be one long recording.</div><div id="00:24:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So someone edit me out now, for example, so someone can just hear your long story, you know, your long version.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But then I&#039;ll also take some small bits out to make something called a digital story. Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Which if you come on the 19th, we&#039;ll be showing some of those. And that&#039;s a type of storytelling where you have some images and then you have the person&#039;s voice on video.</div><div id="00:25:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it would be wonderful if we could have a picture of some of your paintings. Sure, sure. Definitely.</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> To have as the image and then you talking about the audio would be you talking about what painting means to you. Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:25:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And how important it is to be included because your message is that everyday people need to be included in the arts too. Yeah, exactly.</div><div id="00:25:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, making space and how rewarding it can be. Yeah, it is. It is. It is. To get your identity back. Yeah, it is. It is.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, that&#039;s what I said that I feel like I&#039;m starting to be whole again through my painting and through it, I could express myself and people who look at it see through to that.</div><div id="00:26:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And they could like, I don&#039;t understand how I explain it, but the way they see it and the way I stand on the back of them and the way they talk of it, like they can see that the they can see through your soul.</div><div id="00:26:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Like they can just feel you from your painting. And that&#039;s magical for me that how a painting could boost one feeling or could boost one thought and could go into the deeper thought of somebody.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Because if you just look, it&#039;s just a painting, you know, it&#039;s just a painting. But some people have a deeper thought when it comes to painting and that other people are those people that talking about the painting, that people don&#039;t appreciate the art, the painting.</div><div id="00:27:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, different, different art. So those people who could explain the art on that and give their personal personal opinion, personal perspective on that painting is like having a window of the personality of the painter.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They can assess, they can picture it on how the painter could feel. And then it like some, because it said this one lighten your mood and this one like gives you in a deeper thought.</div><div id="00:27:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Because what exactly the lady said, this painting of a silhouette gives you in the deeper thought of the painter. If you could look on the picture she said to me, as she said to her friend that it&#039;s like she is, you know, the person who paint this one is very rich and deep thought.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> With her color, color combination, the color combination that she used is also different with the rice field. The combination of the color is totally different. I said, oh, maybe these people are really, they are used of looking on the painting.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because very, very rare you see the comment, you see comment like that on the painting of anyone could comment on the painting. But that to a specific person, I wanted to, I wanted to come to them, you know, I wanted to approach them.</div><div id="00:28:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I just, I just said I have to, you know, hold myself because they would know I wanted to be, I wanted to be anonymous with all the painting I wanted to run on. That&#039;s why I never put my real name on it. I just put Angel on it.</div><div id="00:29:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So that&#039;s, that&#039;s really, that&#039;s really one thing that I wanted that you can, it&#039;s either you can, you can see different meaning. There&#039;s always different meaning in painting. It&#039;s not just that paint and like that. It&#039;s just that picture, no.</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Even some photographs, because I love photography. I do, I did study photography for six months, but I only finished three months because when my ex-partner died. But I said in photography also, I like the subject like silhouette, like landscape.</div><div id="00:29:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Same, see when I do my painting, I like it to be silhouette and, and I like it to be silhouette and landscape and rice field or anything that landscape.</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And so my photography exit, it&#039;s the extension of my, of my, of my painting. Like I also wanted to capture from my lenses the scenery of the, the scenery of silhouette. And I have one here, but that picture I kept it because it captivate me also. I think it&#039;s still here.</div><div id="00:30:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s in one of my, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s here.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> This one is one of that.</div><div id="00:30:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s, that&#039;s one of that. And</div><div id="00:30:53.000" class="transcript_line"> That one.</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s lovely. That&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And where is that?</div><div id="00:30:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That was in the island of Malapasca. They all, this is all the, yeah, in the Philippines. That&#039;s when I took photo of this one. I have also few, but I think it&#039;s on my, on my memory stick. Yeah. But this one, I&#039;ve, this one is memorable to me because those people that was the streaming, that one is</div><div id="00:31:22.000" class="transcript_line"> is my children. You know, they are my family, my daughter. This is my daughter that&#039;s there. And then my son was over there. So when I take this one, so nobody knows who were that. But you see the boat, you see, but</div><div id="00:31:41.000" class="transcript_line"> one thing you&#039;re gonna think of, who was the person in that, you know, like who were those person and you see the catching people in the, in the, in the sun, what you call the sunset and the race to the, the race goes to the water and then wandering.</div><div id="00:32:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Those people were in this picture had, had real people, you know, that&#039;s the one thing that from the photography. You&#039;re catching real people. Your story is real. You know, that day is real. You can&#039;t lie about photography that when you captured it, you know, that that day it was real. That day it was happened.</div><div id="00:32:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what exactly what I&#039;m, I&#039;m trying that I catch this when, when this person, when the person is that is my family. So I also, I also paint one of this one, but I put it on my, my, my mom&#039;s house, but it was banished by the, it was banished by the Yolanda.</div><div id="00:32:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, when the typhoon reached Yolanda. Yeah. So that&#039;s why I, I reposted on my, on my, my Facebook, like profile picture, because I&#039;ve lost that painting. So I said, it&#039;s, it&#039;s okay, because I still have the picture of it. I might lost the painting. I might lost the picture, but I have the original picture of it. That&#039;s why I keep it as my profile picture.</div><div id="00:33:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So you told me a bit about how painting makes you feel when you&#039;re doing photography. How does that make you feel?</div><div id="00:33:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the same, actually. It&#039;s the same. It&#039;s just that when, when, when you do it, when you capture it from the lens, you are caught on that time. When you are on the painting, you are, you have your minds and live up.</div><div id="00:33:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I want to call this one. Your space is wild. You don&#039;t have, when, when you catch in the photography, you&#039;re just focusing on that specific with your lens. But in the painting, you are, your space is unlimited. It&#039;s, it&#039;s like the universe, you know, that you can put everything on your painting.</div><div id="00:34:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Unlimited. There&#039;s, there&#039;s no, there&#039;s no nothing, you know, you can continue putting it, you know, in painting. Once you capture it, that&#039;s it. That&#039;s it. You cannot edit it. You cannot put it. I know you can photoshop it, but what I mean is to see the real picture, to showcase the real picture.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it. You capture that moment. But in painting, you have very wide imagination. Your imagination is unlimited. It&#039;s the, you can just paint and they call it, your brain is an ocean. You know, so you have an oceans of idea inside your brain that coming out through your painting.</div><div id="00:35:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they said it&#039;s very, it&#039;s almost, this, I know the word, it takes someone to know, it takes someone to know someone, or it takes someone to know one, or it takes someone to know, it takes one to know someone, or it takes one to know one.</div><div id="00:35:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:35:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, those were catching phrases. So people who see on the painting, and they able to, to, to explain or to get into the, the, the, the, the statement of the painting, to capture it as the statement of the painter.</div><div id="00:35:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It, it gives you, so somebody could understand my thought that you are not alone or you are, you are not, it&#039;s not you or they may call it, it&#039;s not, that&#039;s only you, you know. You somebody there understand your thought.</div><div id="00:36:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody there could understand you. That&#039;s exactly what I, what I think of it. You know, it&#039;s even in photography. Somebody there could appreciate your photography. Somebody there could, could, could, could see the value of your photography.</div><div id="00:36:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But in painting, no, it&#039;s, it&#039;s unlimited. It&#039;s an ocean of, it&#039;s an ocean of thought. It&#039;s an, it&#039;s a, it&#039;s a, unlimited, unlimited ideas that you can put into that and you can get out of your brain and, and write it, do it in reality.</div><div id="00:36:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I said painting is the extension of your brain, of your inner personality, of your inner thought. That you&#039;re putting it to, to, to somebody get the part of your inner thought. Like that&#039;s how deep painting for me. Yeah. It&#039;s the, the, the, you let them feel or you let them in to your inner thought.</div><div id="00:37:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s wonderful. It&#039;s wonderful to talk about, about art and also hear how, you know, how important it is to you and how it makes you feel. I&#039;m just wary of the time and your pick up time. But maybe to wrap up, you could tell me what your hopes are for the future.</div><div id="00:37:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my future hope is that, you know, I&#039;m able to, to manifest a good, a good, a greener pasture. I&#039;m able to provide a good future for my children. I know my children are big, but I still have to, so I want them to be, I just, I just like that I will be healthy to, to see them going up until, until the time that, you know, they could have their own family to guide them.</div><div id="00:38:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, now that&#039;s my thought. And then when it&#039;s, when it&#039;s for my career, I want it to just take it slowly. Whatever is available for me to do, I would do it. And I would start, I wanted to strive higher and higher and higher. And also with my painting, I would continue doing it.</div><div id="00:38:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I would continue doing it. I would continue, you know, things that I would, things that would make me feel alive, happy and positive and, you know, like, how you say, boost your personality and boost your, boost your, your confidence.</div><div id="00:38:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that I wanted to see, you know, that, that you can still do it, you know, you can, you still have it, you know, nothing can stop you reaching your goal and making your dream come true.</div><div id="00:39:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s, I really looking for the future that I will be stable with my job. I would be, I would be able to be stable, have a good connection with my children, my two, my two young children. So that&#039;s exactly I&#039;m, I&#039;m looking forward for my health as well.</div><div id="00:39:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That I&#039;ll just be healthy, that able to, to be, to be, you know, just for, for everybody, you know, at least I&#039;m healthy for my whole, for my whole family. I&#039;m able to continue helping them, you know, guiding them.</div><div id="00:39:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s, I really, that&#039;s the things that really matter to me is my family, you know, because I think, I think I would be nothing without my family and I would be nothing without, without them, without me being, being present to their life.</div><div id="00:40:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the essence of being a mother as well, you know, presence to their children&#039;s life.
