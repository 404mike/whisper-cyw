    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In January 1919 and for all of 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George had a considerable</div><div id="00:00:06.960" class="transcript_line"> amount of information going across his desk. Information not seen by the general public.</div><div id="00:00:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Generally I suspect known by the press, but the British Empire was one of his many concerns.</div><div id="00:00:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And this is just a brief summary of some of the major things that were happening and he would</div><div id="00:00:26.880" class="transcript_line"> have become aware of. In January 21st 1919, the Sinn Fein members who&#039;d been elected in the 1918</div><div id="00:00:37.040" class="transcript_line"> general election and who had said they would not take up their seats in the House of Commons in</div><div id="00:00:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Parliament chose to declare an independent Irish Republic. And so for the first time,</div><div id="00:00:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Dale Aaron met in Mansion House Dublin. At the same day the Anglo-Irish War started,</div><div id="00:00:57.200" class="transcript_line"> two Royal Irish constabulary men were killed in an ambush at Solo Head Beg in Tipperary.</div><div id="00:01:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Later that same year, Eamon de Valera, the leader of Escape from Lincoln Prison,</div><div id="00:01:11.600" class="transcript_line"> in South Africa, 70,000 mainly black African miners went on strike at the Witch What&#039;s Around.</div><div id="00:01:19.440" class="transcript_line"> Their strike was disciplined and organised and the government threw police cordons around their</div><div id="00:01:24.640" class="transcript_line"> compounds. The troops broke through the workers barricades with bayonets fixed, killing three and</div><div id="00:01:31.440" class="transcript_line"> wounding 40. Later police and armed white civilians attacked a meeting of solidarity with a strike in</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> miners killing 80 and wounding 80. Meanwhile in Cape Town, the first South African Indian</div><div id="00:01:46.960" class="transcript_line"> conference was convened and the Indians there resolved to agitate for full civil rights and</div><div id="00:01:54.320" class="transcript_line"> to resort to civil resistance until those rights were granted. Meanwhile on the 13th of April 1919</div><div id="00:02:03.520" class="transcript_line"> in Punjab, the Jallanwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, occurred.</div><div id="00:02:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Civilians, unarmed civilians I should say, had assembled for a peaceful protest to condemn the</div><div id="00:02:18.560" class="transcript_line"> arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satyapal and Safuddin Kichlu, and also to honour</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> the Sikh festival of Basarqi. Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, with his battalion of</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Indian Army and Gurkha troops, fired rifles into the crowd of unarmed Indian civilians.</div><div id="00:02:38.880" class="transcript_line"> They were to kill between 300 and a thousand and a thousand were wounded, 14 of which were children.</div><div id="00:02:46.640" class="transcript_line"> But this is the power of the press because when Dyer returned to England, the press demanded a</div><div id="00:02:52.240" class="transcript_line"> public collection for, as Rudyard Kipling described him, the hero of India and he received 26,000</div><div id="00:03:00.320" class="transcript_line"> pounds, nearly a million pounds in modern terms. China was the largest non-European</div><div id="00:03:08.240" class="transcript_line"> participant in World War I. It fought with the Allies and most people don&#039;t know that because</div><div id="00:03:17.600" class="transcript_line"> so much of 1919 is secret history. China joined the war because Germany at the siege of Singtao</div><div id="00:03:26.480" class="transcript_line"> in 1914 had captured Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius. China was not allowed to become</div><div id="00:03:35.520" class="transcript_line"> a combatant because Japan objected. So instead they sent thousands of volunteers who repaired</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> tanks, dug trenches, carried munitions at the front line. But when China turned up at the Versailles</div><div id="00:03:54.720" class="transcript_line"> treaty signing, they were told Shandong was being given to Japan. The delegation returned</div><div id="00:04:02.640" class="transcript_line"> to Beijing and the first student protests occurred on the 4th of May 1919. That May the 4th movement,</div><div id="00:04:14.720" class="transcript_line"> an anti-imperialist cultural and political movement, was the beginning, it has been argued,</div><div id="00:04:22.800" class="transcript_line"> of communism as a cultural shift in China. Meanwhile across the Caribbean,</div><div id="00:04:32.240" class="transcript_line"> the war had resulted in longer working hours, no increase in wages, higher prices of goods and poverty.</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> The returning soldiers and merchant seamen, many of which had been forcefully repatriated</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> after serving in World War I, were angry and disillusioned. This was a critical time in the</div><div id="00:04:56.480" class="transcript_line"> rising demand for independence and the creation of the first trade unions and the first political</div><div id="00:05:03.440" class="transcript_line"> parties. In Canada, June the 21st 1919, Royal Northwest Mounted Police fired a volley of bullets</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> into a crowd of unemployed war veterans, killing two in what was known as the Bloody Saturday</div><div id="00:05:18.800" class="transcript_line"> of the Winnipeg General Strike. David Lord George saw a continuing picture of a collapsing empire.</div><div id="00:05:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Egypt Civil War by 1922. Egypt was a freed country. Afghanistan Civil War.</div><div id="00:05:36.160" class="transcript_line"> Ceylon. Australia where returning soldiers attacked people they saw as communists.</div><div id="00:05:46.160" class="transcript_line"> And there was much more. And across the empire there was revolt and demonstrations.</div><div id="00:05:52.880" class="transcript_line"> And across the empire, new legislations and increasing level of extreme violence</div><div id="00:05:59.520" class="transcript_line"> by the state or with the agreement of Downing Street. So what David Lloyd George saw</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> was a collapse of the British Empire and the fact that those in the empire were not going to return</div><div id="00:06:18.080" class="transcript_line"> to the previous world where London decided everything and money decided everything.</div><div id="00:06:26.640" class="transcript_line"> And his fear was a shift towards socialism but even bigger a shift towards Bolshevism.</div></div></p>
