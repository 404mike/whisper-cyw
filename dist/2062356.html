    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I had discussions with one of the local historians of Resolving some time ago with a view of</div><div id="00:00:08.640" class="transcript_line"> one of miners memorial at Resolving. Four miners killed in local pits. When I say local</div><div id="00:00:18.520" class="transcript_line"> pits I meant specifically for pits surrounding the Resolving area and nowhere else. And all</div><div id="00:00:26.160" class="transcript_line"> the names on the memorial are from the basically from the Resolving area and some are from</div><div id="00:00:32.200" class="transcript_line"> outside the area but nevertheless they&#039;ve been killed in local pits. There was a need to get</div><div id="00:00:39.800" class="transcript_line"> some detail from the local historian whose name was Mr Billy Downing and he researched the names,</div><div id="00:00:48.120" class="transcript_line"> the dates when they were killed and where they were killed. On top of that and he researched</div><div id="00:00:56.120" class="transcript_line"> the production in the various pits that took place at the time. I then as a member of the</div><div id="00:01:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Neathborough Council at the time raised the money in conjunction with the Ryan mining. They</div><div id="00:01:11.280" class="transcript_line"> financed the program and I can say that the memorial itself when I spoke to Dr Howard</div><div id="00:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Francis who is the current member of Parliament for Port Talbot. When I spoke to him some time</div><div id="00:01:26.960" class="transcript_line"> ago he told me that it is the only one of its kind throughout the British coalfield. It&#039;s the</div><div id="00:01:35.800" class="transcript_line"> only one of its kind because there are many mining memorials throughout the British coalfield</div><div id="00:01:42.560" class="transcript_line"> but for mining disasters not very specific but this one was for specifically for miners who were</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> killed in local pits and each name is on there and the dates they were killed. And it was from</div><div id="00:01:59.520" class="transcript_line"> Resolving point of view we&#039;re justly proud because it&#039;s the only one of its kind throughout the</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> kingdom.</div></div></p>
