    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll ask the questions.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So can you please just tell us your name and where and when you were born?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jabeen. I&#039;m born in Kampala, Uganda. That&#039;s in East Africa.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I came here in 1972 as a refugee.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you okay to say that in Swahili?</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Swahili I can&#039;t remember all of it. I&#039;ll speak in our own language.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jabeen. I&#039;m born in Uganda, East Africa.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been a refugee for 50 years.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> When did you say you were born as well?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born on the 15th of September 1958.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> First section we&#039;re just going to talk about growing up outside of the UK.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember about the area that you grew up in?</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was in Uganda, we came here in 1972. I used to be about 8 years old.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to school there. The schooling was different from here because we were more in primary schools.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So when we came here they put us in secondary school so that was a very big step.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Mostly we just went to school there and we had to pay fees.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to celebrate independence there, all the events because all the different people,</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Muslims, Hindus, Christians, we all used to go to the same school.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So if it&#039;s Christmas we go to the church and then when it&#039;s Diwali we go to the Hindu temple.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But Muslims we used to go to the mosque and then we had all African children as well with us.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So all nationalities were together and we all grew up together.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> The English was the main language there and then you could speak Swahili.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the Ugandan and there&#039;s a Ugandan language as well.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> There were many different languages but the main was English.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I came here it was a bit easier for us.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you learnt how to speak English.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, English was probably there.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was it like growing up in the house?</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We were like a big family living in a small house and we had grandparents and all that.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to go and visit them.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we used to, like weekends we used to go to the lake side, have a picnic.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was nice to go to the neighbour&#039;s house, mingle with them, with their festival and all that.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was completely different when we came here.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to the markets, local markets.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you kind of love the most or enjoy the most about Krona?</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up there the weather was nice.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> We very hardly had the rain.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> In East Africa the weather was always nice.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of greenery.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go for long walks in the riverside.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was so safe, you know.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t hear anything.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> In the end somebody kidnapped you or abused you or nothing like that.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was safe.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You could walk miles and miles in the jungle and nobody bothered you.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The people were very friendly.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you think about your childhood?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have much childhood because we went that well off.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We were just taking easy days to come.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was just a simple life, but no stress.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We just wake up in the morning, go to school half day, come home, eat and just play outside.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> No computers, no television, nothing like that.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Just people mingling together.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> What type of games did you play?</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to play hip hop.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to have chalk and just play on the ground.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And just climb trees picking mangoes.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And just had a few toys, not much toys like we do here.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Just had a few old fashioned toys.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our grandparents get them for us.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum used to cook. We didn&#039;t have cookers or anything.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to just help around.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> If you do the house chores, my mum used to give us money to buy sweets.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So everything we had to earn.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And hip hop, was that with the squares?</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, squares.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you would throw?</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, throw.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then skipping rope we used to use and skip.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That was just our way of, you know, because the weather was always dry.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just looked forward to that.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> All the children get together from the neighbourhoods.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just played that.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So then travelling, I was just making sure hip hop because it was the same.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing up in Zimbabwe, so I was exactly the same.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was trying to remember whether we did throw the stone and then we would go.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And have hope.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So travelling to the UK, what made you decide to come to the UK?</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In 1972, the president of Uganda gave all white people, Jews, Asians, all mixed race people,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> to leave the country within 90 days.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So all we were allowed to do is, if you have a British passport, you can come to Britain.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So in 1947, 1960, the British used to rule everything.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they decided, who wants to become British citizens?</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Or you can have African status.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mum decided to be British, take British passport.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And my dad was Ugandan.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So then he had a problem coming.</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So anybody with a British passport, you have to leave.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They came and started breaking the house and kidnapping people.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very rough, like a ritual regime.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we were all six brothers and sisters.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So all of us came with my mum.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to catch a flight from there.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have ticket money or anything.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So then we had to go to the church, temples, Guru Dwaray, and get money for the tickets to come here.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> All we were allowed was 20 shillings, that&#039;s about two pounds.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And one suitcase each.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were little, so we didn&#039;t know what was happening.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to the airport and waited for the flight and they brought us to Heathrow.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we were little, we didn&#039;t understand much.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember what used to happen there, you know.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It was getting really bad.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from the airport, they brought us to Heathrow.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So in Heathrow, we had the National Front and them.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They said they were not coming here, there were 90,000 Asians.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Because all the Jews went to Israel and all different nationalities.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had a choice.</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> If you are not educated, a professional doctor or anybody, you can go to Canada or America.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But if you have more children and you are not educated or anything,</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> they send you to Mexico, Peru, or Britain had to take us.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my mum had a passport and we were all underage.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When we came here, it was difficult.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But they moved us, they put us in a camp.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The camp is where the army stays, not like camps.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Big camp.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They took us to London, Kensington, stayed there a few days.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They showed us all the London.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a nice VIP treatment.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But then they didn&#039;t want anybody there because there were too many Asians already there.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> All foreign people.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So they moved us to Kensington in Warwick.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And there we stayed like a month.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they moved us to North Wales, Stowin.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a big seaside with all the camps, army camps, big warehouses.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So we stayed there about three months.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they said, right, we have to move you around.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So they sent us to Wales, Pontypridd.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of Asians didn&#039;t want to come to Wales.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to go to big cities like Nottingham, Leicester, London.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But the council said, no, no more Asians here because there&#039;s too many already.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s all different nationalities.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t like the way the first people.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So to rehouse 80,000 people, 100,000 people was a big job.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So they gave us a council house.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They made sure they sent us to school.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave us all the food, furniture, everything in the house.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> New, brand new council house.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So they looked after us, you know.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But then when we were in the camp, everybody was together.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So when we went, it was a bit lonely.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when we went to the school, we went to Pontypridd.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the only Asians there.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Me, my sister, and my cousin.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So because the two families, they sent there.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> My uncle and his wife and his kids.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad wasn&#039;t here.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in Italy because he was a state place.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Red Cross took them to Italy, Naples.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So he stayed there.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after a while, he came and joined us.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So then we grew up, they went to school there.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, the education was a bit hard.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we come from primary school going to high school.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So we only lived there for two, three years.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they said, what do you want to do?</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to be a nurse, but I didn&#039;t have any qualifications.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I just got a job in a supermarket.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And my sister and everybody.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And we lived there for five years.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we couldn&#039;t get any Asian food or anything.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, halal meat or anything.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we moved.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go from Pontypridd to Cardiff to do shopping.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to go to the cinemas there.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were just teenagers.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my dad said, it&#039;s not good staying here now.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you know, like growing up, there&#039;s no mosque.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Or there&#039;s no place where you can go meet somebody from your country.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So then they moved us.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad and mom moved to Cambridge, you know, Peterborough.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went there as well.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But then after when I got married, I came to Newport.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed in Newport.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been in Newport for the last 35 years.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the hospital and moved around, you know.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So at the moment I&#039;m a carer.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to leave my job in the NHS because I had medical problems.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And when my disabled daughter was born, I had to leave everything.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m a carer for now.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And we formed this Age of Life.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So when, like, there&#039;s workshops and everything in Newport.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a girl called Lorraine.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s from Caribbean.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> When she went to uni, so she was doing a project on minorities,</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> black and Asian minorities.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So she had a little workshop.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I started talking to her.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, what are you doing?</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, I want some Asian and half Caribbean and all that.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can, what would you really like?</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, it would be nice to have a swimming classes for women.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of Asian women won&#039;t go to normal classes.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So she said, oh, do you know anybody?</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I asked my sister and five of us joined it.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So now it&#039;s 30.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Roy came after, you know, Vanessa and Roy.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the group is now to 30, all different nationalities.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s been going for the last 18 years, I think 15 to 18 years.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go there a lot because of medical problems.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I go now and again, you know.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So we learn a lot, you know.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We get together with all different cultures.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Windrush, that was enjoyable.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Brings memories back from home, you know.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you tell people I&#039;m from Africa, you know,</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> they say you&#039;re not, you know, dark skin or curly hair.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My great-grandparents came from India in 1947.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And when there was a petition there, they had to move.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So my grandfather moved to Kenya and my grandmother to Uganda.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my dad and mom were born there.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They got married there.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They introduced you, like arranged marriages there.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And a long time ago everybody used to marry into their own,</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> not like now with multicultural.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was experience, you know.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Five times I took my younger daughter to see which I was born.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The school I showed her, but you can&#039;t go out in the night.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very scary.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to Kenya.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I got family there.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We crossed the border into Uganda.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nightmare.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very scary in the night, you know.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then in the border you have to, like, they stop you, you know.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> How much money you got?</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and you&#039;re scared, you know.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after we went, they stayed in the hotel.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were there for about five days.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I took her to a ginger that falls.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told them this was my school.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They demolished it.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They got big, in them days they didn&#039;t have big shopping malls or anything.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But now, you know, they built a lot of things.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went there.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But you have to take somebody who&#039;s local or the security guard.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to look at the mall and you can get,</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> we missed the food there, you know, like African food.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Matoke, that&#039;s green bananas.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And over there they make it in leaves, you know.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We had that, we had dry fish and sweet potato, cassava, yam,</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and all those things we&#039;re used to.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But you can get it now in the supermarket.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But that feeling, that atmosphere is not the same, you know.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Over there people didn&#039;t have much, but you see people smiling, you know.</div><div id="00:12:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re all like a big family, you know.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all of our schoolmates, all from Africa, you know.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was sad when we had to come here.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But because we have been through a lot, you know,</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> here everything was new.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of isolation here.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve been there like 10 years, about five, six times,</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m a family there.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to Uganda once.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> After 40 years being here, to see what it was like.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything has changed.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> The school where we went was demolished.</div><div id="00:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the houses, they were breaking, making into big buildings.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a lot of Asians going from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re there now.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve opened shops and all that.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s nice to just go there and wander around and see, you know, the greenery.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The people over there, they all died or passed on.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So everything was new, you know.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When you enter Uganda, the climate is so good.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And the mud there is all like red, you know.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And the greenery is better than Kenya, you know, in Tanzania.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what you miss, you know, the food and all that.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I love to go again, because we went to visit my grandparents&#039; graveyard.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was in Kalolo, you know.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And there, like, it was memories, you know.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So whoever died there couldn&#039;t come here, you know.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They were buried there.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was a nice lifetime experience, you know.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I&#039;m too old to travel, you know.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We need a group.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re doing group tours, you know, if you want to go there.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It costs a lot.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But there are a lot of memories.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So now it&#039;s going to be 50 years, Ugandan Asians came here.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So they have a celebration like Windrush.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So they all get together.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them passed away, you know.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So all the youngsters, they&#039;re showing films, how they came here, how they...</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was, like, young, you know.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So if we meet somebody, they say, so you&#039;re from Uganda.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of...</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of the people are business people.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So when they came here, they opened shops and, you know, all that.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the ones who didn&#039;t have anything, they started from nothing.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, when I went on holiday there, there&#039;s too many memories, you know.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Memories and all the army used to torture people.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re asking people, whoever had...</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They were to leave everything there.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Whoever got houses, businesses, they can go back.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s, you know, like, you know, it&#039;s very hard to start again.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the children&#039;s grown up here.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They won&#039;t be able to live there, just...</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because over there you have to work, you know.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, when you leave your school, you have to get a job.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not like here, you know, gone the door.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re very strict, you know.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was well-spoken English teachers.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So everything was in English, you know, just like here.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So that helped a lot when we moved here.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of people, the whole generation can&#039;t speak English.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s very difficult for them, you know.</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So if they go like...</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I find a lot of people from...</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We got a lot of difference, you know, people in Pakistan, Bangladesh.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re very different from us.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t mix.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They have their groups, you know, on communities.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But the ones who come from Africa, they mix with everybody.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re like a lost tribe.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t have anybody from our country in Newport.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Like you go to London or somewhere, they have fun.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You meet them all there.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you get used to it.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So we don&#039;t belong with the Pakistani community.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t belong to the Bangladeshi community.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So we just like...</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what you call it.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So then when coming to this group, you know, meeting more and more people,</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> we went to Windrush.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was nice, you know.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They have nice people, they have nice hospitality, their food, you know,</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> similar to the one we had.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was really nice, you know.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the whole generation, how...</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> What they&#039;ve been through and what they&#039;ve been through</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> was worse than what we were, you know.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Like we had 90 days to get up quickly before...</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> If you don&#039;t go there...</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> When you were young, they wanted...</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They started about...</div><div id="00:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you call it?</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, over there Asians don&#039;t marry black people,</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> black people don&#039;t marry white people, things like that.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s changed now.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So the president said, if you stay here, you have to get married.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Because African people, they wanted that rich, you know.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not that educated at that time, you know.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were like...</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> All our maidens were coming and working.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So our parents and grandparents said, you can&#039;t marry there</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> because they haven&#039;t got a job, they haven&#039;t got a house, you know.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> How are we going to adjust?</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of people stayed back, you know.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It was difficult, you know.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was nice to come to a new country</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because we didn&#039;t see the hardship here, you know.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have racism or anything.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Only once in school, a boy called me Paki.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t know what it meant.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So my cousin said, that means, you know, they got a name, like...</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Different people got different names.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you think, these people need to be educated.</div><div id="00:17:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They call you Sambu or this and that, you know.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And with them, they can&#039;t see that all people are different, you know.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you&#039;re brown or black, they think, you know, they call you names.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s only one way.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I was little, I said, I&#039;m not tolerating this.</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a botulinity on the head.</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I was going to walking up to school.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, don&#039;t you ever call me that.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So the mom comes, she says, why did you do that?</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, because you call me names.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But that time, you can&#039;t, you know, you could hit and get away with it.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got away with it.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I haven&#039;t had any violence since, you know.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I teach my children to be independent, strong, you know.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Make sure they have education in life, you know.</div><div id="00:18:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I don&#039;t want you to be like...</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t that educated.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So when we left school, got a job, you know, that was it.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to be a nurse, but I found the exams very hard.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t do general exams for nursing.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I got a full-time job caring for my daughter.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s 27, you know, I&#039;m showing her.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;s going to uni now.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, art.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, Mom, I&#039;m so proud of myself.</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, keep it up.</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;s doing art, fine arts.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s really good.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, Mom, people don&#039;t understand.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I put my feelings into it.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I took her to Africa, but the wheelchair access was really bad.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, she stayed in the hotel, you know, because the roads are not...</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But now she won&#039;t go anywhere.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> She just goes to uni and back, you know.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I like to get involved in more things, you know.</div><div id="00:18:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, you&#039;re a good ambassador.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You work for Whiskey.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got good stories to say.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But she just doesn&#039;t want to, you know.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, I&#039;ve done my bit.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I try and mix her up, you know.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So the children, I took them to Africa.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, look, this is where Mom&#039;s born.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;d love to go there, you know.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I got a good, nice company, going to stay a few days.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Have a break, you know, because that&#039;s where history is.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go to Spain, you can have sun tan, you know.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But the main history is in Africa, you know.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So what people go through, what they&#039;ve been through.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a lot of memories, because my sister, she...</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, Yasmin, she came in.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She hasn&#039;t got it. She&#039;s older than me, two years.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But she didn&#039;t think, she didn&#039;t know what happened, really.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was more like, you know, out streetwise.</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Found out everything was happening.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Roy was writing a book.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So he wrote some of the book, I think.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a little bit worried.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But he wrote some of the book, I think.</div><div id="00:19:41.000" class="transcript_line"> About stories.</div><div id="00:19:43.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of projects, people come back from, you know, like refugees.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What stories they&#039;re going to tell.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So sometimes when I&#039;m, you know, well, I come and say it.</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought this opportunity is nice, you know.</div><div id="00:19:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s little, like yourself, you want to ask some questions.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you exactly, you know.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so I hope it&#039;ll be a little bit help, you know.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like we used to walk miles and miles and miles.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re never scared or anything.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But here in this country you get everything.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But you have too much stress.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And you haven&#039;t got the privacy, you know.</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t even go out in the night without being attacked, you know.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But over there people knew each other.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t be scared, you know.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, over there, our friends were African.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go there.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> My mom used to, they boiled food on this wood, you know.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They eat cassava and that.</div><div id="00:20:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We just sat with them and ate, you know.</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But now there&#039;s more prejudice here than there used to be then.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because some people don&#039;t like mixing, you know.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But this group is good so everybody gets together.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Share their story, you know.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I think people who came from Africa, they have a lot to share, you know.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Like some people never got back from the airport.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t allowed to fly out.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Because if it&#039;s a family, they take the husbands and the sons of them.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They kill them.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a lot of women came with no husbands and children, you know.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re lucky we didn&#039;t experience that bit, you know.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re lucky we didn&#039;t experience that bit, you know.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re lucky we didn&#039;t experience that bit, you know.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So when we came in to start again, it&#039;s very difficult, you know.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But we met a lot of nice people, English people, Welsh people.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they took everywhere, showed you Tower of London.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You will have seen it otherwise.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, oh, in England, people come to study and all that.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But these days nobody&#039;s interested, you know.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s good people like yourself are doing all this.</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good project.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And it educates our youngsters, say, look what we&#039;ve been through.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be something in life.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be something in the world.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be something in the world.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be something in the world.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be something in life.</div><div id="00:21:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ll never have a second chance, you know.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I said, Evan.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, again, thank you for sharing because all your stories are so powerful.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you&#039;re sharing and hearing what it was like at that time of the period as well.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And why it&#039;s important to have that connection.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And have the wisdom and the education that comes along.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And you went through actually an answer, answering the questions.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastically in the traditions, in age alive, in moving.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you mixed it in.</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Moving, coming here to Newport and Pontypryd as you said as well.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a village now, it&#039;s a town.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It used to be that small.</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no Asian people there.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, when they see you, they call you names.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The way some of the people in the valleys, I find more racist.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when you see some problems.</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But Turchwood in Newport is multicultural, you know.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can see the people in the valleys, they&#039;re more racist.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can see the people in the valleys, they&#039;re more racist.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when you see some problems.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can see in Newport is multicultural, you know.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So you could talk to somebody from Pakistan or Bangladesh.</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They have different story.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What we&#039;ve been through.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really heartwarming, you know.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so people want to know,</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> oh, this happened.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So now, when I went to Kenya,</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> it was very, very hot, about 50 degrees.</div><div id="00:22:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I found it so hot.</div><div id="00:22:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That I preferred winter here.</div><div id="00:22:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I used to work in the hospital,</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I went there, I came back, I was really, really big.</div><div id="00:22:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very normal.</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, really chocolate brown.</div><div id="00:22:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh my God, do you know Kachirat, Taniswe?</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, we&#039;re only human.</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know,</div><div id="00:23:03.000" class="transcript_line"> a lot of English people, you have to educate them, you know.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They said, oh, you go to Hedge Barrage?</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no.</div><div id="00:23:09.000" class="transcript_line"> When we came, I found my ex-partner in university.</div><div id="00:23:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But what we had a big culture shock.</div><div id="00:23:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But what we had a big culture shock.</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He was Pakistani,</div><div id="00:23:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was from Africa.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So they don&#039;t understand</div><div id="00:23:21.000" class="transcript_line"> cultures.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to stay in.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had a tough life,</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> a tough marriage, you know.</div><div id="00:23:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to get out of it.</div><div id="00:23:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I said, I&#039;m a doormat.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Either I be a doormat or just go and work, study.</div><div id="00:23:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And my ex-husband didn&#039;t want me to go and work.</div><div id="00:23:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Independent, they don&#039;t like</div><div id="00:23:39.000" class="transcript_line"> women to do that.</div><div id="00:23:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But then, slowly, you know,</div><div id="00:23:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I educated my kids. I said, go for it.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Go and do something.</div><div id="00:23:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Try and be to different events.</div><div id="00:23:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But this angel had done a lot for us, you know.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> This was so interesting.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> This year, there are more things going on for a week,</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and the old people&#039;s stories.</div><div id="00:23:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they have been through a lot, you know.</div><div id="00:23:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Ours is not that bad.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Compared to what they went through when they came to this country.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So people have more opportunities now.</div><div id="00:24:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I hope that question did help.</div><div id="00:24:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t hear you.</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll cut this for you.</div></div></p>
