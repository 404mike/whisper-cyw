    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:09.840" class="transcript_line"> The location of the interview is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Today&#039;s date is Monday the 21st of September 2015 and we&#039;re talking to Mark Rosamond.</div><div id="00:00:20.520" class="transcript_line"> Mark would you be kind enough to spell your name for the record?</div><div id="00:00:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Mark with a K Rosamond R O S O M A N.</div><div id="00:00:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Thanks very much. Mark of course I know you as one of the leaders of the fabulous group Omadom.</div><div id="00:00:38.680" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell us about Omadom and particularly its origins? Where did it all begin?</div><div id="00:00:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Omadom actually began with my wife and I, Amanda.</div><div id="00:00:50.680" class="transcript_line"> We were previously members of another dance troupe, the Desert Divas, which have sadly after 10 years have now ended.</div><div id="00:01:02.680" class="transcript_line"> But before they ended we decided that we wanted to run our own troupe.</div><div id="00:01:08.680" class="transcript_line"> So we decided because my wife had been dancing for several years and I was interested in drumming,</div><div id="00:01:18.680" class="transcript_line"> in particular drumming on a North African drum named a darbuka, which is a traditional belly dance drum.</div><div id="00:01:25.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the equivalent of a lead guitar in a modern day band.</div><div id="00:01:30.680" class="transcript_line"> So we got together, first of all we&#039;re just doing it at home, playing about together.</div><div id="00:01:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Then we got the interest of other people that had seen and heard of what we were doing.</div><div id="00:01:41.680" class="transcript_line"> So we decided to start the troupe called Omadom.</div><div id="00:01:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Omadom, there&#039;s quite a little story to the name Omadom.</div><div id="00:01:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh I should add that we are a drumming tribal style belly dance.</div><div id="00:01:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Tribal style is an American form of belly dance.</div><div id="00:02:00.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite modern although it&#039;s using traditional belly dance moves.</div><div id="00:02:07.680" class="transcript_line"> What I do myself on the darbuka is play traditional Egyptian or Arabic style rhythms that belly dancers will well know.</div><div id="00:02:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Sorry Steve, I&#039;ve lost my plot. What was the next bit?</div><div id="00:02:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Well besides the music which is fabulous and powers it all along, there&#039;s a fabulous visual image to your group as well.</div><div id="00:02:30.680" class="transcript_line"> How would you describe it?</div><div id="00:02:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Right, I would call it a colour explosion.</div><div id="00:02:36.680" class="transcript_line"> My wife does all the design and the girls that are in Omadom help her to make the costumes ourselves.</div><div id="00:02:46.680" class="transcript_line"> As you know when we&#039;ve taken part in various carnivals and festivals for Swicker,</div><div id="00:02:53.680" class="transcript_line"> we try and get right into the spirit of carnival by adopting designs and things that are useful to Swicker such as our St. David&#039;s Day parade,</div><div id="00:03:06.680" class="transcript_line"> for example where we introduce the Welsh flag as part of our costume.</div><div id="00:03:11.680" class="transcript_line"> But basically we go for, the girls aren&#039;t the type of belly dancers that most people think of where they&#039;re scantily clad.</div><div id="00:03:22.680" class="transcript_line"> So the dresses for example or the skirts are usually made of 25 yards of material so they&#039;re quite heavy.</div><div id="00:03:30.680" class="transcript_line"> They wear little trolley tops and usually the only part that&#039;s exposed of their bodies are their forearms and perhaps the midriff.</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite a covered up style but it&#039;s very exciting nonetheless and the colour and the sounds that we produce I think add to the enhancement of Omadom.</div><div id="00:03:57.680" class="transcript_line"> I have to say musically and visually a feast for the eye, a feast for the ear.</div><div id="00:04:02.680" class="transcript_line"> Carly Carnival, you&#039;ve been involved in the last two I think, is that right?</div><div id="00:04:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Possibly two or three, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:12.680" class="transcript_line"> Two or three, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Good thing this isn&#039;t too scientific.</div><div id="00:04:16.680" class="transcript_line"> What are your impressions of, because of course in the format of Carly Carnival that we&#039;re discussing we have a stage in the haze or elsewhere in town.</div><div id="00:04:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So Omadom are one of those groups who in a sense blessed the carnival twice over because you give a static set but also then you join us on parade.</div><div id="00:04:40.680" class="transcript_line"> What are your impressions of the audience? How is this received?</div><div id="00:04:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;m glad you asked that question because it has prompted my memory.</div><div id="00:04:48.680" class="transcript_line"> It is actually three carnivals that we&#039;ve taken part in because the first one we just took part in the parade.</div><div id="00:04:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Since that time we&#039;ve actually performed twice on the haze as part of the show for the general public.</div><div id="00:05:06.680" class="transcript_line"> What was particularly brilliant about 2015&#039;s carnival, if I can pick on that one in particular, is that we actually introduced a singer to what we traditionally do.</div><div id="00:05:20.680" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t, the vocals were purely sounds that the singer had used to accompany our drumming rhythms.</div><div id="00:05:32.680" class="transcript_line"> So there was no actual language used, it was just purely vocal sounds but we felt that it worked very well.</div><div id="00:05:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I have to say it did.</div><div id="00:05:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:05:42.680" class="transcript_line"> And we also really appreciate, and I don&#039;t know whether you can remember now, but for the last two years we&#039;ve actually had members of the public unable to contain themselves any longer and they&#039;ve actually got up and started dancing with the girls.</div><div id="00:05:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Now a lot of troops were maybe put off by that but we actually embraced that and we do like it a lot when the public get up and have a go with us.</div><div id="00:06:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I think one of the joys of one with Dom is, well what can I say, your openness of spirit, your celebratory approach to it all.</div><div id="00:06:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And of course the relationship with Swicker is ongoing, and burgeoning.</div><div id="00:06:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Most recently for the third year, Swicker Carnival has undertaken the Carnival number six at Port Myrion, which is part of Festival number six.</div><div id="00:06:35.680" class="transcript_line"> And this year I was delighted that you guys were able to join us.</div><div id="00:06:39.680" class="transcript_line"> What are your impressions, well I suppose first of all of your actual performance, and then perhaps for posterity, the wider festival.</div><div id="00:06:47.680" class="transcript_line"> What did you make of it all, Festival number six?</div><div id="00:06:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Festival number six, well what can I say, a bit of a journey as you know, a couple of hours drive, but we managed to split the troop into four vehicles to ferry our way up to the festival.</div><div id="00:07:03.680" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was brilliant that there was shuttle coaches laid on to transfer us from the car parking area to the actual site.</div><div id="00:07:12.680" class="transcript_line"> A bit of an eye opener, carrying all our camping gear up the hill, but nonetheless it didn&#039;t put us off in any way shape or form.</div><div id="00:07:20.680" class="transcript_line"> The view was magnificent.</div><div id="00:07:22.680" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s we got there, artist camping was on the top of the hill.</div><div id="00:07:26.680" class="transcript_line"> It was brilliant views.</div><div id="00:07:28.680" class="transcript_line"> A beautiful day in fact.</div><div id="00:07:30.680" class="transcript_line"> The weather was, apart from the first night when it did rain, I was alright because I&#039;m used to camping.</div><div id="00:07:37.680" class="transcript_line"> A couple of the dancers did get a bit wet, but they managed to dry their costumes in time for the actual parade on the Saturday.</div><div id="00:07:43.680" class="transcript_line"> We thought it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:45.680" class="transcript_line"> We would have loved to have done more, but obviously we was there to do a certain role, which we fulfilled, and it was absolutely brilliant to meet up on the Portmurrayan Plaza, I believe it&#039;s called.</div><div id="00:08:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Again, we thought we were colourful, but when we were with everybody else there was just colour absolutely everywhere, and the photos will testify to that.</div><div id="00:08:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately you can&#039;t see them on this.</div><div id="00:08:12.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll put them online.</div><div id="00:08:14.680" class="transcript_line"> I particularly enjoyed the other groups that were performing on the plaza, such as Wonder Brass and the Swicker Crew.</div><div id="00:08:22.680" class="transcript_line"> And of course the other guys that stick out in my mind at this moment was Spark.</div><div id="00:08:28.680" class="transcript_line"> I thought they were fabulous.</div><div id="00:08:30.680" class="transcript_line"> In fact, they&#039;ve inspired me to get my own drummers in the troupe to actually dance now.</div><div id="00:08:38.680" class="transcript_line"> So we are actually working on a bit of movement because of what we saw on that day.</div><div id="00:08:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival has always been, what can I say, multicultural, intercultural.</div><div id="00:08:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And what I think was wonderful was the way in which Omidum have brought us a taste of East European and Egyptian and Arabic influences.</div><div id="00:09:02.680" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s it like actually being on a Cardiff Carnival parade on a sunny day?</div><div id="00:09:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Very hot if it&#039;s a very sunny day.</div><div id="00:09:10.680" class="transcript_line"> But no, the atmosphere is brilliant.</div><div id="00:09:13.680" class="transcript_line"> The streets are lined with people that have come specifically to observe the scene, if I can put it that way.</div><div id="00:09:22.680" class="transcript_line"> We make a point of talking to other participants in the parade, so it&#039;s always nice to see people.</div><div id="00:09:32.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve only done three, but already we&#039;re starting to have a rapport with people that we&#039;ve seen before.</div><div id="00:09:39.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just fabulous.</div><div id="00:09:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t really explain.</div><div id="00:09:42.680" class="transcript_line"> We did have the one year, Steve, if you remember when the heavens opened.</div><div id="00:09:47.680" class="transcript_line"> It rained in Wales, Mark.</div><div id="00:09:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Surely not.</div><div id="00:09:51.680" class="transcript_line"> We all got absolutely soaked.</div><div id="00:09:53.680" class="transcript_line"> What I was very pleased with our dancers in particular was that they used make-up that seemed to last the storm.</div><div id="00:10:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And because of the way they wear their costumes, you couldn&#039;t even tell they were wet, whereas everybody else looked drenched.</div><div id="00:10:10.680" class="transcript_line"> The girls still looked, and they maintained their smiles, which was fabulous to see.</div><div id="00:10:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Very much part of the carnival business.</div><div id="00:10:16.680" class="transcript_line"> In terms of smiling, I must confess I am, on behalf of Cardiff Carnival, to you in particular, Mark, and to the whole Hormodorm troupe.</div><div id="00:10:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Bless you. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:10:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And to you in particular, keep on drumming, mate.</div><div id="00:10:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, Steve.</div></div></p>
