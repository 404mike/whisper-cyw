    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Donald Davis. I was born in Kings Road in Llanderby on the 5th of the 4th of 1932.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to school in the Infant School, which is the oldest school in Llanderby.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I became old enough I went to the Central School and stayed there until I was 14 years of age.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember really of the actual starting of the war, but we lived in Kings Road.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And after a number of years of the war Swansea was being bombed by the Germans.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we could see from our home in Kings Road the glow of the oil works in Llandarcy, which was well alight at that time.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the south part of it we could hear the bombings of Swansea itself and the sounds then of the Heinkel bombers, which had a humming noise.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was like this, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, which sounded like as if they were driven by diesel engines.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure whether they were diesel or petrol, I&#039;m not quite sure.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But Swansea was really well alight and as far as we were concerned in Kings Road we could very well have been able to read a newspaper.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because of the light the Llandarcy oil works gave off being well alight.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The work itself in Swansea, later on after the bombings we went down to Swansea and we could see all the rubble which was strewn everywhere.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think bulldozers must have been going along to clear a way through the rubble.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was to us, it was just being well only about 12 years of age then.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But during that time it was an exciting outing basically.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But only we weren&#039;t old enough to realise what really was going on.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> During the war, as far as my father was friendly with a gentleman called Mr. Harro Lee who lived in Llandaerlore Road in Llandebier.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had to go to Morrison Hospital to get medical attention.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And next to him in bed was a German, either a pilot or a member of an aircrew or what he was, I&#039;m not quite sure.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But he must have been able to speak English because Harro Lee asked him how did he manage to bomb Swansea so accurately.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said that it was comparatively easy for them.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> All they had to do was to fly over Llandebier.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And there is, well there was during that time, a furnace in the lime firms in Llandebier.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was well alight at night and it had the glow you could see for miles, not only from up but even in the village it was quite alight.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So what the gentleman in the hospital said to Harro Lee was that he flew over Llandebier, found that furnace well alight.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> On a nice clear evening he was able to pick out the railway lines that he knew about possibly leading towards Swansea.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> All they had to do was to follow the sheen on the railway tracks themselves, the lines, and follow it all the way down to Swansea.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they bombed the city itself.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I remember them seem to be coming back the same way and then turning as they got to Llandebier, they seem to be turning towards Carmarthen over a place called Broad Oak.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were told later on that the air crew must have either had too many bombs left so they let go five bombs over towards the Broad Oak area.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never heard anything of that, whether that was true or not, but I&#039;ve never heard any stories from that date this regarding the bombs creating any damage or anything over towards Broad Oak.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Now during the time that Mr. Lee was in hospital, he obviously gathered all this information and when he returned home he reported the whole matter to the police.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And within a couple of weeks after the whole furnace was covered over with a big steel canopy like the head of a mushroom which hit the whole glow of the furnace itself.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was well done Mr. Lee.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> As was expected, the traffic on the railway line during the war was quite heavily occupied by trains going up and down the line.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And we as children, we were quite interested in the tanks and armaments that were going up, but I never saw them coming down again towards Shrewsbury or Llandaillot and Shrewsbury area.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But then later on, quite often these American soldiers were being transported past the railway station in Landerby.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So being her children, we were quite interested in American chewing gum. So we all as boys together, we all stood on the railway gates and shouted, any gum chap.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And we could see as the train went by, the packets of chewing gum, Wrigley&#039;s chewing gum was being thrown out.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So as soon as the train passed, we were like little rabbits running around the place looking for the bits of packets of chewing gum.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the start of basically us thinking of the American soldiers being in the area.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> From time to time then, in the village, there was a dance in the memorial hall and the American soldiers seemed to be invited there.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And quite nicely, and we could see them enjoying at one time until there was a fight on the square with some of the locals.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously it was a sad day to see everybody fighting on the square near the church.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And this gentleman had been to the chip shop above all things. He had all must be fishing ships.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And as he came from the fishing chip shop, could see this fight and with about, well, it must be eight to ten people fighting on the square.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He got entangled with the fight and as far as the chips were concerned, they were all strewn all over the floor right across.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was sad to me because, you know, they were coming to help us and you get a few people that were after a couple of pints of beer.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody seemed to be the enemy and they didn&#039;t realize it, but this is what happened.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And unfortunately then, after a couple of weeks, my parents invited a couple of American soldiers into Sunnyhurst in Kings Road.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother was quite a lovely lady really, although I say it myself.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> During the war then, she always said, I&#039;ll have to be kind to people, to soldiers, because when my boys might have to go to the war, I hope somebody will look after them.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And unknowns to her, this is what happened.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were Italian prisoners in Landeby.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Germans were in, I think, Llandarog.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And but we had an Italian prisoner in Gambica Farm. His name was Luigi Fontana.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And the police one night on Saturday evening came to see my parents and being Catholics, asked us to take Luigi to the Catholic Church in Ammanford and escort him there and escort him back to our house.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he was returned to the farm in Gambica.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, he was a very smart ex-policeman prior to him going to the, being called up in the army.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a very smart person. He became a prisoner in Tunis.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And his friend, who was another prisoner in Llandeby, his name was Ernesto Masse.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a tank commander, a sergeant, and they both used to come and stay in our house and just have a cup of tea and somewhere to go.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother was quite entertaining.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all a family together basically.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And one night on a Friday night, just before Christmas, we used to call Ernesto Masse Dino.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That was, seemed to be his nickname.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And on this Friday night, there was a knock on the back door.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother went to open the door.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And Dino was there with a big brown paper bag.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, present, Mama, present.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And when she looked into the bag, it was, there must have been about 40 or 50 sparrows there, dead sparrows.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mother said, take them back, you cruel thing.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want them. Take them back.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And the object of him bringing the sparrows to my mother&#039;s house was that being Christmastime in Italy,</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> they set bird cages in the Alps to sing.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> They started singing.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And then unfortunately, other birds came along and bang, bang, bang.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how they trapped them.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And so then they garnish the turkey with sparrows, little bodies basically.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But my mother was quite shocked.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you know how to take them, what he did with the sparrows?</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll never know because ever since he went back to Italy and he went to Australia,</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> but I still pray for him every night.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I pray for them all.</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Another day in, Dino Ernesto Marseille was coming up the road.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were all out on the front.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was so excited, coming towards my mother&#039;s home and our home,</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> that he had this letter in his hand.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, look, look, Maria, letter from Maria.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Look, look.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And he knew very well that we couldn&#039;t understand what was written on the letter</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was all in Italian.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, look, mama, feel it.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, so feel the letter.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was so excited.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And later on, after his return, all Italians, they went back.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So my parents and myself went to Milan to visit Dino and his wife Maria.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a son called Gianfranco.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Now that, unfortunately, was the last time I saw him.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went back to, as I&#039;ve already said, he went back to, emigrated, I think, to Australia.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think he died there.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have tried to trace Gianfranco.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They lived in Via Pizzano Moderno in Milan.</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But I haven&#039;t had any joy getting hold of them at all.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But another prisoner was Guido Bonato.</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Padoa with my parents.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We traced him through our friend Luigi Fontana.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He took us there to meet Guido Bonato.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was quite a good-looking man and very reserved.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he introduced us to his wife.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was working in a spa center.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And we said hello and goodbye.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the last time I saw Guido Bonato and his wife.</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And they, as I&#039;ve said, they lived in Verona.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> We heard on the radio that the war was over.</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother immediately asked Dennis, my brother, my twin brother, and myself, to run down the village.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Quick, quick, quick, she said.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Go to the vicarage and ask the vicar to ring the church bell.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And tell him to ring it straight away because the war is over.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we went down.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can see the vicar now.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a big, very big man.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> His name was Mr. Davis, Vicar Davis.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And within, by the time we got home, the bells were ringing.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that, I think, was the first time they were running after the war.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because during the war, the bells were not allowed to chime at all.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So then everybody started to have the party sort of atmosphere.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was street parties.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody seemed to be so happy.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But sadly, the war in Japan hadn&#039;t ended during that time.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So then, of course, then became, I think, BJ Day, victory in Japan later on.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m proud to say that I&#039;m still in contact with the Fontana family.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Fontana being the Italian prisoner, I&#039;m quite proud to say that I&#039;m still in contact with his wife.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Her name is Irene.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> She is now 96 years old.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> She has a daughter, Elsa.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> When we first came out of the Army, my parents and I went to Italy.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Elsa was only about five then.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she had, Irene had a daughter, another daughter called Elda, a son called Flavio.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And now they&#039;re all married and they live in the Vicenza area in Italy in a village called Marlo.</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Each and every day, every Sunday, I speak to them on WhatsApp.</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have a long chat.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s so nice to be able to see them all.</div></div></p>
