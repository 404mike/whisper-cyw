    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think probably the coronation day. I was working in Newport at the time and I didn&#039;t have a television available but a friend of mine did.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had a very pleasant party, an all day party, with neighbours and friends and so forth.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And you saw people going down and homing in on certain houses which obviously had televisions, often carrying some food with them that they were contributing to the party.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But it certainly made, apart from the obvious interest of the television itself, but it made for a very pleasant social occasion too.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And that I think is my earliest memory, yes. I can&#039;t identify anything earlier than that.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> When do you remember having a television in the home first?</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In my parents&#039; home at the beginning of 1953, but I was not at home then.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think I didn&#039;t see television regularly until I moved to Shropshire and came home at the weekend.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So I saw television every weekend. And after that I think I eventually moved back to Wrexham and then had it available the whole time.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was, I moved back to Wrexham in 1964. So from 1964 on I had full time television so to speak if I wanted to watch it.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> How have your viewing patterns changed over the years?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think in the late 60s, from 1964 on until 1969 when I was living in the family home, I probably watched more, what you might call, general interest programmes.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I moved to my own present home in 1969. And I didn&#039;t watch a great deal of television really.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was too busy these days as I had a lot of work to prepare for the next day.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t really watch a great deal from then on I suppose, except in holiday periods maybe.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think television has influenced your leisure time over the years?</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> My leisure time? That&#039;s a difficult one.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know that it has to any great extent.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think probably in my leisure time I&#039;d have used it in the same way if I hadn&#039;t had television.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Although obviously because I&#039;m interested in the arts and architecture and history things and whatnot.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I would have pursued them anyway. Music, not in practicing it, but in listening to it.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I would have pursued those anyway. The more time I had when I retired, those were the things that I took a great interest in.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But I suppose it supplemented them by providing me with programmes on that type of topic.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you any experience of watching television with a group of other people or in a public place?</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t recall watching in a public place with a group of people.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve watched with family and friends of course.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean that means that you watch some programmes that you wouldn&#039;t necessarily watch if you were on your own.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But it also means that you get an interesting reaction from other people watching a programme</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> where you can get a diametrically opposed opinion of the programme, can&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The one that you would have taken yourself.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> More than that I can&#039;t really say. It isn&#039;t something that I do very often because I live on my own.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think really that&#039;s all I can say.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Of everything that you&#039;ve seen on television, what&#039;s made the greatest impression on you?</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a difficult one.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well obviously there&#039;s a great state occasion to make an impression.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But also certain individual programmes do.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The programmes which are produced now are concerned with the universe or with the lives of composers or whatever.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> As a result of more research, the programmes that are produced would make an impact.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want to think of anything that would be anything specific that made an impact.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I think also of course the news programmes and particularly those that deal with disasters and the situations in which people are living</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> which come over obviously so much more graphically when you see the shots of them, even if they&#039;re sanitised to a certain extent.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things that made an impression was the programme about very recently, the Red Nose Day programme</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> where four celebrities went to live in a Kenyan slum and that made a tremendous impact.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So there is that type of programme that does, yes.</div></div></p>
