    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewees Paul</div><div id="00:00:08.580" class="transcript_line"> and Nicky Keeping, venue Swicker Office, date Friday the 14th of November 2015.</div><div id="00:00:17.900" class="transcript_line"> So Paul and Nicky, when did you first come across Swicker or its predecessor Theatre</div><div id="00:00:24.060" class="transcript_line"> Talleus in Wales?</div><div id="00:00:26.060" class="transcript_line"> Well we first met Mr Swicker about 10 years before Swicker in 1985 when you really were</div><div id="00:00:35.220" class="transcript_line"> the first person to befriend us when we moved to Cardiff, Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:39.900" class="transcript_line"> How did we meet him?</div><div id="00:00:42.980" class="transcript_line"> We just met in chapter, around chapter.</div><div id="00:00:45.900" class="transcript_line"> I think he&#039;s so nosy he came over and wanted to talk to us didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:00:49.380" class="transcript_line"> He said who are you, where are you, where have you come from, what are you doing?</div><div id="00:00:53.100" class="transcript_line"> And I think we were just drinking at that stage.</div><div id="00:00:56.100" class="transcript_line"> We might have got into a bit of happy hour drinking after that with Steve and yeah we</div><div id="00:01:01.660" class="transcript_line"> became great friends.</div><div id="00:01:04.500" class="transcript_line"> But then I suppose we saw Steve working with initially Cardiff Laboratory Theatre and then</div><div id="00:01:13.740" class="transcript_line"> the Centre for Performance Research and then he went off to London for a while to Chisholm</div><div id="00:01:19.460" class="transcript_line"> and came back and started working with Theatre Talleus in Wales.</div><div id="00:01:25.820" class="transcript_line"> We loved the Mad Dog and Tumshan Khatti and we got to know the Bavaiars of Gujarat and</div><div id="00:01:33.580" class="transcript_line"> generally had a great time.</div><div id="00:01:36.060" class="transcript_line"> And then of course I was working for Cardiff Council so really that first mass, although</div><div id="00:01:42.460" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t part of it, I saw it going through Cardiff Castle and that was really excellent.</div><div id="00:01:49.220" class="transcript_line"> But then after a little while there was one New Year&#039;s Day when we&#039;d woken up with a</div><div id="00:01:57.180" class="transcript_line"> hangover probably and we&#039;d had a little bit of a tiff.</div><div id="00:02:00.460" class="transcript_line"> Had we?</div><div id="00:02:01.460" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:02.460" class="transcript_line"> And you came round Steve and said oh have you heard there&#039;s an induction course for</div><div id="00:02:09.620" class="transcript_line"> this Cardiff Samba Band which then was still relatively new and that was probably in about</div><div id="00:02:15.540" class="transcript_line"> 1993 or something.</div><div id="00:02:18.500" class="transcript_line"> We tossed a coin because we weren&#039;t in a position to really rationally agree who was going to</div><div id="00:02:25.060" class="transcript_line"> go because we had two young kids and only one of us could go.</div><div id="00:02:27.900" class="transcript_line"> So we flipped a coin and...</div><div id="00:02:29.900" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t have gone anyway if you&#039;d won.</div><div id="00:02:31.900" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have gone for a week and said oh hey, I don&#039;t want to.</div><div id="00:02:36.620" class="transcript_line"> And so Nicky with her sticking power became a big part of the Cardiff Samba Band for about</div><div id="00:02:42.700" class="transcript_line"> 20 years.</div><div id="00:02:44.300" class="transcript_line"> And actually we still, you know, you still perform with them this summer in France, didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:48.340" class="transcript_line"> you, on Bastille Day.</div><div id="00:02:50.460" class="transcript_line"> But then because we went along to the first, well one of the early Sambadromes down at</div><div id="00:02:56.060" class="transcript_line"> Channel View and Nicky was playing with the Samba Band and for me as someone who always</div><div id="00:03:02.540" class="transcript_line"> really sort of felt dreadful in a dancing environment saw all these amazing blokes dancing</div><div id="00:03:11.100" class="transcript_line"> really well like Ian Devereux and Adrian Wiggins looked very fetching in a matching zen outfit.</div><div id="00:03:18.100" class="transcript_line"> And I sort of thought well if...</div><div id="00:03:20.780" class="transcript_line"> And I met all these cool Samba people and thought well I&#039;ve got to learn how to dance</div><div id="00:03:27.140" class="transcript_line"> and picked up a flyer for patchoua dance and ended up doing a weekend.</div><div id="00:03:36.660" class="transcript_line"> After that weekend I couldn&#039;t actually get down the stairs except on my bum because I</div><div id="00:03:42.700" class="transcript_line"> was exercising muscles I&#039;d never used before.</div><div id="00:03:45.020" class="transcript_line"> That was ages later than that, probably.</div><div id="00:03:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Well it was before my first mass and I think the first mass I did I think was 1994 because</div><div id="00:03:53.820" class="transcript_line"> I remember blue was the theme and I was dancing with a life-size puppet whose shoes were tied</div><div id="00:04:01.860" class="transcript_line"> to my shoes and we were doing sort of partner dancing with Fernanda and Nicky was in the</div><div id="00:04:07.380" class="transcript_line"> Samba Band so that was my first mass.</div><div id="00:04:11.740" class="transcript_line"> I had done a couple before with Daisy and Jimmy when they were tiny and so very young</div><div id="00:04:19.540" class="transcript_line"> they did the carnival right up until they were 15, 16 and every year they did it and</div><div id="00:04:26.540" class="transcript_line"> I thoroughly enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:04:28.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah so I was a bit earlier and that was great fun.</div><div id="00:04:35.140" class="transcript_line"> And of course they&#039;ve both gone on to work in that kind of lifestyle.</div><div id="00:04:40.100" class="transcript_line"> Daisy&#039;s an actor now and Jimmy works in films.</div><div id="00:04:43.100" class="transcript_line"> Still very lively both of them.</div><div id="00:04:46.060" class="transcript_line"> And I think they both learnt a lot.</div><div id="00:04:49.060" class="transcript_line"> They really enjoyed dressing up, they really enjoyed tearing down the road, they loved</div><div id="00:04:53.580" class="transcript_line"> winding up people on the street.</div><div id="00:04:55.700" class="transcript_line"> So that for them was their favourite.</div><div id="00:04:57.700" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve taken part in some of the juvets, these secret pre-carnival rioting.</div><div id="00:05:04.460" class="transcript_line"> They would actually no they didn&#039;t because they were too young and I enjoyed myself far</div><div id="00:05:10.220" class="transcript_line"> too much to allow the kids there then because it was all about just smothering yourself</div><div id="00:05:16.180" class="transcript_line"> in paint and having a lot of drinking, getting very loud and tearing through the town which</div><div id="00:05:21.920" class="transcript_line"> I thought was the best part of carnival always.</div><div id="00:05:26.380" class="transcript_line"> I think they did the first juvets we did because my brother and his wife were down.</div><div id="00:05:31.060" class="transcript_line"> I think they were looking after them and saw us doing it.</div><div id="00:05:33.660" class="transcript_line"> No they were part of the juvets.</div><div id="00:05:36.660" class="transcript_line"> Well if I&#039;m right but that was the year that the juvets was happening in the Hayes.</div><div id="00:05:44.340" class="transcript_line"> There was a concert on the bandstand at the Hayes and we were supposed to tie, we were</div><div id="00:05:50.300" class="transcript_line"> in an underground car park or a you know like part of the St David shopping centre and we</div><div id="00:05:55.860" class="transcript_line"> were supposed to wait until a signal.</div><div id="00:06:00.540" class="transcript_line"> We come out just as the concert was finishing and you&#039;ll remember it Steve, it was an interesting</div><div id="00:06:06.100" class="transcript_line"> evening but what happened was we were doing jab jabs and so Tom of Warped and Twisted</div><div id="00:06:13.940" class="transcript_line"> was our was the sort of sectioned leader really.</div><div id="00:06:18.820" class="transcript_line"> He just went bang bang and then we just whipped into line thinking that was our cue and we</div><div id="00:06:26.300" class="transcript_line"> started marching out of this underground car park and we arrived about ten minutes early.</div><div id="00:06:31.620" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like carnival doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:34.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:35.140" class="transcript_line"> They were furious weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:06:37.020" class="transcript_line"> And obviously we weren&#039;t going to stop and there was a bit of a, I wouldn&#039;t call it a</div><div id="00:06:42.140" class="transcript_line"> Mexican stand off.</div><div id="00:06:43.500" class="transcript_line"> Sound clash at the very least.</div><div id="00:06:45.940" class="transcript_line"> Lamar started shouting didn&#039;t he between every jab jab he would shout what he was going</div><div id="00:06:50.700" class="transcript_line"> to do to people and jab jab where he&#039;s going to do it, jab jab.</div><div id="00:06:55.340" class="transcript_line"> The best one was I&#039;m going to use Mike Chubb&#039;s head as a football I see.</div><div id="00:06:59.780" class="transcript_line"> We all just cheered really loudly.</div><div id="00:07:02.980" class="transcript_line"> Poor Mike, he just looked crestfallen didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:07:08.060" class="transcript_line"> Juve was absolutely great.</div><div id="00:07:10.460" class="transcript_line"> It was the spirit yeah which I really loved that it was just like let&#039;s just go for it.</div><div id="00:07:15.300" class="transcript_line"> They were dark carnivals compared to the carnivals there are now but I think I felt that they</div><div id="00:07:21.220" class="transcript_line"> came from a punk era very much and we were all of the same mind and for me I felt very</div><div id="00:07:28.980" class="transcript_line"> comfortable in that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:07:31.060" class="transcript_line"> They were far more libertarian in that sense do you think?</div><div id="00:07:36.540" class="transcript_line"> Well they didn&#039;t follow a norm did they?</div><div id="00:07:38.980" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t carnival in that sense, it was carnival of people of the city of Cardiff and all the</div><div id="00:07:46.020" class="transcript_line"> all their pasts all together it&#039;s not like right we&#039;re going to have a nice red section</div><div id="00:07:50.140" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re going to have a nice blue section and this is going to be you know represent the</div><div id="00:07:54.220" class="transcript_line"> sea it was a lot of individualism and it was just like what do you want to be what should</div><div id="00:07:58.260" class="transcript_line"> we do and you just decided it was very free.</div><div id="00:08:03.420" class="transcript_line"> I mean you had a Mark as Paulie was talking about early on you know with the tan there</div><div id="00:08:07.460" class="transcript_line"> was two rooms so you had two different sections of carnival really as well so you had a Maru</div><div id="00:08:13.980" class="transcript_line"> section which was a lot more traditional.</div><div id="00:08:16.700" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot more sewing going on.</div><div id="00:08:19.060" class="transcript_line"> A lot more sewing yeah and then of course in the other section it was just spray paint</div><div id="00:08:23.900" class="transcript_line"> which was just so toxic in there people on one side would moan constantly because they</div><div id="00:08:29.580" class="transcript_line"> were smoking fags and and spraying really stinky paint everywhere.</div><div id="00:08:34.700" class="transcript_line"> It was plastic and yeah burning of plastic, ripping of gaffer tape and it was just was</div><div id="00:08:42.860" class="transcript_line"> really quite creative.</div><div id="00:08:45.220" class="transcript_line"> It was creative but very dark and I think probably well I just love that&#039;s what I love.</div><div id="00:08:51.140" class="transcript_line"> I think you have a punk ethic as you were saying.</div><div id="00:08:53.380" class="transcript_line"> It really did.</div><div id="00:08:54.380" class="transcript_line"> It was our era wasn&#039;t it and I suppose it was stuff we&#039;d never really done or I&#039;d never</div><div id="00:09:01.540" class="transcript_line"> really done before.</div><div id="00:09:02.540" class="transcript_line"> No no we were able to do it weren&#039;t you.</div><div id="00:09:04.620" class="transcript_line"> Meeting great people that we&#039;d never met before and they&#039;re still really close friends now</div><div id="00:09:11.380" class="transcript_line"> People like Mareaga we met then, Gareth we met through the mass, we met Tom and Ali,</div><div id="00:09:16.660" class="transcript_line"> we met Spike you know all those people Ben, Jude and Shona all those people we met through</div><div id="00:09:23.340" class="transcript_line"> the mass.</div><div id="00:09:24.340" class="transcript_line"> But also on the other side was Alva and Maru.</div><div id="00:09:27.940" class="transcript_line"> And Sally and Adrian was always in an interesting position because he had his Powys sort of</div><div id="00:09:33.980" class="transcript_line"> connection and Adrian liked, you obviously had Simon you know with the Cardiff Samba</div><div id="00:09:40.260" class="transcript_line"> band and Adrian had his small carnival troupe.</div><div id="00:09:44.140" class="transcript_line"> Nice bit of rivalry there.</div><div id="00:09:48.460" class="transcript_line"> Plus you know Bristol coming over, bristling of you know strutting of leaders who can lead</div><div id="00:09:55.500" class="transcript_line"> the best.</div><div id="00:09:56.500" class="transcript_line"> And then Swansea always really great with their Celtic sort of West Walyan thing.</div><div id="00:10:02.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah no it&#039;s all good.</div><div id="00:10:05.900" class="transcript_line"> And of course 1995 as it is was the Well of Wisdom which was an early attempt to not mainly</div><div id="00:10:12.460" class="transcript_line"> have a parade but to put on a presentation that tried to move towards carnival theatre</div><div id="00:10:18.140" class="transcript_line"> or told a story and certainly in those early days and you already mentioned ending up in</div><div id="00:10:23.100" class="transcript_line"> the Hayes on one occasion there was a whole period where the final carnival presentation</div><div id="00:10:29.100" class="transcript_line"> happened on the steps of the National Museum.</div><div id="00:10:31.100" class="transcript_line"> Tell us about that experience.</div><div id="00:10:33.340" class="transcript_line"> I mean a fabulous backdrop and it was a nice area wasn&#039;t it because people could crowd</div><div id="00:10:41.100" class="transcript_line"> around and then you could perform.</div><div id="00:10:42.620" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a great performance space area there and it&#039;s huge.</div><div id="00:10:45.900" class="transcript_line"> Good sight lines.</div><div id="00:10:46.620" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got loads of people can see it.</div><div id="00:10:49.180" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite flattering as a performer because you are up quite high.</div><div id="00:10:52.540" class="transcript_line"> And yeah you&#039;re up high you could move up and down the steps.</div><div id="00:10:55.740" class="transcript_line"> There were some great fireworks going on.</div><div id="00:10:59.100" class="transcript_line"> Oh really nice and the kids again really enjoying that except for when Jim decided he needed a wee</div><div id="00:11:06.940" class="transcript_line"> and he went I said just go behind that pillar Jim it&#039;s fine you know in the middle of the show</div><div id="00:11:12.220" class="transcript_line"> and so he starts having a wee and suddenly the the rain you know fireworks started firing down on</div><div id="00:11:21.900" class="transcript_line"> him and yeah it was tricky for him bless him he was caught it was a bit traumatic yeah but</div><div id="00:11:29.820" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s just such a great there was no burning involved was there oh it was just a bounce here</div><div id="00:11:34.300" class="transcript_line"> and there a bounce of a spark it was enough to eat yeah did worry he worried it he was only about</div><div id="00:11:40.700" class="transcript_line"> four at the time he worried him slightly but hey he came back the next year he wasn&#039;t you know put</div><div id="00:11:46.380" class="transcript_line"> off but though a really nice and also finishing in the night yes really good yes really great</div><div id="00:11:53.900" class="transcript_line"> because in the daytime it&#039;s lovely but it was such an atmosphere it was a great atmosphere and it</div><div id="00:11:58.940" class="transcript_line"> looked like there was a show happening yeah and there was a bit of a celeb thing going on for a</div><div id="00:12:04.300" class="transcript_line"> while with Benjamin Zephaniah did you get to work with him or well yeah we you were a chanter</div><div id="00:12:10.380" class="transcript_line"> were you a chanter I think I might have was like yeah yes I was a chanter terrible memory</div><div id="00:12:15.580" class="transcript_line"> I know I remember working and singing the songs with Benjamin I really enjoyed that a lot that</div><div id="00:12:21.420" class="transcript_line"> was nice because it wasn&#039;t anything to do with the band or you know it was just doing something</div><div id="00:12:26.380" class="transcript_line"> for myself and it was really good that was the first time ever we decided we needed to get the</div><div id="00:12:29.980" class="transcript_line"> spoken son or chanted word into it yeah Marianne was always very good you know I know we always</div><div id="00:12:35.100" class="transcript_line"> had songs I suppose you&#039;re right yeah it was a chance to try and move that was more of a narrative</div><div id="00:12:39.260" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and one of the key players in that piece of theatre was</div><div id="00:12:44.700" class="transcript_line"> played by yourself Paul oh dear would you get to know us about your character well I was taking</div><div id="00:12:48.940" class="transcript_line"> a little sabbatical from work and uh which was great really good and you kindly offered me the</div><div id="00:12:55.980" class="transcript_line"> the chance of a a character part uh one that didn&#039;t actually involve too much technical dancing so I</div><div id="00:13:02.860" class="transcript_line"> was quite pleased with that and it was quite a dark character uh I think it was called the tempter</div><div id="00:13:07.660" class="transcript_line"> or the book man and uh it also involved growing a diabolical goatee beard which flattered me a bit</div><div id="00:13:15.100" class="transcript_line"> um yeah so I was there with uh the scales of uh of justice and the book of judgment</div><div id="00:13:22.780" class="transcript_line"> massive great horns and nice devil wings that had been made for me and uh I think I was I was trying</div><div id="00:13:29.660" class="transcript_line"> to tempt and nowadays perhaps you might be particularly politically incorrect but I was</div><div id="00:13:34.380" class="transcript_line"> supposed to be tempting the young people into uh into uh evil ways but all in the best possible</div><div id="00:13:41.580" class="transcript_line"> taste yes I assured you know that was great because it gave me the chance rather than I mean</div><div id="00:13:49.100" class="transcript_line"> the dancing and and learning the drumming patterns and that kind of stuff is great but developing a</div><div id="00:13:55.340" class="transcript_line"> character and just thinking about what am I going to be what are we going to be like I&#039;m just hearing</div><div id="00:13:59.820" class="transcript_line"> you through the PA annunciating those words and there has to be an audience of three four five</div><div id="00:14:04.220" class="transcript_line"> thousand people watching it I mean and the communication they you know you were great they</div><div id="00:14:08.380" class="transcript_line"> understood every word there was there was conveyed meaning going on you know I mean parading is great</div><div id="00:14:13.020" class="transcript_line"> and will always be the backbone of what a carnival does but it&#039;s good to explore other things no</div><div id="00:14:17.820" class="transcript_line"> definitely I mean one epic moment for me is uh everyone in Cardiff know associated with carnival</div><div id="00:14:25.020" class="transcript_line"> or cardiff people will know ninja and uh I can&#039;t remember which year it was but I think it might</div><div id="00:14:31.420" class="transcript_line"> have been like the the year after that in about 97 or something where um uh Tom I think it was</div><div id="00:14:38.780" class="transcript_line"> developed this idea of run de mental which was basically um it wasn&#039;t it was sorry it was Chris&#039;s</div><div id="00:14:46.220" class="transcript_line"> idea he saw it in in in brazil and brought it back it was Chris&#039;s idea yeah so the idea was to</div><div id="00:14:52.220" class="transcript_line"> create a section that didn&#039;t necessarily follow the route of the carnival um and so you would</div><div id="00:14:59.420" class="transcript_line"> form a little tableau and drum like mental and then run like mental and there wouldn&#039;t be any</div><div id="00:15:06.780" class="transcript_line"> plan as to where you were going to run it was just uh I think I can&#039;t remember perhaps it was Chris</div><div id="00:15:11.740" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s just Chris led it Chris led it you just hair off and the uh this poor stewards from the council</div><div id="00:15:18.940" class="transcript_line"> I think you know they&#039;ve been a small posse assembled to mind our section but we were very</div><div id="00:15:25.260" class="transcript_line"> well behaved I think and that&#039;s the year that I think gareth met Mareaga so quite a famous year</div><div id="00:15:30.700" class="transcript_line"> in that respect um you were taking photos weren&#039;t you you weren&#039;t actually in it yeah I was doing</div><div id="00:15:35.580" class="transcript_line"> first aid as well they were a couple of injuries and uh um they were body painters weren&#039;t they</div><div id="00:15:42.300" class="transcript_line"> black and white we had lovely black and white body paint we had trained for weeks to do run</div><div id="00:15:48.140" class="transcript_line"> de mental if you&#039;re thinking about a whole gang of smoking drinking did you want to try and get</div><div id="00:15:54.700" class="transcript_line"> oh my god we had fish came over he was our trainer we had to meet three months beforehand</div><div id="00:16:04.460" class="transcript_line"> every Wednesday night Chris got us in and said right if we&#039;re going to do this we&#039;re actually</div><div id="00:16:09.500" class="transcript_line"> going to bloody do it and it means you&#039;ve all got to learn how to run I&#039;d never run in my life</div><div id="00:16:15.180" class="transcript_line"> so Mareaga and and fish down at the tan center every Wednesday or whatever it was</div><div id="00:16:22.460" class="transcript_line"> running around the bloody car park doing press-ups doing sit-ups we&#039;d never done anything like that</div><div id="00:16:30.540" class="transcript_line"> always having a fag in between you know but it we really worked really bloody hard and I</div><div id="00:16:38.540" class="transcript_line"> this is the fittest I tell you it&#039;s the fittest I have ever been we bought special drums they were</div><div id="00:16:44.460" class="transcript_line"> flown over weren&#039;t they from Brazil I think really light wooden drums skin drums and we have beaters</div><div id="00:16:51.820" class="transcript_line"> and it and Chris did about three or four different rhythms and we had to train throwing</div><div id="00:16:59.260" class="transcript_line"> their running as playing and throwing drums all at the same time which for all of us the first day</div><div id="00:17:09.340" class="transcript_line"> yeah and there was quite a bit of face paint malfunction as well as people getting</div><div id="00:17:13.980" class="transcript_line"> face paint in their eyes and stuff like that but it ended up on the steps of the museum and like</div><div id="00:17:19.340" class="transcript_line"> as Nikki said I actually thought I was in the section but now I remember that I wasn&#039;t and</div><div id="00:17:22.940" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the funny thing about mass because sometimes you think you&#039;re doing something and</div><div id="00:17:26.700" class="transcript_line"> people say no you weren&#039;t actually you didn&#039;t think you were doing anything and people said no I saw</div><div id="00:17:31.580" class="transcript_line"> you I&#039;ve got 25 years of that man yeah but they&#039;re just an epic moment for me because I also had a</div><div id="00:17:39.820" class="transcript_line"> video camera and it was back in 97 so it&#039;s a fairly rudimental run to mental camera</div><div id="00:17:46.780" class="transcript_line"> but Ninja who is the first time I&#039;d ever really met him and I&#039;d got to know him a bit</div><div id="00:17:54.220" class="transcript_line"> through the Cardiff festival and stuff like that but he just he got on the stage and he launched</div><div id="00:18:02.220" class="transcript_line"> into this freeform unrehearsed poetry about Ninja Pendragon and yeah yeah it was just a great moment</div><div id="00:18:10.540" class="transcript_line"> for me that yes just so funny and Tom invited him out of the audience to rap because he saw</div><div id="00:18:15.340" class="transcript_line"> him in the audience and he just came forward and off he went and we all performed around him</div><div id="00:18:21.100" class="transcript_line"> spontaneity the whole thing and it&#039;s all based on sort of friendship and</div><div id="00:18:27.740" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff&#039;s a great place and you&#039;ll remember the the Cardiff festival in those days there was some</div><div id="00:18:32.780" class="transcript_line"> stuff that brought a lot of people together like Hayes Alive and the Children&#039;s Festival and those</div><div id="00:18:37.820" class="transcript_line"> kind of stuff and yeah it&#039;s a nice meeting of minds really sounds wonderful</div><div id="00:18:46.620" class="transcript_line"> just for posterity if future generations listen to you</div><div id="00:18:54.380" class="transcript_line"> how do you sum up the value of the whole experience why was it worth doing</div><div id="00:18:58.380" class="transcript_line"> what was it all about why are we here I think it&#039;s a wonderful way for people to make a lot</div><div id="00:19:05.420" class="transcript_line"> of good friends really great friends I think it&#039;s a wonderful way for people who&#039;ve never done</div><div id="00:19:11.820" class="transcript_line"> any kind of you know performing to start off small and amazingly after 10 years are probably</div><div id="00:19:20.940" class="transcript_line"> leading a whole section because people you know it&#039;s it&#039;s infectious it&#039;s easy and it&#039;s fun</div><div id="00:19:28.620" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a very inclusive place as well and I mean I still I haven&#039;t really seen a lot of Keith</div><div id="00:19:34.940" class="transcript_line"> since stopping doing the mass I mean I still see him around occasionally but he was a dear friend</div><div id="00:19:41.260" class="transcript_line"> who you think of someone like him I doubt he as a deaf gentleman I don&#039;t think originally homeless</div><div id="00:19:49.020" class="transcript_line"> and yeah problem and special needs which indirectly we helped to impact on and yet he became a real</div><div id="00:19:57.260" class="transcript_line"> integral part yeah almost not like a mascot but you know he was just a guy that you expected to</div><div id="00:20:02.860" class="transcript_line"> be at the mass and he was able to really express his creative side provided he was allowed to be</div><div id="00:20:10.060" class="transcript_line"> a large lady in high heel shoes with a 22 out of 25 smear of red lipstick</div><div id="00:20:24.540" class="transcript_line"> you think of people like who are the two girls that turned up with no clothes on at all</div><div id="00:20:30.540" class="transcript_line"> totally bare breath they did they basically shoved some snakes tongue in their mouth</div><div id="00:20:38.940" class="transcript_line"> appears as serpents I love yeah it was only until the brain occurred to us that they&#039;d done the</div><div id="00:20:45.660" class="transcript_line"> whole thing bare-breasted yeah I was just you know fine pushing the envelope wasn&#039;t it I think they</div><div id="00:20:51.500" class="transcript_line"> were building up to it for a couple of years they had done they had done it a few years but yeah</div><div id="00:20:56.060" class="transcript_line"> this is that was the first time you saw them well because they were sprayed gold they sort of got</div><div id="00:21:02.460" class="transcript_line"> away with it you had to get quite close but I remember them catching up to a policeman who</div><div id="00:21:05.900" class="transcript_line"> as it was happening he suddenly realized that they weren&#039;t wearing anything</div><div id="00:21:09.900" class="transcript_line"> I love the belly button either you know it&#039;s just very unusual and I mean another thing in terms of</div><div id="00:21:16.140" class="transcript_line"> professional development you know you think of someone like Caroline who is always a keen dancer</div><div id="00:21:22.540" class="transcript_line"> and you know very interested in performance but from her kids doing you know circus school</div><div id="00:21:31.340" class="transcript_line"> and that sort of stuff she got into it herself studied learning to do the the I don&#039;t know what</div><div id="00:21:37.100" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s called the metal stair yeah and then becoming I mean she was really the face of the mass for so</div><div id="00:21:45.260" class="transcript_line"> many years wouldn&#039;t she they always the echo always managed to find a picture she&#039;s got a lovely face</div><div id="00:21:50.220" class="transcript_line"> but you know now professional carnival artists</div><div id="00:21:56.380" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;re you know I mean and there were people like obviously Maryann who were</div><div id="00:22:00.060" class="transcript_line"> professional performers in their own right but a lot of people as Nicky said got their first chance</div><div id="00:22:05.500" class="transcript_line"> to do something without perhaps thinking I am an artist but after a few years they&#039;re recognized as</div><div id="00:22:12.060" class="transcript_line"> as leaders in their field so you&#039;ll see Caroline at you know festivals all over the UK</div><div id="00:22:16.780" class="transcript_line"> Richard Hugh Morgan who&#039;s now in the experimental group we&#039;ve got back up</div><div id="00:22:21.100" class="transcript_line"> yeah through the Breathe Golf experience which has made that his first time he&#039;d ever performed in his</div><div id="00:22:25.660" class="transcript_line"> life was in the precursor to Swicko in Theaters of Tally Esse in Wales&#039; Maddox Community Play</div><div id="00:22:31.100" class="transcript_line"> the first time he ever performed and that one thing that&#039;s amazing that&#039;s strange yeah yeah</div><div id="00:22:38.140" class="transcript_line"> on that note Paul and Nicky Keating I wish to thank you for harvesting your memories and to</div><div id="00:22:43.420" class="transcript_line"> declare you not separately but jointly Cardiff Parnell Heroes thank you very much</div></div></p>
