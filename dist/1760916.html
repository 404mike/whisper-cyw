    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> name Mark. Just at the top I&#039;m just going to say I&#039;m Marcia Armani the</div><div id="00:00:04.040" class="transcript_line"> interviewer with Gareth Davis with an I or an E? Of course.</div><div id="00:00:10.240" class="transcript_line"> Is that the Welsh version? Well absolutely. And we&#039;re at Caleon and it is</div><div id="00:00:18.240" class="transcript_line"> Monday April 29 2019 and we&#039;re here to interview Dr. Mark Lewis. Mark so I&#039;m</div><div id="00:00:27.320" class="transcript_line"> just going to pop that there. I wonder if you could just introduce yourself. Who</div><div id="00:00:31.240" class="transcript_line"> you are, what you do. Okay I&#039;m Dr. Mark Lewis. I&#039;m the senior curator of Roman</div><div id="00:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> archaeology at the National Museum of Wales based at the National Roman</div><div id="00:00:41.520" class="transcript_line"> Legion Museum in Caleon. We hold all the Roman material from the two legionary</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> bases in Wales that happen to be very close together at Usk nearby and Caleon</div><div id="00:00:55.040" class="transcript_line"> where this museum is based. So we only hold Roman objects in our collections</div><div id="00:00:59.520" class="transcript_line"> and anything that&#039;s later any medieval material is sent off to the National</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Museum in Cardiff because we are part of the National Museum of Wales but we hold</div><div id="00:01:08.520" class="transcript_line"> all the Roman material from those two legionary bases. There is a third Welsh</div><div id="00:01:12.960" class="transcript_line"> legionary base but it was built on the wrong side of the River Dee on the wrong</div><div id="00:01:17.320" class="transcript_line"> bank by the Romans so it&#039;s Chester and had it been on the other bank it would</div><div id="00:01:22.400" class="transcript_line"> be in Wales but it is our counterpart in the north if you like it&#039;s a very</div><div id="00:01:26.960" class="transcript_line"> similar geographical location at the lowest crossing point of the Dee and</div><div id="00:01:31.440" class="transcript_line"> took its name after the river Diva, Dewa, after the Dee and Isca, Caleon</div><div id="00:01:37.640" class="transcript_line"> Isca was named after the Usk. So we do have these mirror image fortresses at</div><div id="00:01:43.480" class="transcript_line"> either end of Wales but sadly as far as the National Museum is concerned the</div><div id="00:01:49.160" class="transcript_line"> great collections and great fortress of Chester just happened to be on</div><div id="00:01:53.720" class="transcript_line"> the wrong bank so they&#039;re in England in the modern boundary is along the river.</div><div id="00:01:59.240" class="transcript_line"> So your interest in Roman, where does that come from?</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> Well I grew up on the edge of the levels in Caldecott and of course Caldecott is</div><div id="00:02:12.840" class="transcript_line"> adjacent to the great Roman city of Carwent, our tribal capital and I had a</div><div id="00:02:20.200" class="transcript_line"> fabulous inspirational history teacher when I went to Caldecott comprehensive</div><div id="00:02:26.080" class="transcript_line"> school who you will have met Peter Strong. He was my history teacher at the</div><div id="00:02:31.240" class="transcript_line"> age of 11 and on Sunday mornings he used to take the school minibus to an</div><div id="00:02:36.060" class="transcript_line"> excavation at Trostry near Usk and we used to dig and we were taught to dig</div><div id="00:02:40.520" class="transcript_line"> there from the age of 11, a group of us. Many of my contemporaries fell away as</div><div id="00:02:47.120" class="transcript_line"> time went by and as winters approached because we dug all the way through the</div><div id="00:02:50.920" class="transcript_line"> year at Trostry but he kept going, I kept going for three years and that took me</div><div id="00:02:57.480" class="transcript_line"> up to my teenage years when I was old enough to join the Roman excavations at</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Carwent that were being undertaken by the National Museum of Wales and</div><div id="00:03:04.960" class="transcript_line"> directed by Richard Brewer the then keeper of Roman archaeology. So at the</div><div id="00:03:11.120" class="transcript_line"> age of 15 I joined the excavations in Carwent and because they happened during</div><div id="00:03:15.160" class="transcript_line"> the summer during school holidays I was able to continue to excavate there</div><div id="00:03:20.200" class="transcript_line"> through my GCSEs, through my A levels and even into when I was studying for my</div><div id="00:03:26.240" class="transcript_line"> degree for nine seasons in all. So that&#039;s where I got my love for Roman</div><div id="00:03:32.280" class="transcript_line"> archaeology and where I really sharpened my digging skills to become a</div><div id="00:03:38.040" class="transcript_line"> competent field archaeologist. What an inspirational teacher. Absolutely and I</div><div id="00:03:43.640" class="transcript_line"> think individuals, individual characters are absolutely critical. Somebody will</div><div id="00:03:51.480" class="transcript_line"> somewhere in their lives meet someone that that gives them that spark of</div><div id="00:03:55.840" class="transcript_line"> inspiration or then mentors them to develop it and Peter, I was very lucky I</div><div id="00:04:01.760" class="transcript_line"> had a number, there was also a local gentleman that used to come to that dig</div><div id="00:04:07.240" class="transcript_line"> from Rogget again on the edge of the levels called Barry Stopgate and he was</div><div id="00:04:12.280" class="transcript_line"> a very much a historian and archaeologist but interested in vernacular</div><div id="00:04:17.760" class="transcript_line"> architecture so farmhouses, old farmhouses and old farm buildings. So very</div><div id="00:04:22.600" class="transcript_line"> soon having Doug alongside Barry for years and years and years I was holding</div><div id="00:04:29.480" class="transcript_line"> the other end of his measuring tapes as we surveyed all the ancient farmhouses</div><div id="00:04:34.360" class="transcript_line"> the Tudor and Jacobean farmhouses on the levels and on the south of the county.</div><div id="00:04:40.240" class="transcript_line"> The farmhouses in the north of the county had been surveyed by Lord Raglan</div><div id="00:04:45.560" class="transcript_line"> and Sir Cyril Fox of the National Museum in the early part of the 19th century</div><div id="00:04:50.200" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;d never come down to the south of Monmouthshire so we started picking</div><div id="00:04:55.240" class="transcript_line"> off a number of the houses. I joined Barry who&#039;d been studying these houses</div><div id="00:05:00.080" class="transcript_line"> for some time so private individuals would give us access to their own</div><div id="00:05:05.920" class="transcript_line"> homes and we&#039;d measure them, survey them accurately, look at the internal features</div><div id="00:05:10.160" class="transcript_line"> like ancient fireplaces, staircases, plaster ceilings in some cases, paneled</div><div id="00:05:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Tudor paneled passageways etc and we would photograph them, measure them and</div><div id="00:05:23.680" class="transcript_line"> then write them up and many of those reports are deposited in the local</div><div id="00:05:27.560" class="transcript_line"> library service. So these characters are inspirational and one thing leads</div><div id="00:05:33.120" class="transcript_line"> to another and without them and the inspiration from my own father used to</div><div id="00:05:37.920" class="transcript_line"> take me to all these places and give me access and do much especially on the</div><div id="00:05:44.320" class="transcript_line"> landscape side of things in understanding how things fit together in a landscape</div><div id="00:05:49.760" class="transcript_line"> context. Well when I went to university one of the things we were taught very</div><div id="00:05:58.160" class="transcript_line"> early on was a new sort of theory in archaeology that was called a</div><div id="00:06:02.440" class="transcript_line"> phenomenology of landscape and it was the way that people move about in</div><div id="00:06:08.800" class="transcript_line"> landscapes and then start to attach meaning or importance to certain</div><div id="00:06:13.760" class="transcript_line"> features within landscapes. Perhaps they mark passageways between the summer</div><div id="00:06:19.960" class="transcript_line"> grazing or the winter grazing, perhaps they mark out territory where people lay</div><div id="00:06:25.640" class="transcript_line"> claim to grazing rights through the positions of their chambered tombs, the</div><div id="00:06:32.120" class="transcript_line"> early farmers, the first monuments within our landscape that we can still see</div><div id="00:06:36.720" class="transcript_line"> today. So people started to place monuments, their burial mounds with</div><div id="00:06:46.600" class="transcript_line"> respect to certain views from them so that they could look down on their</div><div id="00:06:50.840" class="transcript_line"> former territory and life from the grave etc. So there&#039;s a relationship</div><div id="00:06:55.160" class="transcript_line"> between the archaeology, the monuments and where they&#039;re positioned within the</div><div id="00:06:59.760" class="transcript_line"> landscape perhaps with respect to ancient communication routes, the road</div><div id="00:07:04.960" class="transcript_line"> system etc. And my father had always intuitively been very very knowledgeable</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and thoroughly understood that aspect of landscape and so when I went to</div><div id="00:07:18.800" class="transcript_line"> university and they taught this as really quite modern theory that had only</div><div id="00:07:22.240" class="transcript_line"> been published about the time I was at university I was immediately overjoyed</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> that I thoroughly understood this because this is the way I&#039;d been trained</div><div id="00:07:32.800" class="transcript_line"> but I was immediately depressed that I hadn&#039;t published it first because I fully</div><div id="00:07:37.520" class="transcript_line"> understood this new theory because this is the way I viewed archaeology and had</div><div id="00:07:43.360" class="transcript_line"> been raised to view it. And so it&#039;s a number of factors that have brought</div><div id="00:07:51.560" class="transcript_line"> me along the path that I now tread but those early mentors and that</div><div id="00:07:59.800" class="transcript_line"> early inspiration was key to really getting me going on the journey.</div><div id="00:08:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Feel free to ask questions Gareth.</div><div id="00:08:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, yes I will. It&#039;s just interesting that you&#039;ve drawn the archaeology and</div><div id="00:08:16.160" class="transcript_line"> geomorphology really together. How do you see that fitting in possibly when we look</div><div id="00:08:22.920" class="transcript_line"> at the landscape on the levels?</div><div id="00:08:24.920" class="transcript_line"> I think, and for me it&#039;s the way I think that we can best understand the interaction</div><div id="00:08:31.520" class="transcript_line"> between man and our landscape or that particular landscape in the past but the</div><div id="00:08:39.440" class="transcript_line"> importance that I place on the levels is not wholly historical. It&#039;s the fact that</div><div id="00:08:47.360" class="transcript_line"> it can inform our futures globally actually not just locally. I think if we</div><div id="00:08:52.120" class="transcript_line"> take the lessons and our understandings of the pasts on the levels at different</div><div id="00:08:57.800" class="transcript_line"> points in time and we project them forward in the knowledge that the</div><div id="00:09:02.800" class="transcript_line"> current predictions are for continued global sea level rise, temperature rise</div><div id="00:09:10.040" class="transcript_line"> and the commensurate sea level rise that will come with that on a global</div><div id="00:09:16.480" class="transcript_line"> basis then we can look at the way the levels have been affected by sea level</div><div id="00:09:21.120" class="transcript_line"> rise, the coming and going of the high mean water spring tide over time and</div><div id="00:09:32.320" class="transcript_line"> project what that will mean for people on the levels and elsewhere in the</div><div id="00:09:38.080" class="transcript_line"> future because people in the past have had the ability to move in and out of</div><div id="00:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> this landscape. In the Iron Age and before the Neolithic farmers, the Iron</div><div id="00:09:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Age farmers even as far back as the Mesolithic, the Middle Stone Age, people</div><div id="00:09:53.400" class="transcript_line"> moved in and out of the tidal zone if you like and the flood plains of</div><div id="00:10:01.400" class="transcript_line"> the levels. It would be very much a summer grazing area for pastoral farming.</div><div id="00:10:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Very little if any arable, no evidence really for arable, very very localized</div><div id="00:10:13.600" class="transcript_line"> probably places like the higher ground like Goldcliff Island and otherwise on</div><div id="00:10:18.240" class="transcript_line"> the Fen Edge and this is shown again in a landscape sense by the positions of</div><div id="00:10:24.920" class="transcript_line"> the early Norman churches. If you look at the earliest churches in southern</div><div id="00:10:29.640" class="transcript_line"> Monmouthshire they sit along the Fen Edge right on the edge where the level meets</div><div id="00:10:34.600" class="transcript_line"> the rising ground up off the flood plain so you start off with places like</div><div id="00:10:40.360" class="transcript_line"> St. Pierre, Mathen, you move along then Port Scuett right on the edge where</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> the ground starts to rise up off the flood plain. Caldecott again securely</div><div id="00:10:54.760" class="transcript_line"> just up off the water meadows where the castle sits and then you travel along</div><div id="00:11:01.680" class="transcript_line"> to the two rogues again on the very edge. Undie again right on the edge so</div><div id="00:11:08.320" class="transcript_line"> close to the railway line which again was then placed right at the edge on the</div><div id="00:11:11.960" class="transcript_line"> slightly higher rising ground and of course the M4 is even further inland</div><div id="00:11:17.960" class="transcript_line"> but again hugs that higher ground. So people move from the winter grazing on</div><div id="00:11:25.200" class="transcript_line"> the higher land, the less boggy areas down to this very very fertile rich flood</div><div id="00:11:31.960" class="transcript_line"> plain the levels for summer grazing. So you&#039;ve got this transhumance as</div><div id="00:11:39.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s called the movement of livestock and people in and out of the landscape.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> If it floods you move out, if it is dry then you can utilize it</div><div id="00:11:51.720" class="transcript_line"> for grazing. Well the issues we have with the intensification of land use and with</div><div id="00:11:58.560" class="transcript_line"> population rises that people don&#039;t really want to move in and out of areas</div><div id="00:12:03.520" class="transcript_line"> anymore and they economically they&#039;re not able to do so. We&#039;re quite sedentary,</div><div id="00:12:08.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re quite fixed within landscapes and the problem that we have is that the</div><div id="00:12:12.840" class="transcript_line"> landscape of the levels is pretty much fossilized at its ancient levels, Roman</div><div id="00:12:17.680" class="transcript_line"> ground level covered by about half a meter of later clay inundation from</div><div id="00:12:23.600" class="transcript_line"> inundations later on and very little since the land is at a certain level but</div><div id="00:12:29.400" class="transcript_line"> the sea has continued to rise very slowly since the end of the last ice</div><div id="00:12:34.480" class="transcript_line"> age and the current concerns with regard to global warming are that it</div><div id="00:12:40.520" class="transcript_line"> seems to be rising more quickly now since the industrial age, the dawn of</div><div id="00:12:47.200" class="transcript_line"> the industrial age then if the land stays at the same level but sea level</div><div id="00:12:53.360" class="transcript_line"> and high tides are rising higher and higher you become more and more reliant</div><div id="00:12:57.640" class="transcript_line"> upon sea defenses until you can&#039;t rely on them anymore because eventually it</div><div id="00:13:02.600" class="transcript_line"> might catch up with them. If you have a failure of a low sea defense it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> that catastrophic usually the water will flood in it will flow back out again</div><div id="00:13:14.680" class="transcript_line"> but if you build astronomically high sea defenses and there&#039;s a there&#039;s a failure</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> of the sea defense then it can be quite catastrophic because then you start to</div><div id="00:13:23.880" class="transcript_line"> get more tsunami like waves that sweep across the landscape so the idea of just</div><div id="00:13:30.600" class="transcript_line"> raising sea walls ever higher is probably not the way to approach any</div><div id="00:13:35.800" class="transcript_line"> future sea level rise so I think if we take lessons from the past and look at</div><div id="00:13:39.880" class="transcript_line"> when the levels were first defended when they were first first attempts at</div><div id="00:13:44.360" class="transcript_line"> drainage were made on a large scale to improve the land and then to defend it</div><div id="00:13:50.160" class="transcript_line"> from the sea we can start to look at what the futures may be for different</div><div id="00:13:55.020" class="transcript_line"> areas of the levels if the current trend for sea level rise continues.</div><div id="00:14:01.460" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the very first piece of what first seen you uncovered as a youngster in an archaeological table?</div><div id="00:14:12.420" class="transcript_line"> Well trust you we were very lucky it was a medieval manor house and we were</div><div id="00:14:18.300" class="transcript_line"> just we were in the ditch around it so that&#039;s where they just threw all</div><div id="00:14:21.860" class="transcript_line"> their refuse all their rubbish so huge amounts of wonderful pottery quite late</div><div id="00:14:26.980" class="transcript_line"> actually 17th century we do haven&#039;t got down to the medieval layers and so</div><div id="00:14:30.900" class="transcript_line"> beautiful glazes beautiful roulette patterns on these pots so it was quite</div><div id="00:14:38.580" class="transcript_line"> beautiful material that helps it wasn&#039;t just boring old grey broken potsherds so</div><div id="00:14:45.540" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think my first ever finds were were actually were the 17th 18th century</div><div id="00:14:53.980" class="transcript_line"> pottery in abundance at Trostrie.</div><div id="00:14:56.380" class="transcript_line"> But what did that feel like and were you aware then of the age?</div><div id="00:14:59.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it felt like an immediate sort of one step removed contact with the past</div><div id="00:15:08.380" class="transcript_line"> because the hand that dropped it in there it hadn&#039;t moved until the hand</div><div id="00:15:13.900" class="transcript_line"> removed it so you do feel that you&#039;re the first person to have handled</div><div id="00:15:18.820" class="transcript_line"> something since it was last handled then you wonder how it was deposited who</div><div id="00:15:24.100" class="transcript_line"> went through the process of depositing it and what their thoughts may have been</div><div id="00:15:28.580" class="transcript_line"> probably thoughtlessly just just getting rid of as much rubbish as they can into</div><div id="00:15:32.260" class="transcript_line"> the ditch they had their own cares and worries and then probably diseases so it</div><div id="00:15:39.820" class="transcript_line"> opens up a whole world of possibilities as to what the back story for that tiny</div><div id="00:15:49.820" class="transcript_line"> little pot should might have been how was it broken in the first place and</div><div id="00:15:53.940" class="transcript_line"> where on earth is the rest of it because it&#039;s so common that you&#039;ll find one</div><div id="00:15:57.980" class="transcript_line"> piece of a pot if I break something in the kitchen I sweep it all up and I</div><div id="00:16:02.740" class="transcript_line"> deposit it together but somehow over time things often don&#039;t find their way</div><div id="00:16:07.660" class="transcript_line"> into the ground as parts of the whole deposited together often you just find</div><div id="00:16:12.620" class="transcript_line"> one part and just make you wonder what happened to the rest of it hasn&#039;t turned</div><div id="00:16:16.540" class="transcript_line"> to dust so it&#039;s all out there somewhere it&#039;s just there waiting to be found</div><div id="00:16:27.340" class="transcript_line"> I often think when I pass an old stone wall that&#039;s hidden in off the track that</div><div id="00:16:32.100" class="transcript_line"> who who made that wall where what were their lives like it&#039;s lovely to hear you</div><div id="00:16:36.540" class="transcript_line"> describe that what about your first piece of Roman wear that will certainly</div><div id="00:16:42.220" class="transcript_line"> have been at car went I was quite early on my first couple of years there we</div><div id="00:16:50.220" class="transcript_line"> had wonderful concrete floors within the

id="00:17:34.820" class="transcript_line"> was not actually an object at all it was a hole in the ground a circular hole in</div><div id="00:17:40.820" class="transcript_line"> the ground in the middle of the Basilica so between the two colonnades of what</div><div id="00:17:46.260" class="transcript_line"> would have looked like a modern Cathedral really with two aisles and a</div><div id="00:17:51.300" class="transcript_line"> knave down the middle it would have stood at least 15 meters high very very</div><div id="00:17:55.580" class="transcript_line"> tall building a huge I&#039;ll haul and in the middle in the foundation levels the</div><div id="00:18:03.620" class="transcript_line"> the the natural soil was a hole with an X shaped slot that settled or being cut</div><div id="00:18:13.180" class="transcript_line"> down into the clay and I just dug what was there and that&#039;s what it produced a</div><div id="00:18:18.340" class="transcript_line"> hole like a with an X a big X in the ground I didn&#039;t know what it was but the</div><div id="00:18:23.780" class="transcript_line"> director knew immediately what it was because one had been found at London and</div><div id="00:18:27.580" class="transcript_line"> it was the impression in the soil that had been left by the crane that the</div><div id="00:18:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Romans had used to raise the column drums on top to build the colonnade so</div><div id="00:18:40.180" class="transcript_line"> because he knew now where the crane sat in the middle to do the two columns on</div><div id="00:18:46.600" class="transcript_line"> either side he knew where the columns were as they&#039;d gone and because he knew</div><div id="00:18:52.080" class="transcript_line"> the spacing from the end wall of where that those columns were because of the</div><div id="00:18:56.440" class="transcript_line"> position of the crane he could tell where the columns were how many they were</div><div id="00:19:01.520" class="transcript_line"> how equally spaced they were and because of the way Roman</div><div id="00:19:06.640" class="transcript_line"> architecture works he could then calculate the height of the building so</div><div id="00:19:10.160" class="transcript_line"> it became apparent to me very early on it&#039;s not a treasure hunt for the staff</div><div id="00:19:15.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s about the information that we can gain through this process so my best</div><div id="00:19:19.720" class="transcript_line"> discovery in many ways or certainly one of the best was was not an object at all</div><div id="00:19:27.120" class="transcript_line"> it was just a shape in the soil in the ground a slightly different colored soil</div><div id="00:19:32.440" class="transcript_line"> with a slightly different texture that we were able to follow the shape of and</div><div id="00:19:37.440" class="transcript_line"> it gave us the

id="00:20:06.080" class="transcript_line"> by future generations it&#039;s just a passing moment in time that just happened</div><div id="00:20:12.520" class="transcript_line"> to get fossilized in the soil imprint and gave us information that we could</div><div id="00:20:17.800" class="transcript_line"> release from the ground over nearly 2,000 years later</div><div id="00:20:23.960" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve also got a passion for the Roman period that&#039;s obvious but where do you</div><div id="00:20:34.600" class="transcript_line"> see and how do you see the Roman

class="transcript_line"> Augustine that said that the world is like a book and those that don&#039;t travel</div><div id="00:20:52.320" class="transcript_line"> only read one page now that&#039;s true if you don&#039;t travel geographically but</div><div id="00:20:59.320" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s true if you don&#039;t travel in time so if I only studied the Roman period I</div><div id="00:21:03.640" class="transcript_line"> probably wouldn&#039;t understand it at all because they stand on the shoulders of</div><div id="00:21:07.480" class="transcript_line"> every previous generation and then there are memories of how things were in the</div><div id="00:21:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Roman period that shape all future generations including today because</div><div id="00:21:16.520" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re still using their alphabet and Latin is hugely important in Welsh and</div><div id="00:21:20.840" class="transcript_line"> English so on the levels we&#039;ve got evidence that Roman sea level was much</div><div id="00:21:31.080" class="transcript_line"> lower than it is today nearly 1.8 meters lower on any one given tide will</div><div id="00:21:37.640" class="transcript_line"> be like for like about one and three quarter meters lower that&#039;s because as</div><div id="00:21:43.460" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve come out of the last ice age sea level has slowed down it&#039;s rising over</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> time but it&#039;s still rising ever so slightly and there are other sorts of</div><div id="00:21:55.920" class="transcript_line"> geological impacts in Britain such as isostatic rebound and the fact that the</div><div id="00:22:00.640" class="transcript_line"> east of Britain is slightly tipping in the West rising up ever so slightly but</div><div id="00:22:04.640" class="transcript_line"> nonetheless in the Severnestuary and here at Cullien we&#039;re about 1.7 meters</div><div id="00:22:10.840" class="transcript_line"> higher at any high tide today than it will have been in the past so if you</div><div id="00:22:16.240" class="transcript_line"> take off that 1.7 meters across the levels actually most tides would never</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> have flooded and you would need a sea wall on the levels so we start to</div><div id="00:22:27.080" class="transcript_line"> question how old the sea defenses are likely to be and to have been but what</div><div id="00:22:33.120" class="transcript_line"> we can find when we dig down on the levels is that all Roman land surfaces</div><div id="00:22:38.880" class="transcript_line"> are covered by later inundations which left around half a meter or so to a</div><div id="00:22:45.540" class="transcript_line"> meter of the gray heavy alluvium the gray clay from the estuary that you can</div><div id="00:22:53.960" class="transcript_line"> see beneath the sea wall anywhere where there&#039;s no seagrass growing and once</div><div id="00:23:02.080" class="transcript_line"> you get below that half a meter or so you get to the old Roman land surfaces</div><div id="00:23:07.600" class="transcript_line"> but you don&#039;t get that many field systems there are localized field</div><div id="00:23:12.560" class="transcript_line"> systems around Nash water treatment works at Goldcliff and they tend to have</div><div id="00:23:17.760" class="transcript_line"> been formed where the Romans cut ditches and when you cut a ditch you get</div><div id="00:23:23.920" class="transcript_line"> a bank that goes with it and they form little enclosures or fields but the</div><div id="00:23:30.040" class="transcript_line"> banks aren&#039;t serious attempts at sea walls they might protect from the odd</div><div id="00:23:34.960" class="transcript_line"> couple of feet inundation but then they&#039;re not they&#039;re not a continuous sea</div><div id="00:23:39.840" class="transcript_line"> wall as we would understand it so the focus for them was probably to just</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> improve the grazing by draining or speeding drainage into the adjacent</div><div id="00:23:53.040" class="transcript_line"> ditches and to take the water away and they appear to have been involved in</div><div id="00:23:58.600" class="transcript_line"> some serious engineering works because one of the most important Roman finds</div><div id="00:24:02.280" class="transcript_line"> from the grant levels was found off Goldcliff Point at Goldcliff Pill on the</div><div id="00:24:09.400" class="transcript_line"> edge of the pill and it&#039;s a lius limestone flat slab about two to three</div><div id="00:24:19.840" class="transcript_line"> feet in height and it&#039;s inscribed in Latin probably in the second or third</div><div id="00:24:26.360" class="transcript_line"> centuries AD and it says the century of Statorius Maximus of the first cohort so</div><div id="00:24:38.200" class="transcript_line"> from this legion at Caillean the second Augustine legion the soldiers of the</div><div id="00:24:45.360" class="transcript_line"> century under the century in Statorius Maximus constructed thirty three and a</div><div id="00:24:51.760" class="transcript_line"> half paces of something that&#039;s all it says the interesting thing about the</div><div id="00:24:57.320" class="transcript_line"> stone is it&#039;s a very thin slab and the bottom half has not been inscribed so it</div><div id="00:25:05.920" class="transcript_line"> the bottom half would have been set in the ground and it would have stood like a</div><div id="00:25:09.280" class="transcript_line"> little headstone on the probably an earthwork that had been constructed now</div><div id="00:25:15.680" class="transcript_line"> that stone is intriguing because it shows that the Roman army is involved in</div><div id="00:25:22.160" class="transcript_line"> an engineering work of some kind construction work at Goldcliff on the</div><div id="00:25:28.240" class="transcript_line"> levels the stone was found in the estuary and clay beyond the present sea</div><div id="00:25:35.040" class="transcript_line"> war but we know that the sea had taken huge tracts of land even within recent</div><div id="00:25:40.800" class="transcript_line"> centuries at Goldcliff so it would have been on land probably when it when it</div><div id="00:25:45.680" class="transcript_line"> when it was set up and it&#039;s now just beyond the current sea wall which again</div><div id="00:25:49.680" class="transcript_line"> tells us something about land loss or gain in the estuary over time and the</div><div id="00:25:56.560" class="transcript_line"> fact that they&#039;re building thirty three and a half paces is intriguing because</div><div id="00:25:59.960" class="transcript_line"> the first cohort has double strength century so you could have anything from</div><div id="00:26:03.760" class="transcript_line"> the usual 80 men in the century up to 160 just building thirty three and a</div><div id="00:26:08.440" class="transcript_line"> half pay or constructing or digging thirty three and a half paces of</div><div id="00:26:12.080" class="transcript_line"> something that&#039;s not very long actually for 80 to 160 men to be working on just</div><div id="00:26:17.960" class="transcript_line"> thirty three and a half paces it then makes us think that because they&#039;ve</div><div id="00:26:22.560" class="transcript_line"> divvied it up in thirty three and a half paces the likelihood is that it&#039;s one</div><div id="00:26:27.920" class="transcript_line"> third of something that&#039;s a hundred paces because they tend to think in</div><div id="00:26:33.640" class="transcript_line"> centuries and that sort of way of thinking so now you you&#039;re talking</div><div id="00:26:39.560" class="transcript_line"> anything up to sort of 300 odd men working on just a hundred paces of</div><div id="00:26:47.200" class="transcript_line"> somethings could be quite an important engineering work of some kind and we</div><div id="00:26:55.160" class="transcript_line"> have no sense of what this could be other than the fact that Goldcliff</div><div id="00:26:58.880" class="transcript_line"> pill merrily flows by it and the evidence from Martin Bell&#039;s work at</div><div id="00:27:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Goldcliff on the Iron Age site suggests that there was no Goldcliff pill there</div><div id="00:27:09.400" class="transcript_line"> in the Iron Age so the proximity of this stone to the Goldcliff pill the huge</div><div id="00:27:15.680" class="transcript_line"> quite significant water course that now flows out into the estuary at that point</div><div id="00:27:20.720" class="transcript_line"> might suggest that it&#039;s actually a Roman construction that they actually</div><div id="00:27:25.440" class="transcript_line"> constructed Goldcliff pill itself as a drainage ditch to drain a large part of</div><div id="00:27:32.840" class="transcript_line"> the levels to improve the grazing either for their cattle for their</div><div id="00:27:40.560" class="transcript_line"> livestock or that they were set to work down there because this was the legion</div><div id="00:27:48.480" class="transcript_line"> that helped to build Hadrian&#039;s Wall this was the legion although this was their</div><div id="00:27:53.600" class="transcript_line"> base they many of them many cohorts were sent up to the north they also built the</div><div id="00:27:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Antonine Wall with other legionary cohorts from other legions so when</div><div id="00:28:06.160" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not up there constructing engineering works like Hadrian&#039;s Wall or</div><div id="00:28:11.840" class="transcript_line"> the Antonine Wall a what you do with them to stop them causing trouble and</div><div id="00:28:17.880" class="transcript_line"> B how do you keep them trained and ready for that type of engineering work if</div><div id="00:28:23.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got nothing else to do and perhaps I just wonder whether they were</div><div id="00:28:28.040" class="transcript_line"> sent to the levels not through necessity necessarily but to train them and to</div><div id="00:28:34.240" class="transcript_line"> keep them occupied whilst they&#039;re back at base here at Cullion and they</div><div id="00:28:40.480" class="transcript_line"> can be usefully employed in work that can benefit the legion and the local</div><div id="00:28:48.400" class="transcript_line"> kivitas the local city state that&#039;s entered at Clowend and I suspect that&#039;s</div><div id="00:28:54.680" class="transcript_line"> what they&#039;re doing and so when we see those little field systems or</div><div id="00:28:59.200" class="transcript_line"> enclosures or drainage ditches at Nash when we see them at Goldcliff when we</div><div id="00:29:05.880" class="transcript_line"> see the the pill and the evidence from the Goldcliff stone these seem to be</div><div id="00:29:10.560" class="transcript_line"> the first attempts at not necessarily reclaiming the levels from the sea but</div><div id="00:29:18.640" class="transcript_line"> enhancing their grazing potential for more of the the the annual cycle for</div><div id="00:29:24.640" class="transcript_line"> more more of the more of the year so I think it&#039;s when it&#039;s the Roman period</div><div id="00:29:29.520" class="transcript_line"> when we start to see if you like intensification a serious attempt to</div><div id="00:29:33.640" class="transcript_line"> harness the levels for more of the year rather than the old system of moving</div><div id="00:29:40.040" class="transcript_line"> with the seasons in and out of the levels from the Fenedge down onto the</div><div id="00:29:45.940" class="transcript_line"> rich grazing of the Fagmites Reeds and the the the the very marshy area that it</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> would have been prior to the Roman enhancements.</div><div id="00:29:58.400" class="transcript_line"> Anecdotally, do you talk to people on the levels and they&#039;ll say oh the rene</div><div id="00:30:02.760" class="transcript_line"> system is all Roman? No the existing rene system is largely set in the alluvium</div><div id="00:30:11.680" class="transcript_line"> that is post-roman we know that that seals the Roman landscape underneath.</div><div id="00:30:17.480" class="transcript_line"> The two big questions are there are some major waterways the White Wall,</div><div id="00:30:24.200" class="transcript_line"> the Black Wall that come down and the Monk&#039;s Ditch and the question at the</div><div id="00:30:29.640" class="transcript_line"> moment is just how old are they? We know that the monasteries maintained them</div><div id="00:30:34.880" class="transcript_line"> certainly, hence the names, but it is very very possible that they have Roman</div><div id="00:30:41.240" class="transcript_line"> origins and we just don&#039;t know for certain yet because we don&#039;t have the</div><div id="00:30:48.060" class="transcript_line"> date in evidence to prove whether their origins lie in the Roman period but the</div><div id="00:30:56.280" class="transcript_line"> Romans certainly begin the process that either created them or led to led</div><div id="00:31:06.320" class="transcript_line"> sequentially to their creation. My suspicion is that the Romans were</div><div id="00:31:10.760" class="transcript_line"> involved in some way in the proto White Wall, Black Wall and Eve and others</div><div id="00:31:18.360" class="transcript_line"> probably in between in that we start to see environmental changes that can be</div><div id="00:31:25.640" class="transcript_line"> explained in the Roman period and later Roman period by land improvement if you</div><div id="00:31:34.880" class="transcript_line"> like. So we&#039;ve seen that with the Goldcliffe stone so it&#039;s just the extent</div><div id="00:31:39.800" class="transcript_line"> of it and which particular parts of it but then that system is then it becomes</div><div id="00:31:48.880" class="transcript_line"> those particular renes, those primary arteries if you like within the</div><div id="00:31:54.720" class="transcript_line"> system. In the early medieval period just after the Roman period they start</div><div id="00:31:59.040" class="transcript_line"> to become really important boundaries between land holdings so it suggests</div><div id="00:32:04.200" class="transcript_line"> they have antiquity that they go back a long way in time. So the</div><div id="00:32:09.600" class="transcript_line"> suspicion is yes at the moment that the major renes might have had Roman</div><div id="00:32:16.040" class="transcript_line"> origins but not necessarily in exactly the same form that they are today but</div><div id="00:32:20.600" class="transcript_line"> those will have been either maintained or reconstructed in their sort of</div><div id="00:32:27.920" class="transcript_line"> more modern formats by later ages. Certainly the monastic holdings had an</div><div id="00:32:36.720" class="transcript_line"> important part to play in that hence Monk&#039;s Ditch because any lands that they</div><div id="00:32:41.600" class="transcript_line"> could reclaim from the sea they could keep so there was a huge benefit as a</div><div id="00:32:46.560" class="transcript_line"> land grab on if you like if you can if you can defend land from the sea it&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:51.080" class="transcript_line"> yours so it&#039;s the local lords of manners had an interest in doing what they</div><div id="00:33:02.040" class="transcript_line"> could to improve their lands as best they could and reclaim as many</div><div id="00:33:06.840" class="transcript_line"> permanently from the sea as they possibly could. By medieval times</div><div id="00:33:10.520" class="transcript_line"> obviously sea level has risen and then you start to need to defend then so you</div><div id="00:33:14.400" class="transcript_line"> get the wall being built and it&#039;s not understood. Maiga means wall, Magwa</div><div id="00:33:19.960" class="transcript_line"> means wall and it&#039;s not fully understood whether that relates to just some old</div><div id="00:33:24.280" class="transcript_line"> archaeological walls of a Roman villa somewhere or whether it actually refers</div><div id="00:33:28.600" class="transcript_line"> to white wall or whether it might actually refer to the sea wall itself</div><div id="00:33:32.920" class="transcript_line"> because it actually stops at Maiga and Deerogget and Caldecott weren&#039;t</div><div id="00:33:37.440" class="transcript_line"> defended they were not held by the monasteries and defense from the sea</div><div id="00:33:42.360" class="transcript_line"> certainly on the Caldecott moor and in Rogget actually came very very late in</div><div id="00:33:48.520" class="transcript_line"> the 19th century whereas Maiga and along to Goldcliff you can see it from the</div><div id="00:33:56.480" class="transcript_line"> 12th century so you know there&#039;s a huge difference in different places and one</div><div id="00:34:01.880" class="transcript_line"> of the the wonderful places on the levels is Moorgate in Undy because it&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:07.240" class="transcript_line"> a medieval house it doesn&#039;t look like it from the road but it is inside it&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:12.360" class="transcript_line"> medieval or at least Tudor, late medieval on the inside and the name of it it</div><div id="00:34:22.040" class="transcript_line"> sums up its geographical location it was the Moorgate because that was the</div><div id="00:34:28.360" class="transcript_line"> start of the moor on the undefended levels once you get beyond Maiga so the</div><div id="00:34:36.720" class="transcript_line"> place names are memories in often of what was once there.</div><div id="00:34:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Reidwick, the Redwick, the dairy farm in the reeds reminds us it was mainly</div><div id="00:34:47.160" class="transcript_line"> pastoral, dairy farm is cattle is not arable down there and then we move along</div><div id="00:34:56.400" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got where I grew up Caldecott which is a very interesting</div><div id="00:35:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Anglo-Saxon place name uncommon in Wales because the part of Wales where</div><div id="00:35:09.200" class="transcript_line"> Caldecott lies on the Gwent level was anglicized very very early on because it</div><div id="00:35:13.120"

class="transcript_line"> Caldecott is actually an Anglo-Saxon name and there were about 120 Caldecott&#039;s in</div><div id="00:35:33.600" class="transcript_line"> England and they center on the

Have you done that?</div><div id="00:38:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Well I was just interested in the link between Latin and Welsh and the way that you described the fact that the Welsh language or Celtic language whatever it was has retreated in that area fairly early on.</div><div id="00:38:57.080" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s quite significant because in Welsh particularly Welsh place names, eddow,</div><div id="00:39:06.760" class="transcript_line"> farm names and so on describe very closely geographical features and so so</div><div id="00:39:13.240"

Goldcliff you see a completely</div><div id="00:39:42.260" class="transcript_line"> different field system that was pointed out by Stephen Rippon at Exeter and you</div><div id="00:39:48.780" class="transcript_line"> start to get Welsh place names at land holdings that look like the Welsh system</div><div id="00:39:56.020" class="transcript_line"> where inheritance was split equally between the areas etc and where the</div><div id="00:40:02.180" class="transcript_line"> the land at the fields are not grouped together necessarily as whole farms but</div><div id="00:40:06.820" class="transcript_line"> spread around a little bit more and a bit more higgledy-piggledy if you like</div><div id="00:40:10.940" class="transcript_line"> now in the east area so the Mathen level and Roggetmore and along to</div><div id="00:40:20.300" class="transcript_line"> Magor that were early Norman plantations if you like and it&#039;s thought that</div><div id="00:40:25.580" class="transcript_line"> Whitsun was probably a Norman land claim for example you you get English</div><div id="00:40:36.580" class="transcript_line"> descriptions of the landscape so you get summer lees the summer pastures the</div><div id="00:40:42.860" class="transcript_line"> summer meadows lees and the Lee and so the summer lease or even summertime in</div><div id="00:40:49.900" class="transcript_line"> Newport the summer grazing again so again pastoral again it&#039;s cattle on the</div><div id="00:40:54.460" class="transcript_line"> whole sheep as well but mainly cattle I should say I keep harking back to cattle</div><div id="00:40:59.260" class="transcript_line"> because when you look at the artwork from the Iron Age Roman boundary they&#039;re</div><div id="00:41:04.820" class="transcript_line"> fixated on cattle they love their escutcheons and mounts that are ox heads</div><div id="00:41:10.260" class="transcript_line"> and that sort of thing so I get a very strong sense that wealth may have been</div><div id="00:41:15.740" class="transcript_line"> considered in terms of your your cattle holding at the time you know we might</div><div id="00:41:21.580" class="transcript_line"> look at somebody&#039;s car or even the motor what version of a mobile phone they</div><div id="00:41:26.780" class="transcript_line"> might be brandishing I think at that time in this part of the world you might</div><div id="00:41:31.520" class="transcript_line"> have been judged on your cattle basically you&#039;re the size of your ranching</div><div id="00:41:39.160" class="transcript_line"> and we are talking ranching we&#039;re not looking at fields here with hedgerows</div><div id="00:41:43.160" class="transcript_line"> that comes later on it is a sort of herding proper ranching in the sort of</div><div id="00:41:48.640" class="transcript_line"> American sense so on the whole but then you need enclosures to bring them in so</div><div id="00:41:54.880" class="transcript_line"> there are sort of enclosures that are created what we would see as fields but</div><div id="00:41:58.800" class="transcript_line"> not the whole landscape there are fields that just planted groups of</div><div id="00:42:03.880" class="transcript_line"> fields planted here and there within the landscape rather than a whole</div><div id="00:42:06.520" class="transcript_line"> landscape fields once you get to the other side of monk stitching start to</div><div id="00:42:11.740" class="transcript_line"> change and your summer leases and your your your summer grazing start to become</div><div id="00:42:17.220" class="transcript_line"> Mardis which again one of the senses in Welsh of a Mardie is is the summer</div><div id="00:42:26.320" class="transcript_line"> grazing and names like tremor first so you&#039;ve got these these settlements that</div><div id="00:42:34.200" class="transcript_line"> again are down on the fence but but they&#039;re they&#039;re they&#039;re named in Welsh</div><div id="00:42:38.680" class="transcript_line"> so this naming seems to have solidified around you know around the time of the</div><div id="00:42:47.280" class="transcript_line"> coming of the norm and some of the names stick from pre-norman times some of them</div><div id="00:42:51.440" class="transcript_line"> are new depending on the land holdings but they the main difference that gives</div><div id="00:42:56.320" class="transcript_line"> us this boundary about along the line of the monk stitch really it starts to</div><div id="00:43:00.560" class="transcript_line"> solidify around the time of the coming of the Normans so whatever you were</div><div id="00:43:06.200" class="transcript_line"> calling it by then seems to have largely stuck but it gives us again that that</div><div id="00:43:15.280" class="transcript_line"> not deliberate but this this this circumstantial fossilization of a</div><div id="00:43:21.440" class="transcript_line"> moment in time where you can see a boundary where the anglicized influence</div><div id="00:43:27.160" class="transcript_line"> has come and this is Anglo-Norman but again it&#039;s the the the Anglo-Norman</div><div id="00:43:32.040" class="transcript_line"> influence has got so far with land holdings and indeed the doomsday</div><div id="00:43:36.960" class="transcript_line"> holdings in this part of the world that that mention who holds what land as far</div><div id="00:43:43.040" class="transcript_line"> as Carleion were very very fortunate that the Caldecott level was included in</div><div id="00:43:48.840" class="transcript_line"> doomsday is the most westerly entry within it the rest of Wales wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:43:53.480" class="transcript_line"> Norman so isn&#039;t in doomsday they speak of the hardwicks and we&#039;ve got hardwick</div><div id="00:44:00.280" class="transcript_line"> at chapstone and elsewhere still in the place names hardwicks are dairy farms</div><div id="00:44:04.160" class="transcript_line"> again so it&#039;s very very very clear what&#039;s going on here</div><div id="00:44:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Caldecott&#039;s got plows by then because it&#039;s mentioned they&#039;re all taxed</div><div id="00:44:15.480" class="transcript_line"> because the Norman view of the feudal system was that all land in Britain has</div><div id="00:44:21.520" class="transcript_line"> one landowner it&#039;s the king and it&#039;s doomsday and this is his terrier of his</div><div id="00:44:26.120" class="transcript_line"> tenants so even the lords and the you know the the the sheriffs everybody</div><div id="00:44:32.040" class="transcript_line"> beneath him they&#039;re all tenants of the king so although we&#039;d look up to them as</div><div id="00:44:36.920" class="transcript_line"> the top of the the top branches of the tree they&#039;re not they still they&#039;re</div><div id="00:44:43.120" class="transcript_line"> still tenants of the king and he&#039;s got this list now of what&#039;s owed to him by</div><div id="00:44:49.040" class="transcript_line"> his tenants for for that those lands their mills their fisheries etc their</div><div id="00:44:55.480" class="transcript_line"> plows how many people they&#039;re working on those farms on the hardwicks etc and</div><div id="00:45:01.240" class="transcript_line"> then whatever profit they can make over and above that is obviously theirs</div><div id="00:45:06.440" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s very clear from those early documents how the landscape certainly</div><div id="00:45:13.280" class="transcript_line"> in the east is starting to shape up as a more intensively managed landscape but</div><div id="00:45:21.280" class="transcript_line"> still along the lines of that time of what it probably was in the Roman</div><div id="00:45:24.840" class="transcript_line"> period and beyond they just had in more and more land improvement mechanisms</div><div id="00:45:31.080" class="transcript_line"> through drainage and then eventually through to sea defense to to the mix to</div><div id="00:45:36.800" class="transcript_line"> further defend the land problem is that the land behind is now fossilized behind</div><div id="00:45:43.120" class="transcript_line"> those medieval sea walls but the sea is still rising behind it and of course many</div><div id="00:45:50.400" class="transcript_line"> of our great cities were and urban conurbations were trading ports and ports</div><div id="00:45:57.000" class="transcript_line"> by definition at sea level but many of them have early foundation dates in the</div><div id="00:46:03.040" class="transcript_line"> Roman period like Cullian or in medieval times like Newport Cardiff and Roman</div><div id="00:46:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff and Roman Carmarthens etc but where development was at the medieval</div><div id="00:46:17.360" class="transcript_line"> or Roman high tide mark and high and dry it wouldn&#039;t necessarily be today</div><div id="00:46:23.960" class="transcript_line"> because of sea level rise so there are lessons I think to be learned for future</div><div id="00:46:29.840" class="transcript_line"> generations in terms of how we manage our responses to climate change and</div><div id="00:46:34.800" class="transcript_line"> environmental change and for the levels perhaps that informs us in terms of the</div><div id="00:46:40.640" class="transcript_line"> fact that the only response really in the past was to move in and out of those</div><div id="00:46:44.640" class="transcript_line"> areas so like a canoe we&#039;re going to find out that just standing there and</div><div id="00:46:50.040" class="transcript_line"> commanding the sea to behave is not going to work and it might be necessary</div><div id="00:46:55.520" class="transcript_line"> to work out a rationale and a methodology for allowing the sea to take</div><div id="00:47:04.800" class="transcript_line"> any land that it requires and to be able to move in and out of the landscape as</div><div id="00:47:09.960" class="transcript_line"> change continues because the one norm is change people tend to shy away from it</div><div id="00:47:17.360" class="transcript_line"> but the one fact archaeologically and environmentally is change so we need to</div><div id="00:47:23.680" class="transcript_line"> learn the lessons from the past to inform the future</div><div id="00:47:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Talking about the estuary, I&#039;ve spoken to a few people who have been out there and follow the tide date</div><div id="00:47:35.040" class="transcript_line"> black rock fishery for example they&#039;re always finding clay pipes and musket balls etc</div><div id="00:47:40.240" class="transcript_line"> and could you tell us about your fishing basket find</div><div id="00:47:46.400" class="transcript_line"> the context around that and any other work you&#039;ve done on it?</div><div id="00:47:49.400" class="transcript_line"> yeah I was a student in conservation at Cardiff University in the early 90s and</div><div id="00:47:56.960" class="transcript_line"> we had to go to a museum for eight weeks each summer to gain on the job</div><div id="00:48:08.160" class="transcript_line"> vocational experience as an internship and because of my great interest in the</div><div id="00:48:18.160" class="transcript_line"> geographical area around Newport and the levels I chose one placement at Newport</div><div id="00:48:24.240" class="transcript_line"> Museum and Art Gallery working under the great Kate Hunter there the head</div><div id="00:48:31.280" class="transcript_line"> conservator at the time and during my internship Nigel Nailing from the</div><div id="00:48:40.040" class="transcript_line"> University of Lampeter was working out on the mega level beyond the sea wall</div><div id="00:48:48.680" class="transcript_line"> surveying mainly surveying fish traps etc that had been first discovered and</div><div id="00:48:55.280" class="transcript_line"> highlighted in the studies that had been undertaken in advance of the</div><div id="00:48:59.320" class="transcript_line"> construction of the second seven crossings so they looked at environmental</div><div id="00:49:02.880" class="transcript_line"> impact before its construction and archaeological impact if it was going to</div><div id="00:49:08.080" class="transcript_line"> destroy archaeology along its path then they were able to record it before</div><div id="00:49:14.240" class="transcript_line"> destruction or remove it they looked either side as well because the</div><div id="00:49:18.800" class="transcript_line"> construction process could start to change the way the estuary maybe swirled</div><div id="00:49:24.160" class="transcript_line"> around and you know scoured or what have you and a fish trap was noted at</div><div id="00:49:31.400" class="transcript_line"> mega that had been half sectioned by the tide naturally by the tide which</div><div id="00:49:38.080" class="transcript_line"> enabled the insides to be seen where you&#039;ve got a kind of non return valve a</div><div id="00:49:42.600" class="transcript_line"> cone shaped internal wicker structure that prevents the fish can swim down</div><div id="00:49:50.760" class="transcript_line"> into the trap but they find it hard to get past the funnel back out again and</div><div id="00:49:56.400" class="transcript_line"> because this had been half sectioned naturally by the tide it was a</div><div id="00:50:00.440" class="transcript_line"> beautiful example that could be used for teaching of how these things actually</div><div id="00:50:04.680" class="transcript_line"> work because when you recreate them you can&#039;t see the insides because it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:50:09.240" class="transcript_line"> round wicker basket so it was being destroyed by the tide which was scouring</div><div id="00:50:18.000" class="transcript_line"> it away so it made a perfect project for an undergraduate student because if we</div><div id="00:50:23.640" class="transcript_line"> were successful in lifting it Newport Museum would get a 12th or 13th century</div><div id="00:50:28.880" class="transcript_line"> original fishing trap from the estuary that would be an excellent display and</div><div id="00:50:35.200" class="transcript_line"> teaching resource but if we failed it was going to be destroyed by the sea</div><div id="00:50:41.120" class="transcript_line"> anyway so it wasn&#039;t really a major part of the project and there were no funds</div><div id="00:50:46.280" class="transcript_line"> available as usual story but we had some old casting bandage that&#039;s used for</div><div id="00:50:52.480" class="transcript_line"> broken arms or broken legs and the sell by date had long gone so again if it was</div><div id="00:51:00.560" class="transcript_line"> kind of I think it was a polyurethane that reacted on contact with moist air</div><div id="00:51:04.960" class="transcript_line"> ideal for the levels so if it hadn&#039;t gone off we&#039;re going to use up this</div><div id="00:51:09.280" class="transcript_line"> stuff it was a free fish trap if we could get it out so I was sent out there</div><div id="00:51:13.360" class="transcript_line"> with a mud sled and given some help and we excavated around the thing we found</div><div id="00:51:19.120" class="transcript_line"> the stake which was lifted with it that originally been used to tether it to</div><div id="00:51:25.760" class="transcript_line"> hold it in in the estuarine mud and it and its stake were excavated around to</div><div id="00:51:32.960" class="transcript_line"> leave them on a pedestal and that&#039;s all we could achieve in the first tide</div><div id="00:51:37.400" class="transcript_line"> because that part of the level it&#039;s very very shallow inclined from the</div><div id="00:51:45.760" class="transcript_line"> fan edge down from the sea wall down onto the gravels beyond the mud but the</div><div id="00:51:51.640" class="transcript_line"> mud is very thick it&#039;s about two feet thick and so the tide comes in quicker</div><div id="00:51:57.120" class="transcript_line"> there at mega then it&#039;s possible for a man to run on land not alone get across</div><div id="00:52:01.920" class="transcript_line"> that mud so if you get trapped by the tide that&#039;s it out there you can&#039;t get</div><div id="00:52:06.120" class="transcript_line"> back so we had a very small window of opportunity to excavate so we just dug</div><div id="00:52:10.600" class="transcript_line"> around it the first time I placed my trowel down by the side of the</div><div id="00:52:19.840" class="transcript_line"> excavated trap and bandaged the thing round to protect it and then went to get</div><div id="00:52:26.240" class="transcript_line"> my trowel and it just gone and I thought well that&#039;s easy I put it by there I&#039;ll</div><div id="00:52:29.400" class="transcript_line"> just fish around in the mud this slurry that&#039;s out there see if you can find it</div><div id="00:52:33.240" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t feel it anywhere that never did find it so I had to abandon the</div><div id="00:52:37.920" class="transcript_line"> trowel and most archaeologists become attached to their trowel because you</div><div id="00:52:42.640" class="transcript_line"> that was the trowel that dug this or found that and found the funny feature at</div><div id="00:52:47.400" class="transcript_line"> Coend so I&#039;d lost this trowel and then we returned the next day after the tide</div><div id="00:52:52.600" class="transcript_line"> had gone in gone out and it was low tide again and Lomiel sat on the surface</div><div id="00:52:57.320" class="transcript_line"> proud about 12 feet away probably washed up the estuary and back down again was my</div><div id="00:53:01.480" class="transcript_line"> trowel bright orange because the iron had turned to iron chloride big crystals</div><div id="00:53:08.640" class="transcript_line"> of iron chloride on this work hard and steel trowel and we then dug underneath</div><div id="00:53:16.880" class="transcript_line"> the fish trap slid it up onto a mud sled and it was taken in a minibus off to</div><div id="00:53:22.440" class="transcript_line"> Newport Museum where it slowly was allowed to dry out and then a future</div><div id="00:53:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff intern after my time with Kate excavated down to the fish trap and</div><div id="00:53:33.840" class="transcript_line"> dried it out and stabilized it for display and it&#039;s still displayed now in</div><div id="00:53:38.160" class="transcript_line"> the gallery with a photograph of it in situ the underside that you can&#039;t see in</div><div id="00:53:43.320" class="transcript_line"> the case with the half section fish trap with the sort of non return valve and</div><div

lifting process and it&#039;s resting on the estuarine mud that filled</div><div id="00:54:00.240" class="transcript_line"> it when it was in the estuary all preserved this was a little bit of the</div><div id="00:54:03.800" class="transcript_line"> seven estuary that&#039;s been lifted for display in in Newport Museum and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:54:09.000" class="transcript_line"> quite a rare example of a of a fish trap of that date the trowel then I put away</div><div id="00:54:16.040" class="transcript_line"> and forgot about because it could really be used very well anymore and gone very</div><div id="00:54:20.320" class="transcript_line"> orange and when I last saw it a few years later it had just completely turned</div><div id="00:54:27.480" class="transcript_line"> to orange powder a solid steel forged trowel had just completely corroded away</div><div id="00:54:37.080" class="transcript_line"> and turned to orange powder because of the the aggressive nature of the chlorine</div><div id="00:54:42.560" class="transcript_line"> in the seawater that just destroys ironwork so it just shows how aggressive</div><div id="00:54:48.120" class="transcript_line"> the environment can be for some things metals especially if they don&#039;t become</div><div id="00:54:52.880" class="transcript_line"> concreted they just dissolve away basically out there or can do if not</div><div id="00:55:00.280" class="transcript_line"> buried in in the clay that sort of encapsulates them but other things such</div><div id="00:55:05.120" class="transcript_line"> as organics can become waterlogged in oxygen free environments within that</div><div id="00:55:10.760" class="transcript_line"> heavy clay and they can be preserved for thousands of years and the fish trap</div><div id="00:55:17.240" class="transcript_line"> probably six or seven hundred maybe eight hundred years old perfectly</div><div id="00:55:23.040" class="transcript_line"> preserved because there was no oxygen getting into that mud that could</div><div id="00:55:27.120" class="transcript_line"> actually start the decay process and support the bacteria that would then</div><div id="00:55:30.920" class="transcript_line"> destroy or the fungi that would then destroy the organic wicker basket so</div><div id="00:55:36.600" class="transcript_line"> organics out there the potential for organic preservation is absolutely huge</div><div id="00:55:42.080" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s shown by two of the vessels that have been recovered from out there</div><div id="00:55:47.000" class="transcript_line"> the mega pill wreck a medieval vessel the Barlands farm boat a Roman boat</div><div id="00:55:53.960" class="transcript_line"> that was recovered from the Gwent Euro Park near the motorway junction at mega</div><div id="00:56:01.080" class="transcript_line"> right up on the fan edge there but it probably been sailed up a creek and</div><div id="00:56:06.440" class="transcript_line"> abandoned there but because it was filled with the alluvium that heavy gray</div><div id="00:56:11.600" class="transcript_line"> clay no oxygen got in and the wood was perfectly preserved and of course the</div><div id="00:56:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Newport ship which was similarly filled with the same clay oxygen free</div><div id="00:56:20.080" class="transcript_line"> environment completely preserved the wood the Barlands farm boat was fully</div><div id="00:56:28.000" class="transcript_line"> excavated by Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust no that that was</div><div id="00:56:33.200" class="transcript_line"> whilst I was working I think that was again about the early 90s I think they</div><div id="00:56:41.260" class="transcript_line"> excavated that so probably I was still at university at that time or working at</div><div id="00:56:44.880" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff University that was excavated by Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological</div><div id="00:56:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Trust it&#039;s been fully published it&#039;s got its own volume but it&#039;s it&#039;s now</div><div id="00:56:54.960" class="transcript_line"> preserved at Newport Museum it&#039;s not always on display it depends I think it</div><div id="00:57:01.280" class="transcript_line"> may have been moved for display with the Newport ship it has been displayed in</div><div id="00:57:06.280" class="transcript_line"> John Frost Square in the museum on the Metsanin gallery in the past or elements</div><div id="00:57:10.680" class="transcript_line"> of it have been but the beauty with both the Megapill boat the the the</div><div id="00:57:19.040" class="transcript_line"> medieval one and the Roman Barlands farm boat are that they look like boats as</div><div id="00:57:25.040" class="transcript_line"> does the Newport ship you can see the shape and structure the length and the</div><div id="00:57:29.760" class="transcript_line"> construction methods so Newport sits on one of the most important collections of</div><div id="00:57:36.400" class="transcript_line"> maritime archaeology in the country and I very much look forward to the day when</div><div id="00:57:41.680" class="transcript_line"> it has a maritime museum that can display all of these vessels together</div><div id="00:57:45.400" class="transcript_line"> because there I can&#039;t think of any anywhere better actually to go and see</div><div id="00:57:50.080" class="transcript_line"> the full history from Bronze Age vessels that were planks sewn together</div><div id="00:57:55.280" class="transcript_line"> using withy ties from the willows of the levels right the way through the Roman</div><div id="00:58:03.080" class="transcript_line"> medieval vessels up to very nearly Tudor times</div><div id="00:58:15.080" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah there&#039;s the Goldcliff plank and there&#039;s one from Caldecott Castle</div><div id="00:58:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Lake as well so we have two vessels there&#039;s one plank of what was thought to</div><div id="00:58:27.880" class="transcript_line"> be a Viking ship that was found at Newport dock when Alexandra dock was</div><div id="00:58:32.600" class="transcript_line"> being built but that&#039;s been recently dated and I think that Toby Jones has</div><div id="00:58:37.600" class="transcript_line"> recently discovered the likely date for that now is again medieval later</div><div id="00:58:43.160" class="transcript_line"> medieval than early medieval so there is a wealth of maritime archaeology and of</div><div id="00:58:50.000" class="transcript_line"> course again how fitting for Newport that the name of the city encapsulates</div><div id="00:58:56.920" class="transcript_line"> its importance it&#039;s raison d&#039;etre how appropriate that it has such an</div><div id="00:59:02.320" class="transcript_line"> important collection of maritime archaeology that&#039;s just waiting for</div><div id="00:59:08.600" class="transcript_line"> presentation and display I think is one of the things that Newport has as an</div><div id="00:59:13.480" class="transcript_line"> asset that could attract people from the rest of the country and abroad to this</div><div id="00:59:18.520" class="transcript_line"> part of the world to explore this landscape and the seven estuary as a</div><div id="00:59:22.960" class="transcript_line"> communication route and that other people just don&#039;t have so I very much</div><div id="00:59:27.880" class="transcript_line"> look forward to the time it will happen one day when when all these vessels are</div><div id="00:59:32.680" class="transcript_line"> are beautifully displayed and interpreted because for whatever reason</div><div id="00:59:37.240" class="transcript_line"> and nobody seems to be put to be able to put their hand on it there is just</div><div id="00:59:42.240" class="transcript_line"> something innately satisfying to most people about boats they just adore</div><div id="00:59:48.360" class="transcript_line"> looking at and learning about boats and there&#039;s been long long understood but</div><div id="00:59:54.520" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s almost as in the way that green is a calming color there is just something</div><div id="00:59:59.160" class="transcript_line"> about vessels maybe it&#039;s the skeletal nature of this structure the graceful</div><div id="01:00:04.800" class="transcript_line"> lines but most you know many people find boats deeply satisfying and they&#039;re a</div><div id="01:00:10.640" class="transcript_line"> huge draw so the sooner they&#039;re on display together the better</div><div id="01:00:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just gonna ask about your fish traps again yeah when you found that fish</div><div id="01:00:23.160" class="transcript_line"> trap yeah how did you feel well it&#039;d been found it by it being with um first</div><div id="01:00:32.120" class="transcript_line"> located by the survey for the sabbath which was known about they knew where it</div><div id="01:00:37.400" class="transcript_line"> was and they could take me straight to it so I was literally taken straight to</div><div id="01:00:41.680" class="transcript_line"> it right there is lifted but when I gently cleaned off the surface and found</div><div id="01:00:48.840" class="transcript_line"> the stake that had held it in place that&#039;s the magic if you like the fact</div><div id="01:00:54.040" class="transcript_line"> that it was half sectioned was magical and you could see that it was all there</div><div id="01:00:57.280" class="transcript_line"> is in perfect condition that&#039;s magical from a survival point of view but when</div><div id="01:01:02.760" class="transcript_line"> you get the additional element of the story that human element of the act of</div><div id="01:01:09.880" class="transcript_line"> staking the thing to hold it in position that&#039;s the magic for me where</div><div id="01:01:16.200" class="transcript_line"> you are retrieving that extra part of the process that extra part of the</div><div id="01:01:21.720" class="transcript_line"> artifact just to remove the basket is not like the object it&#039;s the object and</div><div id="01:01:27.040" class="transcript_line"> its stake that the stake that held it in place there you&#039;ve got the whole</div><div id="01:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> functioning item if you like it tells more of the story to just lift the</div><div id="01:01:37.800" class="transcript_line"> basket would have been to compromise it and only lift a part of the the whole if</div><div id="01:01:43.760" class="transcript_line"> you like so yeah it was a discovery of the stake that the stake was there and</div><div id="01:01:48.040" class="transcript_line"> that was particularly satisfying to me because of the stories that lead on from</div><div id="01:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> that the way that it worked the way it was held in position the way it was</div><div id="01:01:58.120" class="transcript_line"> accessed the way the fish were removed fish are hugely important part of the</div><div id="01:02:03.800" class="transcript_line"> diet conversely you go back to the iron age and it&#039;s questioned whether the iron</div><div id="01:02:10.680" class="transcript_line"> age people really really had fish at all it&#039;s very rare in fact I don&#039;t think any</div><div id="01:02:16.600" class="transcript_line"> fish bones have been found on iron age sites but a lot of iron age sites won&#039;t</div><div id="01:02:20.080" class="transcript_line"> lend themselves to the preservation of fish bone but it&#039;s possible that a fish</div><div id="01:02:25.400" class="transcript_line"> were not as certainly not as an important a part of iron age diet as as</div><div id="01:02:31.640" class="transcript_line"> it was in medieval times so again you can see different interactions with the</div><div id="01:02:35.120" class="transcript_line"> environment and big debates now on fisheries over fishing under fishing</div><div id="01:02:41.360" class="transcript_line"> sustainable fishing you name it we can look back at past times when when</div><div id="01:02:46.760" class="transcript_line"> reliance on different aspects of the environment were different and again</div><div id="01:02:53.280" class="transcript_line"> they it all helps to inform us about perhaps where balance may lie when we</div><div id="01:02:59.760" class="transcript_line"> take different approaches to our environment yes yes I grew up in the</div><div id="01:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> area and they they both grew up in in the area too yes I call we used to call</div><div id="01:03:18.240" class="transcript_line"> it the Moors if you look at the most 17th century maps early maps they&#039;ll</div><div id="01:03:23.800" class="transcript_line"> just be a label across sort of from Nash across to mega the more Godwin the</div><div id="01:03:33.120" class="transcript_line"> bishop and corresponded with William Camden a lot when he was writing his</div><div id="01:03:40.440" class="transcript_line"> first history of Britain Britannia and Camden describes the moor as a fennie</div><div id="01:03:46.680" class="transcript_line"> tract that lies beneath the fennage and was considered to be really quite an</div><div id="01:03:53.320" class="transcript_line"> unhealthy place again these these prejudices continue quite late as later</div><div id="01:04:00.160" class="transcript_line"> 1763 we&#039;ve got a letter from the vicar of Nash the rector of Nash explaining to</div><div id="01:04:08.880" class="transcript_line"> his bishop that he never goes to Nash even though he&#039;s the rector of the</div><div id="01:04:12.800" class="transcript_line"> parish and he pays a curate to go there because he went there once and he got</div><div id="01:04:19.240" class="transcript_line"> the egg and it was nearly the death of him and if he was made to live there in</div><div id="01:04:22.880" class="transcript_line"> his parish it would be the death of him and his family so and the previous</div><div id="01:04:27.520" class="transcript_line"> bishop said that was okay so he trusts that the present bishop will follow</div><div id="01:04:31.680" class="transcript_line"> suit so and and he said that he lives in Ponte pool very nicely and that&#039;s no</div><div id="01:04:36.380" class="transcript_line"> intention of ever going anywhere near Nash so you can see that there&#039;s this</div><div id="01:04:41.520" class="transcript_line"> the moor is the way it was seen and again this Caldecott thing this cold</div><div id="01:04:46.680" class="transcript_line"> harbor this cold shelter there were lots of cold harbors and cold harbors were</div><div id="01:04:51.840" class="transcript_line"> probably these cold shelters cold cots cold cottages that weren&#039;t places of</div><div id="01:04:58.360" class="transcript_line"> banishment in in the case of cold harbors they&#039;re just seasonal bivouacs or</div><div id="01:05:05.720" class="transcript_line"> sort of the equivalent of the camper van or tent where you can be with your</div><div id="01:05:10.760" class="transcript_line"> flocks during the summer periods often they don&#039;t even have evidence of hearths</div><div id="01:05:15.680" class="transcript_line"> for actually cooking there but their shelters that are probably unheated or</div><div id="01:05:21.840" class="transcript_line"> largely unheated cold shelters just so that you can be near your flocks or</div><div id="01:05:26.240" class="transcript_line"> herds on the levels during the summer months so I think we know that the</div><div id="01:05:31.480" class="transcript_line"> place name evidence the archaeological evidence it&#039;s all leading towards a very</div><div id="01:05:35.400" class="transcript_line"> pastoral and largely the level still our posture and largely cattle based</div><div id="01:05:44.200" class="transcript_line"> exploitation well I lived not far from the edge of the moor at Caldecott so we</div><div id="01:05:56.480" class="transcript_line"> just used to travel over the entrance to the seven tunnel for log walks along the</div><div id="01:06:02.520" class="transcript_line"> seawall accessed near the anti-aircraft gun in placement near the near what was</div><div id="01:06:10.800" class="transcript_line"> then the Caldecott sewage works so there was always a footpath down to the level</div><div id="01:06:15.060" class="transcript_line"> there it passed a Roman farm site at Stoop Hill as it was once called Stoop</div><div id="01:06:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Hill and the the rising ground coming up off the Fern edge and I was always</div><div id="01:06:26.880" class="transcript_line"> fascinated by the flotsam and jetsam the the driftwood that used to be</div><div id="01:06:32.520" class="transcript_line"> distributed in hundreds of thousands of tons along that part of the level and</div><div id="01:06:39.520" class="transcript_line"> it seems to have been a long-standing habit of the river to deposit on that</div><div id="01:06:46.080" class="transcript_line"> particular tract of the more because and when I later went to look at the parish</div><div id="01:06:52.880" class="transcript_line"> registers at Caldecott Church and there are a number of entries of burials in</div><div id="01:06:57.440" class="transcript_line"> the churchyard of parts of a body of a person unknown that get washed up on the</div><div id="01:07:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Caldecott moor and it was fascinating again that&#039;s quite a unique entry in a</div><div id="01:07:11.180" class="transcript_line"> burial register you know other parishes aren&#039;t going to have parts of a body of</div><div id="01:07:15.100" class="transcript_line"> a person unknown regular not regularly I wouldn&#039;t say regularly but from time to</div><div id="01:07:20.260" class="transcript_line"> time entered in the the parish register because they had to be accorded a</div><div id="01:07:25.940" class="transcript_line"> proper burial somewhere within the the consecrated churchyard so it you know</div><div id="01:07:32.620" class="transcript_line"> this habit of the river depositing there was quite you know quite quite a</div><div id="01:07:37.420" class="transcript_line"> strong one it seems over a long period of time another odd entry in the burial</div><div id="01:07:44.200" class="transcript_line"> register was that there seems to have been certainly at least one occasion</div><div id="01:07:49.260" class="transcript_line"> where soon after the 7th tunnel actually opened for passengers sadly some</div><div id="01:07:58.820" class="transcript_line"> infants were newborns were taken through the tunnel by their mothers but</div><div id="01:08:05.740" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t come out the other side and were either thrown from trains in the</div><div id="01:08:10.220" class="transcript_line"> darkness of the tunnel or or what have you and they were buried at Caldecott as</div><div id="01:08:14.620" class="transcript_line"> well so you know it&#039;s it&#039;s all about the we&#039;ve talked about the agricultural</div><div id="01:08:21.260" class="transcript_line"> human responses to the environment but as soon as you&#039;ve got new technologies</div><div id="01:08:25.420" class="transcript_line"> like a tunnel a very long dark tunnel that newly opens people find ways of</div><div id="01:08:32.020" class="transcript_line"> utilizing it that the the the the people that planned it could never envisage</div><div id="01:08:38.020" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;re all recorded there in the registers because these these events took</div><div id="01:08:43.780" class="transcript_line"> you know took place and of course the entrance to the tunnel was was my route</div><div id="01:08:50.260" class="transcript_line"> over it over the the bridge if you like over the entrance on to onto the levels</div><div id="01:08:56.180" class="transcript_line"> that link with the tunnel and that access to the other side was always very</div><div id="01:09:00.180" class="transcript_line"> strong in my childhood with the knowledge of said book and the pumping</div><div id="01:09:03.180" class="transcript_line"> station and the efforts that were the mammoth effort to actually sink the</div><div id="01:09:10.420" class="transcript_line"> tunnel because of a great spring that they broke into underneath so that that</div><div id="01:09:15.860" class="transcript_line"> was all a huge part of the geography and that landscape was a very strong a</div><div id="01:09:23.420" class="transcript_line"> strong backdrop to the way I understood my geography which was that travel was</div><div id="01:09:28.860" class="transcript_line"> largely east-west along the edge of the fen you&#039;d either go to the urban</div><div id="01:09:36.380" class="transcript_line"> conurbations in Newport Cardiff or beyond in the westward direction or</div><div id="01:09:40.980" class="transcript_line"> eastwards on to chapstow Gloucester Bristol broadly eastward once the seven</div><div id="01:09:47.460" class="transcript_line"> bridge was in position at chapstow during my childhood so it&#039;s all east-west you</div><div id="01:09:53.860" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t do that that much southern movement so it always intrigued me</div><div id="01:09:58.780" class="transcript_line"> standing on the seawall at Caldecott you could see the beautiful reflections from</div><div id="01:10:03.860" class="transcript_line"> the lights from the windows at Portishead at sunset and the gleaming</div><div id="01:10:09.500" class="transcript_line"> sort of display of the reflected light from the windows there but I&#039;d never</div><div id="01:10:15.300" class="transcript_line"> been there and the other could see it and it was a stone so it&#039;s closer than</div><div id="01:10:19.060" class="transcript_line"> mega as the stone as the crow flies but I&#039;ve never been there I didn&#039;t know it</div><div id="01:10:24.780" class="transcript_line"> at all I still don&#039;t know it well so I&#039;ve spoken since in Thornbury regularly</div><div id="01:10:32.860" class="transcript_line"> and it was sort of 17 to 20 minutes away and yet unless you need to go there you</div><div id="01:10:38.300" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t necessarily go there because it&#039;s not on that east-west corridor that</div><div id="01:10:42.300" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re so familiar with and I&#039;m sure I upset many people when I did a Radio 4</div><div id="01:10:46.940" class="transcript_line"> interview talking about landscape at Redwick recently and I said you know the</div><div id="01:10:52.300" class="transcript_line"> people here on the levels they probably don&#039;t have a good knowledge of what&#039;s</div><div id="01:10:55.580" class="transcript_line"> the other side of Grey Hill and I maintain that they won&#039;t have a detailed</div><div id="01:11:00.460" class="transcript_line"> knowledge of the parishes they might know they travel through it to us or</div><div id="01:11:04.060" class="transcript_line"> what have you but they won&#039;t know Clanclau very well I bet they won&#039;t talk</div><div id="01:11:08.820" class="transcript_line"> Lantricent or Lantricent they don&#039;t stop off there whereas on the east-west</div><div id="01:11:14.300" class="transcript_line"> corridor you probably do and those movements are very ancient the Roman</div><div id="01:11:18.220" class="transcript_line"> fortress was placed at Cullion because it controls the lowest crossing point of</div><div id="01:11:23.620" class="transcript_line"> the Asc

and</div><div id="01:11:32.140" class="transcript_line"> so this movement in this east broadly east-west what we might call the M4</div><div id="01:11:37.780" class="transcript_line"> corridor is very ancient almost certainly pre-roman certainly Roman and</div><div id="01:11:42.980" class="transcript_line"> post-roman and that informs in my mind future debates with regard to the M4</div><div id="01:11:50.980" class="transcript_line"> relief road or lack thereof because it doesn&#039;t matter to me which side people</div><div id="01:11:58.020" class="transcript_line"> fall on there is perfect logic for not building it from environmental impact</div><div id="01:12:04.340" class="transcript_line"> and archaeological impact reasons etc but the one thing you cannot escape is</div><div id="01:12:11.140" class="transcript_line"> that east-west movement is a reality in this geography that is age-old and will</div><div id="01:12:17.700" class="transcript_line"> continue for future generations how we deal with that manager is for mines</div><div id="01:12:24.340" class="transcript_line"> greater than mine and seemingly greater than a lot of the people that have</div><div id="01:12:28.340" class="transcript_line"> applied their minds to it but it&#039;s it&#039;s something that is inevitable people will</div><div id="01:12:35.820" class="transcript_line"> need to move east-west it&#039;s absolutely a given so how that&#039;s dealt with is</div><div id="01:12:43.060" class="transcript_line"> something that will have to be grappled with and I think again the past can</div><div id="01:12:47.380" class="transcript_line"> inform us the historic movement has always been ever further south and it&#039;s</div><div id="01:12:52.500" class="transcript_line"> ironic that the the southern distributor road was south of the M4 and</div><div id="01:12:57.460" class="transcript_line"> any M4 relief road will fall south again so since Roman times what probably</div><div id="01:13:02.660" class="transcript_line"> started off life as the 848 and the ridgeway above it has come down ever</div><div id="01:13:08.460" class="transcript_line"> further south with the M4 the railway line and then and then but the</div><div id="01:13:15.140" class="transcript_line"> geographical reality of that is fixed so this is where the past can help no it</div><div id="01:13:21.060" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t give us the answer as to what to do but it informs us that this is a</div><div id="01:13:25.020" class="transcript_line"> reality that we can&#039;t escape so we need an innovative and the best possible</div><div id="01:13:31.020" class="transcript_line"> solution to what is a given problem that&#039;s not going to go away I&#039;ve done</div><div id="01:13:39.420" class="transcript_line"> very little over there actually because it it hasn&#039;t fallen within my area of</div><div id="01:13:49.620" class="transcript_line"> geographical sort of upbringing my background or my my world of work the</div><div id="01:13:56.060" class="transcript_line"> Wendlug level is of great interest because there is possible evidence</div><div id="01:14:00.460" class="transcript_line"> there for a more intensive Roman land improvement system possible ancient</div><div id="01:14:12.620" class="transcript_line"> Roman fields has been disputed as to where they are the Roman material sits</div><div id="01:14:17.860" class="transcript_line"> in these ditches but of course there are different ways material can find</div><div id="01:14:22.980" class="transcript_line"> their way to different levels so it&#039;s still a matter of dispute as to how</div><div id="01:14:27.340" class="transcript_line"> extensive the Roman drainage system and possible defense was on the Wendlug</div><div id="01:14:35.180" class="transcript_line"> level but there are some again important sites at Beysleg by Silica takes its</div><div id="01:14:41.300" class="transcript_line"> name from a Roman isled structure there&#039;s a villa there cross Carni</div><div id="01:14:49.020" class="transcript_line"> Indian there&#039;s another one Koikurnu so some very interesting and important</div><div id="01:14:55.220" class="transcript_line"> sites again on the Fen edge and then you come down onto the Fen with the later</div><div id="01:14:59.620" class="transcript_line"> medieval churches at St. Brides and Peterstone great medieval structures</div><div id="01:15:05.540" class="transcript_line"> that show how important it&#039;s certainly Peterstone was it rivals Cardiff as an</div><div id="01:15:10.100" class="transcript_line"> architectural edifice so a very important place in medieval times in</div><div id="01:15:15.700" class="transcript_line"> its own right but but later encroachments or movements down on to</div><div id="01:15:23.380" class="transcript_line"> the onto the Fen edge itself and of course they&#039;re important because they</div><div id="01:15:28.160" class="transcript_line"> hold some of the flood markers that record the the one flood of 1607 which</div><div id="01:15:34.340" class="transcript_line"> up to that point was the most completely documented and and within</div><div id="01:15:42.860" class="transcript_line"> certainly living memory or fable at the time the most devastating flood that</div><div id="01:15:47.620" class="transcript_line"> had been experienced by most people in the Seventh Estuary.</div><div id="01:15:53.140" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve spoken to a few people who one chap in particular lives in Rocket or I used to</div><div id="01:16:06.180" class="transcript_line"> call it Rogier and to us corrected and he paints a really blissful childhood</div><div id="01:16:14.060" class="transcript_line"> before the M4 going down you know bird nesting fishing yeah and</div><div id="01:16:21.020" class="transcript_line"> Ealing following the Penhay Beagles yeah yeah yeah yeah you&#039;re much younger</div><div id="01:16:28.220" class="transcript_line"> than that and I think there&#039;s a difference I I was fortunate to have</div><div id="01:16:32.220" class="transcript_line"> known Derek Upton who was one of the great great people of the levels the</div><div id="01:16:36.780" class="transcript_line"> Seventh Estuary levels research committee is basically dedicated and</div><div id="01:16:40.980" class="transcript_line"> dedicated his website to his memory he was the first person because he used to</div><div id="01:16:45.620" class="transcript_line"> roam around out in the mud and beyond the mud deep out into the estuary and</div><div id="01:16:53.180" class="transcript_line"> places that other people wouldn&#039;t dare go but a lot of the archaeology was</div><div id="01:16:59.380" class="transcript_line"> being exposed and eroded out through scouring and he understood it</div><div id="01:17:04.740" class="transcript_line"> incredibly well and he drew the attention of our professional archaeology</div><div id="01:17:11.020" class="transcript_line"> to what was going on out there so there&#039;s the Upton trackway that he</div><div id="01:17:15.380" class="transcript_line"> discovered many of the footprints and thanks to him and thanks to people like</div><div id="01:17:20.820" class="transcript_line"> Martin Bell who you know took the baton and run with what was being discovered</div><div id="01:17:26.340" class="transcript_line"> out there by Derek and others and made their own discoveries we have a much</div><div id="01:17:32.020" class="transcript_line"> better understanding now that generation did and the lave net fishermen they they</div><div id="01:17:36.460" class="transcript_line"> they were much more heavily involved my my involvement with the level in</div><div id="01:17:43.260" class="transcript_line"> childhood was just as an observer of it not going out into it in that way but I</div><div id="01:17:48.780" class="transcript_line"> was around to hear the stories you know out at our end in the in the</div><div id="01:17:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Valley I was only told not so very long ago that they used to walk the</div><div id="01:17:58.740" class="transcript_line"> curhounds out from it and to places like Coent and the slough which means marsh</div><div id="01:18:06.120" class="transcript_line"> the slough the ancient manor house of Coent and they had kennels there to</div><div id="01:18:11.980" class="transcript_line"> overnight rest them so they could rest out a quite then they would hunt in the</div><div id="01:18:17.220" class="transcript_line"> Neddon Valley down onto the Caldecott levels from slough and all the fences</div><div id="01:18:24.220" class="transcript_line"> weren&#039;t barbed wire they were just thin wire so that it didn&#039;t damage the horses</div><div id="01:18:30.180" class="transcript_line"> or the hounds while they were hunting back and forth these details you</div><div id="01:18:33.780" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t capture any other way nobody records the archaeology of barbed wire</div><div id="01:18:37.940" class="transcript_line"> fences but these are realities that enabled the hunt and I was told that Lady</div><div id="01:18:46.060" class="transcript_line"> Kerr would anybody that lost chickens to a fox she would pay for the chickens she</div><div id="01:18:56.820" class="transcript_line"> would buy the dead chicken carcasses or pay you the equivalent so that you</div><div id="01:19:01.860" class="transcript_line"> weren&#039;t out of pocket so that there was no animosity to the foxes or the</div><div id="01:19:06.360" class="transcript_line"> presence of the foxes there was no financial loss to any of the people in</div><div id="01:19:09.600" class="transcript_line"> the area so there were plenty of foxes to hunt so it&#039;s not necessarily a good</div><div id="01:19:15.520" class="transcript_line"> news story but it&#039;s the way it&#039;s the way society functioned in that time and I</div><div id="01:19:19.360" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t go back to that time but I&#039;ve spoken to people that have a memory of</div><div id="01:19:23.880" class="transcript_line"> it or a very distant memory or were told in their childhood of the way it</div><div id="01:19:30.600" class="transcript_line"> functioned I was very very fortunate to be a neighbour for a time of Dennis</div><div id="01:19:35.740" class="transcript_line"> Collett who grew up at Carwent and then was a railwayman and had a very good</div><div id="01:19:42.940" class="transcript_line"> knowledge of the area and the levels and lived in Caldecock and the stories he</div><div id="01:19:49.740" class="transcript_line"> tells of they used to test the sort of flow of the water in the Great Spring in</div><div id="01:19:55.100" class="transcript_line"> the early years by treading blackberries and you get the big sort of tub of</div><div id="01:20:01.020" class="transcript_line"> blackberry juice which is a good dye and then you can pour it into the bore</div><div id="01:20:04.820" class="transcript_line"> holes and then they&#039;d go down into the tunnel and wait for the purple black</div><div id="01:20:10.200" class="transcript_line"> berry juice to start coming through and then they could time the flow and work</div><div id="01:20:13.660" class="transcript_line"> out the flow through the Great Spring from further upstream at Carwent in the</div><div id="01:20:19.540" class="transcript_line"> Neddon Valley and down into the to the pumping station there the he remembers</div><div id="01:20:27.120" class="transcript_line"> stories of the whirly holes that once existed in the Neddon Valley. Neddon</div><div id="01:20:32.760" class="transcript_line"> means whirlpool and there were sink holes down into the cave system just</div><div id="01:20:40.320" class="transcript_line"> below Carwent just above Caldecock Castle and they once had whirlpools in</div><div id="01:20:46.400" class="transcript_line"> them that people could look down into these these whirling this underground</div><div id="01:20:51.280" class="transcript_line"> river that sort of came up to the surface at that point of course they</div><div id="01:20:55.840" class="transcript_line"> were all filled in as part of the tunnel works and then the water level</div><div id="01:20:58.920" class="transcript_line"> slightly dropped once they started pumping out the Great Spring and they&#039;re</div><div id="01:21:02.720" class="transcript_line"> now lost so these things if not recorded in this way through oral</div><div id="01:21:07.960" class="transcript_line"> histories or written down anywhere these memories are lost because sadly Dennis</div><div id="01:21:12.840" class="transcript_line"> is no longer with us and he didn&#039;t live long enough to be recorded in that way</div><div id="01:21:17.640" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;ll be for me to pass on the story wherever I can the stories that he</div><div id="01:21:23.560" class="transcript_line"> passed on to me and also to ensure that his memory is maintained as somebody</div><div id="01:21:31.040" class="transcript_line"> lived in this area and people did used to shoot he used to shoot and he knew</div><div id="01:21:36.040" class="transcript_line"> you know knew how the old way was but with the intensive more intensive</div><div id="01:21:41.760" class="transcript_line"> urbanization if you like of southeastern Monmouthshire something that if we look</div><div id="01:21:48.160" class="transcript_line"> at the current proposals for the next local development plan is likely to</div><div id="01:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> become a suburb of Bristol as far as we can tell with nearly all development</div><div id="01:21:58.320" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s been put on the table in Monmouthshire south of the 848 basically</div><div id="01:22:03.720" class="transcript_line"> then the pressures will grow on in terms of environmental factors on wildlife on</div><div id="01:22:11.480" class="transcript_line"> on the environment and indeed on the road networks because you can only keep</div><div id="01:22:18.240" class="transcript_line"> adding more and more people so far before we approach gridlock and the one</div><div id="01:22:24.720" class="transcript_line"> thing I&#039;ve queried about some of the road schemes is that they can very</div><div id="01:22:29.040" class="transcript_line"> successfully bypass Newport very very very easily and quickly with</div><div id="01:22:34.960" class="transcript_line"> with road construction but does that then in my mind get you to places like</div><div id="01:22:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff quicker so that you&#039;ve just joined a different queue along possibly</div><div id="01:22:45.920" class="transcript_line"> a longer queue in a different place I just don&#039;t know at the moment everybody</div><div id="01:22:50.720" class="transcript_line"> queues in Newport and Cardiff but will you just join a queue that&#039;s twice as</div><div id="01:22:55.440" class="transcript_line"> long in Cardiff I just hope that our infrastructure and our planning is</div><div id="01:23:01.280" class="transcript_line"> sufficiently robust that we can solve the problems not just move from around</div><div id="01:23:08.880" class="transcript_line"> just check how long</div><div id="01:23:13.320" class="transcript_line"> so I think perhaps it&#039;s that that&#039;s nearly an hour and a half I think I</div><div id="01:23:20.160" class="transcript_line"> might end it there because if there&#039;s anything else you&#039;d like to add no I</div><div id="01:23:23.960" class="transcript_line"> think I think we&#039;ve sort of rambled around the levels quite well I&#039;m just</div><div id="01:23:28.760" class="transcript_line"> gonna stop that there now</div></div></p>
