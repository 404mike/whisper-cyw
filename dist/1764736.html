    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you could just introduce yourself.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I know where&#039;s the old tree now. If you overate that child.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Would do.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s terrible for them.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Is he? He likes little ones, does he?</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He is.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> If you could just tell me your name, your age and where we are.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Janice Partridge and we&#039;re at Splott Park.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m my age is 64.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Great. Thanks.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m Anna and I work for Mancap and today&#039;s date is the 5th of October 2020.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So Janice, could you...</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first time that we met, you recorded your story with Stephen.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So Stephen isn&#039;t going to be recorded today. It&#039;s just going to be you.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you maybe, can you think back to when we first did the recording with Stephen</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and how your friendship might have changed or how things have been over the last few months for the two of you?</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the first time was at Central Station.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And we met somebody else who works with you.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Anita who took the photos.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Who was taking photos.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> We went on the platform, we took a couple of photos, taking a few of Stephen and me on the station.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you did one...</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think you did one in Mancap.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you did one in Mancap.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Or was it at home? Did you come to...</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we did it in the Cardiff People First office, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It did, yeah, in one of the offices.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So how are you and Stephen these days?</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We keep in touch, but we can&#039;t really see one another now.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But we keep in touch, we phone each other.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s okay. But we used to have an argument.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> If too many people interfered, you know, we&#039;d okay by ourselves.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But if someone else said, no, Steve, he&#039;d be off like a shot.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d be calling him back.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So who used to interfere then?</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Who used to interfere?</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the other members of People First.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you got an example of that?</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I met a friend in town.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were in 35 years ago from the Blind Institute.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And Steve split up with his girlfriend and he was a bit disheartened.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And he took it out on me.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were in live lounge in town.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got a puzzle book out thinking, oh, Steve will be all right.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He threw the puzzle book on the floor.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And my friend Rob told him off and he walked out and went train spotting.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So he can&#039;t handle any of the people telling him off.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;s liking it if I tell him as well.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then on a Tuesday, before I was meeting the people in chapter,</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> he came and he said, I&#039;m sorry, Jan, about how I was.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Before you were there, he came and said, Jan, I&#039;m sorry about how I performed the other day.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think he did realize.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He does a bit of thinking and I think he realizes.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were okay in the chapter meeting you did.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were playing it in chapter as well as people first.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when you were playing it back to us, our recording.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We listened to it all together, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s when you were playing it back to Steve and I was chapter.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That was it, I remember.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you could...</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So one of the reasons that we wanted to meet up was to find out how this last few months,</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> how you&#039;ve been doing, but also how that&#039;s affected some of your friendships,</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> including your friendship with Steven.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So maybe if we think back to, and it&#039;s a little while ago now,</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> in the run-up to the first lockdown,</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> when before we all got stuck in our houses, what was that like?</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember back to that?</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was funny sometimes, when I had the TV, the radio.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, you can do shopping, but you can&#039;t meet friends.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And now it&#039;s this, if you go to a restaurant, you can&#039;t sit with friends.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And we always got on and it&#039;s strange.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You go to Queen&#039;s Falls or the restaurant, we used to book live lounge.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Before this lockdown, this double lockdown, we used to book a table for six people.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And now you can&#039;t even do that.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were doing that before this second lockdown?</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the second lockdown.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So during the first lockdown then?</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> During the first lockdown, I could go shopping.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And then later on they said, you can&#039;t meet friends now.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But in this one they said, you can&#039;t meet friends.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think, well, who am I going to see?</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I just got the telly at home.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So you live by yourself, Janice?</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I live by myself.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> During the first lockdown, did you see anybody at all?</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I used to go and have coffee with them in coffee shops.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were no coffee shops in the first lockdown.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You could only sit outside and you couldn&#039;t go sit in them.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And one day I was with them and I don&#039;t know, it was on a Monday.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I felt you couldn&#039;t use their inside toilet.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to walk to St. David&#039;s Centre with Emma to go to the toilet.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And it upset my stomach a bit because if I don&#039;t go when I want to,</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> something else happens later.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I get upset stomach if I can&#039;t go to the toilet straight away.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to walk over to coffee run and they let us use our disabled toilet.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we got to the first half, I had another stomach ache.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I suffer badly if I can&#039;t get to a toilet on time.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And in this first lockdown, that happened, but not in the second one.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the first one, because at the very beginning we were only allowed to go out.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We were only allowed to go out of our houses.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No, just for a walk, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Only shopping and medication.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you do your own shopping or did someone help you?</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I always do my own.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember someone lying with my Iceland or the Mollisons for me in the first one</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was difficult to get out.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So he said, Jan, when I do something, I&#039;ll get some things for you.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me what you need and I&#039;ll do one for you.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And he used to do extra things for me as well as his own shopping.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;d go round there and get them all for him.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And so did you see your brother quite a bit in the beginning?</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> More in the first lockdown.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t so much in this one.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But he said to me, if you go out with your friends,</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t want me to go out with them and give it to him so I can understand that.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I can&#039;t explain to my friends that I&#039;m not going out.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they don&#039;t understand it.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They say, yes, you&#039;ve got to get out, Jan.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got fresh air in you.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said, how can I if I can&#039;t?</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I sat out in my garden with people where I live in the first lockdown.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got a garden of you?</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it used to be of its ventures now with a few flowers.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But at one time when I moved there, they had a seat with an umbrella, a table with an umbrella.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They took that away and just got ventures now.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you share the garden with other people or is it just yours?</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had our own ventures, but I did used to share the garden with other residents.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know your neighbours?</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I know them quite well.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They were done repair work when my light bulb was gone because my rubber can&#039;t get round to do it.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And last week I had to have filled those out.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It all happened.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> My alarm card, you know that you press if you come and see me to let you in.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That went.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The light in the hallway went.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My fire light gone in case I can&#039;t hear anything with the fire.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> All that went.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to have them out last week to fix it.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Luckily, they came out to do it and everything is done now.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And they sent a survey to CCHA because in the first lockdown they weren&#039;t sending anyone out.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So what would have happened if you&#039;d got no lights or something?</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;d have to go on to the CCHA.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re closed now.</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;ve told us now in this one that we can get the engineers and do repairs.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But in the first one you couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So if something went wrong there, you just had to wait until they could.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, well, I&#039;m glad now that I could and they did.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the housing association.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> CCHA or Adamsdown, Meteor Street and Tovo Court.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They say we are closed.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> If you stay on, we&#039;ll get someone.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> They told me the first time I have to get on the ladder and do it.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no, that&#039;s not on.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So your neighbours helped, did you say?</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So one neighbour changed the small room light.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, this was the fluorescent lighting on the ceiling in the hallway as you opened the front door.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wanted me to get on that and I&#039;m fixing it.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve never can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s not allowed to move or get up.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, I need someone to come out and do it.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what he did in the second lockdown, but they weren&#039;t in the first one.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the first lockdown, you used to be in your garden, did you say?</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you invite people to your garden?</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No, we used to go down there and we could share it.</div><div id="00:10:30.000"

of me being deaf.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The tutors would say, are you going to do this, Janice?</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the one tutor, she&#039;d say to her, you have to explain she&#039;s deaf.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I never had my friend there I would have still been struggling now.</div><div

id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Andrew.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s Ann&#039;s brother, Andrew Sowery.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so where did you, how did you first meet Andrew?</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> How did that come about?</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was Live Lounge.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I used to meet them in, not Live Lounge, it was called Bye Live Lounge.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a restaurant somewhere and I used to meet them in, and they&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> it used to be Bye Live Lounge.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember the name.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was when I first met Andrew.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was going to their house to stay for the weekend and they said,</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll meet you, Jan, in this place, and so and so and so.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to go there beforehand until I could be there ready to meet them.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were like...</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, so on to part two of the 5th of October 2020 with Janice and Anna in Splot.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So Janice, sorry about that.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You were talking about, you and, about your, I was asking about your brother,</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> how he feels about your relationship with Andrew.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> How does your brother react?</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They all think he&#039;s just my friend.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;ve let it be he&#039;s my friend because I don&#039;t want to route with them.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I have told them he&#039;s my friend.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So who does know that he&#039;s more than just a friend then?</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not really involved like getting married or getting engaged or anything.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not something you want.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He said he just wanted to stay as good friends.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So at the moment, are you just good friends or more than?</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re just good friends until we see a bit more of each other after this lockdown.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So before the lockdown, how often did you see Andrew?</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go to them to stay weekends before the lockdown, before the first lockdown.</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you and Andrew share a room?</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to stay with them.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very happy.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a friend, Becky.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And Becky used to see Anna as well.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had Becky asking me, can she stay at mine?</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She can&#039;t, it&#039;s only for me.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a housing place just for me.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And see Anna, we are trying to tell Becky that she can&#039;t stay at Jan&#039;s.</div><div id="00:16:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So one day she said, oh, can I stay with you for the weekend, Jan?</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, Fex, Ollie, you can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She said that I said she can.</div><div id="00:17:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can&#039;t get through to her.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> How about Andrew? Did Andrew ever get to stay at your place?</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because Anna invited me to stay because mine&#039;s only one bedroom flat.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you have a single or a double bed?</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> If I had a room with another bed seat in it, it would be all right.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I got that bed.</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But if my sister came over.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you share a room with Andrew at his flat or do you have your own room?</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> With him because he&#039;s your boyfriend.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m with him.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you&#039;ve been together for a while, but at the moment...</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> At the moment, the lockdown&#039;s over.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you get to see him in between the two lockdowns then?</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t seen him in any.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve not seen... So when was the last time you saw him?</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw him for a while on the phone, but not seen him since the two lockdowns.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So back in March?</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I seen him, which was before the March lockdown.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And have you been in touch during that time?</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> On my phone I didn&#039;t text her.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s all we could do at the moment.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s phone each other and send a text.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And so have you been more in touch with Angela than you have with Andrew?</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No, more in touch with Andrew than I have with Andrew.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was hearing on the phone.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah. Does he message and stuff or...?</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I actually got engaged last year.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Her fiancé is nice, Kevin.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And he talked to me like that, you know.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes people don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to an engagement party.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But this recce didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he got out that they got engaged.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said to Anne,</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> recce, you know why she didn&#039;t come to your party?</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, because I don&#039;t want her there.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had to...</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what to say to recce, so I used to say Anne.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because Anne is good friends with recce&#039;s fiancé online.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> On Facebook, you see.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to go to Anne&#039;s.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I wouldn&#039;t do this.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> She used to go to Anne&#039;s with Steve and say,</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> can we both stay?</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I wouldn&#039;t do that with someone&#039;s flat.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not that kind of person.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t take...</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> If I had a boyfriend and he wasn&#039;t Andrew,</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t go to my...</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> If I had a brother, I wouldn&#039;t go to my friend&#039;s flat.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say, can he stay as well?</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Put on Anne, you see. It wasn&#039;t right.</div><div id="00:19:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So she just turned...</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to them once.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She invited me to meet them.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And go on the New Year&#039;s Eve and stay the New Year&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the day after.</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> She somehow found out.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Not from me. I don&#039;t know who she found out from.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She had to phone Anne&#039;s while I was staying there.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And she could hear me laughing.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, Janice is there.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was Anne&#039;s 40th birthday.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was invited there for the birthday.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And suddenly,</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> on the Wednesday night, on the Tuesday night,</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> in Royal Stephen and Becky.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking...</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;d like to see if I could run over to her place.</div><div id="00:20:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what are you two doing here?</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, well, Janice is here.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Why can&#039;t we be here?</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I only stayed till the Friday.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed for a week.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I went on Tuesday and stayed till Friday.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So on the Friday, I phoned Anne to say thanks for the whole week.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And actually, I heard Becky&#039;s voice and I was thinking,</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought they&#039;d gone.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> No, she doesn&#039;t want to go till Monday, Jan.</div><div id="00:20:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I wouldn&#039;t do that if I was staying.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say, OK, I&#039;ve got to go now.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> If I am, you know.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say, can I stay longer?</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not like that.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But if Becky is like that, very persistent,</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> very persuasive, so I&#039;m thinking,</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought they&#039;d gone.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, she don&#039;t want to go till Monday.</div><div id="00:21:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, well, I would never do that.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> If I was staying with anyone else, why is she doing this?</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve not been in touch with Andrew the whole time?</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Not the whole time, the first or second lockdown.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Only Anne.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he&#039;s not hearing me.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I just speak to her and I say, oh, it&#039;s Andrew.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And so does he not use text or Facebook or anything?</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he&#039;s not used to it because he&#039;s hearing.</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> His hearing is worse than mine because he got two.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I just hope he gets this one.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it&#039;s sad to have two.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But a couple of weeks ago, we were never able to do this</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> because I was full with wax in my ear.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to this cafe asking for something,</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> not realizing I can&#039;t hear because I went to see Tony Moly</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> thinking I could hear his

Specsavers.</div><div id="00:22:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They can help because there&#039;s not many people in on a Friday</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s lockdown.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought we&#039;d rather go.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, they said, I went to Specsavers on a Monday with my sister</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said, there&#039;s such a lot of wax in both ears.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s why you can&#039;t hear.</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to have them done in this ritual clinic</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> because clinic over here don&#039;t syringe now.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So they do micro surgery, micro, and that&#039;s called 60 pound.</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, I needed to get it out.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They say that much and I said, well, I needed to get the wax out.</div><div id="00:22:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And if there&#039;s no clinic doing it like they used to,</div><div id="00:22:52.000" class="transcript_line"> what am I going to do?</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve never found this clinic online.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went up there and I didn&#039;t know how to get the wax out,</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> so I had a taxi.</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But now I know, well, first again, my sister met me at the clinic</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> because I said, I don&#039;t know the lady and what do I do?</div><div id="00:23:09.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, well, Christine will be, my sister lives in Dade Court.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She met me at the clinic with my niece and then we met my niece</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and went for a coffee and coffee won.</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So he said, you&#039;ll have to have your fax card, Jan,</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s costing 60 pound.</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And people say 60?</div><div id="00:23:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t care how long this is out.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t care how long as I got the wax out.</div><div id="00:23:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I sat there comfy.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I always sit comfy.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I let people do it.</div><div id="00:23:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s some people can&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I sat there letting them do it.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the optician looked.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you use a bit of red where they use their things.</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t want red to affect it.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not hurting or rubbing.</div><div id="00:23:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So it just went away.</div><div id="00:23:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s lots of people who wouldn&#039;t sit there and have it</div><div id="00:23:57.000" class="transcript_line"> what I had done.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, yes, but he can&#039;t leave it in.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now one of my friends, Shahid, he has his microphone,</div><div id="00:24:04.000" class="transcript_line"> his headphones, and I said, they make you deaf.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no wonder you&#039;re deaf.</div><div id="00:24:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And he says, I won&#039;t wax.</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he says, well, go on, have it done then.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So have you been able to stay in touch with other friends</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> during this time then?</div><div id="00:24:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you been all right staying in touch with your other friends?</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Lisa likes staying in touch with.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been before last Friday.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to a house.</div><div id="00:24:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you can&#039;t now, see, because we had the lockdown on the Sunday.</div><div id="00:24:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So the Friday before, Lisa&#039;s mother&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And Lisa said, would you like to come, Lisa, to the house?</div><div id="00:24:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I reached her in town and we get the bus.</div><div id="00:24:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And the other week, I forgot about lockdown.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, your first lesson would have to be in college.</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I think, oh, yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:24:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I go to the college, locked up, no one there.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I think, what do I do?</div><div id="00:24:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They told me go to college.</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But then the tutor told me it would have been the lockdown came in,</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s not.</div><div id="00:25:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So now I know it&#039;s online every Friday.</div><div id="00:25:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So the college, have you been doing that the whole time or?</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, since last September.</div><div id="00:25:13.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, so how&#039;s that been working this last few months then?</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were doing it from the first lockdown that it was online.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It was in Zoom then.</div><div id="00:25:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Now it&#039;s not in Zoom, it&#039;s in Google Classroom, which is online.</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did Zoom last week because I haven&#039;t done it before online.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And so what do you use?</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have like a laptop or?</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I use my mobile, but my iPad isn&#039;t working.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So it is not working and they don&#039;t get it done.</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll treat myself to a new one Christmas.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I had this one on my brother&#039;s mate because he was selling his iPad.</div><div id="00:25:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So my friend got me the iPhone 5 mobile, which I use now.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But he&#039;s giving me his iPhone 8 because he got iPhone 11.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re going to try to get him through his house to swap phones.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I haven&#039;t been out with the others because I got to think of Stephen first.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So college has been all online during this time?</div><div id="00:26:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And you do that on your phone?</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my iPhone from the July of last year.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And now online from these Fridays until the college.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Or lively we used to use it back to normal.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And how do you find it using Zoom and everything?</div><div id="00:26:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well last week I found, I was getting it with Zoom and she said it&#039;s not Zoom.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, so she gave me the things that I got to do this week on my phone.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going around to Stephen on my phone so he can put them onto my new iPhone 8.</div><div id="00:26:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Stephen&#039;s ship brother?</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Stephen, my brother.</div><div id="00:26:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But he had the same name.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And it felt the same way.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is Stephen, my brother.</div><div id="00:26:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:26:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s going to, when I get around to see him, swap the phone and put this new,</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> she sent me the Google network codes and the ID.</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s going to swap them over to the new ones from my iPhone 5.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because more goes on the later iPhones than the iPhone 5.</div><div id="00:27:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re trying to get me to have this COVID-19 NHS thing.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that wouldn&#039;t work on my iPhone 5 because of the memory.</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So he said it won&#039;t work on the iPhone 8.</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about having that app?</div><div id="00:27:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I said okay, he&#039;s getting it out of the, what he&#039;s doing, he&#039;s getting it.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a joint account so he&#039;s getting this phone for me and buying it from the joint account we&#039;ve got.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Your brother?</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So it sounds like you and your brother have been...</div><div id="00:27:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t go around there over the weekend.</div><div id="00:27:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, it&#039;s nice Monday, come have this meal and we&#039;ll do the phones.</div><div id="00:28:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So has your brother been helping out quite a bit during this time?</div><div id="00:28:06.000" class="transcript_line"> He has been helping out quite a bit.</div><div id="00:28:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So what kind of things has he been...</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s been getting shopping, if he gets shopping.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Are we keeping touch with you over the iPhone?</div><div id="00:28:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, I texted him today, can you go to the clinic I&#039;ve asked you this afternoon?</div><div id="00:28:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He goes to the clinic for his bandages changed.</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I always text him to say, I&#039;ll be telling Anna, what time are you going to the clinic?</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said I&#039;ve asked you today Jan, so I&#039;ll see you a bit later after your meeting.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So after this, I&#039;ll go to the shopping and then maybe after this clinic, go up to him.</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> After or before the clinic, depends how long he&#039;s in his clinic.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you get on pretty well with your brother then?</div><div id="00:29:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I do, yeah, because I&#039;m closer to him than my sister.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m with my sister, she phones every week.</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she might phone when I&#039;m with the others, when I&#039;m out with the others and I can&#039;t do the phone call properly.</div><div id="00:29:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s the others?</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Like my friends that I used to be with in the first lockdown.</div><div id="00:29:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So who would that be? Who would you...</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Mark, Emma, Rob, Shaheed, people from Cardiff People First and the Blind Institute.</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking now, this one, we can&#039;t be with them, but we could in the other one.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think you can meet outside, can&#039;t you? It&#039;s just not inside.</div><div id="00:29:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You can meet outside, not in places.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Like this Tony, he sings outside on the haze.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So that would be different. And then we go sitting outside all in coffee one after him.</div><div id="00:29:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And there now, you can only sit outside, not go inside again.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But Shaheed told me last week that he told the lady that she let them go inside because he said,</div><div id="00:30:09.000" class="transcript_line"> well, we all live together. Well, we don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:30:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s telling fibs, saying that we all live together, but they let them go in because he said that.</div><div id="00:30:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t with them, but he told me, I told them that we&#039;re all together, so they let us in.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, you shouldn&#039;t tell them that if you&#039;re not. You&#039;ve got to do track and trace.</div><div id="00:30:31.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you find it, keeping up with all the rules?</div><div id="00:30:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I do track and trace by filling the paper out. I do a lot of scanning on my phone.</div><div id="00:30:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So they say you have these cards and you put them in and they&#039;re sent to the NHS.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So you just put your name and your mobile number and put it in the box.</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They do that in the Wethersfoos restaurants. If you haven&#039;t done it, by scanning your phone.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So have you been in between the two lockdowns? Did you get out quite a bit then?</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> More than one lockdown than this lockdown.</div><div id="00:31:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So you said you meet up with people from People First. Are the People First groups still running?</div><div id="00:31:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they all see this tone and then go for a drink afterwards.</div><div id="00:31:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So have the People First groups been running still?</div><div id="00:31:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They get interested. They&#039;ll need a dog.</div><div id="00:31:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Have the People First groups been running still?</div><div id="00:31:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No, they&#039;re not back until January. They didn&#039;t know how long these two lockdowns were going on for.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So lots of things like lunch and clever back February. So I thought, oh dear.</div><div id="00:31:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So how&#039;s that been for you?</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m going to celebrate my birthday soon.</div><div id="00:31:49.000" class="transcript_line"> When&#039;s your birthday?</div><div id="00:31:50.000" class="transcript_line"> January the 15th is on a Friday.</div><div id="00:31:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Same day as me.</div><div id="00:31:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Same day as you. Same day as my surrogatist.</div><div id="00:31:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to be my surrogateist, she&#039;s the 15th.</div><div id="00:32:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t know how you&#039;re going to celebrate your birthday?</div><div id="00:32:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s lockdown, whether we&#039;re going to be over, whether we can meet or not.</div><div id="00:32:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So People First haven&#039;t been meeting online or anything?</div><div id="00:32:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They do Zoom, outstanding of speaking out, and on a Thursday afternoon on Zoom.</div><div id="00:32:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you go to those Zoom meetings?</div><div id="00:32:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I got the Zoom on my phone to join in from home.</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave me the codes and the numbers.</div><div id="00:32:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Now yesterday our church meets once a month.</div><div id="00:32:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And they gave me the code, they sent me the message.</div><div id="00:32:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I was doing the code and they said, the code is not recognised.</div><div id="00:32:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Try again. And they said, your ID is not recognised.</div><div id="00:32:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh flinkey neck.</div><div id="00:32:51.000" class="transcript_line"> How do I get in?</div><div id="00:32:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I phoned someone and they said, well keep trying.</div><div id="00:32:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I kept trying. I eventually got in to Causeway.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I do a Bible study after because I used to go to Alfa.</div><div id="00:33:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, I used to go to Alfa in City Church.</div><div id="00:33:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And that started back for a couple of weeks last night.</div><div id="00:33:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they do it for the first seven weeks next year.</div><div id="00:33:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So I managed to get into that, but not into the Causeway or the Bible class.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you find using Zoom?

year he thought he had it because he came up in a rash.</div><div id="00:37:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And he thought he had it.</div><div id="00:37:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But he did the test and he didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:37:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he came up in a rash with his legs, he thought he had it.</div><div id="00:38:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said to him, we&#039;ll get a test.</div><div id="00:38:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the test came back, I posted it for him.</div><div id="00:38:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And when it came back and I didn&#039;t know, it goes in the ordinary post box.</div><div id="00:38:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said to him, I collected it from his house.</div><div id="00:38:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I thought they went to the post office.</div><div id="00:38:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But they don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:38:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Things like that go in ordinary full of box.</div><div id="00:38:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And my brother said, no, not post office, ordinary full of box.</div><div

they&#039;ve been exempt from wearing a mask.</div><div id="00:39:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So when people say wear your mask, if you&#039;re exempt, you don&#039;t have to.</div><div id="00:39:08.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about wearing the masks?</div><div id="00:39:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind it.</div><div id="00:39:11.000" class="transcript_line"> First what my sister said was strange, but then I got used to it.</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they say, if you&#039;re out, you&#039;ve got to go up to the counter with your mask on.</div><div id="00:39:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, they say inch off, they&#039;re left at the counter with your mask on.</div><div id="00:39:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You haven&#039;t got to leave it on, just put it on to go up to the counter.</div><div id="00:39:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And inch off, you&#039;ve got to put it on before.</div><div id="00:39:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And now I got it because you&#039;ve got to put it on before you get on the bus.</div><div id="00:39:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m more used to it now than when my sister first mentioned it.</div><div id="00:39:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I got several masks because I got them in packs.</div><div id="00:39:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They do them in packs of two or packs of three.</div><div id="00:39:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And the other day, the strap snapped when I was in town.</div><div id="00:39:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to Home Vagans, Foul Land, and in Foul Land, they sold them two in a pack for a mask.</div><div id="00:40:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, who sells them?</div><div id="00:40:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Where can I get one?</div><div id="00:40:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, who sells them?</div><div id="00:40:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Where can I get one?</div><div id="00:40:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That was on Friday when I was going to meet Lisa.</div><div id="00:40:12.000"

I&#039;m honoured.</div><div id="00:40:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was he ringing about?</div><div id="00:40:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He reads the news. He always tells me about what&#039;s going on, what they&#039;ve said, if I haven&#039;t had it on.</div><div id="00:40:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I like challenge all the quizzes.</div><div id="00:40:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m answering the questions.
