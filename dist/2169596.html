    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The End of an Era</div><div id="00:00:03.920" class="transcript_line"> The ownership of the Alfa had given me a chance to try out other cars and marks with various</div><div id="00:00:08.720" class="transcript_line"> impressions. I wasn&#039;t to know it at the time but my next choice would be my last company</div><div id="00:00:13.920" class="transcript_line"> car. One car supplied to me while the Alfa was resting was a Mercedes saloon, a not particularly</div><div id="00:00:20.880" class="transcript_line"> exciting one but I had been impressed with the comfort, power and build quality. So when</div><div id="00:00:26.680" class="transcript_line"> it came the time to make my next choice I went into the Mercedes showroom in Sussex</div><div id="00:00:32.120" class="transcript_line"> to look at the array of gleaming machinery on offer. Among the wide choice of strange</div><div id="00:00:38.240" class="transcript_line"> bulbous A-glasses and large saloons, estate cars and posing style convertibles was a new</div><div id="00:00:44.880" class="transcript_line"> four-seater two-door hatchback coupe simply named the C-Class Coupe. My wife had admired</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> an S-Class Coupe in another corner of the showroom and coming over to the one I was</div><div id="00:00:56.920" class="transcript_line"> looking at that was some tens of thousands of pounds nearer the spending allowance my</div><div id="00:01:01.520" class="transcript_line"> company was wasting on me, she immediately said this one&#039;s a better colour. So we sat</div><div id="00:01:07.120" class="transcript_line"> in it, established the hatchback boot could accompany our dog without the need to try</div><div id="00:01:12.040" class="transcript_line"> it as he wasn&#039;t of a wolfhound&#039;s physique being a collie cross. The next week the garage</div><div id="00:01:18.240" class="transcript_line"> was generous enough to lend me a demonstrator model overnight and I was impressed. Performance</div><div id="00:01:24.360" class="transcript_line"> felt sporty but more refined than the more aggressive alpha which had a higher power</div><div id="00:01:28.840" class="transcript_line"> output and I suspect was lighter. Checking this I found the curb weights are 1330kg of</div><div id="00:01:36.200" class="transcript_line"> the alpha to 1480kg of the Mercedes and a higher brake horsepower for the alpha of 190</div><div id="00:01:43.960" class="transcript_line"> to the Mercedes 163. The sensation of speed was increased in the higher rev in Italian</div><div id="00:01:50.480" class="transcript_line"> by the exhaust noise. The engine in the Mercedes was a smaller 2 litre compressor petrol unit</div><div id="00:01:57.240" class="transcript_line"> with the air to the engine being I was told supercharged. Unfortunately the engine itself</div><div id="00:02:03.120" class="transcript_line"> looked like a central heating boiler and was a let down after the alpha of Isolée but</div><div id="00:02:08.400" class="transcript_line"> then the bonnet was only ever opened to top up the washer so the disappointment was infrequent.</div><div id="00:02:13.480" class="transcript_line"> To reach my allocated budget I was able to specify a large electric glass roof which</div><div id="00:02:20.120" class="transcript_line"> made the interior lighter. I also ordered the automatic gearbox which unfortunately</div><div id="00:02:25.480" class="transcript_line"> left no money from the Mercedes very expensive leather seats so these were a pleasant light</div><div id="00:02:31.040" class="transcript_line"> grey mixture in cloth. I was shortly to regret this when a red wine bottle incident with</div><div id="00:02:36.600" class="transcript_line"> the shopping left an embarrassing stain on the rear seat and caused a faulty seatbelt</div><div id="00:02:42.040" class="transcript_line"> warning message due to the liquid getting to the sensor. The sympathetic dealer sorted</div><div id="00:02:47.720" class="transcript_line"> both out and I think that was the sum total of mishaps in the car. The car was attractive</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> but less showy and less dangerous to drive than the alpha and it didn&#039;t seem to upset</div><div id="00:02:59.480" class="transcript_line"> any of the company hierarchy by being in the company car park. It was to be my last company</div><div id="00:03:05.200" class="transcript_line"> car and maybe in the final year of my employment I had conformed and chosen a dark colour German</div><div id="00:03:11.480" class="transcript_line"> car like many others there although it was a previously outlawed two door with a glass roof.</div><div id="00:03:17.520" class="transcript_line"> It was pleasant to drive, roomy for a coupé so when I took early retirement I considered buying</div><div id="00:03:24.320" class="transcript_line"> it off the company. The combination of a higher residual value coupled with the knowledge of being</div><div id="00:03:30.120" class="transcript_line"> driven as a company car, see above about opening the bonnet to check the oil, eventually persuaded</div><div id="00:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> me against this course of action. Another Mercedes, a Mercedes 300 CE Coupé. I retired early and</div><div id="00:03:46.440" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t yet ready for pensioners car and already having entered the dangerously seductive world</div><div id="00:03:51.560" class="transcript_line"> of classic car ownership I started to research whether it would be possible to own a future classic</div><div id="00:03:57.160" class="transcript_line"> that would give the benefits of a modern vehicle. My conclusion was this dual purpose could be</div><div id="00:04:03.200" class="transcript_line"> provided by Mercedes 300 CE, a large pillarless coupé in deep midnight blue metallic colour with</div><div id="00:04:12.120" class="transcript_line"> a 3.0-litre 24 valve engine and uprated to include remote entry alarm and CD multiplier to add to</div><div id="00:04:19.920" class="transcript_line"> the list of factory fitted extras. These included an electric steel sunroof, a full leather interior,</div><div id="00:04:26.240" class="transcript_line"> automatic gearbox of traction control, headlamp washers, seatbelt arms that slid out electrically</div><div id="00:04:33.680" class="transcript_line"> when the door was closed because of the lack of central pillar. The car when new cost over £50,000</div><div id="00:04:39.760" class="transcript_line"> which would be approximately £90,000 in present-day money and its solidity and power felt like it.</div><div id="00:04:46.760" class="transcript_line"> It cost me £5,000 and felt like a bargain. It was fast and comfortable long-distance cruiser,</div><div id="00:04:53.400" class="transcript_line"> we even had a whole day in France in it, something I never did in the Espace. The spec was impressive</div><div id="00:05:00.080" class="transcript_line"> and for its time must have been close to the pinnacle of auto refinement. It couldn&#039;t be described</div><div id="00:05:05.240" class="transcript_line"> as economical but that was the payback for the power and weight. The engine output was rated at</div><div id="00:05:11.280" class="transcript_line"> 220bhp with acceleration to 60 in under 8 seconds and a claimed top speed of 145mph. It wasn&#039;t so</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> popular with the rest of the household including the dog who slid around on the leather seats and</div><div id="00:05:25.960" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t impressed by the visibility of the coupe styling, although the electric seatbelt feeds seemed</div><div id="00:05:31.320" class="transcript_line"> to intrigue him. In retirement I was doing a little bit of consultancy working involving travelling</div><div id="00:05:37.080" class="transcript_line"> around the country so I was able to enjoy driving it without complaints from either of the passengers,</div><div id="00:05:42.840" class="transcript_line"> canine or otherwise.</div><div id="00:05:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Gallic madness. My second car bought in retirement was an even rarer creature, a Renault Aventime.</div><div id="00:05:53.560" class="transcript_line"> This has been quoted as an example of a concept car being put into production and quoted by others</div><div id="00:06:00.160" class="transcript_line"> as the product of a rush of Gallic blood to the brain that should have been resisted. In retrospect</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> it frankly was quite bonkers but when I first saw one I wanted to own it and I&#039;m not really sure</div><div id="00:06:12.760" class="transcript_line"> why. The concept was to create a four-seater luxury tourer that was around the size and similar body</div><div id="00:06:19.240" class="transcript_line"> shape, a teardrop monoblock, to the Renault Spouse Pipera carrier. But by lowering the suspension,</div><div id="00:06:26.200" class="transcript_line"> installing the 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine, they&#039;d created an early sports utility vehicle.</div><div id="00:06:33.320" class="transcript_line"> The concept car design included two large cantilever-style doors that moved away from</div><div id="00:06:38.440" class="transcript_line"> the car body before swinging open. The cabin was particularly light and airy with pillarless</div><div id="00:06:44.120" class="transcript_line"> side windows and two huge glass sunroofs, one of which opened and both able to be shielded</div><div id="00:06:50.120" class="transcript_line"> by electric fabric blinds. The idea of a pillarless four-seater with a large open sunroof may have</div><div id="00:06:57.400" class="transcript_line"> been conceived for posing along the Corniches in the south of France but the buffeting from the wind</div><div id="00:07:03.080" class="transcript_line"> coupled with the ready availability of exhaust fumes on the roads in Sussex tempered the enjoyment</div><div id="00:07:08.920" class="transcript_line"> of this. Although the global closing function where all four windows and roof would close at</div><div id="00:07:14.360" class="transcript_line"> a single touch of a button was a nice party trick. Similarly the choice of engine giving 220 brake</div><div id="00:07:21.480" class="transcript_line"> horsepower to the front wheels also gave a certain amount of excitement with the power being beyond</div><div id="00:07:27.240" class="transcript_line"> the handling of the car. There was a claimed top speed of 140 miles an hour which I think would be</div><div id="00:07:33.320" class="transcript_line"> terrifying although it would be very tempting to overtake a lowly slung sports car on the autobahn</div><div id="00:07:39.400" class="transcript_line"> at that speed whilst looking down through the large windows from your leather armchairs. The</div><div id="00:07:45.400" class="transcript_line"> interior was as futuristic as the exterior with the dashboard being relatively minimalistic.</div><div id="00:07:51.720" class="transcript_line"> For the time 2002 the car was luxurious and very well equipped with parking sensors,</div><div id="00:07:58.120" class="transcript_line"> sat-nav system, huge glass roof with electric blinds, cruise control, headlamp washers,</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> electric heated seats in tan leather, climate control and a good music system. The music</div><div id="00:08:11.640" class="transcript_line"> system was hidden behind a dampened lid and except multiple CDs which it swallowed one after the other</div><div id="00:08:17.560" class="transcript_line"> into the bowels of the car. Music could be controlled by the steering column or by a remote</div><div id="00:08:23.480" class="transcript_line"> control handset, very Gaelic. All the controls were in odd places, the climate control near the front</div><div id="00:08:30.440" class="transcript_line"> right hand side of the driver on top of the dashboard with the passenger override on the</div><div id="00:08:35.880" class="transcript_line"> passenger side. The switches for the heated seats and door mirrors were both somewhere else and many</div><div id="00:08:41.880" class="transcript_line"> of the controls and positions didn&#039;t seem intuitive so that coupled with the surprising power for such</div><div id="00:08:47.480" class="transcript_line"> a high vehicle made the driving experience a strange one. Again as with some other cars I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:08:54.440" class="transcript_line"> acquired I like to think it was a bargain. When new it retailed at close to £30,000 but after</div><div id="00:09:00.920" class="transcript_line"> just three years the price had dropped like a stone to the £8,000 I paid for it. I&#039;m afraid that at</div><div id="00:09:07.240" class="transcript_line"> that time there were some inherent electrical problems with Renaults namely the coil sets which</div><div id="00:09:12.680" class="transcript_line"> appeared to be fancy plug leads so that the car would occasionally shut down power to one cylinder</div><div id="00:09:18.520" class="transcript_line"> and go into low power limp home mode. Reading posts on the friendly Aventime Owners Forum</div><div id="00:09:25.400" class="transcript_line"> revealed this to be a relatively common problem so much so that I carried a spare coil set in the car.</div><div id="00:09:32.200" class="transcript_line"> After experiencing this three times myself I reluctantly felt that after less than two years</div><div id="00:09:37.480" class="transcript_line"> ownership the car had to go. It seemed a shame as it was the only other car that I&#039;d had along</div><div id="00:09:44.440" class="transcript_line"> with the split screen VW that it was expecting not just to wave to each other but to stop and</div><div id="00:09:49.800" class="transcript_line"> have a conversation and this happened to me a couple of times. I&#039;m sure it would also have</div><div id="00:09:54.840" class="transcript_line"> happened with the Volvo ES but I can&#039;t remember ever seeing another one whilst I was driving it.</div><div id="00:10:00.440" class="transcript_line"> I guess with total production worldwide of 6,000 it was also unlikely. I was told that only 200</div><div id="00:10:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Aventimes are sold in the UK market so I was probably statistically unlikely to meet many.</div><div id="00:10:13.800" class="transcript_line"> I would like to say that the Aventime is the most eccentric and rarest mode of transport that I&#039;d</div><div id="00:10:18.680" class="transcript_line"> owned but sadly this isn&#039;t true. It was possibly mainstream compared to the Carabao. I understand</div><div id="00:10:27.080" class="transcript_line"> that the car was futuristic enough to be used in the sci-fi film Children of Men and some were</div><div id="00:10:32.360" class="transcript_line"> destroyed in the production reducing the 200 total even more.</div></div></p>
