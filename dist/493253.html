    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is William Morris Jones talking again about Barry docks.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you going to tell me something about pilfering?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> In the war time, I personally didn&#039;t have any personal recollection of it.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But I guess what I was told by my father, that the problem there, it wasn&#039;t only true of Barry docks, it was true of all ports.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That the lifeboat emergency rations were plundered by people.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> What sort of people?</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The workers on the dock, dockside workers.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is what resulted if a ship that sank and a man had to go into the lifeboat.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They found there was no food in, no emergency rations.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it had been pilfered?</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it had been pilfered.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And your father told you this?</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he take any action about it?</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Well if they were caught, they would be severely punished.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there a detective force at the docks?</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Not to my knowledge.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s just this lifeboat pilfering?</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in the war time.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> What sort of rations did they have?</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Biscuits, hard rationed biscuits.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Biscuits and things that would keep.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And when they took these biscuits and things, did they keep them for themselves or sell them on?</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were sold on.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh I can tell you now, this again is in the war time.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I personally have no personal recollection of it.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> There was an American army depot there.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> In Barrie?</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In Barrie, yes, a big one, a large one.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you recall the depot?</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember, it was before I went to work there.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was full of all kinds of things for American...</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh you mean the depot was at the docks?</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The depot was at the docks, yes.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was plundered.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> All kinds of things were taken from the American stores.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So they would have had things like chocolate?</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> This kind of thing, chocolates and sweets and all kinds of things.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The American troops were lavishly supplied with all kinds of things, sweets and all kinds of things.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was when your father was working there?</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So he would have had first hand knowledge of it?</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was the secretary you said?</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He ended up as the secretary, yes.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> During the war what did he do there?</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was in a reserved occupation so he wasn&#039;t called up.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He was, I would say, an under manager.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was also a home guard captain.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So as an under manager he would have had to manage the men?</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not directly, no.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He would be involved with office work.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There were foremen and someone who directly managed the men.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you very much.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> If I can think of something else.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, let me know and I&#039;ll come and record it.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll try to think of something else, no.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what about Howard?</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard...</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard Reese.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Howard Reese.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> When did he become a policeman?</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He became a policeman, yes.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When?</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> After the war.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:03:51.000"
