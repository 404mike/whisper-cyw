    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay I just have to say at the top that I&#039;m Marcia Marnie and with Adrian Williams at</div><div id="00:00:05.120" class="transcript_line"> the Fishery Goldcliff and it&#039;s Monday the 1st July 2019.</div><div id="00:00:09.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just going to put that there and I wonder Adrian if you can just start off, can you</div><div id="00:00:15.440" class="transcript_line"> just maybe introduce yourself?</div><div id="00:00:19.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Adrian Williams, I was the last butcher fisherman of the Welsh butcher fisheries.</div><div id="00:00:29.160" class="transcript_line"> There are some left still but they&#039;re in England not in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:33.960" class="transcript_line"> So what brought your family here?</div><div id="00:00:36.360" class="transcript_line"> Just give us the background to that.</div><div id="00:00:38.480" class="transcript_line"> My father, my grandfather ran the Beechley Oust ferry.</div><div id="00:00:44.520" class="transcript_line"> When the Severn Bridge was announced they looked for alternative venues for bridges</div><div id="00:00:52.120" class="transcript_line"> or crossings of some kind up and down the Severn Estuary.</div><div id="00:00:57.800" class="transcript_line"> When the Goldcliff fisheries became available it was one of the parcels of ground along</div><div id="00:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> with the business that they purchased in the early 1960s after they discovered that the</div><div id="00:01:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Severn Bridge was to make the ferry defunct.</div><div id="00:01:15.280" class="transcript_line"> So what was it, their names?</div><div id="00:01:17.280" class="transcript_line"> What were their Christian names?</div><div id="00:01:18.280" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather was Enoch Williams, my father was John Williams.</div><div id="00:01:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Enoch, wow, where were they from?</div><div id="00:01:25.160" class="transcript_line"> My father was born in Newport when my grandfather was an architect for the Newport Borough Council</div><div id="00:01:35.840" class="transcript_line"> and my grandfather was originally from Bonny Mine in Swansea.</div><div id="00:01:40.480" class="transcript_line"> So what, I&#039;m going back a bit, but what took them to, you know, what led them to running</div><div id="00:01:46.560" class="transcript_line"> the Oust ferry?</div><div id="00:01:47.600" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather was an entrepreneurial person who saw that there was a possibility of creating</div><div id="00:01:56.840" class="transcript_line"> a passenger ferry between Beechley and Oust and he had the dream of doing it and had eventually</div><div id="00:02:05.840" class="transcript_line"> got to the point where he was able to finance it with some outside help after he&#039;d worked</div><div id="00:02:11.780" class="transcript_line"> for a few years as an architect.</div><div id="00:02:14.960" class="transcript_line"> He started the Beechley Oust ferries in the late 1920s and then they started carrying</div><div id="00:02:23.880" class="transcript_line"> cars as cars became more prolific and it went from there to when they were closed down</div><div id="00:02:32.040" class="transcript_line"> to having three ferries which used to carry 15 or 16 cars per ferry and obviously history</div><div id="00:02:39.680" class="transcript_line"> shows that if they were still doing it today they&#039;d need more than three ferries, that&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:44.160" class="transcript_line"> for sure.</div><div id="00:02:48.160" class="transcript_line"> So the ferries, I mean, you were telling me a story last week about the last ferry, what</div><div id="00:02:53.760" class="transcript_line"> happened to the, is there one still remaining or is there one still at Chapstow?</div><div id="00:02:57.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one still at Chapstow on the river side, it&#039;s been pulled up out of the river</div><div id="00:03:03.720" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s just up on top of the bank underneath the railway bridge in Chapstow which they&#039;re</div><div id="00:03:09.880" class="transcript_line"> looking for a permanent site for, the Seven Princesses and there&#039;s a restoration project</div><div id="00:03:19.520" class="transcript_line"> going onwards to try and put it back to a part where they can actually use it like a</div><div id="00:03:25.600" class="transcript_line"> bandstand type thing or a display of some kind in the new development of the Mabee site,</div><div id="00:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> the Fairfield Mabee site in Chapstow.</div><div id="00:03:38.120" class="transcript_line"> So when they purchased the fishery, when they purchased the fishery, I want to hold that</div><div id="00:03:45.120" class="transcript_line"> up a little bit, did they have any knowledge of fishing?</div><div id="00:03:48.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:03:50.120" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather was a keen angler, he was a trout fisherman, he would catch trout, he</div><div id="00:03:57.120" class="transcript_line"> used to have fishing rights on certain rivers in Wales, because my grandfather was a very</div><div id="00:04:03.240" class="transcript_line"> keen fly fisherman, but he had no salmon fishing experience or anything to do with commercial</div><div id="00:04:09.440" class="transcript_line"> fishing.</div><div id="00:04:10.440" class="transcript_line"> So what was their knowledge of this place, this fishery before they came, do you know?</div><div id="00:04:16.440" class="transcript_line"> Not really, no, they just knew it was on the side of the river and if it was on the side</div><div id="00:04:21.440" class="transcript_line"> or near the river then they bought it, that was the rule of thumb really.</div><div id="00:04:26.440" class="transcript_line"> So I just wonder if that&#039;s going to get in the way of the river.</div><div id="00:04:31.440" class="transcript_line"> Right, OK.</div><div id="00:04:33.440" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s he doing?</div><div id="00:04:34.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s mowing.</div><div id="00:04:35.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s mowing in the field, is he?</div><div id="00:04:36.440" class="transcript_line"> Er, the side bit.</div><div id="00:04:41.440" class="transcript_line"> Actually, can I come and sit there?</div><div id="00:04:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sure.</div><div id="00:04:44.440" class="transcript_line"> That might be better.</div><div id="00:04:52.440" class="transcript_line"> That might be better.</div><div id="00:04:53.440" class="transcript_line"> No, you won&#039;t be there long.</div><div id="00:04:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Erm, yeah that&#039;s better, that is much better.</div><div id="00:04:57.440" class="transcript_line"> So, do you have any knowledge of the previous owners?</div><div id="00:05:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Only that they also ran the fishmongers in Newport.</div><div id="00:05:08.760" class="transcript_line"> They were Burgess who had the fishmongers where Marks and Spencer&#039;s in Newport town</div><div id="00:05:16.320" class="transcript_line"> centre used to be and they demolished the existing buildings and built the new Marks</div><div id="00:05:23.320" class="transcript_line"> and Spencer&#039;s, which would have been in the 50s I guess, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:05:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And prior to that the owners were people called fennel and fennels were actually tenants</div><div id="00:05:36.960" class="transcript_line"> to Eden College.</div><div id="00:05:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Eden College were the actual owners for the majority of the period of time of the fisheries</div><div id="00:05:45.960" class="transcript_line"> and they were given the fisheries by Henry VIII at the time of the dissolution of the</div><div id="00:05:52.960" class="transcript_line"> monasteries.</div><div id="00:05:54.720" class="transcript_line"> So, when your grandfather and father brought the fishery here, do you remember that?</div><div id="00:06:00.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was four years old.</div><div id="00:06:03.720" class="transcript_line"> So, what&#039;s your earliest memory of it?</div><div id="00:06:11.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good question.</div><div id="00:06:13.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit of a blur really because I&#039;ve done it so many times before but I used to</div><div id="00:06:19.480" class="transcript_line"> come down with my mother mostly because she was the one that used to come to collect the</div><div id="00:06:24.480" class="transcript_line"> fish and take the fish to the station or to wherever we had to take it.</div><div id="00:06:31.480" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d come through before the motorway was built, obviously before the M4 was built.</div><div id="00:06:40.480" class="transcript_line"> So, it would have been 1965, 1966 when we&#039;d have to come through all the lanes from Chapstow</div><div id="00:06:48.240" class="transcript_line"> to Goldcliff.</div><div id="00:06:49.240" class="transcript_line"> I remember having to travel that road which wasn&#039;t the best and then we&#039;d go down to get</div><div id="00:06:57.240" class="transcript_line"> the fish in the old Land Rover which was very unique.</div><div id="00:07:02.240" class="transcript_line"> We were probably one of the only commercial fisheries that used to go to work in a Land</div><div id="00:07:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Rover.</div><div id="00:07:09.240" class="transcript_line"> Go fishing in a Land Rover was the term I suppose.</div><div id="00:07:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Did you bring it down there?</div><div id="00:07:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to drive it down round the corner.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you get it from here?</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Down round there and it&#039;s all hard, it&#039;s all rocks which every spring we&#039;d make it so you</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> could compact it down and then when you get just down in front of the fence on what we</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> call the mile, mile being a local terminology for a very hard clay and it&#039;s almost like</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> rock but it&#039;s not hard rock but you can drive vehicles on it no problem and that&#039;s what</div><div id="00:07:47.760" class="transcript_line"> we used to drive the Land Rover round and go down and then look in all the baskets and</div><div id="00:07:52.760" class="transcript_line"> what you and your men?</div><div id="00:07:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Mr Howells the fisherman and also we had another chap who was called John Newton, local farmer.</div><div id="00:08:04.760" class="transcript_line"> He used to help out as well.</div><div id="00:08:06.240" class="transcript_line"> When Mr Howells, Wyndham Howells was getting older he wasn&#039;t able to drive the vehicle</div><div id="00:08:13.760" class="transcript_line"> so John Newton used to drive the vehicle.</div><div id="00:08:17.440" class="transcript_line"> So you come down here, there&#039;s a slipway here, drive round to the ranks and then would you</div><div id="00:08:22.440" class="transcript_line"> have to climb up the ranks?</div><div id="00:08:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, depending on where the fish was.</div><div id="00:08:25.440" class="transcript_line"> If it was up on the top tier there was rails and posts and you&#039;d step on the rails and</div><div id="00:08:32.440" class="transcript_line"> post like a ladder and then we used to use a tool like a stick with a prong on the end</div><div id="00:08:39.440" class="transcript_line"> of it and the prong used to be put into the fish&#039;s mouth and then you&#039;d force the fish</div><div id="00:08:43.440" class="transcript_line"> backwards with the stick so you could just about reach the tail of the fish from the</div><div id="00:08:49.080" class="transcript_line"> other side of the basket so you&#039;d have to remember where the fish was because sometimes</div><div id="00:08:53.400" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d slip down again and then you&#039;d have to go back round again and push it again and</div><div id="00:08:57.440" class="transcript_line"> sometimes it&#039;d slip back again and you&#039;d have to go round again so sometimes it was a bit</div><div id="00:09:01.300" class="transcript_line"> of a nuisance.</div><div id="00:09:02.300" class="transcript_line"> Take a few times.</div><div id="00:09:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and other times you&#039;d push it too far and it would flop out on the ground which</div><div id="00:09:08.560" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t want to do that because it would get all muddy and also it might bruise the</div><div id="00:09:13.200" class="transcript_line"> fish a bit so we used to use a stick with a special V in it.</div><div id="00:09:20.200" class="transcript_line"> Like something you&#039;d use on the barbecue?</div><div id="00:09:23.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was about six foot long.</div><div id="00:09:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow.</div><div id="00:09:29.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so you could push the fish quite a considerable way back because the baskets themselves were</div><div id="00:09:34.560" class="transcript_line"> about five foot long.</div><div id="00:09:36.520" class="transcript_line"> So you were going to the narrow end?</div><div id="00:09:38.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:39.880" class="transcript_line"> And then pushing it back that way?</div><div id="00:09:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:41.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I see.</div><div id="00:09:42.880" class="transcript_line"> Well you&#039;d have to find the fish to start with because the baskets, because they were</div><div id="00:09:46.640" class="transcript_line"> silver they were made of aluminium in the last few years of the fishery.</div><div id="00:09:52.360" class="transcript_line"> We had aluminium rather than withy or wicker baskets.</div><div id="00:09:58.480" class="transcript_line"> So the fish weren&#039;t that easy to see especially if there was a lot of, you used to get a lot</div><div id="00:10:03.920" class="transcript_line"> of kelp, a lot of seaweed.</div><div id="00:10:06.440" class="transcript_line"> And if there was a lot of kelp about then it would be very, very difficult to see the</div><div id="00:10:10.280" class="transcript_line"> fish.</div><div id="00:10:11.280" class="transcript_line"> So sometimes if you had fish about then you would have to go and push through the kelp</div><div id="00:10:16.800" class="transcript_line"> to check there wasn&#039;t a fish in the basket because it was so full of seaweed.</div><div id="00:10:23.240" class="transcript_line"> So you had to check each every basket.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> More often than not there wasn&#039;t that much kelp about.</div><div id="00:10:28.880" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of baskets to check though?</div><div id="00:10:31.080" class="transcript_line"> Well, 2,300 when I first took it over, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:10:35.880" class="transcript_line"> So how many ranks was that?</div><div id="00:10:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Well it was three ranks in total.</div><div id="00:10:40.360" class="transcript_line"> As time went by the stocks got less and less and the price of the license went up per basket.</div><div id="00:10:50.320" class="transcript_line"> I identified what I thought was the best part of the fishing and I only did that part of</div><div id="00:10:55.800" class="transcript_line"> the fishing.</div><div id="00:10:56.800" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t do the bits where we didn&#039;t use to catch many fish.</div><div id="00:10:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Where did you catch most of the fish?</div><div id="00:11:01.400" class="transcript_line"> Well the best one was what we call the flood rank which is the one round the corner.</div><div id="00:11:04.400" class="transcript_line"> This one here?</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The flood rank was, because it was always covered the flood rank whereas the air rank,</div><div id="00:11:13.880" class="transcript_line"> the top row as we called it, on a neap tide which is a small tide, it would barely be</div><div id="00:11:23.240" class="transcript_line"> covered, hardly any of it would be covered.</div><div id="00:11:25.880" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have no chance unless you were flying fish.</div><div id="00:11:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Flying fish?</div><div id="00:11:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Flying fish, I&#039;m only joking.</div><div id="00:11:31.640" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got no chance of catching anything.</div><div id="00:11:34.640" class="transcript_line"> So you had, what&#039;s the one over here called again?</div><div id="00:11:40.440" class="transcript_line"> The flood.</div><div id="00:11:41.440" class="transcript_line"> The flood.</div><div id="00:11:42.440" class="transcript_line"> The ebb.</div><div id="00:11:43.440" class="transcript_line"> And there was one called the shrimp which was out and there&#039;s like a spit which will</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> show up, well it&#039;s actually the tide&#039;s coming in there.</div><div id="00:11:52.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to have the shrimp which was only a small rank and it wasn&#039;t worth really putting</div><div id="00:11:59.280" class="transcript_line"> putches in it because we caught very few salmon in it.</div><div id="00:12:02.880" class="transcript_line"> But years ago they used to use it for kite fishing.</div><div id="00:12:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Which is a much larger and much more interwoven basket.</div><div id="00:12:14.880" class="transcript_line"> And the front mouth of the basket was between four to five feet wide and it would go down</div><div id="00:12:24.840" class="transcript_line"> to a plug on the end of it and it would be tightly woven so it would catch everything,</div><div id="00:12:32.640" class="transcript_line"> not just salmon, it would catch small whiting, it would catch flatfish and it would catch</div><div id="00:12:39.640" class="transcript_line"> shrimps.</div><div id="00:12:40.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, was it supposed to catch everything?</div><div id="00:12:41.640" class="transcript_line"> It was meant to catch everything, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And there would be a funnel on the end of it with a plug in it and then they would take</div><div id="00:12:51.800" class="transcript_line"> the funnel off, take the plug out and then tip it into a bucket and then bring it back</div><div id="00:12:57.480" class="transcript_line"> up here and then I never did it myself but there was a boiler where they used to...</div><div id="00:13:03.600" class="transcript_line"> What in here?</div><div id="00:13:04.900" class="transcript_line"> It was in the fish house just behind where we are now, the original fish house.</div><div id="00:13:09.040" class="transcript_line"> And so they boil the shrimps and they&#039;d be taken off to the shop in Newport but we never</div><div id="00:13:15.540" class="transcript_line"> did it, we were never really interested in it.</div><div id="00:13:18.680" class="transcript_line"> So the boiler was still here when you came?</div><div id="00:13:21.360" class="transcript_line"> The boiler was still here, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:23.360" class="transcript_line"> But it was something that we never did because it was too labour intensive and we didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:13:29.360" class="transcript_line"> have an outlet for the shrimps etc.</div><div id="00:13:32.320" class="transcript_line"> So rather than using Kite Sweet we&#039;d converted it to butcher fishery but it was very poor,</div><div id="00:13:40.400" class="transcript_line"> very very poor for salmon.</div><div id="00:13:42.400" class="transcript_line"> You still called it the shrimp though?</div><div id="00:13:43.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we still call it the shrimp.</div><div id="00:13:46.400" class="transcript_line"> It was the first to stop because it was labour intensive.</div><div id="00:13:53.400" class="transcript_line"> If you can imagine having to go and look at it at half past two in the morning, dead at</div><div id="00:13:58.400" class="transcript_line"> night in the black darkness, it wasn&#039;t exactly the best thing to have to do and when you</div><div id="00:14:04.720" class="transcript_line"> had no fish in it.</div><div id="00:14:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to do that?</div><div id="00:14:06.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:07.720" class="transcript_line"> When we first started and I soon got fed up with that and so I stopped doing that and</div><div id="00:14:14.720" class="transcript_line"> as the price of the putches increased then we decided not to do the ebb and just ended</div><div id="00:14:23.160" class="transcript_line"> up with the flood.</div><div id="00:14:24.560" class="transcript_line"> How long did you do that before thinking, well this isn&#039;t worth it now?</div><div id="00:14:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, personally I took over the fishery in 1981 and I carried on doing the flood and</div><div id="00:14:38.760" class="transcript_line"> the ebb until about 1992.</div><div id="00:14:43.560" class="transcript_line"> So I suppose, yeah, about 11 years I did the two together and then I gave up the ebb,</div><div id="00:14:50.560" class="transcript_line"> which had 700, 800 baskets.</div><div id="00:14:53.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s still a lot isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Well it sounds a lot but it wasn&#039;t an awful lot because you only put them out once at</div><div id="00:15:00.560" class="transcript_line"> the beginning of the season, take them in at the end of the season and that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:15:03.560" class="transcript_line"> But checking them every day?</div><div id="00:15:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Every day, twice a day.</div><div id="00:15:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Twice a day?</div><div id="00:15:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Twice a day but then it&#039;s only for, well it was for four months of the year, the original</div><div id="00:15:12.560" class="transcript_line"> licence and then towards the end they were trying to reduce it down to just two months</div><div id="00:15:19.720" class="transcript_line"> of the year.</div><div id="00:15:20.720" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d actually cut it to three months of the year.</div><div id="00:15:22.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s the environmental agency?</div><div id="00:15:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the environmental agency.</div><div id="00:15:25.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re trying to get rid of all commercial fisheries.</div><div id="00:15:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Because of their fear about dwindling fish?</div><div id="00:15:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because of the problems with the native species not having an awful lot of fish.</div><div id="00:15:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Fish returning and also there was other complications with it as well.</div><div id="00:15:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Interbreeding was a worry as well where I used to catch fish which I didn&#039;t really understand</div><div id="00:15:53.560" class="transcript_line"> what they were until I realised that they were farmed fish.</div><div id="00:15:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:15:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Because they didn&#039;t look like the proper Atlantic salmon.</div><div id="00:16:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Got out into the system.</div><div id="00:16:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d been released somehow, either accidentally or on purpose I would have thought accidentally.</div><div id="00:16:08.560" class="transcript_line"> And I was catching these funny looking fish which were farmed salmon and the theory was</div><div id="00:16:15.560" class="transcript_line"> that they were going to interbreed with the wild fish and if they did that then that would</div><div id="00:16:22.560" class="transcript_line"> make the, not a true wild salmon, it would be like a hybrid.</div><div id="00:16:29.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was all kinds of other things going on.</div><div id="00:16:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So when your grandfather, father took over, was it withy baskets then?</div><div id="00:16:41.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it was aluminium.</div><div id="00:16:43.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d had aluminium for a few years.</div><div id="00:16:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I think we had some wicker baskets, withy baskets.</div><div id="00:16:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I found a bill for aluminium wire to repair the baskets with.</div><div id="00:16:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:16:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And my father had requested that a rep had called to talk about new baskets.</div><div id="00:17:07.560" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve got a lot of bills and things there, we&#039;ve got a rich date from 65.</div><div id="00:17:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh, so there&#039;s somebody selling the fish as well?</div><div id="00:17:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I believe they&#039;re still manufacturing aluminium products now.</div><div id="00:17:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure whether they&#039;re still in the full evening I think it was.</div><div id="00:17:26.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got the receipt for the specimen.</div><div id="00:17:35.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we ever had, we might have done, I&#039;m not 100% sure,</div><div id="00:17:39.560" class="transcript_line"> whether we had any made ourselves or whether we just inherited them all.</div><div id="00:17:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So when your grandfather and grandfather came you had the three rangs here.</div><div id="00:17:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And presumably they had looked at the books before and thought this is a bit of an earner?</div><div id="00:17:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Well again, funnily enough I found workings out that my father did, it must have been about 1964.</div><div id="00:18:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got the workings out that he jotted down on the back of a piece of paper,</div><div id="00:18:11.560" class="transcript_line"> a bit of Beechley Oars Ferries paper, of what he thought the proposal, the hammership would actually make.</div><div id="00:18:19.560" class="transcript_line"> So something I&#039;ve never seen actually, I only found it while I was looking through the...</div><div id="00:18:24.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not got chucked out.</div><div id="00:18:26.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s all been kept, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:28.560" class="transcript_line"> So did they inherit Wyndham?</div><div id="00:18:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, he was part of the furniture.</div><div id="00:18:34.560" class="transcript_line"> He was 86 when he died and that was about 1983 or 84, no it was probably later, that might have been 86.</div><div id="00:18:46.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember, I have to look in the graveyard.</div><div id="00:18:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So whether he was turn of the century then, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:18:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But he was here all his life virtually, he went away to war.</div><div id="00:19:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh did he?</div><div id="00:19:03.560" class="transcript_line"> He went to the... I don&#039;t know if he was in the First World War or not, but he got posted to certain places.</div><div id="00:19:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And he did do, I believe he was on the anti-aircraft guns in the war here.</div><div id="00:19:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah?</div><div id="00:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> But I can find all that out because I&#039;m friends with his grandson, friendly enough.</div><div id="00:19:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh are you?</div><div id="00:19:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Well I employed after Wyndham died, he used to repair the aluminium baskets, I employed his son, John Howells.</div><div id="00:19:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, for healing?</div><div id="00:19:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So I employed John for, well, until the fishery closed.</div><div id="00:19:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh, yeah I&#039;d love to get back around to Wyndham.</div><div id="00:19:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And then his grandson is a friend of mine.</div><div id="00:19:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Do they live around locally?</div><div id="00:19:47.560" class="transcript_line"> They live in Newport.</div><div id="00:19:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:19:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So what was your memories of Nick Wyndham?</div><div id="00:19:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Did he actually play a role or were your grandparents father and father in kind?</div><div id="00:19:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Well he was most, yes it was more, he was part of the furniture.</div><div id="00:20:03.560" class="transcript_line"> He repaired the baskets which was an important job, but he wasn&#039;t, well I suppose he would have been in his mid-60s when we first took it over.</div><div id="00:20:16.560" class="transcript_line"> So he would have been reasonably fit and capable in those days.</div><div id="00:20:20.560" class="transcript_line"> But as time went by we had to employ somebody else because he wasn&#039;t up to being by himself here.</div><div id="00:20:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And he was always helped out by his nephew as well.</div><div id="00:20:33.560" class="transcript_line"> If John Newton wasn&#039;t available there was another man called Andrew Greenholge.</div><div id="00:20:39.560" class="transcript_line"> I see Walter&#039;s mentioned him this morning.</div><div id="00:20:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well he was a local farmer who was into everything and he was a very cantankerous sort of person.</div><div id="00:20:52.560" class="transcript_line"> He was a cantankerous, yes, that&#039;s the best way of describing him.</div><div id="00:20:57.560" class="transcript_line"> He called the spade a spade and he was a funny old fellow but he was very useful.</div><div id="00:21:05.560" class="transcript_line"> He was always the person that I used to employ with his tractor and trailer when we set the fishing out at the beginning of the season and then we took it up again at the end of the season.</div><div id="00:21:16.560" class="transcript_line"> He was the man that used to come and sort it all out.</div><div id="00:21:19.560" class="transcript_line"> You load all the putters in the back and bring the guy on to the foreshore and then they&#039;d have to be fixed into position.</div><div id="00:21:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So who would be doing that?</div><div id="00:21:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to employ people, whoever was available really.</div><div id="00:21:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Towards the end of it I couldn&#039;t get the locals to do it.</div><div id="00:21:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to have to get people coming from Chepstone.</div><div id="00:21:41.560" class="transcript_line"> I used to go to parts of Chepstone where I knew there was a few unemployed people and say, right, I need a couple of men just for a day or two days&#039; work.</div><div id="00:21:51.560" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d all come then and put a bit of cash in their hands.</div><div id="00:21:56.560" class="transcript_line"> So how long it took? A couple of days?</div><div id="00:21:59.560" class="transcript_line"> It depended, yeah, mostly it would only, depending if it was just the flood, towards the end of it it would only take a day. It would take one tide.</div><div id="00:22:06.560" class="transcript_line"> But when we used to do this, the flood and the ebb together, it was probably three days because there was a lot of work and this one was messy as anything.</div><div id="00:22:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it? Why?</div><div id="00:22:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s very muddy out there.</div><div id="00:22:22.560" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s on peat rather than on marl.</div><div id="00:22:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:27.560" class="transcript_line"> So you can see, you can actually see tracks out in the peat there now.</div><div id="00:22:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Where that&#039;s where the tractor used to tow.</div><div id="00:22:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And so every year we used to get stuck, Pansy gets stuck, sorry, Andrew Greenhouse gets stuck.</div><div id="00:22:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be lots of cursing and swearing, Andrew&#039;s got stuck again, blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="00:22:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d have to go and get either another tractor or get a winch.</div><div id="00:22:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God, really?</div><div id="00:22:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was a real problem.</div><div id="00:22:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have to re-erect the structure itself, the timbers?</div><div id="00:22:59.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to have to, every year we had to maintain the framework, yes.</div><div id="00:23:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Every year we would have to replace.</div><div id="00:23:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Again, that was one of the reasons why I stopped doing this one because in 92 we had a huge gale while the baskets were in place.</div><div id="00:23:19.560" class="transcript_line"> And it damaged a lot of the framework and it lost a lot of the baskets.</div><div id="00:23:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I never saw the baskets again, they were gone.</div><div id="00:23:33.560" class="transcript_line"> So that was one of the other reasons why I decided not to do the ebb.</div><div id="00:23:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Should we go in?</div><div id="00:23:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:41.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit cold out here.</div><div id="00:23:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:23:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got this image, a photograph of Wyndham with his bike and his beret.</div><div id="00:24:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s a good picture, if you&#039;ve got it.</div><div id="00:24:15.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether I got one of those.</div><div id="00:24:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, before they used to use the Land Rover, they used to do it with a push bike.</div><div id="00:24:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Did they? What do you mean they did it with a push bike?</div><div id="00:24:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, they had a butcher&#039;s bike with a pannier on it.</div><div id="00:24:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:24:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve got that picture actually.</div><div id="00:24:33.560" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have a pannier on the front and a pannier on the back.</div><div id="00:24:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d have to put the fish on the bike and then ride it down to the flood.</div><div id="00:24:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And then wheel it back with the fish on the bike.</div><div id="00:24:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:24:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And if there was a lot of fish, he&#039;d have to make several trips.</div><div id="00:25:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow, yes he would.</div><div id="00:25:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:05.560" class="transcript_line"> So this place here, Adrian, this is the fishery. What did it look like when it was a fishery?</div><div id="00:25:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the old fish house.</div><div id="00:25:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this is the fish house?</div><div id="00:25:15.560" class="transcript_line"> This is the old fish house. That&#039;s a good question. That&#039;s what it looked like.</div><div id="00:25:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow, this is here.</div><div id="00:25:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So what am I looking at then?</div><div id="00:25:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s where we were sat, just there when we sat outside.</div><div id="00:25:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:25:33.560" class="transcript_line"> It was just demolished.</div><div id="00:25:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:35.560" class="transcript_line"> The only thing I kept was the weather vane which was on the other place, the other side.</div><div id="00:25:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow. And that&#039;s one of the salmon?</div><div id="00:25:42.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fresh, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Goodness. Quite a big salmon.</div><div id="00:25:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s a couple there.</div><div id="00:25:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow, crikey.</div><div id="00:25:49.560" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s the stick. There we are, you can see the stick there.</div><div id="00:25:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Now what was this for? Oh, the little thing on that side. It&#039;s a little gaff really, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it wasn&#039;t. As I say, it was like a fork, just a two-pronged fork on the end of it.</div><div id="00:26:05.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s such a great photograph. Isn&#039;t it? Wow, I used to really want a car like that.</div><div id="00:26:12.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a Renault 4.</div><div id="00:26:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, as time went by, Land Rovers became expensive.</div><div id="00:26:21.560" class="transcript_line"> So I discovered that Renault 4s were much cheaper and did the job just as well, if not better.</div><div id="00:26:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you bring that down onto the foreshore?</div><div id="00:26:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I used to drive it down.</div><div id="00:26:33.560" class="transcript_line"> What, with the trailer?</div><div id="00:26:34.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, just in the back. I used to fold the seats down in the back, put the trays in the back of the vehicle and away you go.</div><div id="00:26:43.560" class="transcript_line"> What, to collect the salmon?</div><div id="00:26:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God. Really?</div><div id="00:26:48.560" class="transcript_line"> So then you would bring them back up here, would you?</div><div id="00:26:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and then they&#039;d go into the fish house in there. In there there&#039;d be a big fridge and a freezer making ice and what we call a bosh, which is like a big sink.</div><div id="00:27:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And we chuck the fish in the bosh, wash them all off, put them in the fridge, put ice over them and then wait until we&#039;ve got enough to take to market.</div><div id="00:27:15.560" class="transcript_line"> So market would be?</div><div id="00:27:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, in the early days it used to go to Billingsgate.</div><div id="00:27:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:22.560" class="transcript_line"> But that was very early days because the amount of fish that we used to catch grew less and less and less.</div><div id="00:27:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So in the early days it used to go up to, I used to deal with a company called Bennets in Billingsgate.</div><div id="00:27:38.560" class="transcript_line"> But when my father took it over he used to deal with a different company.</div><div id="00:27:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Well I guess it probably became Bennets.</div><div id="00:27:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was established in 1840 apparently and this was H. Barber and Sons.</div><div id="00:27:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So you would take them to Newport Station?</div><div id="00:27:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And then would there be a special train?</div><div id="00:27:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was the post train would take it in the mornings. So it would take it, you&#039;d go up, take it, leave it at the station and then they&#039;d stick it on the post train.</div><div id="00:28:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And then the Billingsgate would send a lorry and they would collect salmon from all over the country, not just from us.</div><div id="00:28:21.560" class="transcript_line"> It would be coming in from Scotland and North Wales and the East Coast of England, anywhere where they&#039;d been catching salmon.</div><div id="00:28:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Could see the other ranks along here as well?</div><div id="00:28:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Well possibly. Yeah I suppose if they had enough fish, yes.</div><div id="00:28:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And so then that would go up to Billingsgate Market.</div><div id="00:28:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So that is?</div><div id="00:28:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Well that one&#039;s in 1971.</div><div id="00:28:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And this is a receipt to you for how many fish you had?</div><div id="00:28:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So there was one box of five fish.</div><div id="00:29:03.560" class="transcript_line"> 67 pounds. Wow. I mean, carriage delivery in toll.</div><div id="00:29:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s...</div><div id="00:29:15.560" class="transcript_line"> 48 pounds. Wow. Gosh. What a lovely document.</div><div id="00:29:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well there&#039;s a better day there. There&#039;s some...</div><div id="00:29:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Got so much rubbish here.</div><div id="00:29:35.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not rubbish though, is it?</div><div id="00:29:37.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why it keeps it all...</div><div id="00:29:39.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice stuff, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:29:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s just lovely.</div><div id="00:29:41.560" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s two boxes of fish there.</div><div id="00:29:43.560" class="transcript_line"> 22 fish. So this would be the 28th of the 5th, 71.</div><div id="00:29:50.560" class="transcript_line"> So that was a good season. They had 154 pounds for those in 1971.</div><div id="00:29:57.560" class="transcript_line"> I wonder how many days&#039; work that represented?</div><div id="00:30:00.560" class="transcript_line"> That was probably a couple of tides, two or three tides I guess, at least.</div><div id="00:30:05.560" class="transcript_line"> So two tides a day, so you&#039;re doing that twice a day?</div><div id="00:30:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:13.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite hard work.</div><div id="00:30:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it wasn&#039;t hard work as such because it was only for an hour or so.</div><div id="00:30:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Because once the tide... you&#039;d have to wait for the tide to go out.</div><div id="00:30:25.560" class="transcript_line"> So as the tide went out, you could follow the water down and see if you got any fish.</div><div id="00:30:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Or you could just wait for the tide to go out and then just go down and do it in one quick...</div><div id="00:30:35.560" class="transcript_line"> which is what we would do in sort of the night time. We&#039;d just go down when the tide was out.</div><div id="00:30:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you have lights?</div><div id="00:30:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to have big halogen lamps.</div><div id="00:30:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever get caught out by the tide?</div><div id="00:30:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I lost a few cars.</div><div id="00:30:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Have you? Why?</div><div id="00:30:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was more looking for baskets. When the baskets used to get washed out,</div><div id="00:31:01.560" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d get a bit of wind and tide.</div><div id="00:31:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And it would knock the baskets out at the top of the fishing.</div><div id="00:31:08.560" class="transcript_line"> And I know where they were. They&#039;d go up into the sand. You could see the sand.</div><div id="00:31:12.560" class="transcript_line"> I know where they were. So being lazy, I wouldn&#039;t walk to go and get them.</div><div id="00:31:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d take a shovel and... because you&#039;d have to dig it out, basically.</div><div id="00:31:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I took the car up there to get so far and then I&#039;d walk for the rest of it.</div><div id="00:31:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Not the Renault?</div><div id="00:31:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Lost the Renault 4 once, yes.</div><div id="00:31:32.560" class="transcript_line"> What happened?</div><div id="00:31:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, the wheels got stuck in the mud and I couldn&#039;t get it out.</div><div id="00:31:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you get the basket out?</div><div id="00:31:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Probably, yes.</div><div id="00:31:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And then you had to walk back with it?</div><div id="00:31:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, it&#039;s not heavy. It&#039;s very light.</div><div id="00:31:46.560" class="transcript_line"> But there might have been half a dozen, you see. So I would have needed the car then to get them.</div><div id="00:31:53.560" class="transcript_line"> So the fish house, it looks really tall in the photograph. Why was it so tall?</div><div id="00:32:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you have rooms upstairs?</div><div id="00:32:01.560" class="transcript_line"> No, there was no rooms upstairs, but it used to have a system in it where you had...</div><div id="00:32:07.560" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t see it on this very well, but there&#039;s a grill. Can you see the grill?</div><div id="00:32:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:13.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have a grill both ends. So it was designed to allow the wind to blow through so you could open the grills so it would keep it cool in there.</div><div id="00:32:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, okay. Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:25.560" class="transcript_line"> But prior to this, there was a house attached to this as well.</div><div id="00:32:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Before this part of it here was older than this part here.</div><div id="00:32:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And what was that part then?</div><div id="00:32:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, this was a part of the original house because there wasn&#039;t an original house here which was pulled down in the 40s.</div><div id="00:32:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah. Do you know much about that?</div><div id="00:32:50.560" class="transcript_line"> No, not really. It was just where the people used to stay, I suppose, when it was summertime. I don&#039;t know much about it at all, to be honest.</div><div id="00:33:02.560" class="transcript_line"> So would Wyndham stay in the fish house during the season?</div><div id="00:33:07.560" class="transcript_line"> He wouldn&#039;t live there. No, he lived down South Marsh Lane. He would come... well, he used to cycle on his bike to get to the fishing.</div><div id="00:33:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And then in latter years, he had a little moped.</div><div id="00:33:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really? Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the show used to provide him. So he could come and do his bits and pieces, repair the baskets.</div><div id="00:33:30.560" class="transcript_line"> So would you have a fire somewhere to boil a cup of tea?</div><div id="00:33:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, there&#039;s probably a photograph of that somewhere. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve gotten loads of photographs.</div><div id="00:33:39.560" class="transcript_line"> But he would have his sort of living area in the daytime. He had like a day bed where he could have a snooze.</div><div id="00:33:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And then he&#039;d have a coke fire, which all the schools had them at the turn of the century, these pot stoves.</div><div id="00:34:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And he had one of those, which used to keep himself warm. He had asbestos fingers.</div><div id="00:34:07.560" class="transcript_line"> He used to be able to lift the top of the coke fire off with his fingers. I don&#039;t know how.</div><div id="00:34:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And then he&#039;d be able to fill it up with coke, not cold coke, which is what they used at the steelworks.</div><div id="00:34:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:34:25.560" class="transcript_line"> He used to get out very hot, red hot sometimes. But somewhere I&#039;ve got more photographs.</div><div id="00:34:32.560" class="transcript_line"> And there is one of him in the other, this building here is the buildings over there.</div><div id="00:34:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And what was that building for?</div><div id="00:34:42.560" class="transcript_line"> That was for repairing the baskets. That&#039;s where they used to do the basket making and repairing.</div><div id="00:34:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Is that where they were also stored in the winter?</div><div id="00:34:49.560" class="transcript_line"> The baskets, no, they were stored outside. They were just left outside in racks.</div><div id="00:34:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So this model here, that&#039;s in Newport Museum, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:34:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It could be. My brother&#039;s got that particular one, in fact.</div><div id="00:35:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:35:03.560" class="transcript_line"> But I believe he did present one to the museum.</div><div id="00:35:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ve seen it. It&#039;s in the stalls.</div><div id="00:35:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, is it? Okay.</div><div id="00:35:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s in the stalls.</div><div id="00:35:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:35:13.560" class="transcript_line"> So I imagine, or maybe not, that when your father and grandfather arrived,</div><div id="00:35:20.560" class="transcript_line"> that they looked to Wyndham&#039;s for his knowledge of operating a rack?</div><div id="00:35:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I would think so, yes.</div><div id="00:35:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:28.560" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t rocket science, but we tried different things.</div><div id="00:35:31.560" class="transcript_line"> I tried putting baskets in the wrong way round and doing all different things like that, experimenting.</div><div id="00:35:36.560" class="transcript_line"> But none of it worked. It was always the way that it always had been.</div><div id="00:35:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And so that was the way we always went back to.</div><div id="00:35:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever sell to local people?</div><div id="00:35:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, anybody in a farm that used to turn up or anybody who wanted it, restaurants, et cetera.</div><div id="00:35:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:35:54.560" class="transcript_line"> People in Chepstow, because I lived in Chepstow, used to take it to people in there.</div><div id="00:35:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And so, yeah, as the price plummeted because of the farm salmon,</div><div id="00:36:06.560" class="transcript_line"> we had to find other better ways of selling it.</div><div id="00:36:11.560" class="transcript_line"> So rather than sending it to London, we sold it to the local hostels, hotels, restaurants.</div><div id="00:36:17.560" class="transcript_line"> So we used to sell it to us and Chepstow.</div><div id="00:36:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever weigh each individual salmon?</div><div id="00:36:23.560" class="transcript_line"> I always weighed it, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what your heaviest one was?</div><div id="00:36:26.560" class="transcript_line"> 33 and a half.</div><div id="00:36:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:36:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I have a picture of it somewhere, but wow, I&#039;ve got no idea.</div><div id="00:36:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Really? That&#039;s a big one.</div><div id="00:36:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was the biggest one I ever had.</div><div id="00:36:36.560" class="transcript_line"> There was talk of bigger ones before I took over here.</div><div id="00:36:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Was there a fishing record here?</div><div id="00:36:42.560" class="transcript_line"> We had to keep records by law.</div><div id="00:36:45.560" class="transcript_line"> We had to keep a record of every fish caught.</div><div id="00:36:48.560" class="transcript_line"> So I haven&#039;t got any again that I&#039;ve got somewhere.</div><div id="00:36:54.560" class="transcript_line"> This is all I could find.</div><div id="00:36:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got all the records of all the years.</div><div id="00:36:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And it tells you how many fish were caught on every day.</div><div id="00:37:02.560" class="transcript_line"> My God.</div><div id="00:37:03.560" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t very good reading, I&#039;m afraid.</div><div id="00:37:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it handwritten in the early days?</div><div id="00:37:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:37:12.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to do it on like a photocopied form.</div><div id="00:37:18.560" class="transcript_line"> But then towards the end we used to do it on a specially carbonated paper</div><div id="00:37:23.560" class="transcript_line"> that the environment agency used to provide.</div><div id="00:37:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So they would give me a book each season.</div><div id="00:37:31.560" class="transcript_line"> And then I would fill out every day.</div><div id="00:37:35.560" class="transcript_line"> But as the years went by, as we didn&#039;t fish as much, etc., it was pretty dismal.</div><div id="00:37:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And this was very reliant on the weather here.</div><div id="00:37:48.560" class="transcript_line"> This particular fishery was very reliant because of where we are.</div><div id="00:37:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s so far from one side to the other, seven miles.</div><div id="00:37:57.560" class="transcript_line"> If the wind was in the wrong direction, it would blow the freshwater stream,</div><div id="00:38:02.560" class="transcript_line"> which is what the fish would be looking for.</div><div id="00:38:04.560" class="transcript_line"> It would blow it out to sea and we wouldn&#039;t catch anything.</div><div id="00:38:08.560" class="transcript_line"> So we were always looking for a nice southwest wind or a southerly wind.</div><div id="00:38:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Always waiting to see what happens.</div><div id="00:38:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Is it a bit like the lambing season?</div><div id="00:38:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Pretty exhausting, you have to be up all hours.</div><div id="00:38:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, it was miserable times.</div><div id="00:38:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it wasn&#039;t like every day was the same day.</div><div id="00:38:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Every day was an hour&#039;s difference or more.</div><div id="00:38:33.560" class="transcript_line"> So if it was midnight one night, then it would be one o&#039;clock the next night.</div><div id="00:38:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And then the next night it might be quarter past two.</div><div id="00:38:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Because the difference in the tides, they don&#039;t actually follow that it&#039;s an hour.</div><div id="00:38:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s a neap tide, a neap tide goes out slower.</div><div id="00:38:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s more like an hour and a half.</div><div id="00:38:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And then if it&#039;s a spring tide, it&#039;s less.</div><div id="00:38:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s less than an hour.</div><div id="00:38:57.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a little bit complicated, but it&#039;s never the same time.</div><div id="00:39:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever feel, or your father and grandmother,</div><div id="00:39:06.560" class="transcript_line"> feel that we&#039;re part of this dying tradition?</div><div id="00:39:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh definitely, yeah, towards the end.</div><div id="00:39:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I fought it very hard when they tried to extinguish the fishery.</div><div id="00:39:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I wanted to keep it as a heritage thing.</div><div id="00:39:23.560" class="transcript_line"> So I got a, well this is part of the package I put together.</div><div id="00:39:30.560" class="transcript_line"> To try and maintain the heritage of it all.</div><div id="00:39:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s one of the reasons why I carried on doing it.</div><div id="00:39:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I thought it was something unique to the Wales coastline.</div><div id="00:39:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so did you get nowhere with that?</div><div id="00:39:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Well in the end I was compensated, not an awful lot of money,</div><div id="00:39:50.560" class="transcript_line"> but they compensated me, I don&#039;t know, I can&#039;t really remember.</div><div id="00:39:55.560" class="transcript_line"> What, the environment agency?</div><div id="00:39:57.560" class="transcript_line"> The environment agency, yeah.</div><div id="00:39:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well I was paid by the, by the Wye and...</div><div id="00:40:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Pusk.</div><div id="00:40:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Wye Foundation, the Nask Foundation, the Wye and Nask Foundation.</div><div id="00:40:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:40:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Not to fish, they paid me to stop fishing for a few years.</div><div id="00:40:15.560" class="transcript_line"> And then when it came to it, after that period stopped,</div><div id="00:40:18.560" class="transcript_line"> the environment agency said, right, we want you to stop altogether.</div><div id="00:40:23.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll either pay for you not to fish permanently,</div><div id="00:40:27.560" class="transcript_line"> or we&#039;ll pass an act of parliament and we&#039;ll get you out that way.</div><div id="00:40:32.560" class="transcript_line"> And they were trying to reduce the amount of time,</div><div id="00:40:35.560" class="transcript_line"> from three months to two months,</div><div id="00:40:37.560" class="transcript_line"> and so basically I knew I was on a hide and do nothing,</div><div id="00:40:41.560" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t compete against the environment agency,</div><div id="00:40:43.560" class="transcript_line"> unlike Nigel Maud, who&#039;s still competing with them.</div><div id="00:40:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know, he&#039;s got some energy there, hasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:40:50.560" class="transcript_line"> He has, in fact that&#039;s probably about him, that article there.</div><div id="00:40:54.560" class="transcript_line"> When did it stop then Adrian?</div><div id="00:40:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Here, the last time I was fishing was 1999.</div><div id="00:41:01.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite a long time though.</div><div id="00:41:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Twenty years.</div><div id="00:41:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Was your father still alive then when you stopped?</div><div id="00:41:06.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:41:09.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, that one&#039;s about, well that is probably to do with Nigel Maud,</div><div id="00:41:15.560" class="transcript_line"> somewhere along the way.</div><div id="00:41:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy it though?</div><div id="00:41:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh it was great, yeah, it was a real talking point.</div><div id="00:41:21.560" class="transcript_line"> It was unusual, you know, it was unique.</div><div id="00:41:24.560" class="transcript_line"> I had other jobs, not proper jobs,</div><div id="00:41:27.560" class="transcript_line"> because I could never have a proper job.</div><div id="00:41:30.560" class="transcript_line"> I always had salesman jobs, I worked for Rank Xerox for a bit,</div><div id="00:41:35.560" class="transcript_line"> trying to sell their photocopies, that was a disaster.</div><div id="00:41:38.560" class="transcript_line"> God, everyone&#039;s worked for Rank Xerox.</div><div id="00:41:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, lots of people work for them.</div><div id="00:41:44.560" class="transcript_line"> And then I worked for a company called Welsh Glass,</div><div id="00:41:47.560" class="transcript_line"> and I sold replacement windows, which I was quite successful at.</div><div id="00:41:52.560" class="transcript_line"> I worked for them for fifteen years.</div><div id="00:41:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:41:56.560" class="transcript_line"> But when this finished, were you sad, or just accepted it?</div><div id="00:42:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, I was sad, but I suppose I had to accept the fact that I wasn&#039;t catching the fish.</div><div id="00:42:07.560" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t getting any proper money out of it, I wasn&#039;t earning anything from it.</div><div id="00:42:12.560" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t tell the advice, I&#039;d better keep quiet really.</div><div id="00:42:15.560" class="transcript_line"> You can scrub that all out, nobody need know that.</div><div id="00:42:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, but I was doing it because I enjoyed doing it.</div><div id="00:42:24.560" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t doing it to make money, really, because I wasn&#039;t making any real money.</div><div id="00:42:30.560" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, it was different. Very unusual.</div><div id="00:42:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever see Wyndham repairing the baskets and stuff like that?</div><div id="00:42:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Only the aluminium ones, yeah, not the wooden ones,</div><div id="00:42:43.560" class="transcript_line"> because that was before my time.</div><div id="00:42:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Wyndham used to help him at one point, and then his son John used to do them after Wyndham died.</div><div id="00:42:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So was there a skill to it?</div><div id="00:42:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say it was a great skill, but you had to know how the basket worked,</div><div id="00:43:05.560" class="transcript_line"> you needed to know how to make the bends in the pieces of aluminium wire,</div><div id="00:43:11.560" class="transcript_line"> but it wasn&#039;t a very skillful job, but to have made one out of withy, that was a skill.</div><div id="00:43:18.560" class="transcript_line"> The Morgan boys, as you probably know, they make them still. That is a skill.</div><div id="00:43:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they look lovely too, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:43:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:43:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever find anything in your baskets that wasn&#039;t a salmon, or wasn&#039;t a fish for something unusual?</div><div id="00:43:33.560" class="transcript_line"> I always dreaded a body, but I never got one.</div><div id="00:43:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Never got one, luckily. Because that was something my father used to do.</div><div id="00:43:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Because we always had boats on the river, he would be the one that they turned to go and find a body</div><div id="00:43:51.560" class="transcript_line"> if somebody jumped off one of the bridges.</div><div id="00:43:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh God, really?</div><div id="00:43:55.560" class="transcript_line"> So he would be the person that would have to go and recover the body.</div><div id="00:43:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:43:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, before the days of the lifeboats and the sarah and whatever.</div><div id="00:44:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Were they always boatmen then, your family?</div><div id="00:44:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, my grandfather, as I say, was an architect. He had nothing to do with it.

I used to have boats here.</div><div id="00:44:30.560" class="transcript_line"> He used to keep his boats in Chepstow, either in the Wye or in Chepstow Pill.</div><div id="00:44:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we had boats in Cornwall and places, West Wales.</div><div id="00:44:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go out to Denny Island?</div><div id="00:44:43.560" class="transcript_line"> I went there once.</div><div id="00:44:45.560" class="transcript_line"> How did you get there?</div><div id="00:44:47.560" class="transcript_line"> I got there in a boat, a Dory, many years ago.</div><div id="00:44:51.560" class="transcript_line"> I met somebody recently who walked there with cattle.</div><div id="00:44:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t know if they can do that.

There&#039;s not much there.</div><div id="00:45:18.560" class="transcript_line"> What is there? I mean, why do you...</div><div id="00:45:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Why did you go there?</div><div id="00:45:26.560" class="transcript_line"> We went to have a look at it. Just went out to somewhere to go,</div><div id="00:45:29.560" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s very few places to go in a boat from here.</div><div id="00:45:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So we went out to the Denny. It&#039;s about, oh, it&#039;s probably six miles from here.</div><div id="00:45:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s an all-way out, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:45:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And there wasn&#039;t much there. It was mostly bird nests.</div><div id="00:45:48.560" class="transcript_line"> But we would have gone there probably July, August,</div><div id="00:45:51.560" class="transcript_line"> so the birds would have probably finished nesting by that time.</div><div id="00:45:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But I can&#039;t remember. It was a long time ago.</div><div id="00:45:59.560" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t a lot of grass on it.</div><div id="00:46:01.560" class="transcript_line"> He swears that they took the cows out there to graze.</div><div id="00:46:05.560" class="transcript_line"> You were telling me about the farm next door that used to...</div><div id="00:46:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it a hospital or something?</div><div id="00:46:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, no, it was...

I&#039;m not sure when.</div><div id="00:46:35.560" class="transcript_line"> But they mentioned to me that if you were going to have a baby,</div><div id="00:46:41.560" class="transcript_line"> it must have been somebody who knew what they were doing.</div><div id="00:46:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Like a midwife, maybe?</div><div id="00:46:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Before midwives, this is 100 years ago, 90-odd years ago.</div><div id="00:46:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Before the NHS, you&#039;d have somebody who knew what they were doing,</div><div id="00:46:58.560" class="transcript_line"> not a doctor or whatever.</div><div id="00:47:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And the old farmhouse used to be a place where they would come to have their children.</div><div id="00:47:09.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so interesting.</div><div id="00:47:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, the only thing I can suggest is that you talk to Sue Waters,</div><div id="00:47:14.560" class="transcript_line"> because she would probably know better than me about it.</div><div id="00:47:17.560" class="transcript_line"> But I know there&#039;s a lady called Bunty Withers who lives in Lydney,</div><div id="00:47:21.560" class="transcript_line"> who she always talks about the farm and about how she was born there, etc.</div><div id="00:47:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Really? Bunty Withers? What a fantastic name.</div><div id="00:47:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, she&#039;s now Bunty Stickler.</div><div id="00:47:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah? And she was born out here?</div><div id="00:47:37.560" class="transcript_line"> She was born, she says, in the farm.</div><div id="00:47:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:47:41.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was a bit different to what it is now, you see.</div><div id="00:47:44.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a much smaller building, and it was part of the Priory.</div><div id="00:47:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, of course, yeah.</div><div id="00:47:53.560" class="transcript_line"> But who else? Again, you need to talk to the Waterses.</div><div id="00:47:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:47:58.560" class="transcript_line"> They would know much more about it than me.</div><div id="00:48:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Martin would know more about it than me, but he probably wouldn&#039;t know that much about it.</div><div id="00:48:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Martin Hayeswell is the guy that owns it now.</div><div id="00:48:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, somebody should actually go and speak to him.</div><div id="00:48:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, if you can get him. He&#039;s not there very often.</div><div id="00:48:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t he? No.</div><div id="00:48:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever have people passing by and saying, oh, I used to fish there?</div><div id="00:48:20.560" class="transcript_line"> All the time.</div><div id="00:48:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Really? Yeah?</div><div id="00:48:25.560" class="transcript_line"> I get people come over, you used to come down, you were the boy, blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="00:48:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:48:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:48:32.560" class="transcript_line"> But do you ever think, when you&#039;re here in the winter and you have a high tide, does it ever intimidate you?</div><div id="00:48:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it must be quite something to see.</div><div id="00:48:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, the house has been here for 27 years, and it&#039;s pretty well built.</div><div id="00:48:52.560" class="transcript_line"> When I built it, I built it not with my own hands, but I&#039;d specified it all, designed it all, and said I want this, that and the other.</div><div id="00:49:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And so we haven&#039;t done too badly. It hasn&#039;t flooded or anything like that because it&#039;s higher.</div><div id="00:49:07.560" class="transcript_line"> But we do get a lot of breaking spray coming over the top of the wall when it&#039;s windy, when it&#039;s very windy.</div><div id="00:49:16.560" class="transcript_line"> That must be daunting.</div><div id="00:49:18.560" class="transcript_line"> It is if you stood in the window upstairs.</div><div id="00:49:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I can show you some video footage of it if you like.</div><div id="00:49:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I actually came across some on YouTube.</div><div id="00:49:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, probably stuff I took then.</div><div id="00:49:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, maybe. And it was coming through the gates there?</div><div id="00:49:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s stuff I&#039;ve posted on YouTube.</div><div id="00:49:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. Oh, crap.</div><div id="00:49:36.560" class="transcript_line"> So the fact that at high tide, down there, it&#039;s below sea level, that doesn&#039;t intimidate you?</div><div id="00:49:42.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, not at all. No, we&#039;re way above the high tide line here, so we&#039;ve got no problem.</div><div id="00:49:49.560" class="transcript_line"> The other building down there, that floods occasionally.</div><div id="00:49:52.560" class="transcript_line"> The cafe?</div><div id="00:49:53.560" class="transcript_line"> No, the other house where they used to repair the baskets. That used to flood.</div><div id="00:50:02.560" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve had a new ramp put in so it doesn&#039;t flood as often as it used to.</div><div id="00:50:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to ask, Adrian, that I haven&#039;t asked you about?</div><div id="00:50:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Not really. I can&#039;t think, really.</div><div id="00:50:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Could I take some copies of these photographs?</div><div id="00:50:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Of course you can.</div><div id="00:50:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Is that okay? You&#039;ll be credited with everything, of course.</div><div id="00:50:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I keep meaning to, too lazy to do it, to scan it all and then post it on, because my website, I&#039;ve got goldcliff.net.</div><div id="00:50:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Have you?</div><div id="00:50:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, www.goldcliff.net, which I never ever get around to doing. I&#039;ve had it for 20 years and I kept meaning to do it and I never do it.</div><div id="00:50:50.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great. It takes a long time to scan loads of stuff like this.</div><div id="00:50:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:50:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:50:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I&#039;ve lost all kinds of pictures, but as you say, things like that one there, that&#039;s a great picture.</div><div id="00:51:04.560" class="transcript_line"> And you reckon that&#039;s the 1920s?</div><div id="00:51:06.560" class="transcript_line"> It says 1929, whoever wrote it on there.</div><div id="00:51:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s here?</div><div id="00:51:12.560" class="transcript_line"> This is the flood, yes.</div><div id="00:51:14.560" class="transcript_line"> And all the others, do you reckon, are from here?</div><div id="00:51:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, not all of them. Some of them are, some of them aren&#039;t. Most of these are.</div><div id="00:51:25.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this is fantastic, isn&#039;t it, this?</div><div id="00:51:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:51:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:51:38.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s probably quite big. I might have to get my big scanner out. Is that okay?</div><div id="00:51:42.560" class="transcript_line"> If you want to, yeah.</div><div id="00:51:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Is that okay?</div><div id="00:51:44.560" class="transcript_line"> If you want.</div><div id="00:51:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I just don&#039;t want to take too much of your time.</div><div id="00:51:47.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s all right.</div><div id="00:51:48.560" class="transcript_line"> That means I have to get the whole caboodle out.</div><div id="00:51:59.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this is a great little thing for little photos.</div><div id="00:52:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:52:12.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve seen this one, I&#039;ve seen this.
