    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m in Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, and I&#039;m talking to Lance</div><div id="00:00:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Jones who is going to tell us about his father&#039;s involvement in building the Mulberry Harbour.</div><div id="00:00:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Lance.</div><div id="00:00:12.440" class="transcript_line"> Hi. In fact, it was my grandfather, my Tide, who was the guy involved. His name was Charles</div><div id="00:00:19.340" class="transcript_line"> Price Williams, originally of Shridlan, and then was living in Abigail with my nine, his</div><div id="00:00:26.720" class="transcript_line"> wife at the time. He was born in 1907, so he was actually too old to fight in the Second</div><div id="00:00:32.860" class="transcript_line"> World War, but as a blacksmith, he had a valued occupation. And so having built landing craft</div><div id="00:00:40.040" class="transcript_line"> and helped repair bombed out places like in Birmingham and in London and so forth, he</div><div id="00:00:48.880" class="transcript_line"> was then brought on to help build the Mulberry Harbours and the structures related to Mulberry</div><div id="00:00:56.480" class="transcript_line"> Harbours at Conwy. Still living at home, whereas he previously lived in compounds and accommodation</div><div id="00:01:03.960" class="transcript_line"> when he&#039;d been working in Birmingham and Glasgow and so forth. In Conwy, he was helping to</div><div id="00:01:09.320" class="transcript_line"> build the Mulberry Harbours near Quimham and for the Mulberry Harbours. So he was very</div><div id="00:01:18.160" class="transcript_line"> proud of what he did, and I know he felt somewhat, he felt the fact that he was too old to fight</div><div id="00:01:27.400" class="transcript_line"> and others that he knew were going to fight, but in his way, he was doing the bit that</div><div id="00:01:31.900" class="transcript_line"> he could, and he was proud of what he did do.</div><div id="00:01:34.920" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t live in the, because many of them were in the old convalescent homes in</div><div id="00:01:40.680" class="transcript_line"> Tuganoa and around, but apparently he traveled in every day by train, presumably.</div><div id="00:01:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I believe that, I mean, I know that he was based from home, he never talked about</div><div id="00:01:50.280" class="transcript_line"> having lived away, and of course, there&#039;s a train station in Naba Gala and there&#039;s the</div><div id="00:01:55.880" class="transcript_line"> train station at Llandudno Junction. So he never talked about living away, so I just</div><div id="00:02:02.760" class="transcript_line"> always suppose.</div><div id="00:02:03.760" class="transcript_line"> He may have walked actually from Llandudno Junction to the Mulberry, it wouldn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:02:06.960" class="transcript_line"> been that far to go on over Telford&#039;s Bridge. So did he know what he was building? They&#039;ll</div><div id="00:02:14.680" class="transcript_line"> say they didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:15.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, he always talked about it, sort of very much in the past tense, and I think</div><div id="00:02:23.560" class="transcript_line"> it was only at the end of what they&#039;d done, they realized that they were building these</div><div id="00:02:27.160" class="transcript_line"> Mulberry harbors. They were just, you know, structures of steel, weren&#039;t they, that they</div><div id="00:02:31.880" class="transcript_line"> were making, but for what he didn&#039;t know, I don&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:02:34.960" class="transcript_line"> And you don&#039;t know which year he started, because I wondered whether he had been building</div><div id="00:02:39.880" class="transcript_line"> on Joris Hughes&#039;s original Hippo and Crocs, or whether he actually built the three pierheads.</div><div id="00:02:49.600" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know what year he started in Conway on the Mulberry Harbour,</div><div id="00:02:54.480" class="transcript_line"> so what I do know is that he pretty much worked right the way through from 1940, doing war-related</div><div id="00:03:02.960" class="transcript_line"> work and being taken from one place to another place to help rebuild and construct, if you</div><div id="00:03:08.600" class="transcript_line"> like.</div><div id="00:03:09.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very proud of his war work, because he was an older man, and he&#039;d given his time</div><div id="00:03:14.320" class="transcript_line"> and his older years to construct something that was very important in the war and all</div><div id="00:03:20.080" class="transcript_line"> the other things that he did.</div><div id="00:03:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And my Tide was a great storyteller, so he always had a story to tell about everything</div><div id="00:03:27.720" class="transcript_line"> that he&#039;d done. I think, unfortunately, because I moved away to go to university, I used to</div><div id="00:03:36.960" class="transcript_line"> see him every morning because I was his paperboy. So every morning I&#039;d have 20 minutes with</div><div id="00:03:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Tide and we&#039;d have a cup of tea and so forth. When I moved away, he was still there, and</div><div id="00:03:46.360" class="transcript_line"> I asked him, rather than actually lose the story so I don&#039;t hear the stories and so forth,</div><div id="00:03:51.200" class="transcript_line"> I gave him a book and a pen to write stories down. But unfortunately, he kind of got through</div><div id="00:03:58.920" class="transcript_line"> his early years in the book, so he talked as a child, but he never really wrote his</div><div id="00:04:04.360" class="transcript_line"> life as an adult. So that&#039;s a bit of a...</div><div id="00:04:06.600" class="transcript_line"> A bit of a regret.</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t have his wartime...</div><div id="00:04:09.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have his wartime records.</div><div id="00:04:10.800" class="transcript_line"> So did he get a medal at the end of that? Any commendation?</div><div id="00:04:13.880" class="transcript_line"> No, not that I&#039;m aware of at all.</div><div id="00:04:15.800" class="transcript_line"> And yet his war work was really important.</div><div id="00:04:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:04:19.600" class="transcript_line"> And he survived it and he was cheerful and well afterwards.</div><div id="00:04:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. He was fine, absolutely fine. And it&#039;s interesting that the family</div><div id="00:04:31.360" class="transcript_line"> was on my mother&#039;s side of the family. The family after that, they all served, they were</div><div id="00:04:38.160" class="transcript_line"> in all of the services. And my father&#039;s family are all from Royal Welsh Use of Leers, going</div><div id="00:04:44.640" class="transcript_line"> all the way back to the 1700s. And in fact, they have got their medals, particularly from</div><div id="00:04:51.160" class="transcript_line"> the First World War in the Regimental Museum in Carnarvon. But that&#039;s not tied to us.</div><div id="00:04:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Such a lovely story about your time. And I know they did very long hours. It must have</div><div id="00:05:02.400" class="transcript_line"> been very tiring because at the end of a long day, he had to get back on, presumably get</div><div id="00:05:05.880" class="transcript_line"> on the train and go home. But I&#039;m glad he survived it and put stories about it.</div><div id="00:05:11.400" class="transcript_line"> He was a very strong man right the way through into his mid-70s. And he used to proudly</div><div id="00:05:16.640" class="transcript_line"> challenge me to an arm wrestle. When I was 18 and playing rugby at school and for the</div><div id="00:05:22.680" class="transcript_line"> town, he would challenge me. And I remember in the last years I was 18, he was 74 and</div><div id="00:05:28.320" class="transcript_line"> he challenged me to an arm wrestle and I couldn&#039;t beat him. And I was a big lad.</div><div id="00:05:32.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so glad. He was so strong even at the end of his life. Such a lovely story. Thank</div><div id="00:05:37.480" class="transcript_line"> you so much.</div><div id="00:05:38.480" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div></div></p>
