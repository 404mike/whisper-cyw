there were not many people who were here.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And Cooperation Road was as it is.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> No, there are new houses.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They are by the river.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big yard.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Used to be a train track cross over the Cooperation Road.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see it was finished, I think, when I came.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they broke and made houses over there.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Now they are full.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a long time, I think, seven, eight years now.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And they develop that place.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Here, mostly I&#039;ve seen most of the shops are same.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> One fish and chips shop and one is just where we live.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> One fish and chips shop just changed from the owner just four or five years ago.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And most all same children, not anyone is doing their job.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Since last few years, few years, 20 years, before that it was very little population here.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Now it is very much.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It looks too many people everywhere.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When we go for shopping, when we go anywhere outside house.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> At that time, not many people were here.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> In this time, since I came here, so many people from other countries came here.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And this city became, this was town at that time called town, Newport town.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So it is quite crowded now.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can see because it is crowded in the beginning, everything we feel is good.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think with me, no one was for me that you are not English, you are Pakistani or like this.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No one said this thing.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Just one lady was there.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> She used to talk to me.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> She was in front of our house because I was alone.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> She came out and because she lives in old people&#039;s house, I used to talk with her.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Once, just once she said, oh you Pakistani people eat pancake and smelly food.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like this.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> She said this one.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> She talked to me nicely.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But she said what was in her mind.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was smoothly good.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But when my sons educated here and born and brought up, my one son did MBA.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He wanted a job here.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He did try a lot as people, children do.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Once he went for interview, they called him.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> First he went to the Redding.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He stayed there for two days.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So we made him to stay over there in a hotel.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He passed there.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the second interview was in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He went to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He stayed there one night or two nights.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I forgot.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Six or seven years.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So their second stage, it was second stage of interview.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very good.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They said after second stage, they said no you are not good for our company or what was it.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very depressed.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He said I was very good in everything.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they called me the other interview.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Few British boys were as well there.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So they made me behind.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He said no, no, it&#039;s not a job for you.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go home.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was very depressed.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very depressed because he went for two place for that interview.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Before that he wasn&#039;t successful in first interviews.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But in this he was very, he said they did me.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They backed me from there.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So he decided other son helped me.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He was okay.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So as you are going through, I&#039;m sure I can&#039;t place this now.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m fortunate because of my husband.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He worked here.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He did work for this country quite a lot because he worked in a big publishing company.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning when he came here.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So he contributed a lot for this country.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in Bristol then he came here.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So what part of your culture do you like to maintain as you live here now?</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Do any celebrations, practices, traditions you maintain?</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there are.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning I did not know when not many people were there or were here in few years.</div><div id="00:14:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Not many because the other people who were here from Pakistan, they were different culture.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The language I speak, Urdu, they don&#039;t speak Urdu.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So we couldn&#039;t mix.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We can&#039;t mix them because our culture everything was there.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I grew up in a big city and my dad was in army and different backgrounds.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So we don&#039;t know Punjabi or Bengali or anything.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know about Bengali.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They were not much here.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> From Pakistan they were quite a lot of operational.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So two, three years we did not know.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t celebrate.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Only my husband and his brother was here.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They both came together.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We celebrate, go to each other&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably it happened.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there were so many relatives and so many nice friends here.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Before this all I...</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any brothers and sisters?</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> One is here, other in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What memories do you have of your brothers and sisters?</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very good.</div><div id="00:16:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very helpful to each other.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We love each other.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we love each other.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We want to help whenever anyone wants help.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> All the experiences.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> How long have you been involved, Age Alive?</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I started before the pandemic.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> About two years or three years before the pandemic.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And a year after my husband is quite ill.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He needs all the time there.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t leave him.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> After one year I
