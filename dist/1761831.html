    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Martin Bell? Oh hello Martin, it&#039;s Marcia here. Hi, thanks for getting through to me.</div><div id="00:00:11.040" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m grateful to you for giving me your time this afternoon Martin, I really am. Oh</div><div id="00:00:16.120" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s no problem, happy to. Oh thank you, because I&#039;m actually recording this, is that</div><div id="00:00:21.520" class="transcript_line"> okay with you? Yes, sure, yes. And what I&#039;ll do is when I finish I&#039;ll transcribe it and</div><div id="00:00:26.520" class="transcript_line"> send you a copy so you can look through it and add or take away or correct, is that alright?</div><div id="00:00:33.520" class="transcript_line"> Fine, yeah. So I wonder how much time do you have? Well what&#039;s needed really, I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:40.520" class="transcript_line"> think, I haven&#039;t got anything else in my diary but I don&#039;t want to waste too much of your</div><div id="00:00:45.520" class="transcript_line"> time. Well I won&#039;t be more than an hour I would say. So I wonder if you could just in</div><div id="00:00:52.800" class="transcript_line"> your own words just introduce yourself, who you are and your involvement with the grant</div><div id="00:00:59.080" class="transcript_line"> living levels. Yes okay, well my name is Martin Bell and my day job is Professor of Archaeological</div><div id="00:01:09.080" class="transcript_line"> Science at the University of Reading. But for the last 38 years actually I&#039;ve been doing</div><div id="00:01:20.080" class="transcript_line"> archaeological research in the seven estuary, originally on the English side at Breen Down</div><div id="00:01:28.600" class="transcript_line"> and then since 1991 on the Welsh side, particularly focused around Goldcliff where I&#039;ve been looking</div><div id="00:01:39.760" class="transcript_line"> at sites dating from the Mesolithic period around 8,000 years ago right up to the end</div><div id="00:01:49.080" class="transcript_line"> of the Iron Age and we&#039;ve excavated loads of sites and we&#039;re still working on the recording</div><div id="00:01:54.920" class="transcript_line"> of sites in that area. So when the Living Levels Project came along it was a really</div><div id="00:02:04.880" class="transcript_line"> great opportunity to convey some of the information that we&#039;ve got out of all these years of work</div><div id="00:02:12.600" class="transcript_line"> on the archaeology of the foreshore of the seven estuary to a much wider audience and</div><div id="00:02:19.840" class="transcript_line"> to begin to train up local people in the sort of techniques which would enable them to record</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> sites in the future. So we&#039;ve done a few training courses and we hope to do some more and we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:02:34.200" class="transcript_line"> also had lots of lectures and we&#039;ve helped Newport Museum with a new display on the archaeology</div><div id="00:02:42.320" class="transcript_line"> and helped the Newport Wetlands Centre with some archaeological material as well.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you were working on the other side of the estuary did you look across and think</div><div id="00:02:53.880" class="transcript_line"> right we&#039;ve got to check that place out too?</div><div id="00:02:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes partly, that was it because the same deposits occur on both sides but actually the main</div><div id="00:03:04.080" class="transcript_line"> catalyst was a skilled steelwork technician called Derek Upton who worked at Glenwerne who</div><div id="00:03:13.840" class="transcript_line"> started finding lots of sites and told us about them and got us involved in investigating them</div><div id="00:03:22.160" class="transcript_line"> and he worked with us for many years, well these 10 years, guiding us around the site showing us</div><div id="00:03:31.080" class="transcript_line"> what he&#039;d found and you know we&#039;re still plugging away really recording and investigating many of</div><div id="00:03:40.200" class="transcript_line"> the sites that he found as well as other sites that we&#039;ve found since then but you know he played</div><div id="00:03:45.640" class="transcript_line"> a really important part in alerting everybody to the rich prehistoric archaeology of the seven</div><div id="00:03:55.240" class="transcript_line"> estuary along with a very different character, an academic geologist called John Allen who was a</div><div id="00:04:04.840" class="transcript_line"> colleague of mine at Reading University who sorted out the sedimentary sequence of the whole of the</div><div id="00:04:13.080" class="transcript_line"> seven estuary and was able to show that the deposits that Derek Upton had found wooden</div><div id="00:04:20.120" class="transcript_line"> structures and artifacts in were actually prehistoric. John Allen sadly died in the autumn</div><div id="00:04:29.240" class="transcript_line"> after a very successful career as a geologist.</div><div id="00:04:35.640" class="transcript_line"> So did Derek approach you when you were still working in Bream or had you already come over here?</div><div id="00:04:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Sort of yes, I mean actually as far as I can remember the first point of contact when I</div><div id="00:04:52.520" class="transcript_line"> met both Derek Upton and John Allen was actually a conference that we had at Western Super Mayor</div><div id="00:05:00.440" class="transcript_line"> which was prompted by the threat at the time building the seven barrage and the conference</div><div id="00:05:06.920" class="transcript_line"> was really designed to try and alert people to the archaeology of the estuary and that&#039;s when</div><div id="00:05:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I think when I first met Derek Upton and John Allen and we they got me interested in</div><div id="00:05:24.840" class="transcript_line"> in the things that had been found on the Welsh side as well. So I might</div><div id="00:05:31.560" class="transcript_line"> um leap around a bit Martin so please bear with me.</div><div id="00:05:36.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fine. So Derek was a steel worker absolutely no disrespect to him because I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:05:42.360" class="transcript_line"> heard so much about him but why did you take him seriously?</div><div id="00:05:48.040" class="transcript_line"> Um well I suppose because when he took me out to see things it made sense and also you know he was</div><div id="00:06:00.280" class="transcript_line"> a voluntary warden for the Gwent Wildlife Trust and I&#039;m very interested in nature conservation</div><div id="00:06:08.120" class="transcript_line"> and wildlife so I mean we were talking the same language really we understood one another and</div><div id="00:06:15.240" class="transcript_line"> got on well and you know archaeology is a subject where anybody can make a really outstanding</div><div id="00:06:24.440" class="transcript_line"> discovery and and Derek did you know and and I think his great contribution was</div><div id="00:06:33.160" class="transcript_line"> was knowing the estuary so I mean he wandered around there from childhood yeah I mean that was</div><div id="00:06:40.280" class="transcript_line"> his that was his leisure time activity really and going out in the estuary looking at the</div><div id="00:06:47.640" class="transcript_line"> the birds and the wildlife and finding archaeology.</div><div id="00:06:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So do you sorry carry on. So he got a really intimate knowledge of of it and and recognised</div><div id="00:07:00.840" class="transcript_line"> that when he was finding you know wood structures buried in sediments that that they must be quite</div><div id="00:07:09.720" class="transcript_line"> old well at first you know he did go along to some sort of professional academic archaeologists</div><div id="00:07:17.240" class="transcript_line"> and you know he got a bit of a brush off people said well you know they&#039;re probably very recent</div><div id="00:07:24.120" class="transcript_line"> and that sort of thing but the the trouble was you said they were working from a mindset of</div><div id="00:07:29.560" class="transcript_line"> dryland archaeology you know they knew what to expect in a um on a dryland site but at that time</div><div id="00:07:37.240" class="transcript_line"> um you know 30 odd years ago they hadn&#039;t really got their heads around the sorts of things that</div><div id="00:07:44.120" class="transcript_line"> you might find in a in a intertidal wetland and it all seemed a bit incredible but I think gradually</div><div id="00:07:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean not just myself but other archaeologists Stephen Oldhouse Green at the National Museum</div><div id="00:08:00.040" class="transcript_line"> and Alastair Whittle in the Archaeology Department at Cardiff realised that what Derek was telling</div><div id="00:08:05.240" class="transcript_line"> us about you know made sense and was important and then we checked that out of course by getting</div><div id="00:08:12.360" class="transcript_line"> radiocarbon dates on some of these wood structures that he&#039;d found um you know that some people</div><div id="00:08:18.600" class="transcript_line"> thought were probably going to be very modern and we discovered that they were bronze age or iron age</div><div id="00:08:26.280" class="transcript_line"> so the picture built up from there really. I know it&#039;s not a very academic um scientific</div><div id="00:08:32.840" class="transcript_line"> measurement but do you think he had a good instinct then for this? Oh yes yes he did yes</div><div id="00:08:37.800" class="transcript_line"> yes I think it&#039;s I think it&#039;s very pertinent actually that well his instinct was derived from</div><div id="00:08:43.800" class="transcript_line"> an intimate knowledge of the landscape really you know he&#039;d looked at it he saw how the sediments</div><div id="00:08:50.200" class="transcript_line"> formed um and he realised that some of this stuff had got to be old yeah and I mean it included</div><div id="00:08:58.120" class="transcript_line"> things like you know footprints human footprints at Uskmouth um that we now know are you know</div><div id="00:09:05.320" class="transcript_line"> around 8 000 years old and I think you know I think a lot of people were probably fairly</div><div id="00:09:10.680" class="transcript_line"> skeptical of that to begin with but now of course we found these human footprints on lots of sites</div><div id="00:09:17.720" class="transcript_line"> and we know that they&#039;re buried in sediment sequences of known dates and so on um so um</div><div id="00:09:24.600" class="transcript_line"> you know I think it was his sort of intuitive understanding of the the landscape and the</div><div id="00:09:31.080" class="transcript_line"> environment that was enabled him to think outside the box actually that&#039;s really the key thing he</div><div id="00:09:37.240" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t approaching it from the point of view of the sort of you know knowledge and understanding</div><div id="00:09:42.520" class="transcript_line"> of a trained archaeologist um which which might have which might have made him skeptical about</div><div id="00:09:49.480" class="transcript_line"> they were but but he was it was based on his own personal observation and deduction um you know</div><div id="00:09:57.480" class="transcript_line"> interestingly enough you know he wasn&#039;t somebody who found easy to write any of that down actually</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah you know he was his passing on of knowledge was almost entirely by word of mouth actually</div><div id="00:10:10.840" class="transcript_line"> wow gosh so what sort of man was he oh a remarkable man really I mean very um</div><div id="00:10:19.720" class="transcript_line"> very kind and and generous um uh you know extremely knowledgeable about about wildlife and</div><div id="00:10:28.440" class="transcript_line"> and and the and the history of the estuary an absolute encyclopedia really</div><div id="00:10:34.680" class="transcript_line"> um well see what do you also describe into um I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve spoken to some of my team Bob Trett</div><div id="00:10:41.720" class="transcript_line"> that um he knew how to navigate that area beyond the scene wall you know where it was safe to walk</div><div id="00:10:48.760" class="transcript_line"> and stuff oh yes yes I mean he&#039;s the he that taught me that actually really you know it is quite a</div><div id="00:10:56.120" class="transcript_line"> it is quite a knack because there are dangerous places and you do have to be very careful</div><div id="00:11:01.400" class="transcript_line"> but he but he&#039;d walked it all and he got a sort of map in his mind really I mean he couldn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:11:08.520" class="transcript_line"> drawn out a map I don&#039;t think yeah at least he never did but I mean he knew how to find things</div><div id="00:11:15.880" class="transcript_line"> um which he&#039;d seen years before in some cases yeah because the mud you see the mud and sand</div><div id="00:11:23.800" class="transcript_line"> are moving around all the time so you know you can go down there you find something and then you</div><div id="00:11:30.040" class="transcript_line"> go back two weeks later to show somebody else and it and it&#039;s gone it&#039;s covered up for the next four</div><div id="00:11:35.400" class="transcript_line"> years or something um but he would be able to you know take you to a spot where he&#039;d found something</div><div id="00:11:43.400" class="transcript_line"> years before um knew exactly where it was it&#039;s an astonishing ability although I think you know many</div><div id="00:11:53.320" class="transcript_line"> sort of country people and um farmers and so on have a similar sense don&#039;t they of the patch that</div><div id="00:12:00.200" class="transcript_line"> they know yes Derek&#039;s patch was a bit more unusual you know it was about well at least 30 kilometers</div><div id="00:12:07.880" class="transcript_line"> long and um you know 500 meters wide sort of thing so what what what what were his spectacular</div><div id="00:12:19.080" class="transcript_line"> finds what were his most spectacular finds yeah um well I suppose um yes let&#039;s think about this</div><div id="00:12:27.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean there were there were many um but I think the human footprints at usk mouth were among the</div><div id="00:12:34.840" class="transcript_line"> most important um he was also um the main finder along with bob tret of the iron age buildings</div><div id="00:12:46.040" class="transcript_line"> at gold cliff which set off the whole of my research project there really um that that</div><div id="00:12:54.200" class="transcript_line"> happened in 1991 after a big storm they went down there and they saw these rectangular buildings</div><div id="00:13:03.160" class="transcript_line"> um and at the time people thought oh well they&#039;ve got to be quite recent um but we got</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> radiocarbon dates and they were iron age wow and we excavated them and we&#039;ve been working there</div><div id="00:13:15.960" class="transcript_line"> ever since on sites of different dates gosh um so that was important and he also discovered the</div><div id="00:13:23.160" class="transcript_line"> bronze age settlement at redwick which we&#039;ve excavated and he was um instrumental in the</div><div id="00:13:32.440" class="transcript_line"> discovery of the bronze age site at cauldicot which is not in the intertidal area but it&#039;s in a</div><div id="00:13:38.760" class="transcript_line"> in a lake that was made in the grounds of cauldicot castle and when they were making the lake um the</div><div id="00:13:48.680" class="transcript_line"> machines dug up bits of wood and some metal work and derrick realized that those were</div><div id="00:13:58.200" class="transcript_line"> prehistoric and reported them and that led to a to another big excavation I didn&#039;t do that</div><div id="00:14:03.560" class="transcript_line"> excavation it was done by nigel nailing also another one of his finds is the may gore pill</div><div id="00:14:13.960" class="transcript_line"> medieval boat that was found in a when um when he took some visiting german scholars to</div><div id="00:14:24.280" class="transcript_line"> to look at may gore pill during one of our field seasons and um and he realized that these bits</div><div id="00:14:31.720" class="transcript_line"> of timber sticking out of may gore pill were were part of a boat and that led to a an excavation</div><div id="00:14:38.360" class="transcript_line"> again by nigel nailing and the boat was very successfully lifted um so you know those are</div><div id="00:14:47.720" class="transcript_line"> probably his most um significant um finds that um you know in all um uh what is it four four</div><div id="00:14:58.600" class="transcript_line"> cases led to you know quite big excavations and published monographs um but there are quite a</div><div id="00:15:06.520" class="transcript_line"> number of others as well other other discoveries and as far as I know you know all his main</div><div id="00:15:14.680" class="transcript_line"> discoveries I think have been published actually um all because he generously shared his information</div><div id="00:15:24.760" class="transcript_line"> with other people you know he wasn&#039;t able to to write them up himself but he involved other people</div><div id="00:15:32.120" class="transcript_line"> and helped them you know launch a project that that investigated them</div><div id="00:15:39.560" class="transcript_line"> amazing isn&#039;t it that&#039;s what&#039;s said to collaboration yes it&#039;s quite it is quite unusual</div><div id="00:15:45.240" class="transcript_line"> because I think you know there are other you know quite gifted as it were amateur archaeologists</div><div id="00:15:52.440" class="transcript_line"> that find a lot of stuff but some of them don&#039;t share it yes at all and it and it sort of dies</div><div id="00:16:00.680" class="transcript_line"> with them really which is a great shame um yes because of course Derek died young really and</div><div id="00:16:07.960" class="transcript_line"> in tragic circumstances so I mean in a way it&#039;s fortunate that that all this stuff was um you know</div><div id="00:16:16.840" class="transcript_line"> by that stage largely written up although I suppose there may well have been other things</div><div id="00:16:21.400" class="transcript_line"> that I don&#039;t know about that um that were were lost with him but so would you say um uh that</div><div id="00:16:33.160" class="transcript_line"> this sort of excavation it is is it would you say it&#039;s a new and emerging science</div><div id="00:16:39.560" class="transcript_line"> in this sort of wetland area or oh yes yes very much so I mean um at least when we started you</div><div id="00:16:45.960" class="transcript_line"> know um the intertidal archaeology well it um at gold cliff started in 1991 um but there had been</div><div id="00:16:56.200" class="transcript_line"> some some work earlier in 1986 at usk mouth and a few other bits and pieces and at that time it was</div><div id="00:17:07.080" class="transcript_line"> pretty well completely well fairly fairly new although you know there&#039;ve been some earlier</div><div id="00:17:13.240" class="transcript_line"> projects um in some cases one or two bits of work decades before not in the seven estuary but</div><div id="00:17:21.800" class="transcript_line"> but in other other parts of the uk um but they were very small scale and I think the potential</div><div id="00:17:28.840" class="transcript_line"> of intertidal archaeology um really has mainly been recognized as a result of the work that</div><div id="00:17:39.560" class="transcript_line"> went on in the seven estuary from the from the late the mid 1980s onwards really um because it&#039;s</div><div id="00:17:47.800" class="transcript_line"> not just a matter of you know one or two sites here and there they&#039;re they&#039;re all over the place</div><div id="00:17:53.960" class="transcript_line"> yeah um and every time we go there we find something um partly because the seven estuary</div><div id="00:18:00.600" class="transcript_line"> is so incredibly unusual you know it&#039;s got this enormous tidal range um so the the sea goes out</div><div id="00:18:08.200" class="transcript_line"> for kilometers and um it&#039;s got a thick sediment sequence which has got you know sites of well</div><div id="00:18:17.240" class="transcript_line"> all dates really um buried within it so what why um why the the arrival why was so late in the day</div><div id="00:18:27.800" class="transcript_line"> this um becoming alert to the potential of this area um uh yes that&#039;s a good question isn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:18:37.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an easy answer to it except that um</div><div id="00:18:42.360" class="transcript_line"> I would you know archaeologists were a bit um bit fixated on on dry land sites yeah um and</div><div id="00:18:54.280" class="transcript_line"> in south wales I think very fixated actually on roman and medieval archaeology um you know the</div><div id="00:19:01.800" class="transcript_line"> prehistory of of that area which most of these sediments are prehistoric and the prehistory had</div><div id="00:19:10.120" class="transcript_line"> had been little worked on in fact even now we know far more about the prehistory of the</div><div id="00:19:16.760" class="transcript_line"> the wetland in the intertidal zone than we do about the dry land oh really um you know which is</div><div id="00:19:24.120" class="transcript_line"> which is extraordinary although actually the archaeology of the dry land has advanced a lot</div><div id="00:19:29.800" class="transcript_line"> since um in the last 20 or 30 years but even so I think we&#039;ve got nothing like the level of</div><div id="00:19:37.640" class="transcript_line"> information about it that we&#039;ve got from this narrow strip on the intertidal zone and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:19:44.360" class="transcript_line"> because that the the particular circumstance is being preserved in the silt yes that&#039;s right</div><div id="00:19:50.200" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s these sediments are wet all the time and they preserve wood structures and a lot of</div><div id="00:19:57.400" class="transcript_line"> environmental evidence yeah things like footprints not just human footprints but animal footprints</div><div id="00:20:04.360" class="transcript_line"> most dryland situations all the wooden posts and things you know that make up trackways or</div><div id="00:20:11.400" class="transcript_line"> or buildings they&#039;ve um decayed away in a wetland context you find the wood preserved so um</div><div id="00:20:22.520" class="transcript_line"> so did you have to forgive me for saying this Martin but did you have to learn on the job</div><div id="00:20:27.240" class="transcript_line"> or is that something you know it seems is it quite niche this sort of archaeology yes it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s</div><div id="00:20:35.160" class="transcript_line"> it is quite quite niche um but um and yes i mean i i did have to learn on the job and i was fortunate</div><div id="00:20:44.360" class="transcript_line"> in that i had um two um great advisors one was john coles who was the guy that</div><div id="00:20:52.920" class="transcript_line"> pioneered the wetland archaeology of the Somerset levels and probably the most</div><div id="00:20:59.480" class="transcript_line"> widely respected wetland archaeologist in the world and john coles actually died</div><div id="00:21:06.680" class="transcript_line"> in the autumn as well but so he was one of our advisors but my colleague john allen was the other</div><div id="00:21:13.480" class="transcript_line"> advisor on the sediment side and then we got people like derek and a great team of supervisors</div><div id="00:21:23.240" class="transcript_line"> that we were able to hire um who&#039;d worked on things like um waterlogged um uh waterfront sites</div><div id="00:21:34.120" class="transcript_line"> in in london yeah i mean different sorts of sites but also with preserved woods so they&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:21:40.760" class="transcript_line"> expertise in that field yeah um so we were able to put together a really good team actually</div><div id="00:21:46.920" class="transcript_line"> each of whom had you know knowledge in aspects of the problem and then gradually from that we built</div><div id="00:21:56.760" class="transcript_line"> it built the sort of um experience to to know how to deal with these sites</div><div id="00:22:02.520" class="transcript_line"> do you um i i often imagine that uh it must be really challenging because you only have small</div><div id="00:22:09.800" class="transcript_line"> windows in which to work don&#039;t you because of the time yes that&#039;s right i mean the sites i&#039;m</div><div id="00:22:14.360" class="transcript_line"> working on at the moment are in the bed of the of the seven estuary between four and five meters</div><div id="00:22:22.520" class="transcript_line"> below ordnance datum yeah um and there you only have you only have about an hour and a half</div><div id="00:22:31.800" class="transcript_line"> oh my goodness that spring tides yeah those spring tides occur for um about four or five days</div><div id="00:22:42.440" class="transcript_line"> every month or in some cases every two weeks yeah um so they&#039;re tiny little windows and of course</div><div id="00:22:49.160" class="transcript_line"> sometimes especially at this time of year the the low tide falls in the middle of the night so you</div><div id="00:22:54.440" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t do anything yeah um and then there&#039;s a period from um about may till mid-august when</div><div id="00:23:01.640" class="transcript_line"> there are no suitable tides um at all because the tidal range is is low during the summer</div><div id="00:23:08.920" class="transcript_line"> so um i guess in the course of the year there are probably i actually never really counted it up</div><div id="00:23:17.000" class="transcript_line"> but you know there are going to be probably 20 days something like that that are really suitable</div><div id="00:23:24.360" class="transcript_line"> to work on sites like that and on those 20 days you&#039;ve only got about an hour and a half in the</div><div id="00:23:30.680" class="transcript_line"> most critical um area so it&#039;s a matter of you know working very fast and um knowing exactly what</div><div id="00:23:40.920" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re going to do on a particular tide so that you&#039;re building up an additive picture all the</div><div id="00:23:45.560" class="transcript_line"> time but is it possible that when you go back the following day it&#039;s been covered up again</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> oh yes it&#039;s always been covered up to some extent but i mean it might just be covered up by a thin</div><div id="00:23:56.120" class="transcript_line"> film of mud yeah or sometimes it might be covered up by 10 or 20 centimeters of sand yeah which is</div><div id="00:24:03.880" class="transcript_line"> you know very difficult to shift if you&#039;ve only got an hour and a half to uncover something</div><div id="00:24:09.720" class="transcript_line"> photograph it make a plan and record it but what tools do you use out there then sorry what tools</div><div id="00:24:18.280" class="transcript_line"> do you use tools um well a range of tools um i mean the main tool i use at the moment actually</div><div id="00:24:26.920" class="transcript_line"> is water to wash off things that are partly exposed so i&#039;m out there with a as the tide goes down</div><div id="00:24:35.960" class="transcript_line"> yeah i&#039;m out there with a bucket of water standing in the water filling up the bucket and chucking it</div><div id="00:24:43.320" class="transcript_line"> where there are little bits of interesting sediment exposed yeah and that way i can use</div><div id="00:24:48.840" class="transcript_line"> the sea to wash away some of the mud or sand that&#039;s accumulated and see whether there&#039;s</div><div id="00:24:55.960" class="transcript_line"> anything significant there but we have to use plastic and wooden tools particularly because</div><div id="00:25:03.240" class="transcript_line"> other other tools damage the the wood um and so that&#039;s quite difficult do you have you ever</div><div id="00:25:11.640" class="transcript_line"> got caught out by the tide um well um not not seriously but you know there are times when um</div><div id="00:25:23.000" class="transcript_line"> when it comes in very quickly but i mean we&#039;re we&#039;re quite fortunate actually in the area where</div><div id="00:25:28.360" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re working um there is a gentle slope from the site upwards so um uh although the tide comes in</div><div id="00:25:39.960" class="transcript_line"> very quickly at the bottom of the slope um once one&#039;s got to the the slope itself you know even</div><div id="00:25:49.160" class="transcript_line"> at a crawling pace one would be able to to move more quickly than the tide comes in so and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:25:56.600" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not um as dangerous as as it might be but of course you&#039;ve got to avoid areas of of quicksand</div><div id="00:26:04.520" class="transcript_line"> and deep mud oh my goodness are there many of those yes um but you know i&#039;ve never got um</div><div id="00:26:13.080" class="transcript_line"> completely stuck and and and nobody that has been working with me has ever got completely stuck but</div><div id="00:26:19.640" class="transcript_line"> i mean it would be possible too and and i suppose if one was very cold and exhausted</div><div id="00:26:27.720" class="transcript_line"> you know that could be that could be difficult and of course it&#039;s not somewhere where you can</div><div id="00:26:33.800" class="transcript_line"> work on your own no you&#039;ve always got somebody with you yes yes um so um do you know um</div><div id="00:26:43.400" class="transcript_line"> developments say like the the new um it&#039;s not new anymore the second seven bridge and</div><div id="00:26:50.040" class="transcript_line"> once upon a time the proposed seven barrage and um it must shift the um the the the bed of the river</div><div id="00:27:00.760" class="transcript_line"> or the estuary did have you have you noticed the impact of those developments yes very very much</div><div id="00:27:07.400" class="transcript_line"> so yeah um i mean most of my work isn&#039;t isn&#039;t particularly near the the new seven bridge but</div><div id="00:27:14.360" class="transcript_line"> um just in in um when was it january i think of of of 2020 um i went down to see some sites that</div><div id="00:27:25.800" class="transcript_line"> were underneath the bridge where medieval um woven fish baskets in large numbers i mean 20 or more</div><div id="00:27:37.560" class="transcript_line"> had been exposed by erosion and the the the tremendous scouring around the um the giant</div><div id="00:27:47.160" class="transcript_line"> rectangular concrete pillars that support the the the box structure of the bridge</div><div id="00:27:53.880" class="transcript_line"> um and it&#039;s exposing these fish traps medieval fish traps all the time um so there&#039;s there&#039;s a</div><div id="00:28:01.400" class="transcript_line"> lot of important stuff they&#039;re being exposed and and not really being recorded at the moment</div><div id="00:28:09.400" class="transcript_line"> although it has been worked on in the past in fact um rick turner who was the i think the main sort</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> of archaeological inspiration behind the living levels project he pioneered the study of um</div><div id="00:28:24.360" class="transcript_line"> fish baskets and other finds when the second seven crossing was was being made yeah um the other big</div><div id="00:28:31.320" class="transcript_line"> change that&#039;s happened as a result of the bridge is the build-up of sediment um which is sea wood</div><div id="00:28:38.920" class="transcript_line"> of the bridge as far as i can see where there&#039;s been quite a quite a development of a sediment</div><div id="00:28:46.760" class="transcript_line"> deposition so sites that were exposed before the bridge was built are now deeply buried by</div><div id="00:28:54.920" class="transcript_line"> by mud so it&#039;s it&#039;s certainly caused um significant changes but then the other issue there is that</div><div id="00:29:03.240" class="transcript_line"> there are there are big changes in the behavior of the estuary going on anyway for all sorts of</div><div id="00:29:10.600" class="transcript_line"> that we don&#039;t fully understand but it&#039;s to do with the pattern of of weather and climate and</div><div id="00:29:18.600" class="transcript_line"> maybe the incidence of westerly winds and big storms so you get these well sort of cyclical</div><div id="00:29:25.480" class="transcript_line"> changes occurring um which affect what&#039;s exposed have you experienced that over the decades then</div><div id="00:29:34.760" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve been working down there you&#039;ve observed that yes yes and my colleague john allen um the</div><div id="00:29:41.400" class="transcript_line"> sediment specialist has actually documented these things going back um least three or four hundred</div><div id="00:29:49.560" class="transcript_line"> years oh really gosh so for you martin what what&#039;s been your most exciting discoveries</div><div id="00:29:58.520" class="transcript_line"> um well let&#039;s think well i would say the footprints actually although of course you know in a sense i</div><div id="00:30:07.400" class="transcript_line"> i share that discovery with derrick upton and and with others because different people have found</div><div id="00:30:13.320" class="transcript_line"> them in different places but um i&#039;ve found a lot of uh of fine examples at gold cliff um and um</div><div id="00:30:24.040" class="transcript_line"> you know i think that&#039;s the thing that sort of captured people&#039;s imagination yes um most um</div><div id="00:30:32.360" class="transcript_line"> and i suppose the you know the discovery that of how much iron age um archaeology there was at</div><div id="00:30:42.200" class="transcript_line"> at gold cliff in the we&#039;ve we&#039;ve excavated eight rectangular buildings there and 16 trackways why</div><div id="00:30:53.480" class="transcript_line"> and but of course you know all these things are done by by a team of people really you know i had</div><div id="00:31:00.840" class="transcript_line"> i had about um i suppose about 40 people working with me at a time at gold cliff to</div><div id="00:31:08.200" class="transcript_line"> excavate those buildings and record all the stuff that derrick upton had originally found</div><div id="00:31:15.000" class="transcript_line"> so when you say trackway what do you mean what is a trackway is it a roadway well it&#039;s a laid</div><div id="00:31:21.560" class="transcript_line"> wood structure of various types i mean some of them are bits of round timber let&#039;s say</div><div id="00:31:28.440" class="transcript_line"> uh about a meter long all laid one next to another so that people could walk across</div><div id="00:31:35.560" class="transcript_line"> the salt marsh or the reed swamp um without sinking in others are bits of larger round timber</div><div id="00:31:45.160" class="transcript_line"> laid along the line of a trackway to create the same sort of effect and still others are</div><div id="00:31:52.600" class="transcript_line"> much more sophisticated where you take some bits of round timber let&#039;s say 70 centimeters long with</div><div id="00:32:01.240" class="transcript_line"> a pointed end and you stick them in diagonally at 45 degrees to make a sort of cross piece</div><div id="00:32:08.440" class="transcript_line"> yeah and then you put either planks or brush wood across the top to make a raised walkway</div><div id="00:32:16.680" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s probably where there&#039;s shallow water rather than than a than a muddy surface yeah um so there</div><div id="00:32:25.480" class="transcript_line"> are lots of those in in the estuary particularly at gold cliff but a few in other places as well</div><div id="00:32:32.280" class="transcript_line"> so i wonder why gold cliff and redwick seem to have a concentration is that because you&#039;ve just</div><div id="00:32:39.320" class="transcript_line"> been digging there um no i think it&#039;s i think gold cliff it&#039;s i think the explanation is straight</div><div id="00:32:46.520" class="transcript_line"> forward really that there was an island there oh yeah an island of bedrock in the middle of</div><div id="00:32:54.840" class="transcript_line"> okay um and that island was about one kilometer by half a kilometer yeah um and that provided</div><div id="00:33:04.360" class="transcript_line"> an ideal place for well exploiting the the resources of the estuary yeah probably</div><div id="00:33:11.240" class="transcript_line"> particularly fish but other resources as well what are the other resources then what were the</div><div id="00:33:17.240" class="transcript_line"> other resources yeah um well um probably birds although to be honest we haven&#039;t got very much</div><div id="00:33:23.960" class="transcript_line"> evidence of that but bird bones don&#039;t survive terribly well and later on in the iron age</div><div id="00:33:31.560" class="transcript_line"> and the bronze age actually the key resource was grazing animals on the salt marsh so that&#039;s what</div><div id="00:33:40.200" class="transcript_line"> rectangular buildings that gold cliff and redwood were to do with grazing cattle and sheep because</div><div id="00:33:48.600" class="transcript_line"> it was very rich nutritionally yes exactly and and really good pasture seasonally you know it</div><div id="00:33:56.760" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t have been much use in the winter yeah because it would be terribly terribly wet and</div><div id="00:34:03.160" class="transcript_line"> and um you know big difficulty with animals getting stuck and so on but there&#039;s a period from</div><div id="00:34:09.800" class="transcript_line"> about may until the middle of august when the tidal range is reduced and the salt marsh plants</div><div id="00:34:17.240" class="transcript_line"> are really you know coming into their own and very very productive and that i think is when</div><div id="00:34:23.640" class="transcript_line"> people would have been grazing their animals down there and the same thing went on in salt marsh</div><div id="00:34:29.560" class="transcript_line"> environments into into recent times actually oh really um you know it was a it still is used as</div><div id="00:34:38.680" class="transcript_line"> a grazing resource where it survives but actually there&#039;s very little proper salt marsh surviving in</div><div id="00:34:45.880" class="transcript_line"> the seven estuary now it&#039;s quite restricted where would you find find it today then at peterson</div><div id="00:34:53.480" class="transcript_line"> okay um there&#039;s there&#039;s a reasonable area at peterson actually although it&#039;s not it&#039;s</div><div id="00:35:00.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s grazing is is not well um i suppose i better not pass any comment on the grazing</div><div id="00:35:09.000" class="transcript_line"> some of it seems to involve horses and things right okay yeah i&#039;m not clear that it&#039;s that</div><div id="00:35:15.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s really managed in a traditional way and there&#039;s there are issues about the ownership of it</div><div id="00:35:22.680" class="transcript_line"> at gold cliff there&#039;s a triangle of salt marsh beside gold cliff hill which i think is still</div><div id="00:35:30.200" class="transcript_line"> grazed by by sheep um and um you know that&#039;s probably grazed in a in a fairly traditional</div><div id="00:35:39.480" class="transcript_line"> sort of way so has to sort wash be been washed away then over the decades yes that&#039;s the problem</div><div id="00:35:46.440" class="transcript_line"> you see once the sea wall becomes established yeah um as i mean there&#039;s probably been some sort of</div><div id="00:35:53.080" class="transcript_line"> sea wall in much of the seven estuary since the roman period but certainly by medieval times</div><div id="00:35:59.720" class="transcript_line"> sea walls were were sort of fixed yeah and so what happens then is you get the erosion of the</div><div id="00:36:08.120" class="transcript_line"> salt marsh on the seaward side of the sea wall yeah um but but the the salt marsh can&#039;t sort of</div><div id="00:36:15.800" class="transcript_line"> retreat inland of course because the sea walls there okay yeah you&#039;ve got a constantly diminishing</div><div id="00:36:21.800" class="transcript_line"> salt marsh so at times in the mesolithic or the iron age um salt marsh probably extended right</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> from the present sea wall um to the to the rising ground you know let&#039;s say flanworm or somewhere</div><div id="00:36:40.520" class="transcript_line"> you know you could have had around six kilometers wow not all salt marsh perhaps i mean it would</div><div id="00:36:47.080" class="transcript_line"> have been a mixture of salt marsh mud flats yeah um raised bog in places and thin woodland yeah</div><div id="00:36:55.480" class="transcript_line"> but those are all you know really important wildlife habitats yeah um and now um what you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:37:03.000" class="transcript_line"> got is a well the salt marsh is largely gone except at places like peterson and and gold cliff</div><div id="00:37:12.760" class="transcript_line"> um and and i think that near a cardiff there&#039;s some there&#039;s some salt marsh remaining um and</div><div id="00:37:20.280" class="transcript_line"> the other environments of course have largely vanished as well apart from mud flats which are</div><div id="00:37:27.480" class="transcript_line"> which are still extensive at low tide but um so you often when when you know</div><div id="00:37:35.880" class="transcript_line"> reads about the the the levels you often hear about you know the land being reclaimed and</div><div id="00:37:41.560" class="transcript_line"> habitated and you know it&#039;s been described to me as a you know monumental civil engineering</div><div id="00:37:48.280" class="transcript_line"> project really so what you&#039;re seeing in your early history archaeology are you seeing examples of</div><div id="00:37:55.960" class="transcript_line"> land reclamation or is it just farming with what seeing do you see what um what i&#039;m mostly seeing</div><div id="00:38:05.320" class="transcript_line"> in the bronze age and iron age and perhaps in the neolithic but less evidence for the neolithic</div><div id="00:38:12.360" class="transcript_line"> is people utilizing a landscape um in order to</div><div id="00:38:20.520" class="transcript_line"> obtain grazing um and and particular resources yeah fish and and so on and all the other wetland</div><div id="00:38:28.520" class="transcript_line"> resources that would be useful you know like reeds and yeah and so on all the plants that they would</div><div id="00:38:34.200" class="transcript_line"> have would have used they&#039;re not in up until the roman period altering the landscape in a deliberate</div><div id="00:38:43.400" class="transcript_line"> way okay and so we don&#039;t find evidence of drainage and reclamation yeah until the roman period i</div><div id="00:38:50.520" class="transcript_line"> would say i mean some people have argued otherwise but i don&#039;t think the evidence for that is at all</div><div id="00:38:55.880" class="transcript_line"> good actually um in the roman period we certainly do get um evidence for the making of low banks</div><div id="00:39:04.680" class="transcript_line"> to keep the sea out yeah and we&#039;ve got that at gold cliff and making of ditches to drain</div><div id="00:39:12.760" class="transcript_line"> areas which were probably behind low banks or sea walls and you&#039;ve got that</div><div id="00:39:18.680" class="transcript_line"> um very clearly at gold cliff at nash in the sewage works um and in rumney um on the um the</div><div id="00:39:33.240" class="transcript_line"> went loop level um uh lots of evidence for roman activity and the same thing over on the english</div><div id="00:39:44.680" class="transcript_line"> side actually yeah so i think the romans drained the levels without any doubt i think they also</div><div id="00:39:53.960" class="transcript_line"> protected some of it from the sea with with a probably a rather low sea wall that probably</div><div id="00:40:01.800" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t keep out all the um all the all every tide but that kept most of them out and and and</div><div id="00:40:11.160" class="transcript_line"> probably all of them out for the period of the summer when most of the the area would have been</div><div id="00:40:16.760" class="transcript_line"> most intensively used but by the roman period we know that people were actually living on the wetland</div><div id="00:40:24.760" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s traces of settlements and buildings and wells and things i mean steve</div><div id="00:40:29.800" class="transcript_line"> ripon will be able to tell you a lot more about that because that is that&#039;s his subject and not</div><div id="00:40:34.920" class="transcript_line"> really mine okay so what would you say your um what is yours ancient history iron age no my</div><div id="00:40:44.600" class="transcript_line"> my subject is is is environmental archaeology and geoarchaeology okay pre-history i suppose really</div><div id="00:40:52.760" class="transcript_line"> so what does that mean then martin um well the period that i specialize in is is up to but not</div><div id="00:41:01.320" class="transcript_line"> including the roman period really okay okay but because i&#039;m an environmental archaeologist</div><div id="00:41:07.800" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;m interested in people&#039;s relationship with the with the landscape and how people have changed</div><div id="00:41:14.840" class="transcript_line"> the landscape okay um and the the sediments as well you know that&#039;s that&#039;s part of it the sediments</div><div id="00:41:21.480" class="transcript_line"> the vegetation the evidence for plants and animals so that side and that&#039;s you know in a way why i&#039;m</div><div id="00:41:29.160" class="transcript_line"> so uh passionate about the living levels because it helps to bring together the archaeology the</div><div id="00:41:36.760" class="transcript_line"> heritage and the the nature really so in in the evidence you&#039;ve gathered and and excavated how</div><div id="00:41:45.080" class="transcript_line"> have you seen people change in the landscape um well um if it&#039;s not so much how in the periods</div><div id="00:41:55.720" class="transcript_line"> that i&#039;m dealing with in the seven estuary not so much how people are changing the landscape</div><div id="00:42:01.720" class="transcript_line"> except by using it yeah um it&#039;s more about how they&#039;re fitting in okay a changing landscape yeah</div><div id="00:42:11.160" class="transcript_line"> and taking advantage of the opportunities that that it provides um so they will have been changing</div><div id="00:42:20.200" class="transcript_line"> the landscape i mean for instance in the bronze age there are so many footprints of cattle on the</div><div id="00:42:27.560" class="transcript_line"> peat surface in the entire zone yeah but it&#039;s obvious that it was a really significant grazing</div><div id="00:42:33.960" class="transcript_line"> resource yeah i would argue probably just for part of the year you know three or four months probably</div><div id="00:42:40.280" class="transcript_line"> and and the the that grazing would have had a significant impact on the vegetation yeah um</div><div id="00:42:47.480" class="transcript_line"> um we we know that when salt marsh and it&#039;s grazed today that it that it has a different</div><div id="00:42:54.200" class="transcript_line"> vegetation composition from you know untouched salt marsh as it were so their their activities</div><div id="00:43:01.720" class="transcript_line"> are changing it in that way but it&#039;s not like the the sort of much larger scale um all deliberate</div><div id="00:43:09.160" class="transcript_line"> alteration of the landscape by the creation of of things like fields and and so on that you get</div><div id="00:43:16.600" class="transcript_line"> in a dryland situation it&#039;s more people utilizing resources um in the in a constantly changing</div><div id="00:43:25.960" class="transcript_line"> coastal situation so it it sounds to me like it could keep on giving this this area oh yes i think</div><div id="00:43:34.200" class="transcript_line"> so i mean it&#039;s you know it&#039;s eroding all the time and what&#039;s more the sand and the silt is moving</div><div id="00:43:42.200" class="transcript_line"> around all the time so you know there will be things exposed at the next low tide yeah that</div><div id="00:43:51.720" class="transcript_line"> have probably never been never been seen before um the trouble is of course you know will one be</div><div id="00:44:00.920" class="transcript_line"> there to record it and um and i suppose you know it&#039;s um perfectly valid criticism in a way that</div><div id="00:44:12.920" class="transcript_line"> my research has inevitably especially over the last five or so years been very much focused at</div><div id="00:44:22.120" class="transcript_line"> um</div><div id="00:44:25.320" class="transcript_line"> i didn&#039;t didn&#039;t mention this previously but one of the the uh the most exciting things we&#039;ve found is</div><div id="00:44:32.520" class="transcript_line"> a is a wooden fish trap of mesolithic date the only example that&#039;s ever been found in um the</div><div id="00:44:40.600" class="transcript_line"> british isles except for a couple of examples in ireland actually goodness me so how old is that</div><div id="00:44:45.960" class="transcript_line"> then would you say um it&#039;s um about 7 000 years that&#039;s extraordinary and it&#039;s right down in the</div><div id="00:44:53.880" class="transcript_line"> bed of the estuary the lowest site we&#039;ve ever found wow and that makes it particularly difficult</div><div id="00:45:01.160" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s um you know it&#039;s got the the shortest time of exposure gosh so was it was it recognizably</div><div id="00:45:12.680" class="transcript_line"> a fish trap i mean well yes i mean it&#039;s actually a series of v-shaped um lines of well wooden posts</div><div id="00:45:23.480" class="transcript_line"> making a v-shape yeah only about four or five meters long by two and a half meters wide yeah</div><div id="00:45:31.240" class="transcript_line"> um and um woven around these posts the posts are about four centimeters in diameter i suppose</div><div id="00:45:38.840" class="transcript_line"> there are little thin um bits of um round wood which are sort of woven around to make a basket</div><div id="00:45:47.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah so it&#039;s um yes i think i would say it&#039;s quite recognizable</div><div id="00:45:52.200" class="transcript_line"> god the fish trap and that was a totally unexpected discovery three years ago yeah when we were doing</div><div id="00:45:58.920" class="transcript_line"> a drone survey to try and make a plan of our human footprints yeah and to to to make this plan we had</div><div id="00:46:08.520" class="transcript_line"> to put down a series of 12 targets which were like well like big crosses on on them on plastic</div><div id="00:46:18.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah in order to enable the drone to match up hundreds of photographs that it took</div><div id="00:46:25.000" class="transcript_line"> in order to make a sort of composite plan and one of these targets was put down somewhere where</div><div id="00:46:31.160" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d never looked before yeah and my colleague tom walker who&#039;s worked with me on all this for</div><div id="00:46:37.320" class="transcript_line"> for several years realized that there was a line of wooden posts there wow yeah we thought well</div><div id="00:46:43.800" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s interesting but we expected they would turn out to be medieval actually yeah and then</div><div id="00:46:49.400" class="transcript_line"> we got a radiocarbon date and and we&#039;ve now dated i think six of them and all of them are</div><div id="00:46:56.280" class="transcript_line"> metalic that&#039;s extraordinary very exciting yes it is it is yeah i suppose in recent years that&#039;s</div><div id="00:47:03.320" class="transcript_line"> the most exciting discovery really so the use of drones have been very useful for you yes i mean</div><div id="00:47:10.520" class="transcript_line"> yes transformative in that case because actually without the drone it was impossible to make a</div><div id="00:47:17.000" class="transcript_line"> proper plan yeah you know when you&#039;ve only got um an hour and a half at a tide yeah and the area</div><div id="00:47:24.680" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;re dealing with is you know um well the core survey area for the footprints is</div><div id="00:47:32.200" class="transcript_line"> is about 800 meters by 200 meters yeah and it&#039;s very complex you know there are lots of different</div><div id="00:47:39.480" class="transcript_line"> sediments exposed with footprints in some of them and then other moving banks of gravel and sand</div><div id="00:47:47.960" class="transcript_line"> and so on burying everything sometimes you know getting a proper plan was only possible with this</div><div id="00:47:55.640" class="transcript_line"> drone but then you know there was this amazing spin-off really but i may be um</div><div id="00:48:03.240" class="transcript_line"> sounding ignorant here but do you use lidar at all yes not um not in the seven estuary</div><div id="00:48:14.760" class="transcript_line"> intertidal zone okay and actually partly because of course the trouble with the tides okay yes</div><div id="00:48:22.040" class="transcript_line"> you know you&#039;re very lucky if you&#039;ve got got some your lidar pictures taken at the right time</div><div id="00:48:29.400" class="transcript_line"> right okay yeah you know the um the tide&#039;s got to be out yeah um so i use lidar quite a lot in</div><div id="00:48:38.120" class="transcript_line"> dryland situations but i&#039;ve never actually found um an existing lidar data set um that um</div><div id="00:48:48.120" class="transcript_line"> um you know had been taken at the appropriate time for the area that i&#039;m working in the seven</div><div id="00:48:54.280" class="transcript_line"> estuary although of course if it was flown specifically for that which is expensive yes</div><div id="00:49:01.320" class="transcript_line"> you know one could get that and it would be incredibly valuable are you surprised at how</div><div id="00:49:07.720" class="transcript_line"> much interest your work and your team&#039;s work and its discoveries have um attracted</div><div id="00:49:14.840" class="transcript_line"> a wide generation yes i would i would say so i mean we&#039;ve had lots of um you know interest from</div><div id="00:49:22.040" class="transcript_line"> the general public you know the lectures that have been organized by the the living levels have been</div><div id="00:49:28.760" class="transcript_line"> very well attended by local people um and then there&#039;s been quite a lot of interest from</div><div id="00:49:37.080" class="transcript_line"> over the years from television programs and so on i think we&#039;ve had i don&#039;t know i&#039;ve never</div><div id="00:49:43.240" class="transcript_line"> counted them 15 television programs that have that have come to film particularly the footprints</div><div id="00:49:52.280" class="transcript_line"> um well they&#039;re so relatable aren&#039;t they the footprints yes exactly i think they capture</div><div id="00:49:58.360" class="transcript_line"> people&#039;s imagination and of course that&#039;s good from our point of view not only does it make them</div><div id="00:50:05.560" class="transcript_line"> the work that we&#039;re doing more widely known but it also provides a you know another form of record</div><div id="00:50:12.440" class="transcript_line"> actually yes you know there&#039;s our academic photographs and plans and notes and reports but</div><div id="00:50:20.680" class="transcript_line"> you know a bit of television uh footage is is um you know in some ways more more accessible to</div><div id="00:50:29.320" class="transcript_line"> to to the average person so is the work ongoing do you think the archaeological work ongoing down</div><div id="00:50:36.280" class="transcript_line"> yes yes it&#039;s ongoing at the moment in a in a pretty modest way yeah i mean largely myself</div><div id="00:50:43.720" class="transcript_line"> and and tom walker um when we haven&#039;t got lockdowns we visit um i don&#039;t know six to eight</div><div id="00:50:52.120" class="transcript_line"> times a year when there&#039;s a suitable low tide and we record what&#039;s exposed yeah and we&#039;ve got quite</div><div id="00:50:59.480" class="transcript_line"> shopping list of other things that we want to do oh yes some of which we&#039;re you know gradually</div><div id="00:51:06.760" class="transcript_line"> getting on with others will depend more on on trying to raise a grant from somewhere oh my god</div><div id="00:51:15.160" class="transcript_line"> and that is difficult actually oh gosh yeah in the present in the present climate i had one</div><div id="00:51:21.880" class="transcript_line"> grant application that would have enabled me to do everything i wanted to complete there yeah</div><div id="00:51:29.480" class="transcript_line"> and it was two days away from submission to the national geographic society in america yeah when</div><div id="00:51:35.720" class="transcript_line"> they pulled the entire grant round because of covid oh my goodness really and they still haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:51:43.160" class="transcript_line"> reinstated it so um that was a tremendous blow really oh gosh huge blow yes god do you do you</div><div id="00:51:54.200" class="transcript_line"> attract international interest then in your work yes we we&#039;ve had um we had a a good coverage in</div><div id="00:52:02.280" class="transcript_line"> the national geographic in the past oh have you really yeah two photographers yeah and from</div><div id="00:52:09.080" class="transcript_line"> from new york to work with us for a week when was that then martin um that was i can&#039;t remember</div><div id="00:52:16.760" class="transcript_line"> um probably about um six years ago six or eight years ago yeah um and a journalist</div><div id="00:52:27.400" class="transcript_line"> from switzerland also came from them to write a write an account of what was going on so</div><div id="00:52:36.280" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s been that that interest and quite a lot of international interest from archaeologists</div><div id="00:52:42.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah what from archaeologists who work in similar environment yes particularly i think yes</div><div id="00:52:50.840" class="transcript_line"> yes because the techniques we&#039;re using and the types of things we&#039;re finding are</div><div id="00:52:55.480" class="transcript_line"> relevant to them and the great growth in coastal and intertidal archaeology in britain</div><div id="00:53:03.240" class="transcript_line"> has been um mirrored in you know many other parts of the world actually yeah so we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:53:11.720" class="transcript_line"> you know we benefited from collaboration and advice with colleagues in denmark and scandinavia</div><div id="00:53:19.080" class="transcript_line"> the nevelands north germany um canada and and america in particular but other places as well</div><div id="00:53:26.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah well martin i&#039;m very conscious of the time i i&#039;ve been talking for now and then i don&#039;t want</div><div id="00:53:32.360" class="transcript_line"> to keep you too long but um i wonder if i had any more questions i could add them to the transcription</div><div id="00:53:39.560" class="transcript_line"> when i send it through yes of course yes would that be okay i&#039;ll pop the answers onto onto that</div><div id="00:53:45.160" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s that&#039;s lovely it&#039;s happy to help in any way i can thank you so much it&#039;s been so nice to chat</div><div id="00:53:51.320" class="transcript_line"> and thank you so much for putting up with me in my uh ignorant questions but they weren&#039;t at all</div><div id="00:53:57.480" class="transcript_line"> ignorant actually i think they were you know it seemed very pertinent well i hope so i mean it&#039;s</div><div id="00:54:03.320" class="transcript_line"> so fascinating you know it&#039;s something it&#039;s so tangible when you say you find a fishing net that</div><div id="00:54:08.920" class="transcript_line"> or trap that is you know several thousand years old it&#039;s just it just sparks the imagination i</div><div id="00:54:15.800" class="transcript_line"> mean do you do that when you find something like that do you try to imagine what the lives were</div><div id="00:54:20.760" class="transcript_line"> like are the people who made it and put it there yes yes yes that&#039;s uh that&#039;s half the fun of it</div><div id="00:54:27.800" class="transcript_line"> really and it&#039;s certainly very exciting for us really to you know never quite know what you&#039;re</div><div id="00:54:32.920" class="transcript_line"> going to find you know usually something interesting turns up and a huge benefit of</div><div id="00:54:38.920" class="transcript_line"> working in the same area for decades really because the picture builds up all the time you know</div><div id="00:54:46.680" class="transcript_line"> yeah it&#039;s not as if you&#039;re duplicating what you already know it&#039;s as there&#039;s often completely new</div><div id="00:54:53.480" class="transcript_line"> things oh it&#039;s so exciting but martin thank you so much your time i am really grateful</div><div id="00:55:01.560" class="transcript_line"> good luck with the completion of your thank you well this is actually um i&#039;m doing a short book</div><div id="00:55:09.560" class="transcript_line"> so um this is what i&#039;m working on now um so um this will appear in the book at some points</div><div id="00:55:17.080" class="transcript_line"> probably next year i should love that&#039;s terrific i mean it&#039;s i think it&#039;s very good that you&#039;re</div><div id="00:55:22.120" class="transcript_line"> providing some permanent record like that actually because i think so that&#039;s these lottery projects</div><div id="00:55:29.800" class="transcript_line"> they can be um you know a bit difficult from that point of view once they end you know</div><div id="00:55:37.720" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s it wondering what the what the legacy yeah and you know it&#039;s um yes everything&#039;s going</div><div id="00:55:45.800" class="transcript_line"> to record office but not everyone um uses archives it&#039;s and that&#039;s what i was keen that those who</div><div id="00:55:54.040" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t normally maybe wouldn&#039;t access heritage or culture like that maybe they would through a book</div><div id="00:55:59.560" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s really good the project management have agreed to that now and yeah thank you so much</div><div id="00:56:06.520" class="transcript_line"> martin fine happy to help in any way i can oh lovely you take care now yeah thank you bye</div></div></p>
