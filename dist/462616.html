    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The miners strike, what&#039;s your memories of watching that on television?</div><div id="00:00:06.020" class="transcript_line"> Both my grandads worked in the mines, so always I&#039;ve been aware of miners and from my grandparents</div><div id="00:00:21.160" class="transcript_line"> obviously both my tides were miners. Jolly hard life, very unsociable hours, unsociable working</div><div id="00:00:33.680" class="transcript_line"> conditions, so I&#039;ve always had a strong feeling for miners. I&#039;m not a person that supports strikes</div><div id="00:00:45.440" class="transcript_line"> are such, but I do think that when the miners went on strike they had their valid reasons,</div><div id="00:00:52.600" class="transcript_line"> whatever that might have been. It was a sad day for our country when it happened because I do</div><div id="00:01:00.640" class="transcript_line"> think that their striking caused great upset within the country. But we live in a democratic</div><div id="00:01:12.080" class="transcript_line"> country and everybody is entitled to have their say and their way of life and I suppose it was</div><div id="00:01:21.440" class="transcript_line"> inevitable that the miners would need better conditions and certainly would need better</div><div id="00:01:27.560" class="transcript_line"> money. So I did have sympathy with them. What was your opinion of how the miners were portrayed</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> on television? Well, I suppose like any other organisation when you get a group of people who</div><div id="00:01:50.040" class="transcript_line"> have got a problem and become incensed by it, sometimes their reactions can be perhaps not</div><div id="00:01:59.160" class="transcript_line"> exactly what you would admire and they were not always perhaps portrayed in the best light,</div><div id="00:02:07.600" class="transcript_line"> but they had a grievance and they had to put it across one way or another and rightly or wrongly</div><div id="00:02:20.880" class="transcript_line"> How did you view the strike as a Welsh strike or a British strike? I didn&#039;t view it as a Welsh</div><div id="00:02:31.960" class="transcript_line"> strike, no. It was a strike of the country as a whole. I didn&#039;t feel it was appertaining to</div><div id="00:02:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Wales alone, although we&#039;ve lost all our mines virtually, haven&#039;t we? I mean we were renowned</div><div id="00:02:47.320" class="transcript_line"> for our coal mining going back way, way back when How Proud Was My Valley was an interesting film,</div><div id="00:02:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Paul Robeson and How Green Was My Valley and Proud Valley. So it really wasn&#039;t just a Welsh</div><div id="00:03:06.360" class="transcript_line"> person&#039;s problem. So from my point of view, I think it affected the country as a whole,</div><div id="00:03:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Did it have an effect on the community here, do you think? This was a steel village, Brumbo,</div><div id="00:03:27.480" class="transcript_line"> big steel mining. Up to a point, yes, I would say so, because when the work people in Brumbo</div><div id="00:03:38.720" class="transcript_line"> had their problems, obviously, and it was after the miners&#039; strike that the men in Brumbo went on</div><div id="00:03:48.480" class="transcript_line"> strike. I suppose they felt, well, other people are striking, if we have a problem, we will strike.</div><div id="00:03:54.880" class="transcript_line"> And for the first time ever, there was a strike in Brumbo in the steelworks, which was practically</div><div id="00:04:03.560" class="transcript_line"> unheard of before. So yes, I would say that the miners&#039; strike probably was in their mines,</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and they saw how that was dealt with, and they decided that they would strike. Though whether</div><div id="00:04:20.960" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s good to strike, that&#039;s debatable, isn&#039;t it?</div></div></p>
