Well, of course, that happened before I came back here,</div><div id="00:00:37.600" class="transcript_line"> but I do watch Countdown.</div><div id="00:00:42.480" class="transcript_line"> So the devolution campaign, I mean, do you remember what was on television in the run-up to the</div><div id="00:00:48.640" class="transcript_line"> referendum in 1997?
