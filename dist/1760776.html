    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then so now it&#039;s recording so I&#039;m with Gordon and Linda Shears and is this</div><div id="00:00:07.900" class="transcript_line"> Marshfield&#039;s? Saint Brides. Saint Brides okay and it&#039;s Friday July the 5th already 2019</div><div id="00:00:18.080" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;m just gonna pop this here yeah and Gordon can you just tell me</div><div id="00:00:26.720" class="transcript_line"> where you were born? Well I was born in Chapmans Farm in Peterstone in 13th of</div><div id="00:00:32.400" class="transcript_line"> February 1934 came here in the June and I&#039;ve been here ever since. So why did your</div><div id="00:00:42.040" class="transcript_line"> parents move here? Well the Chapmans Farm wasn&#039;t big enough it wasn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:00:48.360" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t hold enough stock to pay you know make a living and I think the</div><div id="00:00:53.760" class="transcript_line"> owner was pretty hot on the rent at the time probably wanted three or four pound an acre</div><div id="00:00:59.120" class="transcript_line"> different than today. Was it Tridiga Park farm then? This was the one in Peterstone</div><div id="00:01:08.440" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it? Yeah so this one was the Tridiga? Tridiga Estate. Yeah so what sort of</div><div id="00:01:15.720" class="transcript_line"> landlords were they that you know? Well I didn&#039;t have much to do with them</div><div id="00:01:22.120" class="transcript_line"> because soon as my father died I bought it had passed to the Romney Builders or</div><div id="00:01:27.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah the Romney Builders right. Tridiga Estate I don&#039;t think they they didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:33.800" class="transcript_line"> bother you know they they come and done the repairs on the roofs.</div><div id="00:01:38.080" class="transcript_line"> Look what&#039;s wrong with the tree. The moorings climbed up the tree. Oh yes. Well I never I&#039;ve never seen a mooring climb up the tree. Look at it right up there. The mooring that comes to</div><div id="00:01:47.320" class="transcript_line"> fall is the big mooring climb up there. Sorry about that. No that&#039;s alright.</div><div id="00:01:53.320" class="transcript_line"> So Gordon who were your parents what were their names? Well my father William James Sir O&#039;Shares he was originally a father in all they</div><div id="00:02:04.880" class="transcript_line"> farmed in my custom. He when he was 18 in 1916 he was called up for the service</div><div id="00:02:13.960" class="transcript_line"> first World War went to France he was a in charge of a mule train taking supplies</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> up to the front and bringing never talked about it but probably bringing wounded</div><div id="00:02:28.920" class="transcript_line"> or dead soldiers back up to the rising mud and the trenches. They had to have</div><div id="00:02:37.400" class="transcript_line"> duck boarding down for the mules to walk on. If the mule went off the duck boarding</div><div id="00:02:42.720" class="transcript_line"> he had a heck of a job to pull him back on to it. And he had two years in the</div><div id="00:02:51.680" class="transcript_line"> service. Came home when my mother lived in the next farm, Newlands Farm which is</div><div id="00:03:00.240" class="transcript_line"> down beyond Shalim camp. I don&#039;t know much about it. Tell me about the when he</div><div id="00:03:11.960" class="transcript_line"> warned there was a fire. Oh yeah they had a they tunneled into this side of this</div><div id="00:03:17.800" class="transcript_line"> hill and they had places off a main entrance you know for bugs for the troops</div><div id="00:03:27.600" class="transcript_line"> to sleep and they had a big, I don&#039;t know what it was, a stove in the middle of it and this one</div><div id="00:03:39.080" class="transcript_line"> my father woke up and was full of smoke and it had caught fire. He went to his</div><div id="00:03:43.960" class="transcript_line"> superior officer and woke him up, told him. He didn&#039;t take much interest in it</div><div id="00:03:51.720" class="transcript_line"> but anyway he got out with five others. That&#039;s all of his platoon.</div><div id="00:04:00.160" class="transcript_line"> He got them, woke them up didn&#039;t he? But the officer went back to sleep.</div><div id="00:04:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Went back to sleep and died with the fumes. Quite a few did.</div><div id="00:04:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Well he was in a mattress to regiment. Yeah but he woke him up you know and told him</div><div id="00:04:15.400" class="transcript_line"> because the fumes killed him and I killed others. But Gordon&#039;s father went around</div><div id="00:04:22.120" class="transcript_line"> and got out with him. The officer did make the effort to come out with him but the others you know.</div><div id="00:04:28.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s only one story he said and didn&#039;t say much about it. He had gas as well didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:04:37.320" class="transcript_line"> No he wasn&#039;t gassed. He was gassing, he made his chest bad.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No that was it yeah the wetness in the trenches and all it was never dry they weren&#039;t and he came out</div><div id="00:04:47.440" class="transcript_line"> and he had asthma then all his life. Really? And of course my mother was in the next farm,</div><div id="00:04:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Beatrice Elizabeth Ward. She drove a milk bloat in Cardiff delivering milk because they had</div><div id="00:05:01.440" class="transcript_line"> three or four milk carts. Her brothers Clifford and Albert they both had rounds as well and I</div><div id="00:05:14.280" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t know where they got married but my father took a milk round in Patches Street in Grangetown</div><div id="00:05:20.960" class="transcript_line"> of his own and he had a Morris van and a rally motorbike and sidecar and he had a man working</div><div id="00:05:26.600" class="transcript_line"> for him. He had one round in town and one round in Pennyland and the Pennyland people paid up to</div><div id="00:05:34.880" class="transcript_line"> date because they were the affluent part of Cardiff but the ones in town by 1926 he was old 500 pound.</div><div id="00:05:43.280" class="transcript_line"> That was a long penny though see. So he sold the round and come and found the farm was</div><div id="00:05:49.340" class="transcript_line"> available he came out and started farming. Did you say he was delivering milk on the</div><div id="00:05:55.960" class="transcript_line"> motorbike and sidecar? With the sidecar yeah somebody I think my father drove the van,</div><div id="00:06:02.080" class="transcript_line"> a Morris van he had. But the horses left? He didn&#039;t have any horses on the work round.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> All right. He was motorised. So but did because he was working with the mule trains on the back</div><div id="00:06:21.400" class="transcript_line"> you know was that because he&#039;d worked with horses back home? Yes he worked with horses on his</div><div id="00:06:26.920" class="transcript_line"> father&#039;s place yeah because his father planned on the Rupert estate. Where was that? At Magreston</div><div id="00:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> and the house was condemned and before he went to the army he hauled all the stone to build a</div><div id="00:06:45.400" class="transcript_line"> new house there and then the estate went bankrupt so they said we can&#039;t build a new house so this</div><div id="00:06:52.920" class="transcript_line"> farm will have to be joined onto the next one so he had to move out so they went to St. Gravel&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:58.200" class="transcript_line"> for a year or two. But in the forest of Dean? Yeah. Oh really? He didn&#039;t like it there and he knew someone I think</div><div id="00:07:09.720" class="transcript_line"> it was to do with the Baptist Chapel who owned new house and they took that on but he didn&#039;t live</div><div id="00:07:16.920" class="transcript_line"> long when he was there. So where is new house? New house is just this side of the</div><div id="00:07:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Shire Newton. If you noticed on the corner just before you go to the Shire Newton there&#039;s a house with no roof.</div><div id="00:07:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well that&#039;s new house. Oh. They said that the walls are bold or something it wasn&#039;t worth</div><div id="00:07:44.360" class="transcript_line"> repairing that&#039;s why they let it go direct. It&#039;s a shame. It used to be a lovely house here.</div><div id="00:07:54.120" class="transcript_line"> Used to have goats and everything outside and ducks and chickens and everything it used to look so pretty</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> you know and by the road. Well Billy Cutter was. But now it&#039;s all untouched. Billy Cutter farmed it for years.</div><div id="00:08:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Now Cutter&#039;s farmed it and then</div><div id="00:08:13.080" class="transcript_line"> a saddler on it. The Coleman had it then. Yes the Coleman had it. So then your father and mother had to find somewhere else to live?</div><div id="00:08:21.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah well they. You had to look around in Patches Street now I don&#039;t know whether they lived there as well.</div><div id="00:08:28.520" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got a clue where they lived. Did they have a dairy herd then? No but they had</div><div id="00:08:35.880" class="transcript_line"> milk come down in 17 gallon churns from Carmarthen every morning on the train.</div><div id="00:08:43.960" class="transcript_line"> You had to go to the station and pick up the churns. In Leaport? No in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:08:50.600" class="transcript_line"> And then they took them around and they took they used to put them in people&#039;s churns.</div><div id="00:08:56.360" class="transcript_line"> They had it in one bottle. No they had to dip it out the churn. They took it out ladled out and</div><div id="00:09:02.200" class="transcript_line"> yes put it in people&#039;s whatever they brought out. Yes.</div><div id="00:09:08.280" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s your earliest this is so your parents then came here? Cherry Orchard? Yeah in 1934.</div><div id="00:09:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah so that was before you were born? No I was four. Three or four men told me. They were the</div><div id="00:09:23.960" class="transcript_line"> cat and dog always in Beecherstone that long one that&#039;s when he was born in that house. That&#039;s the one</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> they rented. Oh. So now you know he didn&#039;t come many miles away to come down here. I&#039;ve been here</div><div id="00:09:36.680" class="transcript_line"> ever since. Continuous. 85 years. I&#039;m the patriarch of the area since Phil Stocks. Since May or June.</div><div id="00:09:44.520" class="transcript_line"> Like it yeah. Since Phil Stocks died. Yeah. He&#039;s the oldest one. He would have had better.</div><div id="00:09:50.760" class="transcript_line"> You know. Better. Well I&#039;m here with you now Gordon so we&#039;re gonna have to make.</div><div id="00:09:55.320" class="transcript_line"> But you know. I&#039;m five years older than John Turner in Church Farm because he&#039;s coming up to 80 now.</div><div id="00:10:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah yeah but Gordon stayed here where others that of their parents were here</div><div id="00:10:08.440" class="transcript_line"> and all that time had gone. They moved away got married and moved away and they&#039;d come back</div><div id="00:10:14.760" class="transcript_line"> to the area like Sid. Not continuous. No Sheila. She moved into Newport for a while.</div><div id="00:10:22.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But she&#039;s younger than me. But her mother died. She was living on the corner there.</div><div id="00:10:27.800" class="transcript_line"> You know. You just had the post office. Yeah. Do you have any brothers and sisters? I had a sister</div><div id="00:10:33.240" class="transcript_line"> born in 1926. She was eight years old when you went to John. Yeah. But she died when she was 80.</div><div id="00:10:40.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. In 2007. Yeah. Yeah. So what was it what&#039;s your earliest memory then here?</div><div id="00:10:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Can I name a few? I could remember.</div><div id="00:10:56.680" class="transcript_line"> And Gordon could remember when he was a young lad. We&#039;ve got a gun sight field down the lane.</div><div id="00:11:06.200" class="transcript_line"> In the wall. In the wall. The servicemen used to go down to train with their guns. There was a</div><div id="00:11:13.240" class="transcript_line"> teapot where they used to be sat in that pit with the going across they&#039;d be firing to train.</div><div id="00:11:19.720" class="transcript_line"> They used to take coachmen to the bottom of the fire. We&#039;ve got this one shed still there.</div><div id="00:11:25.160" class="transcript_line"> The other part of the other shed is up here in pieces up here. We got to put together one day.</div><div id="00:11:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But yes they took over the field and they used to do the shooting and everything. Train them.</div><div id="00:11:38.040" class="transcript_line"> Every day they&#039;d bring him down and take him back in the evening.</div><div id="00:11:44.360" class="transcript_line"> When he was down there with his dad, a little boy, just before the wall,</div><div id="00:11:51.480" class="transcript_line"> in the wall, he was down the field with his father and they were doing something,</div><div id="00:11:57.640" class="transcript_line"> checking animals I suppose or whatever. He looked up and saw a plane and he was waving</div><div id="00:12:02.680" class="transcript_line"> to them because it was so low down. It was a plane with a man taking films and photographs</div><div id="00:12:09.240" class="transcript_line"> of the docks. He was waving to him and the man, you could see his face of the man looking down</div><div id="00:12:18.920" class="transcript_line"> like you know because he was taking photographs of the area for them to bomb the docks.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing. Instead when they did start bombing Rona&#039;s area,</div><div id="00:12:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Patti Reese used to live in the farm, a long farm down there, that people can stay there now</div><div id="00:12:35.480" class="transcript_line"> in caravans and whatever. It&#039;s all done up now. She&#039;s gone now. But the bomb came down there.</div><div id="00:12:45.320" class="transcript_line"> The landline came down there. When they had a big fire in the night, all were in the house.</div><div id="00:12:51.400" class="transcript_line"> When they came out in the morning, there was this big unexploded bomb with the parachute on it.</div><div id="00:12:58.360" class="transcript_line"> They dropped two mines. The one in the field over the road exploded. It took the roof off the house.</div><div id="00:13:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So her house was this house? No. Someone else&#039;s house. Really? Yeah. But they had the</div><div id="00:13:10.600" class="transcript_line"> mine right there. They stayed there all night and with this exploded landmine. This German had been</div><div id="00:13:15.880" class="transcript_line"> taking the photographs, look at everything and Gordon had waved up to him like you know. He was</div><div id="00:13:21.400" class="transcript_line"> looking down. Someone had gone out with a lamp, a dim lamp and he&#039;d seen it and he dropped the bomb</div><div id="00:13:30.280" class="transcript_line"> then thinking it was someone&#039;s signal. This was in the night, not in the day. I know in the night</div><div id="00:13:35.720" class="transcript_line"> just pitch black you know. So of course he thought someone was giving him a signal to drop the bomb.</div><div id="00:13:43.160" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t have any sense. So of course you know he just missed the dock then. Why?</div><div id="00:13:50.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s an incredible story. Yeah. They dropped some down just the other side of the village as well.</div><div id="00:13:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And exploded that was. Where was that then? In front of Greyhouse farm. Yeah. And</div><div id="00:14:06.600" class="transcript_line"> they closed the road so that our bus service used to have to go along the main road and down the</div><div id="00:14:11.240" class="transcript_line"> narrow road here. We used to have a driver who only had one eye and he used a belt down</div><div id="00:14:20.600" class="transcript_line"> that road and he was only wide enough for the bus. He used a belt down that road in the dark.</div><div id="00:14:25.240" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t imagine that the lights on the bus were very dim because they didn&#039;t allow them.</div><div id="00:14:30.760" class="transcript_line"> And there was big greenies on the one side. It was to scare the life out of us.</div><div id="00:14:36.360" class="transcript_line"> How long was the road closed for then? About a fortnight I think.</div><div id="00:14:41.400" class="transcript_line"> So were there any craters left from where these bombs were? No, they all filled up.</div><div id="00:14:44.760" class="transcript_line"> They filled up. Yeah the one where the landmine, that was a crater for years. It had even that</div><div id="00:14:52.040" class="transcript_line"> reeds growing in it and things. It was full of water but in the end Peter Rees filled it up.</div><div id="00:14:59.880" class="transcript_line"> Was your firebird called up for the second world war? No, no.</div><div id="00:15:03.720" class="transcript_line"> He wouldn&#039;t have gone anyway because his asthma was too bad. Oh gosh, yeah. No he would have been</div><div id="00:15:09.400" class="transcript_line"> 41 then so he would have been a bit too old. Yeah and he had the farm and everything to me.</div><div id="00:15:20.920" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of farm was this then? It was always milking. Sheep.</div><div id="00:15:26.040" class="transcript_line"> Pigs they used to have years ago. I didn&#039;t see any pigs because they&#039;d gone. Chickens.</div><div id="00:15:33.080" class="transcript_line"> But they had dairy, milking so it was hard work all in the night.</div><div id="00:15:38.600" class="transcript_line"> They allowed Italian prisoners to work on the farm and the one, he was a tall thin fellow I can</div><div id="00:15:48.680" class="transcript_line"> just about remember him. His name was Gatti G-H-E-I. I don&#039;t know what his first name was and he was a</div><div id="00:15:55.480" class="transcript_line"> really hard worker. He was drafted into the Italian army and he won happily by it and I think he was</div><div id="00:16:04.280" class="transcript_line"> glad to be captured and he worked hard. There was another one who was the exact opposite him. He</div><div id="00:16:10.360" class="transcript_line"> was short and dumpy and he was a lazy so and so. But he had Gatti for quite a long time.</div><div id="00:16:21.080" class="transcript_line"> So they would be dropped off in the morning? Yeah they had a like a hammy lorry type.</div><div id="00:16:26.280" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d all sit in the side and they&#039;d drop them off pick them up about five o&#039;clock in the night.</div><div id="00:16:31.080" class="transcript_line"> Where was the POW camp then? There was one in Van Martin. One on the corner they used to have.</div><div id="00:16:41.240" class="transcript_line"> You came from Newport. Where that big gate is. Opposite Devon schools.</div><div id="00:16:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Opposite Devon schools there was a camp. But there&#039;s one where Trevor used to have as well was there?</div><div id="00:16:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh that was an army camp. There was a battery. There were no prisoners. One of them went to</div><div id="00:16:58.920" class="transcript_line"> prison there? No. I thought there were. Van Martin was a prisoner of war camp and that one there at</div><div id="00:17:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Dufferin. The camp in Trinidad House. Well by Trinidad House that was American.</div><div id="00:17:17.480" class="transcript_line"> When I was in school there was root martyrs. Americans just had root martyrs past us.</div><div id="00:17:24.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to go out to see them. Mrs William just said I was to go out to see them by the gate.</div><div id="00:17:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Nearly every time we went past somebody would throw out a load of sweets.</div><div id="00:17:38.200" class="transcript_line"> That must have made such an impression on the young boy these Americans. Yeah they were really</div><div id="00:17:45.240" class="transcript_line"> you know long.</div><div id="00:17:48.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know when he was in them but there have been a lot. Over 100 probably in each one.</div><div id="00:17:54.360" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d be one go past and then there&#039;d be another one. There might be two or three.</div><div id="00:17:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Three groups. Yeah I don&#039;t know how far. He&#039;d had to march all the way around.</div><div id="00:18:04.200" class="transcript_line"> What school did you go to? The one in the corner in St. Brights until I was...</div><div id="00:18:09.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a little... there&#039;s a... where the churchyard is and the very corner is a little small churchyard.</div><div id="00:18:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Well that building next to it was the school. It was only a small one just for so many people.</div><div id="00:18:20.760" class="transcript_line"> It was 35 I think. Oh my goodness. We saw it before it got done up. You know I looked in the room.</div><div id="00:18:27.720" class="transcript_line"> They were going to do it and you know maybe took a lot of stuff away.</div><div id="00:18:31.560" class="transcript_line"> But you know it wasn&#039;t very big room but it was cozy like. Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh they had a fire in it. Yeah. One classroom there was only one teacher every day.</div><div id="00:18:40.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. There was too many for her. She couldn&#039;t handle it because we were there until we were</div><div id="00:18:46.360" class="transcript_line"> 11 or 12. Or if you didn&#039;t go to Beasley you went there till you were 14.</div><div id="00:18:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And of course she couldn&#039;t teach the young one that knew intake and the older ones. So they split</div><div id="00:18:58.440" class="transcript_line"> it and Mrs Morris came then. Well did they just have a curtain across the... No they just split it</div><div id="00:19:04.280" class="transcript_line"> one side and the other. You had to put up with Mrs Morris telling the kids because I was a bit</div><div id="00:19:09.240" class="transcript_line"> bigger then. Mrs Morris telling the kids starting them on the alphabets you know.</div><div id="00:19:19.080" class="transcript_line"> Mrs Hughes was there when I went there. I must have started about beginning of 39.</div><div id="00:19:25.880" class="transcript_line"> And while I was there Lynn Harding was a very famous</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Shakespearean actor before the war and during the war. And they had a plaque in the school wall,</div><div id="00:19:39.720" class="transcript_line"> on the school wall with his you know a bronze thing with his</div><div id="00:19:47.320" class="transcript_line"> autograph you know his outlining on it and embossed it was and writing on it. I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:19:53.720" class="transcript_line"> know where it is now. It went in the church. Why was that there? And then it&#039;s supposed to</div><div id="00:19:59.880" class="transcript_line"> have gone in the hall after. Did he come visit it then? He came and visited it. I thought so.</div><div id="00:20:04.360" class="transcript_line"> To see it. Yeah. Did you? All I can remember of him he was a very impressive looking man and he</div><div id="00:20:11.560" class="transcript_line"> had a very very deep voice you know. Come to think of it he was a really</div><div id="00:20:18.360" class="transcript_line"> a Shakespearean actor with his voice. Very much like what&#039;s his name?</div><div id="00:20:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Richard Burton. Richard Burton&#039;s voice. Yeah I thought you meant Richard Burton.</div><div id="00:20:33.640" class="transcript_line"> So was it, did this actor, did he have any links to St. Brian? Yes he was born in the church house,</div><div id="00:20:39.480" class="transcript_line"> the pub. Yeah it&#039;s a house now. It&#039;s still got a kind of a mouth but it&#039;s a big house now. They&#039;ve</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> put houses all in the area where the car park used to be. That&#039;s up the side church road.</div><div id="00:20:54.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just on the corner here at the end. But yeah he was you know very</div><div id="00:20:59.720" class="transcript_line"> soft. Yeah he was born there. I don&#039;t know what he did in the church. That&#039;s amazing. You remember that?</div><div id="00:21:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah they used to, another member of the war was they had smoke screens. They had lobbies with</div><div id="00:21:12.040" class="transcript_line"> trailers behind them with oil in it and a chimney up the back and they used to generate smoke through</div><div id="00:21:19.160" class="transcript_line"> these, this chimney and if whichever way the wind was blowing if the wind was blowing from the west</div><div id="00:21:26.360" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d be over this side and it would be blowing all over the but docks. It&#039;s just clouded against</div><div id="00:21:35.560" class="transcript_line"> air attacks. If it was an easterly wind they&#039;d go over an ash and they generated there. You remember</div><div id="00:21:42.760" class="transcript_line"> that? I can remember them. I remember them just down the road here practicing one day</div><div id="00:21:48.680" class="transcript_line"> and my father used to be in dread of them going further up because he was asking me wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:53.560" class="transcript_line"> have been able to take the smoke. Yeah luckily they never did. They did down on the corner there,</div><div id="00:21:59.720" class="transcript_line"> they did generate it. A practice one in the daytime that was. So you must have seen quite a bit of</div><div id="00:22:06.760" class="transcript_line"> activity because you had Newport docks that side, Cardiff docks this side. We used to get under the table</div><div id="00:22:11.720" class="transcript_line"> very often when we had the German bombers over. My mum used to live in Newport and she actually saw</div><div id="00:22:22.120" class="transcript_line"> they were all firing up at the planes and she actually saw a German plane spiraling down on fire</div><div id="00:22:29.880" class="transcript_line"> and they could see the pilot in there before he crashed into a house. It was a tobacco in his family</div><div id="00:22:37.640" class="transcript_line"> he had tobacco shop and all his family were killed. The mother, father, daughter were killed in his</div><div id="00:22:43.560" class="transcript_line"> house opposite my mum&#039;s but they actually saw that he couldn&#039;t do anything the German pilot to avoid</div><div id="00:22:48.760" class="transcript_line"> because he&#039;d been hit look see and he was on fire and he died himself but you know crashed into</div><div id="00:22:54.200" class="transcript_line"> opposite the other side of the road to where my mum lived. That&#039;s where the fire station is now.</div><div id="00:22:59.960" class="transcript_line"> The fire station&#039;s there now. Off road. Off road. Yeah. Gosh. Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have sirens going off down here? All the time yeah.</div><div id="00:23:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Did you have gas masks? Yes I had to take gas masks to school every day on my back.</div><div id="00:23:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You get told off if you got to go back home and get it if you didn&#039;t take it bring it.</div><div id="00:23:24.920" class="transcript_line"> So you should make you go back home and get it. So how far was school for you then from here?</div><div id="00:23:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh just in the village down the corner then. What are you about quarter of an hour? It&#039;s about</div><div id="00:23:33.880" class="transcript_line"> 200 yards isn&#039;t it? No it&#039;s more than that. 300 yards. So you had to walk there on your own?</div><div id="00:23:38.600" class="transcript_line"> Well there&#039;s a couple of others used to come to my aunties and my aunties.</div><div id="00:23:45.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been driving. So very very rural here. I mean the western Welsh buses used to bring</div><div id="00:23:53.960" class="transcript_line"> the sailors down for their practice and sometimes a driver would stop and say do you want to lift to</div><div id="00:23:59.000" class="transcript_line"> school? He used to get in the bus and go down to the school. They wouldn&#039;t be alone. No.</div><div id="00:24:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Where were the sailors doing their practice? Down in the shed I told you about. Oh really?</div><div id="00:24:12.920" class="transcript_line"> At the bottom of the lane we&#039;ve got a big shed there. Oh that&#039;s where they were doing it? There</div><div id="00:24:16.040" class="transcript_line"> used to be all windows in it but children broke in. So what were you doing there? There was an</div><div id="00:24:22.280" class="transcript_line"> office there. They had an office there for the ones that were sitting there. As I said they had</div><div id="00:24:29.480" class="transcript_line"> the pits with the gun and they pretend planes going across and they&#039;d be shooting at them like</div><div id="00:24:36.040" class="transcript_line"> a big target practice. They had a big target on the bank and a big ash heap in front of it</div><div id="00:24:44.600" class="transcript_line"> on the field and they had a machine gun in Peter Rees&#039;s field halfway down the lane and they used</div><div id="00:24:51.720" class="transcript_line"> to fire at this target and the stray bullets that were off just to go in the ash and after the war</div><div id="00:24:59.240" class="transcript_line"> a fellow went down there and sieved through the ashes and he had about I think about 10 full big</div><div id="00:25:06.040" class="transcript_line"> bags of bullets out of the ashes. We still found them later because the woman down the lane got the</div><div id="00:25:14.120" class="transcript_line"> bomb disposal and they came to visit her and because he had to go in Elfield and he was going</div><div id="00:25:20.200" class="transcript_line"> and the children were playing in Elfield. They shouldn&#039;t have been in there like because there</div><div id="00:25:23.400" class="transcript_line"> was animals on all end. But anyway they found these bullets and everything and these</div><div id="00:25:30.920" class="transcript_line"> these ammunition of course they were wearing them. They thought it was unexploded. So they had the</div><div id="00:25:35.720" class="transcript_line"> army the boys came here. I don&#039;t remember that. Yeah it was you know they had two children.</div><div id="00:25:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Ginger yeah remember. I can&#039;t think of that. Julie. Oh Julie and her husband yeah. Did you have a</div><div id="00:25:57.160" class="transcript_line"> shelter at school? A bomb shelter at school? Yes well it was above the ground. I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:26:01.640" class="transcript_line"> where it&#039;s still there in the playground. It was part of the Hale Ash you know big inches.</div><div id="00:26:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Or was it like a? No it was just a brick building with a concrete roof. Two doors in it that&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:26:15.240" class="transcript_line"> We never used it. It was never a day like air raid down here. No. Not longer in school. Did you have</div><div id="00:26:22.200" class="transcript_line"> to have like practice at school about what to do if it did go off or anything like that? I expect so.</div><div id="00:26:29.240" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember now. So I remember after I was born just after war 94 to 5 I can remember they</div><div id="00:26:36.600" class="transcript_line"> used to do the sirens. Yeah they had one by Shepherd&#039;s Fish Shop didn&#039;t they? Yeah they</div><div id="00:26:46.440" class="transcript_line"> used to let it go off a certain day every month or something. To make sure it worked. Make sure it</div><div id="00:26:54.280" class="transcript_line"> worked in case there was any. Really? Yeah I can remember that. Yeah I don&#039;t think it&#039;s there now.</div><div id="00:27:00.040" class="transcript_line"> No I haven&#039;t done anything for years. During the Cold War it was. Yeah did you have a bomb shelter here</div><div id="00:27:05.720" class="transcript_line"> at home? No only the table. They were into the kitchen table. It&#039;s hilarious when you think about</div><div id="00:27:11.320" class="transcript_line"> that the kitchen table. Were there any gun batteries down here? Yes well on the on the corners</div><div id="00:27:20.360" class="transcript_line"> where there&#039;s all these bends are there was an army camp there that was an artillery and radar station.</div><div id="00:27:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah they had all sorts of guns there. Yeah that&#039;s why I thought there was prisoner</div><div id="00:27:33.080" class="transcript_line"> walls well but it was all this army station was it? Yeah. That&#039;s where I told all the buildings were in</div><div id="00:27:37.800" class="transcript_line"> I thought. Yeah there&#039;s still a couple of buildings there. There are still buildings. Really? Yes they&#039;re lovely strong</div><div id="00:27:43.160" class="transcript_line"> buildings they are as well. But yeah they. Well after the war the people that were short of houses they all</div><div id="00:27:49.960" class="transcript_line"> went in there and took possession of it and there was probably about 20 families living in there.</div><div id="00:27:56.280" class="transcript_line"> So they had a place to go to because of the war. They were there for a good while because Mrs. Pugh was</div><div id="00:28:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Arthur McGann. Yeah. Oh McGann. Arthur McGann. Yeah that&#039;s his. Is he buried in the church house? Yes.</div><div id="00:28:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So was he an Irishman? No no no he loved him he never knew his parents he was in a</div><div id="00:28:18.040" class="transcript_line"> in a home but in a home he was you know. They were both in the services. In the services. And</div><div id="00:28:24.440" class="transcript_line"> he was born and they had to go back into the services. He&#039;s from Melvin Farrow and you&#039;ve never heard from him again.</div><div id="00:28:30.280" class="transcript_line"> No. No. He says. But um. I think he was in London there you want it. I don&#039;t know he came down here but</div><div id="00:28:39.480" class="transcript_line"> I can remember him. He worked for Derek Baker to Orchard Farm driving the ford and tractor</div><div id="00:28:47.240" class="transcript_line"> and used to do some ploughing and all and</div><div id="00:28:54.760" class="transcript_line"> because I know he went past our front gate with his discarrows and caught the gate and bent it.</div><div id="00:28:59.160" class="transcript_line"> It was never the same. Mrs. Pugh was she there as well? Mrs. Pugh had the first one. They were the first in.</div><div id="00:29:06.680" class="transcript_line"> She was instigator. So who was she then? She lived in Church Road as well. But had they come from outside the area?</div><div id="00:29:14.680" class="transcript_line"> No. I don&#039;t know where she came from but Bill Pugh was born down here. His father was a</div><div id="00:29:22.840" class="transcript_line"> railwayman. And he, I know his father was a railwayman. But he worked on the roads.</div><div id="00:29:29.000" class="transcript_line"> For the, maybe in some islands. He used to drive an island motorcyle trimming the roads.</div><div id="00:29:37.400" class="transcript_line"> In the summer. I don&#039;t know what he did altogether. But he had a gammy leg from a motorbike accident.</div><div id="00:29:44.840" class="transcript_line"> So when he was on his motorbike he had his one leg stuck straight out because he couldn&#039;t bend it.</div><div id="00:29:52.600" class="transcript_line"> What about the Home Guard? Do you remember them? Yeah I can remember them. They got in trouble.</div><div id="00:29:59.640" class="transcript_line"> They had a pill box down</div><div id="00:30:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Pontestal Ground which is down past the lakes at the moment. And they were supposed to watch</div><div id="00:30:10.120" class="transcript_line"> the Bristol Channel you know. And the commander went down there one night and found them all asleep.</div><div id="00:30:18.680" class="transcript_line"> And that was riot. They put foot before the firing squad for being a super duty.</div><div id="00:30:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Did you know any of them? Any local men?</div><div id="00:30:31.240" class="transcript_line"> A few used to come here to John. John was his age years old mental. She did go dancing and a few of</div><div id="00:30:37.880" class="transcript_line"> them would bring her home. Because we got spoons from one of the, from the US. Oh US. I got on them.</div><div id="00:30:45.160" class="transcript_line"> And two spoons. I use regular. Every day I use them. And they&#039;re still lovely looking spoon.</div><div id="00:30:52.120" class="transcript_line"> They came out of the pig swill they did. Did they? Someone put them in did they? No they used to,</div><div id="00:30:59.960" class="transcript_line"> they used to collect it, boil it up and they called it nutrient. And they used to deliver it</div><div id="00:31:05.160" class="transcript_line"> for the pigs. Of course when you were chopping it up you&#039;d find a spoon in amongst it. Yeah</div><div id="00:31:09.880" class="transcript_line"> where they&#039;d emptied it in. I&#039;m looking what they were emptying in from their pigeons.</div><div id="00:31:19.320" class="transcript_line"> So Joan would have been a young woman at the time. So she used to bring, they used to drop her home</div><div id="00:31:25.240" class="transcript_line"> looks here after dance or whatever. Yeah. Walk her home. Walk her home. Yeah. Well she was,</div><div id="00:31:31.240" class="transcript_line"> she joined the land army because all the, all the, when they come to 16 or 17 they could join the</div><div id="00:31:36.760" class="transcript_line"> land army. Yes. So she joined the land army. And where did she work? She worked here. She could</div><div id="00:31:42.280" class="transcript_line"> work at home. On the farm. Really? So did she wear what? Yeah. She wore the land army uniform.</div><div id="00:31:48.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah the breeches and all. Yeah. And the green jumper I think it was. Yeah. Was it good, were</div><div id="00:31:56.840" class="transcript_line"> there lots of dances with the Americans? I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know. There was. There used to.</div><div id="00:32:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Auntie Phyllis and Uncle Penry, she used to have them bring her, bring her, because she stayed here</div><div id="00:32:10.840" class="transcript_line"> for a while. Yeah. Lived here for a while she did. Auntie Phyllis did. Gordon&#039;s mum&#039;s sister. And</div><div id="00:32:21.080" class="transcript_line"> she can, she said she was walking home with one of the servicemen and she didn&#039;t realize it. It</div><div id="00:32:27.480" class="transcript_line"> was a pitch black you know because they didn&#039;t have any lights along here. Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Never do. There&#039;s still no lights. But he was bringing her home and was they married there?</div><div id="00:32:38.920" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t married there. They weren&#039;t married but they were caught in her,</div><div id="00:32:43.560" class="transcript_line"> fiance was walking behind him and she didn&#039;t know. Walked all the way up. Listen to him and</div><div id="00:32:49.800" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Penry. He said she never knew. Of course I bet she had a shock when she heard. I bet she did.</div><div id="00:32:55.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness. She got married before the war. He was an</div><div id="00:33:00.360" class="transcript_line"> Air Force. But he went off with an, she had one child I saw and he went off with another woman.</div><div id="00:33:08.200" class="transcript_line"> So she was on her own. So she was literally, she got, she was divorced and</div><div id="00:33:16.040" class="transcript_line"> Penry was trying to, wanted to court her before she got married. Oh I see. He was</div><div id="00:33:22.120" class="transcript_line"> heartbroken when she married him. Oh never, I never knew that. Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:26.680" class="transcript_line"> But anyway in the end of course he did marry her. Oh. But that was in 1946. He had a little girl and</div><div id="00:33:32.040" class="transcript_line"> he treated her as his own you know. Oh that&#039;s nice. Now they never had any more children. Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:33:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was, she was quite tall Auntie Felicity, Uncle Penry because he was shorter. Yeah he was.</div><div id="00:33:41.160" class="transcript_line"> Nice looking man, he was always fresh looking. He came here to, he brought the, they had the farm</div><div id="00:33:48.360" class="transcript_line"> car because he worked on the mother&#039;s farm. Brought the car here to pick my mother and father up to</div><div id="00:33:54.520" class="transcript_line"> come get married and we&#039;d bought a tractor a couple of days before and they delivered it.</div><div id="00:34:00.120" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s, he was in his wedding suit and he had to get up on the lorry and drive the tractor off</div><div id="00:34:04.840" class="transcript_line"> the lot before he went to his wedding. So what was it like growing up here in this you know,</div><div id="00:34:13.240" class="transcript_line"> in this village in this area and has it changed much? Well it changed quite a lot.</div><div id="00:34:20.280" class="transcript_line"> This, the traffic is bad. Traffic is terrible now because it&#039;s between the two cities. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:34:24.680" class="transcript_line"> early mornings and Auntie time you know all the children, it&#039;s the lorries that go past,</div><div id="00:34:31.480" class="transcript_line"> it shakes the house. I can&#039;t. I yeah, I always remember we were going, I said to Linda you know</div><div id="00:34:37.880" class="transcript_line"> we were going to buy a bull up in Abergavenny or see this bull in Abergavenny back in mid-60s</div><div id="00:34:45.400" class="transcript_line"> and Albert Priest saw them and his wife, they said they&#039;d drive us up to see this bull</div><div id="00:34:54.040" class="transcript_line"> but they couldn&#039;t get away in the day so he said he&#039;d be here at about seven.</div><div id="00:34:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Well I was waiting outside from seven o&#039;clock until eight o&#039;clock and the only thing that went past</div><div id="00:35:05.720" class="transcript_line"> was a red and white bus, a service bus.
