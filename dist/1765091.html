    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well you see, although we look back on the English and the Welsh, particularly in</div><div id="00:00:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Monmouthshire, it is bone-filt in Canada to be able to understand the Welsh, even if you</div><div id="00:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t speak it too well, to understand it, and also the English, because as I say,</div><div id="00:00:30.720" class="transcript_line"> my mother spoke very little English, my father spoke very little Welsh, although he was a</div><div id="00:00:38.080" class="transcript_line"> self-educated man and a good man, and he could sing Welsh like all the rest of us, and he</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> could sing French and we could sing Russian, but we don&#039;t understand after time what do</div><div id="00:00:49.760" class="transcript_line"> you sing. Now when it came to that, we used to play tricks on my mother, she would, if we didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:56.480" class="transcript_line"> want to do what she wanted us to do, she&#039;d speak to us in Welsh and we&#039;d answer her in English,</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> and all kinds of tricks like that, and we didn&#039;t understand what she was saying if it was something</div><div id="00:01:10.160" class="transcript_line"> that we didn&#039;t want to do, but these are the things that in later life that you look back on</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> and say well when your own children try to do the same thing as you, say well I don&#039;t understand,</div><div id="00:01:24.400" class="transcript_line"> we don&#039;t understand what you mean, so but we used to use it in reverse, that when we wanted</div><div id="00:01:30.160" class="transcript_line"> something from my mother, then we&#039;d speak to her in Welsh and she&#039;d give us the whole world,</div><div id="00:01:36.160" class="transcript_line"> you see this is the value of even of bilingual, particularly in the Welsh and English where we</div><div id="00:01:47.120" class="transcript_line"> were. Now after I came out here, there was an unfortunate situation in Canada of depression</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> well the depression that they had here was to me, was to us, some of us, it was still heaven,</div><div id="00:02:09.200" class="transcript_line"> considering what we had gone through in 1921 and 1926, the depression yet in the 30s was</div><div id="00:02:16.480" class="transcript_line"> was nothing compared to what we had gone through and how we had to live, but there was what served me</div><div id="00:02:24.800" class="transcript_line"> when you asked about Dean Welsh,</div><div id="00:02:29.520" class="transcript_line"> while they were building Eaton&#039;s building here in 1929 and the starting of the best hotel,</div><div id="00:02:38.240" class="transcript_line"> there was a sign on the contractors had a sign</div><div id="00:02:42.160" class="transcript_line"> on it, men wanted no Englishman need apply, so I was around with a few Englishmen, a couple of us</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Welshmen, a few more Welsh than Scotsmen and they said well that&#039;s a funny sign, well I said that</div><div id="00:03:02.400" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t make any difference to me, so I said I&#039;ll go over, so I went over to the office and I said</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re looking for men, well what can you do, I told them anything anybody else can do, I can do,</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> but I see you&#039;ve got a notice out there, he said well you&#039;re English aren&#039;t you,</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t you know, and then I spoke to him in a bit of Welsh, I said no I&#039;m not an Englishman,</div><div id="00:03:27.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a Welshman, so I got a job, you see just for a few days because the conditions on there were so</div><div id="00:03:35.200" class="transcript_line"> you was better off without the job than you was with the job, this is what they call a depression</div><div id="00:03:41.200" class="transcript_line"> in Canada, this is what I learned from a depression, a depression is something that is created</div><div id="00:03:52.400" class="transcript_line"> where although you work you&#039;re better off not working, that&#039;s what the depression is,</div><div id="00:03:58.160" class="transcript_line"> because you could get a couple of meals a day you know from different places as a</div><div id="00:04:02.880" class="transcript_line"> salvaging army or something and this is a fact, this is a fact even after I got a job for the</div><div id="00:04:10.160" class="transcript_line"> city of Saskatoon, I sat down with people who were on relief with identically the same family that</div><div id="00:04:16.480" class="transcript_line"> I had and worked out what they paid in rent and what I paid in rent and what I bought</div><div id="00:04:21.280" class="transcript_line"> and they were better off than me and I was working 10 and 12 hours a day, seven days a week</div><div id="00:04:26.160" class="transcript_line"> for the city of Saskatoon, so you see</div><div id="00:04:31.600" class="transcript_line"> but I had one thing, I wasn&#039;t taking charity and that was one thing that I found out about</div><div id="00:04:40.480" class="transcript_line"> our people, the Welsh people when we came, we&#039;d do anything but take the charity</div><div id="00:04:47.680" class="transcript_line"> because we were dead against charity because it was over the hill to the porters as far as we were</div><div id="00:04:53.280" class="transcript_line"> concerned, so these are some of the things when then they say as the first thing I said,</div><div id="00:05:01.920" class="transcript_line"> well you&#039;re Welsh, well you must be a good singer, well the only, when they ask you why are all</div><div id="00:05:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Welsh people good singers, well all Welsh people are not good singers, that&#039;s for sure, that&#039;s the</div><div id="00:05:15.200" class="transcript_line"> myth and the other one is that if you want to be a good singer you&#039;ve got to put in a lot of practice</div><div id="00:05:21.200" class="transcript_line"> and the reason, the only reason that I know is because Welsh people sing a lot, they put in a lot</div><div id="00:05:30.400" class="transcript_line"> of practice whether they actually go to a music teacher or whether they go to the choir or whether</div><div id="00:05:35.440" class="transcript_line"> they sing together on the street corner but the football game, things they don&#039;t do you, if the</div><div id="00:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Canadians were to do what the Welsh people do, some of their customs and this is what, this is</div><div id="00:05:48.480" class="transcript_line"> another reason why I&#039;d like to see the culture broader, when you go to a football game, sing,</div><div id="00:05:54.720" class="transcript_line"> sing at the football game, I know this is spreading to Europe now and into England and Scotland</div><div id="00:06:03.040" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s thing at the game, when we go to another concert, you go to a concert, everybody sits there</div><div id="00:06:10.720" class="transcript_line"> either smoking or something, nobody starts up a song, you know, but only some of the Welsh</div><div id="00:06:20.880" class="transcript_line"> group will get together, we&#039;ll get together and go to a club, go to a legion club, who do you find</div><div id="00:06:27.520" class="transcript_line"> whether it&#039;s two Welsh people together, a choir sort of thing and it&#039;s proven here</div><div id="00:06:31.520" class="transcript_line"> and when you go away, when you&#039;re traveling, if you&#039;re getting with the Welsh people you sing</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> you see and I think these, this is the reason that the Welsh people are singing but Canadians</div><div id="00:06:44.240" class="transcript_line"> could be just as good as singers because a lot of old people can&#039;t read music, they don&#039;t know one</div><div id="00:06:50.080" class="transcript_line"> note from another but they learn off the person who&#039;s singing alongside them and if you sing long</div><div id="00:06:55.280" class="transcript_line"> enough you&#039;ll learn it and that&#039;s what I think is the one of the reasons why we should retain our</div><div id="00:07:02.640" class="transcript_line"> culture because singing, as I say in my opinion, singing has only in the last 200 years been a</div><div id="00:07:09.120" class="transcript_line"> culture with the Welsh people, has become prominent as a culture, there&#039;s no doubt about it that it was</div><div id="00:07:16.480" class="transcript_line"> there from time immemorial, this community either chanting together or praying together or singing</div><div id="00:07:24.160" class="transcript_line"> together has always been a part of our culture and I think that&#039;s what we should try and retain</div><div id="00:07:31.120" class="transcript_line"> because we, I don&#039;t know, I know when I brought the Welsh society when they asked me to say grace</div><div id="00:07:39.680" class="transcript_line"> one time I sang the grace and everybody said that&#039;s the first time we&#039;d heard that for years,</div><div id="00:07:45.840" class="transcript_line"> you see, we sang the grace</div><div id="00:07:50.720" class="transcript_line"> praise God from whom all blessings flow</div><div id="00:07:57.440" class="transcript_line"> praise him all creatures here below praise him above in heavenly host</div><div id="00:08:09.760" class="transcript_line"> praise father son and holy ghost</div><div id="00:08:17.760" class="transcript_line"> be present at our table lord be here and everywhere adored</div><div id="00:08:32.160" class="transcript_line"> these mercies bless and grant that we may feast in paradise with thee</div><div id="00:08:47.760" class="transcript_line"> you see they don&#039;t do that anymore but we used to sing it every meal at home when we were children</div><div id="00:08:55.760" class="transcript_line"> when we were children would you sing it in English or in Welsh at home?</div><div id="00:08:59.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d say it mostly in English but sometimes in Wales all I could do was there, you know,</div><div id="00:09:07.280" class="transcript_line"> and in Wales where we were the visitor always had the choice of the grace</div><div id="00:09:14.960" class="transcript_line"> if there was someone came to our house for supper we&#039;d ask them to say the grace, I used to say</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> because the reason for that was we knew ours let&#039;s learn theirs and there was this surprise</div><div id="00:09:29.840" class="transcript_line"> in how many different ways they were of blessing, you know, blessing the food and</div><div id="00:09:38.160" class="transcript_line"> these are the things that are missing now too we&#039;ve lost all those we very rarely say grace in ours now</div><div id="00:09:46.560" class="transcript_line"> but the funny part about this when the children come that&#039;s the time we say it we don&#039;t say it</div><div id="00:09:51.040" class="transcript_line"> if it&#039;s adults but when the grandchildren come I we do so we have tried but it&#039;s it&#039;s a lot of</div><div id="00:10:01.440" class="transcript_line"> things that that that enter into it at the festival again I would like to have seen you know a couple</div><div id="00:10:11.600" class="transcript_line"> of our children or children dressed in Welsh costumes. Which festival? The music festival</div><div id="00:10:18.800" class="transcript_line"> in Saskatchewan. You get on and like when when the Queen comes and things like that, you know,</div><div id="00:10:27.280" class="transcript_line"> should I tell you about the incident with the Queen?</div><div id="00:10:32.880" class="transcript_line"> The wife and I had an invitation down to from the Premier to meet the Queen in Regina a year</div><div id="00:10:41.040" class="transcript_line"> ago now July the 4th last year and I thought it was only 12 lunch so we had lunch and then after</div><div id="00:10:49.280" class="transcript_line"> the lunch he came around on the walk around and the Premier was with him we were the first couple</div><div id="00:10:56.160" class="transcript_line"> he walked across to and he said she said he said this is Mr Thayne and this is Mr Thayne she wanted</div><div id="00:11:02.880" class="transcript_line"> to know what I was from I told her from old Regina and wanted to know what I had been doing and I</div><div id="00:11:08.640" class="transcript_line"> told her I&#039;m an organiser with the unions and now that I was with the senior citizens of Pantone</div><div id="00:11:14.240" class="transcript_line"> the Premier and we stopped and talked for for quite a while she was quite interested and</div><div id="00:11:21.920" class="transcript_line"> you see they you you seem to send something out</div><div id="00:11:31.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether I&#039;m an unusual but I find it a lot among a lot of old people</div><div id="00:11:36.640" class="transcript_line"> we built a self-confidence within ourselves and I think this I think this is good and</div><div id="00:11:44.240" class="transcript_line"> this is what we should to meet the Queen you know lots of people said after her</div><div id="00:11:50.080" class="transcript_line"> to meet the Queen I respect her in a position I hope she respects me that&#039;s all I that&#039;s all I</div><div id="00:11:55.520" class="transcript_line"> ask from anybody my you know and I didn&#039;t fall over any chairs or anything else or scrabble</div><div id="00:12:03.360" class="transcript_line"> she speaks to me I speak to her she doesn&#039;t doesn&#039;t make any difference to me but these are the things</div><div id="00:12:10.480" class="transcript_line"> I think that that the Welsh people are losing and losing fast is that Welsh people have a terrific</div><div id="00:12:20.240" class="transcript_line"> amount of self-confidence as a nation they believe they can do everything anything and everything</div><div id="00:12:30.720" class="transcript_line"> we proved it in the armies in the with the with the Welsh regiments in the war if there was</div><div id="00:12:36.240" class="transcript_line"> anything to be done they&#039;d do it they&#039;d do it and I think that is one of the basic things of the</div><div id="00:12:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Welsh people when they take their when they&#039;re convinced that the thing to do is right what</div><div id="00:12:46.880" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re going to do is right they&#039;ll do it you see and I think that&#039;s a part of our culture that is</div><div id="00:12:54.080" class="transcript_line"> is knowing the right from the wrong and we learned very young what was right from wrong the people</div><div id="00:12:59.600" class="transcript_line"> today I don&#039;t think often know the doings been right or wrong they&#039;re supposed to know what is</div><div id="00:13:03.440" class="transcript_line"> right and what is wrong but they don&#039;t know I think that&#039;s the problem but but I think the Welsh culture</div><div id="00:13:09.520" class="transcript_line"> was a part of that</div><div id="00:13:13.440" class="transcript_line"> you know you think for yourself to find out what you think it is right or wrong of course if you&#039;re</div><div id="00:13:18.320" class="transcript_line"> wrong you&#039;re pretty soon told but and is it good is it good that&#039;s the I think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:28.720" class="transcript_line"> all of my life anyway and all of the people that I&#039;ve run into</div><div id="00:13:34.160" class="transcript_line"> with Welsh background or Welsh people is is is it for the good is it is it good if it&#039;s good</div><div id="00:13:42.640" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ll be I did and if you look down through the people Welsh people in Canada and find out</div><div id="00:13:48.480" class="transcript_line"> the positions they held the jobs they&#039;ve done after they&#039;ve got them you know their life</div><div id="00:13:56.880" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;ll support it&#039;ll support what I say and now we&#039;ve got to go on and build the new group</div><div id="00:14:04.080" class="transcript_line"> the new group then are the children of Welsh people who respect their Welsh background</div><div id="00:14:11.760" class="transcript_line"> to get an opportunity to speak their language be able to speak their language and know something</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> of the culture I think that that&#039;s the next move otherwise not only in Canada you&#039;re going to die</div><div id="00:14:25.600" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;ll die in there but the fight is on over there I understand for the Welsh language to come</div><div id="00:14:31.520" class="transcript_line"> back in the school I don&#039;t want to see all and only Welsh language that&#039;d be the most ridiculous</div><div id="00:14:36.960" class="transcript_line"> thing to do because the whole world is going to be anglicized before as far as that goes but we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:14:44.480" class="transcript_line"> got to have these other languages on the side I know as much French as I do Welsh because</div><div id="00:14:52.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been in that environment but you learn it from the people because you want to converse</div><div id="00:14:57.520" class="transcript_line"> them they want to converse them you can converse with people if you want to but I&#039;d like to be able</div><div id="00:15:02.240" class="transcript_line"> to converse with the with the Welsh people and I wouldn&#039;t want to teach Welsh language</div><div id="00:15:09.040" class="transcript_line"> just for the sake of saying well let&#039;s go in the corner and and and talk Welsh</div><div id="00:15:15.200" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s what&#039;s ruined some of the societies and that&#039;s what causes the division</div><div id="00:15:20.800" class="transcript_line"> is the few who can speak Welsh getting together and speaking Welsh in one corner</div><div id="00:15:25.360" class="transcript_line"> and ignoring the others that&#039;s one of the biggest problems that we had and that&#039;s what broke our</div><div id="00:15:31.120" class="transcript_line"> Welsh society there was no doubt about that was the ones who could speak Welsh would get together</div><div id="00:15:37.120" class="transcript_line"> and you know conduct half the business in Welsh and half in English so these are there are dangers</div><div id="00:15:45.760" class="transcript_line"> mine and that&#039;s one of the dangers you could split the group up that&#039;s what have broken up</div><div id="00:15:50.560" class="transcript_line"> the German groups here is because there was there was two there was the high and the low Germans and</div><div id="00:15:56.400" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d get together and they&#039;d speak even among themselves speaking German without a fellow like</div><div id="00:16:00.880" class="transcript_line"> me dropping in and speaking English</div><div id="00:16:17.120" class="transcript_line"> interview between Lewis Thomas and W.E. Davis of Regina on September the 1st 1970</div><div id="00:16:27.440" class="transcript_line"> okay an interview do you mind telling me how old you are Mr. Davis?

but they didn&#039;t arrive in the well said in 81 in the spring of 81 they spent a few</div><div id="00:18:59.280" class="transcript_line"> months in outside of Buenos Aires</div><div id="00:19:04.320" class="transcript_line"> and my maternal grandfather he was out in BC here came out in 1862 yes they left Wales on December</div><div id="00:19:15.120" class="transcript_line"> the 22nd in 1862 of the rising sun I see and they arrived in the square of BC on the 13th of June</div><div id="00:19:23.920" class="transcript_line"> 1863 well that was journey yes and uh what did he do there was he on the mining yes he went to</div><div id="00:19:34.960" class="transcript_line"> prospecting the line up to the caribou yes he was there until 1874 when he returned to Wales</div><div id="00:19:42.160" class="transcript_line"> yes I knew there were some Welsh people who went into the prospecting yes there&#039;s quite a number</div><div id="00:19:48.240" class="transcript_line"> of them and there was one amongst them uh Harry Jones and my mother talking about he was quite</div><div id="00:19:54.480" class="transcript_line"> a young man well he he died in Victoria at the age of 95 or 1936 or 1937 I think well and he was</div><div id="00:20:04.640" class="transcript_line"> in amongst that group too with my grandfather&#039;s he and recently I&#039;ve been able through this</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> journal again this year there&#039;s an article about him it&#039;s Harry Jones and there&#039;s a peak named</div><div id="00:20:17.200" class="transcript_line"> after him there&#039;s Jones peak in the caribou range well the name of the journal to which Mr Davies</div><div id="00:20:26.720" class="transcript_line"> is referring is YR capital E N F Y S the journal of the Welsh people outside Wales</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> the meaning of the title is the rainbow</div><div id="00:20:47.120" class="transcript_line"> well now Mr Davies what was your own occupation over the years was it farming farming yes</div><div id="00:20:54.640" class="transcript_line"> farming yes and you farmed up until quite recently until well 10 years ago when we had to leave on</div><div id="00:21:02.880" class="transcript_line"> he was told to work</div><div id="00:21:06.480" class="transcript_line"> oh yes yes um can you tell me anything about the um</div><div id="00:21:14.640" class="transcript_line"> from your from hearing people talk about the previous occupations of the settlers who um</div><div id="00:21:25.040" class="transcript_line"> who went to Patagonia from Wales were they were there a variety of occupations represented</div><div id="00:21:33.200" class="transcript_line"> yes a variety that&#039;s I think was one of the big mistakes they&#039;re going out there</div><div id="00:21:40.160" class="transcript_line"> the idea of farming you know and there&#039;s hardly any of them that had any experience in farming at</div><div id="00:21:45.600" class="transcript_line"> all they&#039;re mostly miners and carpenters and so on but the grandfather he&#039;d been farming of course</div><div id="00:21:55.040" class="transcript_line"> Wales before going to somewhere but that was one great disadvantage yeah would you say from your</div><div id="00:22:03.920" class="transcript_line"> from hearing people talk that um the settlers were as nationalistic in their feeling as Michael Jones</div><div id="00:22:12.800" class="transcript_line"> was and the other organizers of the project well some of them I think well quite nationalistic yes</div><div id="00:22:20.400" class="transcript_line"> yeah do you recall the name Lewis Jones oh yes he was from my reading of the records the one who</div><div id="00:22:31.680" class="transcript_line"> who did the most to sort of publicize Patagonia in Wales yes he did he was apparently a great</div><div id="00:22:40.720" class="transcript_line"> speaker and a clever journalist I have a faint reflection about him you know he was still living</div><div id="00:22:49.680" class="transcript_line"> when we left yes and I well I remember seeing him as well but yeah of course of course the father</div><div id="00:22:58.160" class="transcript_line"> talking a lot about him the organizers of the colony Michael Jones and Lewis Jones and and their</div><div id="00:23:05.440" class="transcript_line"> friends really um had no clear impression of the nature of the country did they and the problems</div><div id="00:23:15.520" class="transcript_line"> that would face the settlers well it&#039;s apparent that they didn&#039;t you know one thing they landed</div><div id="00:23:22.800" class="transcript_line"> there in midwinter in july the 28th he was held on the mimosa yeah that&#039;s the name of the boat</div><div id="00:23:31.920" class="transcript_line"> and two months to the day they left on the 28th day of may 1865 and they landed on this bleak</div><div id="00:23:41.360" class="transcript_line"> and barren coast there and july the 28th yeah and they couldn&#039;t too late to get a crop in oh</div><div id="00:23:51.360" class="transcript_line"> oh yes i was couldn&#039;t do anything yeah and see there were 40 miles from the valley and you cross</div><div id="00:24:00.880" class="transcript_line"> there and it&#039;s still today you can stand on that post today and all you can see is just stones and</div><div id="00:24:09.360" class="transcript_line"> and little short bushes we stood on there there&#039;s no gentleman there he&#039;s passed away recently now</div><div id="00:24:16.480" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s in columbia bogota columbia and he stood there and my sister and i was standing there</div><div id="00:24:23.440" class="transcript_line"> looked and he looked out at this last you know just desert and he says i&#039;ve seen enough with</div><div id="00:24:30.080" class="transcript_line"> this i don&#039;t want to see him he just died recently i had it yeah and he said he died yeah well i know</div><div id="00:24:40.560" class="transcript_line"> quite a bit about from my reading about the hardships which the settlers encountered</div><div id="00:24:47.040" class="transcript_line"> over the years and</div><div id="00:24:54.240" class="transcript_line"> i am interested however in in the situation that developed in the 1890s by by that time as i</div><div id="00:25:03.520" class="transcript_line"> understand it the the welch pioneers had proved the</div><div id="00:25:11.760" class="transcript_line"> the agricultural potential of the area if water was applied through irrigation oh yes and</div><div id="00:25:20.320" class="transcript_line"> the result was they they had proved that it was a productive area and argentinians began to move</div><div id="00:25:29.520" class="transcript_line"> into the province and and i guess some italian immigrants by this time too yeah and this created</div><div id="00:25:39.280" class="transcript_line"> of course a new situation for the welch didn&#039;t it oh yes it did yes yeah</div><div id="00:25:47.680" class="transcript_line"> was there was there any intermarriage at that time or has it taken place to any extent since</div><div id="00:25:57.440" class="transcript_line"> oh yes to a great extent since yes at that time no matter what they were there for</div><div id="00:26:08.080" class="transcript_line"> 10 years from 1865 until 1875 before any joined them in that policy they were there for 10 10 years</div><div id="00:26:19.520" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where there&#039;s quite a few making mistakes about this group that came out from</div><div id="00:26:25.360" class="transcript_line"> patagonia to canada here they said that they&#039;d spent 37 years there they didn&#039;t see there&#039;s only</div><div id="00:26:35.120" class="transcript_line"> two that came out here in 1902 that had been landed there in 1865 that&#039;s my father and then</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> the mother david hughes but david hughes he returned after five years he returned to south america in</div><div id="00:26:47.600" class="transcript_line"> 1907 he returned so so we&#039;re the only ones the rest of some of them had only been there</div><div id="00:26:53.600" class="transcript_line"> i was all of course i would even want my father mother was saying you know that they&#039;d only been</div><div id="00:26:57.360" class="transcript_line"> there three or four years some of them they came out to canada some of them had been 10 some of</div><div id="00:27:01.760" class="transcript_line"> them had been 15 some of them up to 20 years or more but the only two that came out here</div><div id="00:27:10.160" class="transcript_line"> and we were we were trying to find out when we got back there now they weren&#039;t able to find</div><div id="00:27:14.880" class="transcript_line"> that anybody in canada besides us my sisters and i that have direct descendants if you&#039;ll be</div><div id="00:27:21.840" class="transcript_line"> in the world</div><div id="00:27:28.080" class="transcript_line"> now of the group that that came to canada there were two there were approximately 250</div><div id="00:27:36.160" class="transcript_line"> who sailed on that ship were you with that with the main group yes we were that ship well this is</div><div id="00:27:42.480" class="transcript_line"> coming to women and children yes well according to a book i haven&#039;t got here now with my sister</div><div id="00:27:48.960" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s written by a man there on the banks of the tuba</div><div id="00:27:54.800" class="transcript_line"> and according to him that was 234 to be exact but we were not all welsh there was</div><div id="00:28:02.880" class="transcript_line"> like and he called me two english families and there was one scotsman there and one</div><div id="00:28:10.480" class="transcript_line"> and you wouldn&#039;t dare say anything about him in english spanish otherwise either</div><div id="00:28:20.240" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s one of those english families that came over her children that were</div><div id="00:28:27.280" class="transcript_line"> quite a size you know in the 14 and 15 years they speak welsh</div><div id="00:28:32.000" class="transcript_line"> well the mother was completely english she was from lancaster and the father was an irishman</div><div id="00:28:40.560" class="transcript_line"> they could speak welsh yeah now most of the most of the group who came to canada of course</div><div id="00:28:46.560" class="transcript_line"> would have been farming in in patagonia most of them yes there&#039;d perhaps be a few tradesmen</div><div id="00:28:54.000" class="transcript_line"> uh</div><div id="00:29:08.640" class="transcript_line"> do you recall um whether any serious consideration was given by the group</div><div id="00:29:17.120" class="transcript_line"> to settling in the irrigated lands of southern alberta i&#039;m not aware of that at all</div><div id="00:29:26.160" class="transcript_line"> it would have uh in some senses seemed a logical place to go because of their experience in that</div><div id="00:29:33.280" class="transcript_line"> type of farming yes and similarly of course they had been very successful ranchers your people in</div><div id="00:29:41.040" class="transcript_line"> in the schubert area yeah um my guess is that they uh they didn&#039;t uh go to southern alberta</div><div id="00:29:54.640" class="transcript_line"> because uh irrigation land was costly to acquire and uh the ranches by that time had been largely</div><div id="00:30:06.560" class="transcript_line"> broken up into small holdings and there wasn&#039;t as much homestead land</div><div id="00:30:12.800" class="transcript_line"> available in southern alberta as there was in this part of saskatchewan at the time would you</div><div id="00:30:19.120" class="transcript_line"> feel that&#039;s a fair uh estimate possibly i don&#039;t know i never heard any talk of that at all you</div><div id="00:30:25.600" class="transcript_line"> know but if you we came out with saw coats there of course that was as in the way of northwest</div><div id="00:30:31.840" class="transcript_line"> yeah and there was a farmer there well he&#039;d been in south america and he&#039;d come to canada</div><div id="00:30:38.480" class="transcript_line"> all eight or nine years ahead of us by the name of evan jenkins yes i remember seeing that name</div><div id="00:30:46.160" class="transcript_line"> here i think some do with it and well mostly there was four townships had been reserved for</div><div id="00:30:54.000" class="transcript_line"> a vals supplement before we came out well after this conversation taking place between the</div><div id="00:30:59.360" class="transcript_line"> government of britain and get these out of satagonia you know there</div><div id="00:31:09.360" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah um do you recall uh whether um the settlers felt they had been reasonably well</div><div id="00:31:19.520" class="transcript_line"> treated by the canadian authorities in the in the handling of</div></div></p>
