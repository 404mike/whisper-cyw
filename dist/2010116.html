That&#039;s fine, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:47.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember it because it was my first puja after coming from Kolkata, India,</div><div id="00:02:54.500" class="transcript_line"> and I was a newly bride, so it was very exciting for me to go and see a durga puja happening in Wales, you know.</div><div id="00:03:06.500" class="transcript_line"> So when I went there, there were lots of activities going on,</div><div id="00:03:10.500" class="transcript_line"> but nowadays all the cooking and everything gets done in the hall.</div><div id="00:03:16.500" class="transcript_line"> Those days we were not that lucky to have all the accommodation,</div><div id="00:03:21.500" class="transcript_line"> so we only had a hall to have the puja, all the offerings, everything,</div><div id="00:03:27.500" class="transcript_line"> but actual the feeding part where the loads of people come and have food with us,</div><div id="00:03:34.500" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t have that space.</div><div id="00:03:37.500" class="transcript_line"> So I remember we used to come back to Puthkol to make rasagulla and Shikha Ghosh&#039;s house,</div><div id="00:03:44.500" class="transcript_line"> and Dr Tapash Ghosh, his wife, Sampa Bosh, Gopa, myself, Roma Pachaudhuri,</div><div id="00:03:53.500" class="transcript_line"> and we all used to go to Roma Pachaudhuri&#039;s house to make khichuri and labra,</div><div id="00:03:59.500" class="transcript_line"> so we just divided all the cooking into different houses, you know.</div><div id="00:04:04.500" class="transcript_line"> So we used to travel in the morning, come back at lunchtime,</div><div id="00:04:08.500" class="transcript_line"> cook all the food for the people who were going to attend puja, and go back to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:04:13.500" class="transcript_line"> So it was much more harder work that time.</div><div id="00:04:17.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really fascinating, Anamika.</div><div id="00:04:20.500" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that also, other than the community spirit,</div><div id="00:04:25.500" class="transcript_line"> there was also a financial reason for this,</div><div id="00:04:28.500" class="transcript_line"> that the organization was not very well-off at that time, or limited financial resources?</div><div id="00:04:36.500" class="transcript_line"> I think so, because puja wasn&#039;t held, it was only the beginning of puja in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:04:44.500" class="transcript_line"> so it wasn&#039;t held at a much bigger scale as it&#039;s happening now,</div><div id="00:04:49.500" class="transcript_line"> so we had less resources, financial resources.</div><div id="00:04:55.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember people used to come to our house, get khana,</div><div id="00:05:00.500" class="transcript_line"> they used to go around people&#039;s houses to collect puja.</div><div id="00:05:04.500" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to say, because the next question is number five, what made the challenges?</div><div id="00:05:10.500" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ll come to the challenges, so just to complete what Anamika was saying,</div><div id="00:05:17.500" class="transcript_line"> so you went around the houses to actually involve.</div><div id="00:05:22.500" class="transcript_line"> So let&#039;s come to that, what were the challenges you both feel was at that time in the puja?</div><div id="00:05:28.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember myself with Tapas Basu used to go in different places,</div><div id="00:05:35.500" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff, in Swansea, in other places, nearby places,</div><div id="00:05:39.500" class="transcript_line"> to collect chala, what we call their contribution for the puja,</div><div id="00:05:47.500" class="transcript_line"> and it was very difficult, because at that time we are not sure how many Indian people,</div><div id="00:05:55.500" class="transcript_line"> particularly Bengali people, is around in Swansea areas, or even in Bridgen and Port Coor,</div><div id="00:06:02.500" class="transcript_line"> and that was a major challenge we found out at that time.</div><div id="00:06:07.500" class="transcript_line"> You want to add something?</div><div id="00:06:09.500" class="transcript_line"> It was a challenge, because in relation to puja, what&#039;s happening now is there is much more publicity,</div><div id="00:06:19.500" class="transcript_line"> advertisement, which attracts people to come to their nearest place to have Durga Puja,</div><div id="00:06:26.500" class="transcript_line"> because this is a very special time for the Bengali all over India,</div><div id="00:06:31.500" class="transcript_line"> its puja is held in different names. We call it Durga Puja,</div><div id="00:06:36.500" class="transcript_line"> in some parts of India it&#039;s called something different, so it&#039;s very important to all Indians,</div><div id="00:06:42.500" class="transcript_line"> but at that time we didn&#039;t have the measurement of publicity that much,</div><div id="00:06:49.500" class="transcript_line"> so it was just word of mouth.</div><div id="00:06:58.500" class="transcript_line"> So Anamika, you were saying that it was a lot of challenge, and Karnayita is saying a lot of challenge as well,</div><div id="00:07:03.500" class="transcript_line"> how did you actually manage to identify people whose house to go to and knock for each other those days?</div><div id="00:07:09.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s by word of mouth, somebody I was asking where some Indian, particularly Bengali people were living,</div><div id="00:07:18.500" class="transcript_line"> and of course the people who were around in this area, they were feeding us with all those addresses and the name of the people.</div><div id="00:07:28.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is like as an association, Indian association in Cardiff, we already knew quite a few people,</div><div id="00:07:39.500" class="transcript_line"> doctors over the place, Bridgen, Swansea, Merthyr, Cardiff,</div><div id="00:07:44.500" class="transcript_line"> so it was a challenge to collect donations and to run puja for six days.</div><div id="00:07:55.500" class="transcript_line"> And of course a lot of people used to ring in our house to find out if there is any puja going on in the Indian East area,</div><div id="00:08:03.500" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s also by word of mouth, and it started spreading all over Wales and outside.</div><div id="00:08:11.500" class="transcript_line"> Just I wanted to concentrate a little bit about this time to connect, Chanda, and get the financial resources,</div><div id="00:08:21.500" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s much more easier, I understand now, because everything is collected in the premises on four or five days,</div><div id="00:08:28.500" class="transcript_line"> and people come there, we don&#039;t go to people&#039;s houses,</div><div id="00:08:31.500" class="transcript_line"> and when you did that, it was before the days of internet, before the days of mobile phone, only the house sort of landline phones.</div><div id="00:08:40.500" class="transcript_line"> Can you, both of you, can you give some experiences, bad and good experiences about going in people&#039;s house and collecting Chanda?</div><div id="00:08:49.500" class="transcript_line"> Chanda, can you remember any bad or good experiences?</div><div id="00:08:53.500" class="transcript_line"> I would say it was a rather interesting experience, because obviously Bengali people wanted to know if there is any Duga puja around the area,</div><div id="00:09:05.500" class="transcript_line"> and they were very pleased to contribute whatever they can, and they did it very gladly, they accepted it,</div><div id="00:09:16.500" class="transcript_line"> and obviously from them other people used to know what puja is going on, and that&#039;s how it started growing, the whole thing in there.</div><div id="00:09:28.500" class="transcript_line"> Anamika, you want to add something on that?</div><div id="00:09:31.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, I remember when I used to go out and collect donations for puja,</div><div id="00:09:40.500" class="transcript_line"> obviously I didn&#039;t have first-hand experience, but what I used to have heard that sometimes it was a bit difficult sometimes,</div><div id="00:09:51.500" class="transcript_line"> to go and ask for donations and wait for their perceptions of how they want to do it, you know,</div><div id="00:10:02.500" class="transcript_line"> so I didn&#039;t have any first-hand experience, so I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t really add anything extra to it.</div><div id="00:10:09.500" class="transcript_line"> So the Chanda collection at that time, probably each Chanda you got took probably half an hour, 45 minutes or an hour,</div><div id="00:10:18.500" class="transcript_line"> because of the travel, then you have to discuss those with the people you are collecting the Chanda, and all that,</div><div id="00:10:25.500" class="transcript_line"> and give them the information about the puja, which now it takes less than a couple of minutes.</div><div id="00:10:31.500" class="transcript_line"> At that time of course it was time-taking, because you need some transport, not necessarily you always have the transport,</div><div id="00:10:41.500" class="transcript_line"> you may have to go by bus to somebody&#039;s house, and that&#039;s how it happened, but at the end of the day we succeeded in collecting</div><div id="00:10:51.500" class="transcript_line"> at least some contributions from the people involved.</div><div id="00:10:56.500" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember anything which actually one thing or two things or three things which sticks out in your mind going back 40 years,</div><div id="00:11:10.500" class="transcript_line"> which actually sticks out?</div><div id="00:11:11.500" class="transcript_line"> The most important thing which sticks out in my mind is first of all is collecting Chanda, which is the contribution of people,</div><div id="00:11:21.500" class="transcript_line"> and secondly to particularly to prepare offerings for the Goddess Durga, for example,</div><div id="00:11:33.500" class="transcript_line"> that ladies were involved in cooking khichdi, labra, and making rasagullas in somebody&#039;s house,</div><div id="00:11:43.500" class="transcript_line"> and these sort of things were really very exciting at that particular moment, and of course encouraged everybody to get involved,</div><div id="00:11:52.500" class="transcript_line"> and a lot of volunteers then started coming in and saying can I do something, can I do this, and that&#039;s how it happened.</div><div id="00:12:00.500" class="transcript_line"> You want to add something?</div><div id="00:12:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Well for me it was something obviously I was so new, came to this country in 1975 April and Durga puja in October,</div><div id="00:12:15.500" class="transcript_line"> so within five months I couldn&#039;t believe that something like this, a big gathering, it&#039;s not just religious, it&#039;s a social gathering as well,</div><div id="00:12:28.500" class="transcript_line"> so to go there from the morning, meet so many people, and do all the work what was necessary to complete the puja,</div><div id="00:12:41.500" class="transcript_line"> it was an overwhelming experience with friends, the people I didn&#039;t know, I met so many people, apart from the religious side of it,</div><div id="00:12:52.500" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t that much involved in doing what I do now, but it&#039;s just a massive experience and it&#039;s a very joyful experience.</div><div id="00:13:06.500" class="transcript_line"> So do you think that Durga puja and the festival going back in Wales for 40 years has actually helped in creating your circle and social contact?</div><div id="00:13:19.500" class="transcript_line"> Of course it has, because this is the only opportunity once a year to go to Durga puja and meet lots of friends, make new friends,</div><div id="00:13:32.500" class="transcript_line"> and by word of mouth the horizon, the boundaries started expanding, a lot of other people came to know,</div><div id="00:13:43.500" class="transcript_line"> the people 70-80 miles away from Bristol used to come to the puja and of course it was the greatest opportunity to meet everybody,</div><div id="00:13:53.500" class="transcript_line"> to exchange views, exchange gifts, know how their health or their wealth and how their children are doing,</div><div id="00:14:09.500" class="transcript_line"> and all sorts of exchange of ideas, this took place and that is the greatest opportunity almost once a year for everybody to get together,</div><div id="00:14:20.500" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s how the whole thing started growing in Wales, in particular in our Kadi puja.</div><div id="00:14:29.500" class="transcript_line"> If I remember, 40 years ago, comparing in two days, of course the number of people at that particular time was not that many,</div><div id="00:14:43.500" class="transcript_line"> what we can see now, we are more than about 2,500-3,000 people coming in over five days in recent years.</div><div id="00:14:56.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is just meeting everybody, people we don&#039;t meet regularly, we meet once a year there, and especially what fascinates me,</div><div id="00:15:11.500" class="transcript_line"> now I&#039;m talking about that all the youngsters are coming here to work and I go around and talk with them and it&#039;s a greatest pleasure for them,</div><div id="00:15:28.500" class="transcript_line"> so young, coming here and attending Durga Puja, meeting people socially, it&#039;s a great pleasure.</div><div id="00:15:39.500" class="transcript_line"> And do you think that in that interaction there is also an ongoing opportunity of transfer of experience about you or your life in this country or the society of this country</div><div id="00:15:55.500" class="transcript_line"> to the younger people who have just come, they may ask you a few questions about the society, about other things which you may be able to help them with?</div><div id="00:16:03.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely. Lots of youngsters we have met, they have asked me different questions, how was puja used to be or what did you do then, what should you do,</div><div id="00:16:15.500" class="transcript_line"> so as an experienced person living in this country over 40 years, I think that&#039;s a lot of help to youngsters to settle them down well, so yes it is.</div><div id="00:16:31.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember I used to work in a steel company and a lot of young people from India, from Tata Steel or Indian Steel Company, they used to visit to put talbot work,</div><div id="00:16:44.500" class="transcript_line"> and of course some of them used to live in Port Coal and some used to live in Port Talbot, and they are of course very much interested being a Bengali person to find out if there are any Durga Puja going on,</div><div id="00:17:00.500" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s how youngsters get involved, and once one group of people from India, they knew that Durga Puja is going on, but then from the water mouth, other people living in this area around 80 miles or 90 miles,</div><div id="00:17:20.500" class="transcript_line"> they knew that Durga Puja is going on in the Cardiff area, and obviously they used to come there and enjoy themselves, and that&#039;s how the whole thing started growing up,</div><div id="00:17:33.500" class="transcript_line"> and over the years since 40 years ago, and today we can see that a lot of people benefited by knowing that Puja is still going on and is still going well in that area.</div><div id="00:17:53.500" class="transcript_line"> I understand, Kanahida, Anonymous as well, that in the last 15 years or so, you have actually been first helping and then being the main priest of Durga Puja. Can you tell us your experience about that and how you got involved like that?</div><div id="00:18:15.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember in 2000, I had a phone call from Dr. Acharje, I called him Dada, he asked me over the telephone that whether I am interested in doing the Durga Puja.</div><div id="00:18:37.500" class="transcript_line"> I was really very scared at that time because Durga Puja is not an easy thing to do, it needs a lot of involvement, and not only that, there was also what we call religious fear behind me,</div><div id="00:18:57.500" class="transcript_line"> whether I am going to succeed, what is going to happen to me if I am not doing that thing particularly well, then I completely rejected the idea.</div><div id="00:19:09.500" class="transcript_line"> Then Dr. Acharje came back to me again and asked me, Kanahida, there is nobody here who can perform the Puja, I was thinking you should be suitable for this opportunity.</div><div id="00:19:26.500" class="transcript_line"> Then I told him that I have to ask my family in India whether I can actually perform the Puja ceremony, and I had a very good positive answer back from home,</div><div id="00:19:47.500" class="transcript_line"> and I said to Acharje that of course as you asked me that there is nobody available, therefore put my name in, I will try my best.</div><div id="00:19:59.500" class="transcript_line"> This way in year 2000, Dr. Acharje said you don&#039;t have to worry about anything, I am going to teach you everything from the very beginning,</div><div id="00:20:12.500" class="transcript_line"> and therefore what happened was that about 3-4 months before the Durga Puja started, I started going to Dr. Acharje&#039;s house,</div><div id="00:20:22.500" class="transcript_line"> and he showed me every nitty-gritty of the every day which I involved, and that&#039;s how it started, and of course the first year it was so difficult for me, I was a bit nervous,</div><div id="00:20:38.500" class="transcript_line"> but once I started doing the first day what we call Shastri, then Saptami, Ostami, they all started becoming more and more easier for me,</div><div id="00:20:52.500" class="transcript_line"> and I grew in confidence, and this way that year, it started in year 2000, I enjoyed very much to be honest, and for obvious reason I got hooked into this whole process.</div><div id="00:21:09.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good way of finishing that you got actually hooked into it.</div><div id="00:21:14.500" class="transcript_line"> Anamika, tell me as Kanhai they are doing now Durga Puja, he is our main priest, he is actually the chief priest, how does it affect you?</div><div id="00:21:24.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, as Kanhai is the priest, so I became his assistant you can say, but I had to learn lots of things from Mrs. Acharya, all the religious rituals which are very very complicated,</div><div id="00:21:50.500" class="transcript_line"> and eventually I learnt it, like we all went to school and learnt various things in our life, very similar way, I learnt all the process, and why we do this, what it needs to be done, how many of this, how many of that,</div><div id="00:22:10.500" class="transcript_line"> so I became very involved each year, so from 2000 year, 2000 till now, it&#039;s a huge responsibility, and I, since Mrs. Acharya passed away, I feel that the whole responsibility that is obviously after Kanhai is on my shoulder,</div><div id="00:22:33.500" class="transcript_line"> I need to do everything, all the rituals as I have learnt, as best as I could, and I am also teaching youngsters how to do it, what to do, why we are doing it, what needs to be done on each day, so it&#039;s a big responsibility.</div><div id="00:22:53.500" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like what comes to me listening to both of you is going like a generational teaching from one generation to another generation.</div><div id="00:23:23.500" class="transcript_line"> So he understands what he is doing, he did it religiously, and he is still doing it religiously, and that even makes me feel more responsible, so to do my part sincerely.</div><div id="00:23:39.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great. What do you say about that?</div><div id="00:23:41.500" class="transcript_line"> Kanhai, can you just say first that how you think the puja has actually grown and evolved in last sort of 25, 30 or 40 years, how you feel about how the puja has grown, the festival has grown?</div><div id="00:24:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Obviously the Durgapuja is very much of a social as well as religious event, and the people who are particularly Bengali, they are interested to find out that is there any puja going on in Cardiff area,</div><div id="00:24:23.500" class="transcript_line"> and from the word of mouth and to their friends it started, and a lot of people for the over the years like young doctors, young steelworkers, engineers started in about 70, 80 miles area around Cardiff,</div><div id="00:24:48.500" class="transcript_line"> and they were all interested to come into the puja, and in last 20 years, last 15 years which I have been involved as a priest, I have noticed there was almost a steady growth of people,</div><div id="00:25:05.500" class="transcript_line"> and over 15 years I am not sure whether that due to what they like my puja, I mean my performance during the puja ceremony, and in this way a lot of people got involved over the years,</div><div id="00:25:28.500" class="transcript_line"> and still growing, and now we got a new generation of youngsters who became member of the wealth puja committee, and they have shown very much interest in doing whatever is required to do,</div><div id="00:25:50.500" class="transcript_line"> and in this way I find out the festival particularly the number of people started growing, and the frontiers, the horizon started expanding over the years, and of course I am very much pleased and get a lot of pleasure out of it,</div><div id="00:26:11.500" class="transcript_line"> knowing that people are still interested and they contribute whatever they can over the years.</div><div id="00:26:18.500" class="transcript_line"> Can I come into it?</div><div id="00:26:19.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Sonamika you come into it.</div><div id="00:26:21.500" class="transcript_line"> You said how the puja evolved since last 25, 30 years, the main theme of the puja is still very similar, like it is a very family oriented, very friendly way, like 40 years ago I have seen it,</div><div id="00:26:39.500" class="transcript_line"> it just grown in numbers, and it is still very friendly, we welcome everybody, but now I think we got high tech people here, the publicity of Kharif Durga Puja is huge,</div><div id="00:26:58.500" class="transcript_line"> internet, mobile, telephone calls, letters, these are so many media that we publicize puja, so puja has evolved around since 1975, it is much larger scale,</div><div id="00:27:19.500" class="transcript_line"> and all these committee people they have taken their responsibilities very very well, 1975 I didn&#039;t know that much, 1970 or what used to go on, but what I used to see there are few people, they always did the work,</div><div id="00:27:39.500" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know whether there was a committee, I&#039;m sure there was, but I&#039;m not sure, but because of high tech, different social media, people&#039;s time contributions, everything means a lot more,</div><div id="00:27:54.500" class="transcript_line"> and puja has grown into much bigger scale than I used to know it, 1975 till 1980s, nowadays, wow, people travel, even from Swindon, North Wales, just think about it, how much sincere people are to attend this religious and social festival?</div><div id="00:28:21.500" class="transcript_line"> And of course, last year, the influence of the high tech, we can see that they are trying to interchange what is going on in Calcutta, and what is going on in Kharif in particular time,</div><div id="00:28:46.500" class="transcript_line"> they are trying to show the whole puja ceremony, all the rituals, the people involved, and it is only possible because of the growth of what we call the high tech technology,</div><div id="00:29:01.500" class="transcript_line"> and I remember that particularly when I saw on television that they are showing some excerpts from the Durga Puja in Kharif and in Calcutta.</div><div id="00:29:20.500" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that coming to another angle, that Polyonomica can fully go on first, do you think there is also an angle has changed in terms of cultural activity or programs or functions, or do you think this is the same sort of way it used to be 30-40 years ago?</div><div id="00:29:43.500" class="transcript_line"> Cultural function is going, involvement of people in cultural function is happening in much more larger scales.</div><div id="00:29:53.500" class="transcript_line"> It also happened because I remember my two little girls, they joined into doing various things, various programs, but because Kharif Indian community was in a much smaller community,</div><div id="00:30:08.500" class="transcript_line"> but because of the National Health Service, the community has grown into a much bigger one, and we have more people, all these youngsters coming with so much extracurricular activities, and they are teaching their youngsters,</div><div id="00:30:27.500" class="transcript_line"> so it is happening in a much bigger, larger scale, and we didn&#039;t have that much of opportunity, there was I remember only one lady who is to teach dancing, and Ramadi is only the one person who is to teach singing,</div><div id="00:30:44.500" class="transcript_line"> and I remember I even participated, I sang in functions, my children danced, my friends&#039; children, they danced, but now we have many, many ladies with so many other specialities that they are teaching children, they are taking, they are participating themselves, so yes, it is happening in a much bigger scale.</div><div id="00:31:09.500" class="transcript_line"> Can I just ask you last but one question, what do you think is holding the group together? What do you think is the main cement in holding the group together?</div><div id="00:31:26.500" class="transcript_line"> I think it is an excellent opportunity for everybody to involve, particularly in puja, as I said, it is once a year greatest festival in the Hindu calendar, and nobody wants to miss this opportunity to come four, five days, whenever there is an opportunity,</div><div id="00:31:55.500" class="transcript_line"> and obviously in this way it started growing all over the Kharif and surrounding areas, and it started growing up like this over the years, and my own perception about the festival is that in my particular, my own contribution,</div><div id="00:32:23.500" class="transcript_line"> I am so much encouraged to do particular, the priest side of it, the ritual side of that, I was very much deeply involved last 15 years, and he gave me a lot of pleasure,</div><div id="00:32:51.500" class="transcript_line"> and I found out that this is the only way one can contribute to the society, to the community, and that&#039;s the way I thought, you know, I will remember this Kharif puja, and this is the way that I feel that everybody should involve in this particular event,</div><div id="00:33:21.500" class="transcript_line"> in particular time of the year, and I will encourage whenever it is possible to ask people to join us during the puja to exchange their views, their ideas, and then from that way they can go back and they can influence the other people to involve with the puja,</div><div id="00:33:48.500" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s the way I feel that the whole thing is going.</div><div id="00:33:53.500" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean, Anamika, what is your perception about what is holding the whole thing together?</div><div id="00:33:57.500" class="transcript_line"> I think the whole thing is held. Everybody, all the committee, they really want to hold a Durga puja each year, is the puja, that people who are away from home, living abroad, for them and for the committee members and all of us who are involved in the puja,</div><div id="00:34:27.500" class="transcript_line"> we want to hold, hold this special occasion. I think this is puja, is keeping people together. It&#039;s a way, people are away from home, and for Bengalis all over India is such a special time.</div><div id="00:34:44.500" class="transcript_line"> This is India&#039;s biggest, largest religious celebration. It&#039;s not just religious, people, as I said before, it&#039;s social gathering as well. So, is puja, is holding everybody together?</div><div id="00:34:57.500" class="transcript_line"> And also, it&#039;s people, it&#039;s up to the people to involve, to get together at the time of puja, and that is also the responsibility, not the responsibility, it is their interest to involve during the puja, and of course, by what amount they can invite some other people to join us,</div><div id="00:35:22.500" class="transcript_line"> and in this way, the whole thing started growing over the years, and cemented together, and obviously, that over the years, now we have a new Durga, Durga prasimha started from 2008?</div><div id="00:35:39.500" class="transcript_line"> 2002. 2002, and this way, of course, that is another idea, I want to express my views, that it is growing, and over the years, and about 2008, there was a Durga prasimha, a festival in Calif museum.</div><div id="00:36:07.500" class="transcript_line"> Where is it? St. Feaghan.</div><div id="00:36:09.500" class="transcript_line"> They brought artists from Calcutta to prepare the Durga prasimha in front of youngsters, and that&#039;s how we started growing, you know, the other people&#039;s interest in the area, and not only interest of the Hindu people, the people from South Wales,</div><div id="00:36:31.500" class="transcript_line"> the youngsters, the universities, the other institutions, people interested in, and I remember that somebody from Calif University started as a doctorate project in this particular Durga heritage,</div><div id="00:36:58.500" class="transcript_line"> and this is the way the whole thing started growing all over the Wales, not only for the Hindu people, but also for the people from all different religions, languages, and this is one of the greatest things I can draw satisfaction from.</div><div id="00:37:22.500" class="transcript_line"> Do you also think that when people come to this festival of West Puja committees, Durga Puja, they actually get involved quite easily, which actually, may they find it different than they are used to back in India, back home, that people can get involved very easily?</div><div id="00:37:41.500" class="transcript_line"> I think so, because from my experience, you mean getting involved in puja?</div><div id="00:37:51.500" class="transcript_line"> In puja, during the puja.</div><div id="00:37:53.500" class="transcript_line"> During the puja, yes, I have done that myself actually. When early morning, it&#039;s always, I&#039;m saying early morning is after ten o&#039;clock, is our responsibility to start the puja, so we go there quite early.</div><div id="00:38:10.500" class="transcript_line"> And when there was shortage of people, and I remember calling people from audience, so can you come and help, you know, blah, blah, blah, I&#039;ll show you what to do.</div><div id="00:38:23.500" class="transcript_line"> I just need some people to start the puja, you know.</div><div id="00:38:26.500" class="transcript_line"> So yes, people get involved very easily in Cardiff, you know, we welcome everybody, all religions, all races, whoever wants to come and celebrate with us.</div><div id="00:38:39.500" class="transcript_line"> So involvement during Durga Puja in Cardiff, I don&#039;t think so, it&#039;s a problem. It&#039;s a, what I should say, that all welcome process.</div><div id="00:38:58.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great. Just to wind up, can you say anything else you want to talk about, about the festival and Durga Puja? Anything else you want to talk about, Kanaida? Any other things you want to talk about?</div><div id="00:39:16.500" class="transcript_line"> My personal experience as a priest, I had to, I really worked very hard to know exactly what I am doing.</div><div id="00:39:30.500" class="transcript_line"> And I remember over the years that I find it a highly responsible, responsible job for me to get everything together.</div><div id="00:39:42.500" class="transcript_line"> And I always contacted Dr. Acharji, which I had to find out exactly what is involved.</div><div id="00:39:53.500" class="transcript_line"> And Dr. Acharji was of course very much helpful to me. And he told me almost everything, how to perform all these things.</div><div id="00:40:03.500" class="transcript_line"> And obviously from Port Col to Cardiff is about 30 miles. And to attend the Durga Puja in a particular time, to start in a particular time of the day,</div><div id="00:40:19.500" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t that easy for us to go there early in the morning and stay somewhere and perform the evening ceremony.</div><div id="00:40:28.500" class="transcript_line"> And it takes a lot of time and of course the worries and anxieties. And I was always very much particular that the puja should be starting in the right time and should finish in the right time.</div><div id="00:40:46.500" class="transcript_line"> And I was very much involved with this and of course very much worried as well until the whole thing has been performed by other people who used to assist.</div><div id="00:41:01.500" class="transcript_line"> And obviously I needed somebody to assist me and my wife and other people in those areas, particularly the ladies who are involved in arranging things.</div><div id="00:41:15.500" class="transcript_line"> And I am very much grateful for all of them to assist me in helping to continue doing the ritual as easy as possible.</div><div id="00:41:27.500" class="transcript_line"> And of course I always made some difficulties but that as I can remember is one of the contributory factors to the puja to be carried out in the next year.</div><div id="00:41:48.500" class="transcript_line"> And more experience and more confidence. I have grown over the years and I did enjoy very much myself that I am contributing something to the community, to the society.</div><div id="00:42:06.500" class="transcript_line"> And obviously I am very much pleased. A lot of people know me in Kharib and outside Kharib as a priest, as a friend, as a advisor, whatever you call. And I am very much pleased and draw a lot of satisfaction out of it.</div><div id="00:42:26.500" class="transcript_line"> Okay, Anamika, do you want to say anything else, add anything else you can think about?</div><div id="00:42:31.500" class="transcript_line"> Not really. It is just a big responsibility. As long as we can do it, travel from Pothkol to Khafeeli every day and come back, it is a huge pressure as well.</div><div id="00:42:47.500" class="transcript_line"> So all in all, we still enjoy performing puja and I assist him. As long as we can carry on doing this, helping the community, it will be great.</div><div id="00:43:04.500" class="transcript_line"> Good. Thank you very much both of you. And we will finish it today here. Thank you.</div></div></p>
