    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Great House and the Well. The Great House, known as T. Mowre in Welsh, is an</div><div id="00:00:06.640" class="transcript_line"> Elizabethan manor house. It&#039;s a grade two listed building that was built around</div><div id="00:00:10.680" class="transcript_line"> 1569. It&#039;s sometimes known as the Earl of Leicester&#039;s house. Sir Robert Sidney, who</div><div id="00:00:16.020" class="transcript_line"> became Earl of Leicester in 1618, took ownership of the Coitie estate on his</div><div id="00:00:20.100" class="transcript_line"> marriage in 1584. And it is possible that he and his wife lived in the house for a</div><div id="00:00:24.800" class="transcript_line"> year until he was elected Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire in 1585.</div><div id="00:00:28.860" class="transcript_line"> But following his election they are known to have lived mainly in London. The</div><div id="00:00:33.460" class="transcript_line"> assumption that this house was part of the Coitie estate has therefore not been</div><div id="00:00:36.780" class="transcript_line"> proven. When the Coitie estate was bought by Samuel Edwin in 1718, T. Mowre, or the</div><div id="00:00:42.380" class="transcript_line"> Great House, was not included in the sale. Hence the romantic idea that the house</div><div id="00:00:46.580" class="transcript_line"> once belonged to the Earl of Leicester is no more than that, at least until</div><div id="00:00:50.420" class="transcript_line"> someone proves otherwise. During the winter the house was said to use heat</div><div id="00:00:54.180" class="transcript_line"> from wintering cattle in an abutting barn as a kind of central heating. This</div><div id="00:00:58.580" class="transcript_line"> is one of the stories often told to diners at the Great House, which is now a</div><div id="00:01:01.660" class="transcript_line"> hotel and restaurant. As you continue the trail past the Great House and then</div><div id="00:01:06.020" class="transcript_line"> behind it, you&#039;ll reach Well Street. Until 1928 there was no mains water</div><div id="00:01:10.940" class="transcript_line"> available in the village. The well situated on this street was the main</div><div id="00:01:14.420" class="transcript_line"> source of water to the villagers. In times of drought, it is said, each household was</div><div id="00:01:18.860" class="transcript_line"> permitted just two gallons of water per day.</div></div></p>
