    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I left school at 14, I went to a primary school, secondary modern school in Markham.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I left school at 15 years of age, I was 15 in September and I started in the mines in 1962,</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and I started in the mines Christmas Eve of the same year.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I started underground, did my training, went to college, did some training,</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> and then I went to work on the face with some men. Within a year I broke my foot.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was still only, I think perhaps just coming up to 16 or 16.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you break your foot?</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I was what they call withdrawing, getting timbers out,</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> whole timbers out that had been supported in the roof and letting it go out.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I cut this one up with an axe and actually the stone fell and it rolled over and it went over main step,</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> it went straight over my steel choke up and into my main step.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> The funny thing about it was that they took me straight to my house in the ambulance,</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> called my mother and said, do you want to see him before we take him out?</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I was frightened to death. Yeah, they did that.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I came back, I worked on the face for a while and then I was asked to go to work with the splices.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to work with the splices and I worked with the splices for about two years.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a striker, when they were cutting steel ropes I was the guy with the armour, the sledge.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> While doing that, a piece of steel went up through my eye and I was in hospital again and I was still only young.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They took me, the eye was alright, they saved the eye, everything was okay.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The thing about that was that they took, as soon as I did it,</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> they sent goggles down the mine for everybody who was using anything that afternoon, everything went alright.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did that and then that was okay.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked for a few years in the mines and decided that I&#039;d go out to the mine site.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in roads working and repairing and on the coal.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I went outside to work and I worked for Wyn&#039;s Heavy Aldridge in Newport, massive company, big, carried heavy stuff.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a stiersman, finished there, went to work in a foundry and I thought, no I don&#039;t like this, I&#039;m going back to the mines.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went back into the mines, went to Markham, Colleray and was a repairer and I worked on a coal.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the manager came to see me one day and said, I heard you were with the ventilation officers in Auckland when you were training.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah, I&#039;d like to train to be a ventilation officer here.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did and I went and I passed the exams and everything and I think they were pretty good and I worked on doing that.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Then my marriage broke up after a couple of years and the manager stopped my lamp one day and said to me,</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> listen Glen, there&#039;s a place in the Rhondda, in Dinas, in the mines rescuization, full time.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re interested in going, I&#039;ll put your name forward.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did and that&#039;s where I went to and I was there for about 10 years and then I had an accident with my leg, not underground or anything,</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> but I hurt my foot and somebody came to see me and it wasn&#039;t fair to go down there, then a problem with walking.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> If I had to carry somebody, I would be a liability in case something went wrong.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I decided it was time to go out.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So then they came and they offered me redundancy and I took the redundancy and went outside.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Since then I&#039;ve started up my own business and I&#039;m still working today.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy working in the mines?</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Loved it, absolutely loved it.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard work and it was dangerous work, but I like to come regularly.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been around everywhere and there is nowhere that I have seen a camaraderie like that.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I would imagine the only thing near that would be a soldier.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t think anybody, I&#039;ve never seen it anywhere else.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was kind of you were all in the same position.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all in the same position and if somebody, if he was working in the face and somebody had a piece of rough ground, it was bad,</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> then you would finish your work and go and help him and the other blokes would come and help him and make it good.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He was watching out for one another all the time.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the thing. It was good.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They looked out for you and that was good.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoyed that camaraderie.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Proper teamwork as well.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was. It was always teamwork.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you taught teamwork? Was it just a natural thing?</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a natural thing, I think, that it just carried on.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to work in the foundry and this is why I finished in the foundry, was that sometimes it was aluminium we were using</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes you put an ingot in and if there was water or it was cold, he would explore and go up in the air.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So everybody would run and whatever.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I went up one day and some of this molten aluminium spurted over and went down into his boots.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody, but nobody, stopped working and just kept on and he was screaming on the floor.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother was doing brass and I was doing aluminium. Only me and him ran two miners.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I put my notes in the afternoon and my brother and we both finished. I said, I don&#039;t know what you would be like that.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no camaraderie at all and I was in Cavalier and I never forget that.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I really finished me towards that. I finished that day.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was no looking out for each other?</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Not at all.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Were in the mines?</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in the mines. If somebody got injured, they were on a stretcher and they were taken out.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> People were there and they were always reassuring them.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it always in the back of your mind that you could get injured any day or was it good knowing that you did get injured?</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Every miner knows every day. He&#039;s always looking out for things you knew it was instinctive to know that there was danger there all of the time.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> If it wasn&#039;t the roof, it could be a journey coming or it could be a walker moving.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There were many, many different things underground that could catch you out.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think miners were quite vulnerable. Although we did get caught out, we did get killed and were some people.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> There were some of these things.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So moving on to your first injury with your foot, you mentioned you will steal toe cap boots.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, your accident missed the steel bits.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It went into my toe cap and broke into my toe cap.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> How were you injured? Was it a permanent injury? Did your employer give you any kind of compensation or did they help you to get back into work?</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just on the sick end.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you get paid on the sick end?</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I got paid until my foot was okay and then I went back to work.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You were able to go back down in the sick end.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was only young and I was very, very young. Today the kids are a lot older, I think, and advanced than we were.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember going down and I remember when it hurt so much. It was my first break.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I had tears in my eyes and I remember the bloke I was working with, Tommy, Tommy Grasses.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He looked at me and he said, is that a tear in your eye, boy?</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll never forget it. I said, no.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to me, because you&#039;re a man now and men don&#039;t cry, you&#039;re a miner.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember him telling me that and I didn&#039;t cry after. He&#039;d do it a lot, but let me tell you, I wanted to.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Fifteen-year-old is a child, because you were a child at that time.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the way it was. It was okay after. I had compensation. We used to get compensation.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d pay your wages and all of this. I didn&#039;t get any money for it because they broke my foot.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had sick pay?</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Sick pay and everything like that. They paid me. I went back to work and that was it. That was the way it was.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> How long were you off?</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you know, approximately a month.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And they paid you full wage or was it a lesser wage?</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> They paid me full wage.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They paid me full my year.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> When you had the accident with your eye and you mentioned after that that everybody had goggles, how did it go from not having goggles to having goggles?</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it simply your accident?</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the goggles must have been there. They must have been in the colliery because they were straight down the mine.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They just didn&#039;t give me any goggles. I didn&#039;t know anything about it. They just closed my eyes and went straight through.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So you think the goggles were probably available?</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they never...</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Did the other miners wear them?</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not many people were wearing my goggles at all.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, but after your accidents?</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were totally having to wear them on.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it a case of if you don&#039;t wear them and you get injured then you won&#039;t get sick pay?</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know what they did but I know that I got... from my eye. I know they did it and then I had to go for a board with my eye.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave me so much for life. I can&#039;t remember how much it was. They paid me up.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So they gave you compensation?</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave me compensation for my eye, yeah. They did have compensation for my eye.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you paid sick pay as well?</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I was paid when I was off, yeah. But then they paid me a couple hundred pounds I think. It was like perhaps about £300.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was a lot of money.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a lot of money then, but yeah, and I had that. And then I supposed to have had a pension for it.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the government came in and said, no, no, anybody under 3% or whatever is... you know, they stopped that pension. You&#039;ve got to have 7%.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t matter, but that was the way it went.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But you had compensation. Did you have lasting damage in your eye or did it leave you right?</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. It hasn&#039;t affected my eyesight at all. They were worried about cataracts, but I never even had a cataract.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was the steel span and the corneas of the eye, the covering of the eye, and spread it, but it stayed there.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had to turn it and pull it back out. Yeah, not nice.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, they did that and they put two stitches in it. As you can see if you look, they put two stitches in my eye.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after a couple of weeks, they said to me, you&#039;re going to go on with your eye, you need stitches out.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went down to the theatre and I drew the stitches out and that&#039;s the worst pain I&#039;ve ever had in my life.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I passed out about three times. They just picked it off with a tweezers and pulled it, but it was pulling it off, you know.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Pulling it out through the eye. So that wasn&#039;t nice, but yeah, I passed it about three times. I don&#039;t remember that.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was the way it was, you know.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But you were a man.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a man. No, I didn&#039;t cry.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d listened to your father who advised you when you were 15 not to cry.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He taught me how to cry.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s the way it was, you know.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think when I was in the mines since coming out of the mines, I had tests for my hearing aid, for my ears and I like.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh yeah, you&#039;ve got a little bit of hearing loss.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went about 12 months ago and they said it&#039;s a little bit progressive and my wife said you better go because you&#039;re not listening to me.</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went and I went and I got apparently a severe hearing loss.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can hear you, you know, but it&#039;s too what it is, severe hearing loss in both ears.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said you had that for a long, long time.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think it&#039;s to do with working in mines?</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was boring, boring holes and I know boring Europeans, it was, yeah.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So if it was eight or ten holes, you know, and six inch, six foot long, you know, boring that.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had, if anything, then with that and he said well you heard it straight after he had trouble with my hands.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to have an operation, I had to go and see about my hands.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I saw a doctor who said to me, do you usually work in a mines, do you?</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said yeah.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So you go away and get it?</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He said no.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He said did they test you for it?</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no, not really, they just let me in.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> He said well you&#039;ve got a carpal tunnel in both hands, he said and that&#039;s from vibrating.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did a conversation for that, you know, as well, with my hands.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> From the coal board?</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> From the government.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So right finger is another name for?</div><div id="00:14:48.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, white finger and carpal tunnel are a different thing.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, so what&#039;s a white finger?</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> White finger, your fingers go numb, you know, they will go white everywhere.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s something in your hand for a while.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it goes white, that&#039;s what you think, like white finger.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So it gets very painful, it&#039;s not nice.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I had is your veins, they twist around your veins, sitting with whatever.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So they had to operate on both my hands to get them right.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not right now, but you know, I get penchant for it, so yeah, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I can put up with that.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the thing, you know.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So apart from your mishaps, were you aware of any other accidents or anybody with any kind of disability working in the mine?</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there anybody who had lost a limb or?</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember my own dad died at 48 with emphysemia and they said it was nothing to do with the cold, but it was, it worked out, it is.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Something to do with it.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I went to put up a conversation with my mother, it was too long ago, he didn&#039;t live long enough, he only died at 48.</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So where did that go?</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether, you know, she should have got the compensation, not him, but they never paid her anything.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was really, really bad and I&#039;ve heard a lot of stories like that since.</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember a bloke called Ronnie Bishop.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he caught his foot in the Panzer chain.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He was like, he worked with a limp or one, he still worked underground, he couldn&#039;t work on a face or anything anymore.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But he still worked there, he worked on a corrie.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> There were lots of hellas and bad accidents, you know.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And was allowances made?</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were, yeah, they were definitely allowances made for people, you know.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And even too, I won&#039;t mention names, but when I worked in A Corrie, there was a man there, I would say he had autism.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I would think autism.</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Norah, a lovely bloke, really good.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But he really could make radios.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d make a radio app from scratch, a really good guy.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll never forget it, but he was so, if you talked to him, he was not with it, you know.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But the manager gave him a job cleaning the toilet.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So I always remember, he went for a job and the manager said, yes, you can have a job.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He couldn&#039;t put him underground, no way, he&#039;d be too dangerous, couldn&#039;t, you know.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I always remember him and he had this going and one day I was with the manager walking down because we were going together to see something.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to me, what&#039;s that noise, Glen?</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what noise?</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> That noise, he said.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, it&#039;s the radio, it was music playing, you know.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s he coming from?</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, toilets.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So he walked over to the toilets.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember him and he said, this fella was in there.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to him, why have you got that on?</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Why is that on in you now?</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;m going to do my engineering work.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to him, I refer to him as Mr. Man, I don&#039;t want to get this guy in.</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, it&#039;s on, he said, because you told me that I had a very important job.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And you told me that I was to lag the pipes if there was any icing and things to make sure there wasn&#039;t any bursts.</div><div id="00:18:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, yes.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m listening if there&#039;s going to be any snow.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So the manager said, OK, he said.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He walked up to Tony and he said, it&#039;s time for me to finish now, Glen.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, isn&#039;t it June?</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the middle of June, he was boiling up.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> He just passed on his pipe, he walked away and he just said, oh, leave him go.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was funny, but you know, that&#039;s what they were like, you know.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t all bad.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Managers weren&#039;t all bad.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I found some of them really good, you know.</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them were hard.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, good ones, you know.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there many people with learning disabilities?</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see a lot, but I remember him really well.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Not everybody, people.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Not that he was diagnosed.</div><div id="00:19:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Not that he was diagnosed.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, not that he was diagnosed.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s say then, some people weren&#039;t suitable to go underground.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Or to work on the surface in certain areas.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Where you have machinery and other safety if you want to.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But they did work in other areas, you know.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they could help on the timber yard.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, with supervision they could work different places, you know.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there were other people in the mines with disabilities, you know.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know if they were paid the same or were they paid for the job?</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were paid the surface rate.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Whatever the surface rate was going, they were paid exactly the same.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it doesn&#039;t matter whatever.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were paid the same.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> There weren&#039;t any discrepancies to my knowledge anyway.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there were some really good people about them.</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Some people who understood that there were difficulties with some people.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was good to see.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I noticed that miners were very tolerant of this.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And always nice to these people.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I treated them not as less, but as equals.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And always laughing.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> How are you going?</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it was good.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That was good.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I like that.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The more I talk to people, the more positive things are.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Even though it&#039;s a really hard job.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But the camaraderie, that word, is mentioned every single time you interview somebody, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The camaraderie and the teamwork.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It does sound like such a good place to work apart from the danger and the lies and everything.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It does seem very difficult.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard and it was horrible in places.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s the same.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard people saying, you know, you&#039;re miners, you&#039;re money for a rope and all this nonsense.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But when you take him to the camaraderie, like I had an uncle who said,</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re getting too much money, you people are always on strike.</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And all this.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to him, well, come with me then.</div><div id="00:21:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I took him to the pithead and I raged to the manager to take him down.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He looked over the top like, I&#039;ll be studying going on ahead.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, come on, we haven&#039;t started yet.</div><div id="00:22:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s only going down.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But no, he wouldn&#039;t go down.</div><div id="00:22:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He changed his mind a bit quick.</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But it isn&#039;t, you know.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not about that.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about...</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But everything, you know, that was good.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> There was positives, you know.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There were positives.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And the positives were good.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we didn&#039;t get a lot of money in the beginning.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember, I think it was £22.50 they paid us.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> £12.80. £18 was in the second.</div><div id="00:22:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a top of £18 second.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When I started, I think I was on...</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> £6 a week.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You went morning, you started down below.</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I went morning, you went...</div><div id="00:23:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I went £6 a week, I think I started on about £6 a week.</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you know, I mean, the Tardic kids, they only go one.</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> One half of the money, don&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:23:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the times have changed and things have changed, the values have changed.</div><div id="00:23:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was, you know.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoyed my time in the rescue service.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, the camaraderie there was really, you know, it was a god.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Really good.</div><div id="00:23:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We saw some things, done some things.</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Saw some things.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Worked together regularly.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Had a laugh and I know, you know, I can always remember.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the funniest things of all that.</div><div id="00:23:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody liked going into the old drift mines.</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was shut because they were full of cold water, you know.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And everything, and when they went in, they were dating in bits and pieces, falling.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And you ought to be careful, you know.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had a call one night, and I&#039;ll never forget it.</div><div id="00:24:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, we ran up the station and got up the station.</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boss said I was a volunteer, as he said, to go into an old drift mine.</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So everybody started to sort their off, you know.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Walk away like he said.</div><div id="00:24:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Come on now, boys.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a 26-year-old woman, I think she was 26, that stripped off naked, took her two kids.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And stripped off naked and went into this drift.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Walked into this drift mine.</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But you couldn&#039;t get on the band, right?</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody could get on the band.</div><div id="00:24:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Who was Jock?</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They were up there, but gee, apparently the kids had run away.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had backtracked.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how right this is, but I know the army, everybody was looking, but nobody could find her anyway.</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think she had backtracked and gone in a vehicle and disappeared.</div><div id="00:24:57.000" class="transcript_line"> With somebody.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> End of story.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I have heard she&#039;s been seen since.</div><div id="00:25:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think if they ever caught you, she&#039;d be doing a jail term because it cost thousands and thousands of pounds to turn out a team and get everybody looking for her.</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know how her boys dived in there, you know.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So they risked their lives.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they would have, yeah, because when you go into somewhere like that, I mean, apparently when they went in and walked around the corner, there was a ledge.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Now she wouldn&#039;t have been able to see that in the dark.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose she would have walked into that.</div><div id="00:25:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was so cold, she would have gone unconsciously.</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But they went, we had some officers there who used to do the skid diving, you know.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And they went in and they never found anything, you know, when she went in there.</div><div id="00:25:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you know, how dangerous just to...</div><div id="00:25:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So what happened to the children?</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They went to sleep with their grandad and their grandma, I think.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know what happened.</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I did hear she had a boyfriend up north or something, and this is what had happened.</div><div id="00:26:07.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d gone in, to make like if she&#039;d gone in and died.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But she&#039;d backtracked and gone in a circle.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I heard.</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether it happened.</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we were told.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, but they were good men to work with.</div><div id="00:26:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them I worked with were in Six Bells explosion, you know.</div><div id="00:26:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them were in Aberfan.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They were all from different things, you know.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the worst kind of rescue mission, the deadliest rescue mission you went on?</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I never went on many deadly ones.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I went on more or less in Bryn Llyw.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We went there one morning and there was a fire.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the way, they said it was...</div><div id="00:27:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d listened to the radio, you know, and it was like port control, port number one.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were telling him that this fire now is timber and coal, you know, spontaneous combustion, right?</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he went from coal and then he went into belt.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went from that to being coal, to belt and oil burning.</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and we thinking, oh, here we go.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we got there, there was two inspectors there, Gifford, I think, and he was, I&#039;m not sure, Gifford.</div><div id="00:27:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the one.</div><div id="00:27:34.000" class="transcript_line"> One was a coal board and one was the union guy.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went into it and Lachy were the one side fight, you know.</div><div id="00:27:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were the other side with the smoke coming towards us.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were in there and we were closing down, you know.</div><div id="00:27:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, can you see a door?</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And we said, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, what&#039;s the cover like?</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was nothing there at all, no timber.</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It all burned away.</div><div id="00:28:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There was no timber down, so we had to put steel over the top, which is a no-no, you know, because steel slips, not steel, do it.</div><div id="00:28:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, we put it there and I was with a fellow, a school field, and he collapsed, me and him, it was all right.</div><div id="00:28:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But then we got in and we eventually got past this place, into where this door was, you know.</div><div id="00:28:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, what is it like?</div><div id="00:28:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And we said, well, it&#039;s red hot, like.</div><div id="00:28:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, well, cool it down, you know.</div><div id="00:28:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So we cooled it down and he said, well, go in there.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, it&#039;s a powder magazine, which was, you know.</div><div id="00:28:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went in and he said, right, can you get, so he said, we&#039;re the captain, can you undo something and tell us what it&#039;s like?</div><div id="00:28:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know what happened, but I know some of it was sweating and whatever, and we didn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:28:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It was daily jacks, daily, but all different types of stuff, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:28:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, so tell us then, what&#039;s it like, Leo, did this go in?</div><div id="00:28:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:28:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ve never, ever, never, ever had it in this state before.</div><div id="00:29:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, he could have gone puff, he said, or he could have left the top of the mountain, you know, but I&#039;m asking him to bring it out, like.</div><div id="00:29:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But we did bring it out, you know, sorry.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think the best one I ever went on was up the partag.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And we was up there and we went in.</div><div id="00:29:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And these two guys, they tried a machine from the top.</div><div id="00:29:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They were in a private mine.</div><div id="00:29:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And we worked out the length they were in.</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was no air going in there, but we could talk to them because there was a phone line in there.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was two blocks trapped.</div><div id="00:29:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we got there, I always remember the mother, the wives and mothers were there, and the kids, and the kids were saying, go give it a go, you know, really, really upsetting.</div><div id="00:29:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They never were allowed to come too near, I suppose.</div><div id="00:29:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody assumed they saw the vehicle, all the rescue boys, they&#039;d be all over, you know, in two seconds.</div><div id="00:30:01.000" class="transcript_line"> They were going to wave a magic wand and everything, but it&#039;s not that easy, you know.</div><div id="00:30:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And there wasn&#039;t much hope to getting them out.</div><div id="00:30:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But on digging in, you know, the teams, the different successive teams had worked.</div><div id="00:30:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And apparently their own men had dug a lot, you know.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was no way, you know, they&#039;d distance in.</div><div id="00:30:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But apparently we hit the journey in the road.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went at the site of the journey and got them out.</div><div id="00:30:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They were digging out, we got them out.</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So we did get them out.</div><div id="00:30:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was a nice one, you know, that was a lovely one, you know.</div><div id="00:30:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it was nasty.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The first one I went on was my own Caldry marker.</div><div id="00:30:38.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a fire in the shaft and I had to go down on top of the cage with another rescue man.</div><div id="00:30:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, you can&#039;t put any harnesses on it because you&#039;ve got to wear your armor.</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to stand on the top and he just slung a chain around and we went down.</div><div id="00:30:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to walk across this narrow, narrow thing, frightening to death.</div><div id="00:30:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was, yeah, there was other things.</div><div id="00:30:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was the way it was, you know.</div><div id="00:31:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good and I enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:31:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed my time there.</div><div id="00:31:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I liked the boys I worked with, you know, the officers were good.</div><div id="00:31:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We had good fun together.</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a good community because we all lived.</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our own tennis courts.</div><div id="00:31:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a training pool lesson.</div><div id="00:31:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our own swimming pool.</div><div id="00:31:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our own rack, rack nation room where there was no cup of tea, table.</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had table tennis, I think, and all different things like that, you know.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to do all these things.</div><div id="00:31:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They had tennis courts and we used to do all of that.</div><div id="00:31:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we lived there, you know, bumping out, we did everything ourselves, you know, and everything, you know.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But we would challenge the local rugby team or the local cricket team, you know, to play our women.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that.</div><div id="00:31:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they came down.</div><div id="00:31:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We played them in rugby.</div><div id="00:31:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, I think all our boys were 35, 40 and they were about 20, you know.</div><div id="00:31:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We had three steps, but it was good, you know.</div><div id="00:31:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But we said to them, you ought to come and play our women and cricket, you know.</div><div id="00:32:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said, yeah, right, oh, we&#039;ll play them.</div><div id="00:32:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, we got a cracking cricket team.</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So they came down, I was fully expecting them to see all these women coming down, you know.</div><div id="00:32:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all the boys dressed up when there was women, like, you know.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But the funniest thing is, this one Alan, he was going away the next day to Benidorm or somewhere like that.</div><div id="00:32:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Poor old boys dead, you know.</div><div id="00:32:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I remember him and we played and he had a strap thing on.</div><div id="00:32:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, when we changed, he had straps and bras that could be used, you know.</div><div id="00:32:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;m going to go away, you know.</div><div id="00:32:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the sun.</div><div id="00:32:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He had a sun tan of a bra.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, he had a bra and everything.</div><div id="00:32:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So everybody laughed at him.</div><div id="00:32:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was what he was.</div><div id="00:32:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But good, good, good.</div><div id="00:32:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And good camaraderie.</div><div id="00:32:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, when, if something was on, one of the boys would go and knock on the women and tell them what was going on.</div><div id="00:32:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything&#039;s OK.</div><div id="00:32:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You never say, oh, no, it&#039;s a big fire.</div><div id="00:33:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was just without a safety day.</div><div id="00:33:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, the boys were all right, they&#039;re great, you know.</div><div id="00:33:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can remember going on one early in the morning.</div><div id="00:33:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I came back at six o&#039;clock until Sunday morning, I think I came back at six o&#039;clock in the evening.</div><div id="00:33:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d gone about four or five in the morning.</div><div id="00:33:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I came back about six.</div><div id="00:33:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And my wife and children were there, you know.</div><div id="00:33:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had that dinner and they wouldn&#039;t eat until I came home.</div><div id="00:33:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was, you know, it must have been horrific for them, you know.</div><div id="00:33:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But, yeah, I mean, you know, when you think of it, it had happened by the time we got there mostly.</div><div id="00:33:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I know sometimes it could be a bit scary, but it had happened and was all over by the time we got there.</div><div id="00:33:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If it was an explosion, it had happened by the time we got there.</div><div id="00:33:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to go and pick the bits, you know, so the things happened.</div><div id="00:33:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It always picked bits happened, you know.</div><div id="00:33:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But mostly, yes, we&#039;d gone to a fire or something like that.</div><div id="00:33:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But, yeah, that&#039;s the way it was, you know.</div><div id="00:33:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a good money being on the rescue team.</div><div id="00:34:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good money.</div><div id="00:34:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good money.</div><div id="00:34:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you see, having said that, you&#039;d be on crew from eight o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:34:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Until, say, half past four.</div><div id="00:34:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d be on crew from the time you finished.</div><div id="00:34:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Till morning you&#039;d be on call.</div><div id="00:34:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d be doing that four days a week or five days a week sometimes, you know.</div><div id="00:34:28.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the chefs was 24 hours.</div><div id="00:34:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The fireman was 24 hours.</div><div id="00:34:33.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be on in the morning, you know, you&#039;d go home.</div><div id="00:34:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody&#039;d come and relieve you for an hour and you&#039;d be back on.</div><div id="00:34:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you&#039;d do it.</div><div id="00:34:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the way it was.</div><div id="00:34:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, it was a lot of waiting time, a lot of time in the house.</div><div id="00:34:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t go out because if something happened, you had to move.</div><div id="00:34:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And they did pride themselves on quick going out there, you know.</div><div id="00:34:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Really, I think it was about just over a minute from bed.</div><div id="00:34:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and our vehicle was leaving the yard.</div><div id="00:35:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had to be quick, you know.</div><div id="00:35:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was good.</div><div id="00:35:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:35:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Felly, ond unrhyw beth oedd ychwanegol eich bod yn ei ddweud amdano?</div><div id="00:35:15.000"
