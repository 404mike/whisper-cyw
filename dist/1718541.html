    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t take your father&#039;s footsteps and go into forestry then?</div><div id="00:00:04.160" class="transcript_line"> I would have actually, I was quite interesting, but there was a, I think my father was recommending</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> that there were too many people in the forest, too many managers in the forestry at the time,</div><div id="00:00:16.560" class="transcript_line"> and that there were lots of people after the war who kind of gone into the forestry after</div><div id="00:00:21.680" class="transcript_line"> kind of having roles in the army and things like that, because it was that kind of operation where</div><div id="00:00:27.440" class="transcript_line"> it I think suited those kind of military-minded people, I think.</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> The Forest Commission didn&#039;t always have a happy kind of relationship with third parties and things</div><div id="00:00:40.640" class="transcript_line"> like that, particularly the farmers, because the drive to get the land and to plant the land with</div><div id="00:00:51.280" class="transcript_line"> trees was so strong after the war, because kind of prior to the war, even though the Forest Commission</div><div id="00:00:57.840" class="transcript_line"> had been set up in 1919, it was its anniversary last year or centenary, it had to acquire the land.</div><div id="00:01:10.240" class="transcript_line"> It was only about 10% of the total timber kind of usage in the UK was coming from home soil,</div><div id="00:01:16.800" class="transcript_line"> 90% of it was being imported, and even after the first, they realized there was a problem</div><div id="00:01:22.320" class="transcript_line"> after the First World War, because they chopped down every tree going pretty much in the First</div><div id="00:01:26.640" class="transcript_line"> World War, because the kind of wars apparently take a lot of timber, as well as kind of going</div><div id="00:01:32.160" class="transcript_line"> to rebuild things after them. And in the First World War, they needed wood for cordite, which was</div><div id="00:01:38.880" class="transcript_line"> kind of used in the shells in the psalm and things like that, it was a kind of a source material for</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> that. But even after 1919, when they said we&#039;re not going to do this again, we&#039;re not going to</div><div id="00:01:50.960" class="transcript_line"> get caught with a pants down, kind of having no way of having the timber we need to kind of</div><div id="00:01:58.400" class="transcript_line"> manage and save ourselves. And then within a couple of years, they had a plan to plant</div><div id="00:02:03.760" class="transcript_line"> millions and millions of acres, I can&#039;t remember if it was two or five million acres of trees</div><div id="00:02:08.560" class="transcript_line"> in the UK to get the resource back. But within a couple of years, some change of government,</div><div id="00:02:15.360" class="transcript_line"> and somebody said, well, that&#039;s costing us too much money. And they pulled it back. So by time</div><div id="00:02:20.160" class="transcript_line"> the Second World War came up, they still had about 10% of homegrown stuff, and they were still</div><div id="00:02:26.240" class="transcript_line"> importing 90%. And when the war, a lot of that was coming from Scandinavia, across the North Sea,</div><div id="00:02:34.880" class="transcript_line"> there was some from Africa, but bits of Asia, sorry, bits of Europe, but obviously Europe closed</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> down fairly quickly during the war for a source of anything. And once the U-boats and things like</div><div id="00:02:46.160" class="transcript_line"> that were out in the seas, then we couldn&#039;t really import wood readily from Scandinavia,</div><div id="00:02:54.480" class="transcript_line"> particularly when some of those countries were taken over by the Germans anyhow.</div><div id="00:02:58.560" class="transcript_line"> So they suddenly realized that during the war that this was a big problem. And once again,</div><div id="00:03:03.840" class="transcript_line"> they sat down and said, we mustn&#039;t do this again. So they had another plan to have a five million</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> acres of trees planted and got going on there. And that was the drive that my dad got onto,</div><div id="00:03:17.120" class="transcript_line"> I suppose, at the time, that the need for forgetting the trees planted. It was a policy</div><div id="00:03:25.280" class="transcript_line"> at the time. It was supposed to be an insurance policy, because they said, well, okay, we&#039;re not</div><div id="00:03:29.840" class="transcript_line"> supposed to have another war. But if we do, we&#039;re going to be in exactly the same position,</div><div id="00:03:33.520" class="transcript_line"> or even worse, because we chop down every available tree that&#039;s worth having at that time. And</div><div id="00:03:41.760" class="transcript_line"> obviously, once after the war, there was a massive rebuilding program. And even though</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> modern materials are coming through, timber is still used massively in any kind of building</div><div id="00:03:54.640" class="transcript_line"> program, be it industrial or domestic houses. So yeah, they got through that.</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, a lot of the trees, when you look at them now, I&#039;m not too sure if they&#039;re ideal for</div><div id="00:04:08.800" class="transcript_line"> the modern requirements. But the good thing to see is that there are sawmills and things like</div><div id="00:04:15.360" class="transcript_line"> that now locally. Whereas before, the nearest place for any timber in Wales to go was the pop</div><div id="00:04:22.960" class="transcript_line"> mills in Ellesmere Port from places, you know, miles away. But kind of the trees as well were</div><div id="00:04:31.200" class="transcript_line"> aimed at very much the pit props. A lot of the trees planted here, they wanted fast growing trees,</div><div id="00:04:38.720" class="transcript_line"> but they could keep the mining industry going, because that&#039;s what drove the steel industry and</div><div id="00:04:44.960" class="transcript_line"> all the rest of it. And at that time, they could see that that&#039;s what was needed was fast growing</div><div id="00:04:51.520" class="transcript_line"> timbers that would allow them to get back to a reserve of some timber at least,</div><div id="00:04:58.720" class="transcript_line"> letting that same stuff grow on. But it wouldn&#039;t necessarily be the timber you&#039;d be growing now for</div><div id="00:05:04.400" class="transcript_line"> perhaps what modern demand is, I don&#039;t know. The thing I find is that the sheer amount of effort</div><div id="00:05:11.280" class="transcript_line"> and work that went into putting the trees where they are and to make them grow. And I know my</div><div id="00:05:16.960" class="transcript_line"> father used to have quite a bit of conflicts every now and again with the local farmers who</div><div id="00:05:23.280" class="transcript_line"> still had to shoot back into the forest to graze and things like that. Yeah, of course. And they,</div><div id="00:05:28.400" class="transcript_line"> a part of it, there are things like, for example, the cut to meat, they started to become</div><div id="00:05:35.440" class="transcript_line"> more appreciative of what the local farmers were saying. They were saying, oh, these forests, you</div><div id="00:05:40.800" class="transcript_line"> fence off all these lands. All it does is breed foxes that come out and take our</div><div id="00:05:45.520" class="transcript_line"> lambs and things like this. And you&#039;ve got loads of little crows that keep going, what are you</div><div id="00:05:49.520" class="transcript_line"> doing about this? So they then kind of had programs to try and control it. And Joe Williams,</div><div id="00:05:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Lindsay Williams, his dad was the trapper. Right. I don&#039;t know. Yeah. But I suppose he was</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> responsible for keeping down the vermin and the foxes. Yeah. So there was lots of little things</div><div id="00:06:09.600" class="transcript_line"> like that going on. And when we were young as well, the RSA rally used to use the forestry roads.</div><div id="00:06:16.160" class="transcript_line"> They haven&#039;t done now for a number of years, but in places, if I still go around there now,</div><div id="00:06:20.960" class="transcript_line"> I can see the bends where the RSA rallies were coming around because the contour of the bends,</div><div id="00:06:27.040" class="transcript_line"> because when they made the road originally, they&#039;d be graded and all the roads would be that shape.</div><div id="00:06:32.880" class="transcript_line"> But on the bends now, where you see it, there&#039;s a lovely camber on the bends. And that camber has</div><div id="00:06:37.440" class="transcript_line"> been made by when the RSA rallies used to go through, they threw all the gravel from one side</div><div id="00:06:42.800" class="transcript_line"> to the other side of the road. And you get a nice little little camber on the bends in place.</div></div></p>
