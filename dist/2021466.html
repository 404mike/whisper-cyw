    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the music scene like then? Newport in the early 70s?</div><div id="00:00:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, to be honest with you, I wasn&#039;t that familiar with it. I certainly wasn&#039;t part of it.</div><div id="00:00:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Is that because you come from A-Men Corner?</div><div id="00:00:41.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to say really. I was kind of not that interested at the time in the music. I had my teeth</div><div id="00:00:48.720" class="transcript_line"> into the fashion thing. A-Men Corner finished in 1970. I formed a band called Judas Jump under</div><div id="00:00:57.920" class="transcript_line"> Don Arden&#039;s management, which lasted only about a year and a half. We made a couple of singles and</div><div id="00:01:05.040" class="transcript_line"> album and then we basically decided to call it a day. It wasn&#039;t going anywhere. So I decided to come</div><div id="00:01:10.960" class="transcript_line"> back to Wales. I just had enough at London at the time. I was with my girlfriend, a Swedish girl</div><div id="00:01:18.960" class="transcript_line"> called Britt, who was lovely. I decided to come back to live in Newport for a while just to get</div><div id="00:01:25.280" class="transcript_line"> my thoughts together. Whilst I was there, I met up with Paul Hanbury, who was one of the partners in</div><div id="00:01:30.720" class="transcript_line"> the shop called Clobber that was based in Cardiff Road. He had a partner called Gerald Davis.</div><div id="00:01:38.640" class="transcript_line"> They were running the shop. Then I came back and I had a few quid spare. I said,</div><div id="00:01:44.960" class="transcript_line"> do you fancy having a partner? They agreed that I could join as a third partner. Then we developed</div><div id="00:01:52.320" class="transcript_line"> the shop from there and it went on. You migrated over from the music business into the fashion</div><div id="00:02:01.840" class="transcript_line"> business. It wasn&#039;t intended to be long term or anything. It was just something else to do.</div><div id="00:02:09.040" class="transcript_line"> I got fed up with the politics of the rock and roll business for a while. It was a difficult time,</div><div id="00:02:16.880" class="transcript_line"> especially with Arden managing and all that. Don Arden was famously Sharon Osborne&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:02:24.960" class="transcript_line"> He was a sink or swim kind of thing. There was a lot of money put into it. It was like a hype.</div><div id="00:02:32.480" class="transcript_line"> It was signed to EMI. There were hoardings in London all over the place on the tube.</div><div id="00:02:39.600" class="transcript_line"> There was Front Page of the NME. There was loads and loads of publicity being put out there as a</div><div id="00:02:45.760" class="transcript_line"> super group, which is a little bollocks really to be honest with you because we were never a super</div><div id="00:02:49.920" class="transcript_line"> group. He wanted to create a super group kind of band. I picked other band members from other</div><div id="00:02:56.320" class="transcript_line"> bands. Andy Bound from The Herd, Henry Spanetti on drums, Charlie Harrison who went on to be Poco</div><div id="00:03:03.280" class="transcript_line"> and a couple of other guys. One other guy, Julian Williams who became head of Sony.</div><div id="00:03:08.160" class="transcript_line"> Richard, you were around Newport in the early 70s I believe.</div><div id="00:03:11.920" class="transcript_line"> I left school in 16. I was 17 in 1970. I was living in Cardiff. It was really Cardiff that</div><div id="00:03:23.840" class="transcript_line"> I was familiar with during the 70s. The moon, the top rank, places like that. It wasn&#039;t until</div><div id="00:03:32.160" class="transcript_line"> well, I went to the Cardiff Art College in 1971. I spent a year there and then moved over to Newport</div><div id="00:03:40.320" class="transcript_line"> in 1972. So it was in 1972 that I arrived in Newport. You were there as well Alan in 1972?</div><div id="00:03:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was there. By then we&#039;d opened up the shop probably in Skinner Street.</div><div id="00:03:52.640" class="transcript_line"> What are you making of Newport then? It was pre-punk I guess you&#039;d call it, glam.</div><div id="00:04:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Where did the bands play? It was the time of Prog Rock wasn&#039;t it? I don&#039;t know about Newport</div><div id="00:04:04.880" class="transcript_line"> bands. I&#039;m trying to think of the bands that would have been around at that time. You know the bands</div><div id="00:04:08.640" class="transcript_line"> like Oswald Orange, some odd names. They became racing cars right? Yeah, yeah. Kensington was the</div><div id="00:04:17.360" class="transcript_line"> club at the time. Tell us a little bit about that Alan because this would have been like almost the</div><div id="00:04:21.120" class="transcript_line"> TJs of the early 70s in Newport I guess. It was the Rock Club in Newport wasn&#039;t it? Well you know</div><div id="00:04:26.400" class="transcript_line"> who ran that, it was Julian&#039;s father. Julian Blake&#039;s father yeah. Julian Blake&#039;s dad. Newport legend</div><div id="00:04:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Julian Blake. And his wife Marilyn ran the club and they were getting a guy called Alan Gardner</div><div id="00:04:41.280" class="transcript_line"> was managing it and a guy called Ricky King who was the DJ and they were bringing in lots of bands.</div><div id="00:04:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I mean well Amen Corner played there but you know people like Roxy Music, Dr John, Status Quo,</div><div id="00:04:57.600" class="transcript_line"> you know a lot of the touring bands at the time they were getting the pick of the crop really.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they had an agent in London who was helping them out with the bands.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And didn&#039;t that eventually burn down I think? Yeah I think the only idea I don&#039;t quite know exactly</div><div id="00:05:11.280" class="transcript_line"> what happened. I have no idea but it was a place to go you know for sure you know it was a fun</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> place and it was quite happening at the time. How about you Rich? Were you a gig goer? I know you were.</div><div id="00:05:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah well yes but it was more, the thing is we had the Students Union on Stow Hill.</div><div id="00:05:31.040" class="transcript_line"> When I was a student in Cardiff in the art college I&#039;d go to the gigs in the Students Union. I mean</div><div id="00:05:37.120" class="transcript_line"> one of the best things about becoming a student in Cardiff was the fact that I got a union card</div><div id="00:05:42.080" class="transcript_line"> that I can get into places you know so now I&#039;ve seen all the bands that you know it was difficult</div><div id="00:05:46.640" class="transcript_line"> to get into. But the Students Union on Stow Hill we had a hall out the back and it was there that</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> we used to have bands once a month and there&#039;d be the sort of discos and stuff like that and</div><div id="00:05:57.600" class="transcript_line"> occasionally we&#039;d go to the Kensington but we were pretty much in this sort of, we&#039;d stick to</div><div id="00:06:03.360" class="transcript_line"> the union and in fact we would go over to Cardiff more than we would anywhere else because Cardiff</div><div id="00:06:09.200" class="transcript_line"> had a pretty good music scene really you know. I&#039;d got to know Shaking Stevens while I was in</div><div id="00:06:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Art College and he used to play over the pageant rooms and his manager Legs Barrett,</div><div id="00:06:22.320" class="transcript_line"> I got to know him as well and Legs was managing a Newport band called Crazy Cavern and the Rhythm</div><div id="00:06:28.080" class="transcript_line"> Rockers and it was Crazy Cavern, I sort of, were the first band that I came across in Newport as a</div><div id="00:06:36.240" class="transcript_line"> sort of a Newport band and I mean they were, I think John Peel once said something like down</div><div id="00:06:41.680" class="transcript_line"> there in Newport they&#039;ve never heard of a rock and roll revival because it&#039;s never died and these</div><div id="00:06:46.640" class="transcript_line"> blokes were playing from the early, well they were playing in the 60s, I mean they were,</div><div id="00:06:50.800" class="transcript_line"> well they only stopped playing because Cavern sadly died and they were the first band,</div><div id="00:06:56.720" class="transcript_line"> Newport band that I went and see, in fact I went to see them in Corporation Road in the Corporation</div><div id="00:07:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Hotel, I remember going to see it and at the back of the hotel was a hall and they used to have these</div><div id="00:07:07.840" class="transcript_line"> country and western nights where everybody dressed up as cowboys and took guns along,</div><div id="00:07:12.160" class="transcript_line"> I think they were pretend ones. What year would this have been do you think?</div><div id="00:07:14.720" class="transcript_line"> At 72, 3 something like that, it was early, fairly early and they would, that&#039;s where I first saw</div><div id="00:07:21.840" class="transcript_line"> them, I saw them playing in there and then I saw them in various other places around Newport,</div><div id="00:07:27.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember all of the places but I got to follow them quite regularly because I like</div><div id="00:07:32.080" class="transcript_line"> rockabilly and rock and roll. Yeah they were legendary Newport bands, did you know them Al?</div><div id="00:07:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Well I remember, no when I go back before that to the days of the majestic which is back in the 60s</div><div id="00:07:44.160" class="transcript_line"> so that&#039;s another story you know and that was the place where you&#039;d see, I saw, do I see there,</div><div id="00:07:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Gene Vincent, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, you know all the Mersey Beats, all the Mersey bands,</div><div id="00:07:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Zoop Money, I mean it was a great scene I thought when I was growing up but I was</div><div id="00:08:02.800" class="transcript_line"> in my teens then you know it was a different story altogether. How did you get into music Alan</div><div id="00:08:07.520" class="transcript_line"> and Newport, what was the way in for you? Well I just, I was a big fan, I was going to shows</div><div id="00:08:14.080" class="transcript_line"> when I was probably about 12 or 13. It was the Majestic Ballroom, I would go back to Gene Vincent</div><div id="00:08:19.040" class="transcript_line"> in his leather suit and his one leg, you know the one leg with the leg behind him, he broke his leg</div><div id="00:08:25.680" class="transcript_line"> or he had a bad, he had a dummy leg you know that he broke in a car accident or something or a</div><div id="00:08:29.840" class="transcript_line"> motorbike crash or whatever it was and I remember him playing at the Majestic with, you know,</div><div id="00:08:34.720" class="transcript_line"> it was kind of iconic to see him, it was amazing to see him play there and it would have been</div><div id="00:08:42.480" class="transcript_line"> 65, what about 65? Oh yeah I was a teenager, I was, yeah yeah, I mean I was in, I was in</div><div id="00:08:50.240" class="transcript_line"> heaven, it was great, it was the best thing I&#039;ve ever seen I think. The roof, the roof, you know,</div><div id="00:08:56.160" class="transcript_line"> was blown off the place. That was the key to it all as far as I was concerned, that was when I was</div><div id="00:09:00.720" class="transcript_line"> growing up, that&#039;s formed a lot of my early knowledge of, you know, of music and got me</div><div id="00:09:06.160" class="transcript_line"> excited about it. I know nothing of the Majestic, where was it exactly? On Stowe Hill, right next to</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> the Penn and Lee, right at the bottom of Stowe Hill. When did it close in the 60s?</div><div id="00:09:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Probably late 60s I&#039;d say, early 70s, they had a Saturday morning club, you know, we could go,</div><div id="00:09:28.320" class="transcript_line"> the guy would be playing all the jive records and stuff, I mean it was really the place to go</div><div id="00:09:33.360" class="transcript_line"> back then, but that&#039;s where I saw my first bands, you know, when I was growing up and then I was</div><div id="00:09:38.320" class="transcript_line"> going to see package shows in Cardiff at the Capitol, saw The Beatles with Roy Orbison,</div><div id="00:09:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Jerry and the Pacemakers, saw The Stones with Ike and Tina Turner, saw, you know, just reading</div><div id="00:09:50.880" class="transcript_line"> and the Stax review, I mean it just went on and on, but I even remember The Allisons and sort of,</div><div id="00:09:57.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, really NAF bands that were actually touring, playing the Colston Hall, and I was</div><div id="00:10:02.560" class="transcript_line"> about 14, I think, or 15, so I mean and then the Majestic was like a regular event and it was</div><div id="00:10:09.360" class="transcript_line"> one of the, you know, it was very kind of either, you&#039;re either a teddy boy or a mod,</div><div id="00:10:12.880" class="transcript_line"> right, so there were quite often a few of argy bargies there, depending on which side of the room</div><div id="00:10:18.480" class="transcript_line"> you were on, it was a bit hairy, you know, but the girls were there, you know, they&#039;d like to dance,</div><div id="00:10:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I was quite good at driving at the time, I remember, but I saw some great bands and like,</div><div id="00:10:29.840" class="transcript_line"> then I joined a band, I saw, actually I saw Sounds Incorporated playing, they were like an</div><div id="00:10:35.040" class="transcript_line"> instrumental band really, with six piece, with horns, and I saw the guys playing the horns,</div><div id="00:10:40.080" class="transcript_line"> I thought from that time onwards I really wanted to play sax, so that&#039;s why I got a saxophone,</div><div id="00:10:44.880" class="transcript_line"> and it went on from there, and Andy used to come up from Cardiff to see the bands.</div><div id="00:10:49.200" class="transcript_line"> Had he fair weather low?</div><div id="00:10:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he used to come, I used to see him, and I was in a band called Five In Hand then,</div><div id="00:10:53.840" class="transcript_line"> and I was singing and playing a bit of sax, and Andy was always there, so I guess I got to meet him,</div><div id="00:11:00.160" class="transcript_line"> and it kind of went on from there, you know, but that&#039;s 60s, that&#039;s 60s, and then I promoted</div><div id="00:11:06.080" class="transcript_line"> stuff myself in the top rank back in 70s, but that was all, a lot of that was reggae,</div><div id="00:11:12.160" class="transcript_line"> I did a lot of reggae stuff, field pass, you know, third world.</div><div id="00:11:16.640" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;ve had a life in kind of music culture, really Alan?</div><div id="00:11:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I dipped in and out of it, you know.</div><div id="00:11:24.080" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve always seemed to have been in it, in music or fashion in some way, if not for promotion,</div><div id="00:11:29.360" class="transcript_line"> you know, promoting.</div><div id="00:11:30.320" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think of anything else that interests me really.</div><div id="00:11:32.400" class="transcript_line"> You just can&#039;t get a job.</div><div id="00:11:33.520" class="transcript_line"> No exactly, create your own work, you know, you know, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:39.920" class="transcript_line"> And Richard, I know we haven&#039;t mentioned this, but you&#039;ve kind of had a career in</div><div id="00:11:45.360" class="transcript_line"> tell me, tell me what you&#039;ve worked in.</div><div id="00:11:47.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve worked in housing and homelessness, and I was a psychiatric nurse, but the one thing</div><div id="00:11:53.520" class="transcript_line"> which I&#039;ve always done is having been to art college, I always believed that everybody</div><div id="00:11:59.120" class="transcript_line"> ought to go to art college, and that everybody had the potential of something within them,</div><div id="00:12:04.720" class="transcript_line"> and I believe that when I was running this homeless organisation, that all the homeless</div><div id="00:12:09.840" class="transcript_line"> people that we dealt with had something that they could do.</div><div id="00:12:11.040" class="transcript_line"> So I raised nearly two million pounds to build the first purpose-built art centre for homeless</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> people in Britain.</div><div id="00:12:19.040" class="transcript_line"> There were day centres in Britain, but this was a purpose-built art centre.</div><div id="00:12:24.640" class="transcript_line"> What year was this?</div><div id="00:12:26.640" class="transcript_line"> That would be, it was after the 70s, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:12:29.840" class="transcript_line"> It was later.</div><div id="00:12:31.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s okay, it&#039;s worth talking, it&#039;s certainly worth mentioning.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a recording studio in there, we had an art room, ceramics, pottery, we taught</div><div id="00:12:42.240" class="transcript_line"> people how to play music.</div><div id="00:12:44.240" class="transcript_line"> When was that, Rich?</div><div id="00:12:46.240" class="transcript_line"> It was on the corner of Dock Street and George Street, it&#039;s in the old Jessamyns building.</div><div id="00:12:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Prince Charles and his son opened it, William.</div><div id="00:12:52.240" class="transcript_line"> So it was opened when he finished university, so I don&#039;t know what year that was, but the</div><div id="00:12:58.960" class="transcript_line"> thing was it was, you know, and it was absolutely fantastic, and I think it was a great</div><div id="00:13:04.720" class="transcript_line"> experience, you know, and it was absolutely fantastic because there was nobody who couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:13:08.720" class="transcript_line"> do something.</div><div id="00:13:10.720" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I&#039;ve got two albums here which were produced by them, and I&#039;ve even got another</div><div id="00:13:15.520" class="transcript_line"> album over here which was all about the Chartists.</div><div id="00:13:19.520" class="transcript_line"> It was all about Alex&#039;s books, his stories.</div><div id="00:13:25.520" class="transcript_line"> So it was fantastic, but sadly it&#039;s closed now, and, you know, I think that people had</div><div id="00:13:31.600" class="transcript_line"> been, especially people who had been excluded from all sorts of things, to give them the</div><div id="00:13:37.360" class="transcript_line"> opportunity to express themselves some way, musically or artistically, gave them confidence</div><div id="00:13:43.520" class="transcript_line"> and it would, you know, move them along and help them get out of the situation they found</div><div id="00:13:48.800" class="transcript_line"> themselves in, but it doesn&#039;t happen these days.</div><div id="00:13:52.080" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a shame, God.</div><div id="00:13:53.520" class="transcript_line"> It is, really.</div><div id="00:13:54.640" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s there now?</div><div id="00:13:56.720" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything there now?</div><div id="00:13:57.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s accommodation.</div><div id="00:13:58.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s accommodation.</div><div id="00:14:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:14:02.320" class="transcript_line"> That must have been the 80s, was it?</div><div id="00:14:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Late 80s.</div><div id="00:14:06.320" class="transcript_line"> Late 80s, I&#039;d say.</div><div id="00:14:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Late 80s, because I was away.</div><div id="00:14:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:14:12.320" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;d have been around then, Alan, I would have pestered you to come over and do</div><div id="00:14:16.320" class="transcript_line"> something, you know, talk about something.</div><div id="00:14:18.320" class="transcript_line"> I would have loved to have done that.</div><div id="00:14:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh well.</div><div id="00:14:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Benji did come in once on one occasion because he was recording just up the road in that</div><div id="00:14:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Notting Hill studio.</div><div id="00:14:32.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember Benji when he was a teenager, toasting.</div><div id="00:14:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, and down Cardiff, down to Casablanca.</div><div id="00:14:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:42.320" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t said this yet, but obviously you opened Paradise Garage in Cardiff in the</div><div id="00:14:48.320" class="transcript_line"> late 70s, right?</div><div id="00:14:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:52.320" class="transcript_line"> That was kind of a punk shop.</div><div id="00:14:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Then you took it to LA.</div><div id="00:14:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was in Bristol first, you know.</div><div id="00:14:58.320" class="transcript_line"> It was in Bristol.</div><div id="00:15:00.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d invested in the shop in Clobber.</div><div id="00:15:02.320" class="transcript_line"> We grew the shops.</div><div id="00:15:04.320" class="transcript_line"> We eventually opened one in Skinner Street, which was the alternative to the one in</div><div id="00:15:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Road.</div><div id="00:15:12.320" class="transcript_line"> And then we opened a bigger shop down the road on the corner of Skinner Street and Dock</div><div id="00:15:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Street, opposite Arnold&#039;s Lighting Emporium, which is still there.</div><div id="00:15:20.320" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, it was quite a popular shop and we were selling all the latest sort of</div><div id="00:15:26.320" class="transcript_line"> clothes, you know, mostly men&#039;s wear.</div><div id="00:15:28.320" class="transcript_line"> So it was fairly straight kind of clothing, really, although it was kind of fashionable</div><div id="00:15:34.320" class="transcript_line"> at the time.</div><div id="00:15:36.320" class="transcript_line"> And so then the other little shop that is in the street became more the alternative shop</div><div id="00:15:42.320" class="transcript_line"> and I was kind of more responsible for buying stuff for that.</div><div id="00:15:44.320" class="transcript_line"> It was back and forth to London then.</div><div id="00:15:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Again, going back and forth.</div><div id="00:15:48.320" class="transcript_line"> My girlfriend had good contacts with Kensington Market.</div><div id="00:15:50.320" class="transcript_line"> I was buying a lot of stuff from there and stuff that people hadn&#039;t seen before in Newport.</div><div id="00:15:56.320" class="transcript_line"> So it became quite a trendy shop.</div><div id="00:15:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Where would people go?</div><div id="00:16:00.320" class="transcript_line"> What clubs or pubs?</div><div id="00:16:02.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:16:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, I think before, I&#039;m not sure what they were doing between 72 and 74, but in</div><div id="00:16:10.320" class="transcript_line"> 74 we opened Rudy&#039;s, which was the nightclub.</div><div id="00:16:12.320" class="transcript_line"> And that lasted for years because I used to go there in the 80s, you know.</div><div id="00:16:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, which became the place to go on a Friday or Saturday night.</div><div id="00:16:20.320" class="transcript_line"> It was kind of like a bit more at market sort of strict dress code, you know, but not posh.</div><div id="00:16:30.320" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t posh.</div><div id="00:16:32.320" class="transcript_line"> But it was a lovely place.</div><div id="00:16:34.320" class="transcript_line"> It had a nice decor and we had a dance floor and a good DJ.</div><div id="00:16:36.320" class="transcript_line"> It was quite a cool place to go.</div><div id="00:16:38.320" class="transcript_line"> It used to get absolutely ram-packed.</div><div id="00:16:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, it changed a lot because we were doing all the disco stuff then, you see.</div><div id="00:16:44.320" class="transcript_line"> So, and then everybody that was in, you know, a lot of customers from the shop would actually</div><div id="00:16:50.320" class="transcript_line"> go congregate and go to Rudy&#039;s.</div><div id="00:16:52.320" class="transcript_line"> It became the place to go.</div><div id="00:16:54.320" class="transcript_line"> So you had the fashion shop and the club too?</div><div id="00:16:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And then, and then clobber carried on and we opened up about three or four more shops.</div><div id="00:17:02.320" class="transcript_line"> So we had about six shops in the end.</div><div id="00:17:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And eventually I was back and forth to the King&#039;s Road every week practically, buying</div><div id="00:17:10.320" class="transcript_line"> stuff for Bristol because Bristol became more of my little baby.</div><div id="00:17:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So I was buying all the cool stuff that they wouldn&#039;t have sold in Newport and putting into the Bristol shop.</div><div id="00:17:20.320" class="transcript_line"> I was traveling up every week.</div><div id="00:17:22.320" class="transcript_line"> I was picking up bin liners of stuff all over the King&#039;s Road and up to Hackney and all over London really.</div><div id="00:17:30.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was fun. It was so much fun.</div><div id="00:17:32.320" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d come back, you know, we&#039;d put stuff on sale.</div><div id="00:17:35.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d sell the stuff on a Saturday and I&#039;d go back up again the following week.</div><div id="00:17:39.320" class="transcript_line"> It was back and forth all the time to London.</div><div id="00:17:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So I was really aware of the punk thing that was coming along the tunnel.</div><div id="00:17:45.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, nobody else could, you know, because I was there all the time.</div><div id="00:17:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:50.320" class="transcript_line"> What were you doing there?</div><div id="00:17:51.320" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, I was just going to switch over to ask Richard what he was doing.</div><div id="00:17:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, one of the things that had happened whilst I was in Cardiff, it does follow in, it follows on to Newport, was that</div><div id="00:18:06.320" class="transcript_line"> we got involved with showing a film about Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers.</div><div id="00:18:13.320" class="transcript_line"> And we took it one day down to the paddle steamer in Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:18:18.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was during the coal miners strike.</div><div id="00:18:21.320" class="transcript_line"> And halfway through the film where Stokely Carmichael was stirring everybody up, there was a power cut.</div><div id="00:18:28.320" class="transcript_line"> And we were the only white people in the room and the place was getting a bit, felt very hostile.</div><div id="00:18:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, somebody stood up with a torch and said this bloke&#039;s a bad man, really.</div><div id="00:18:39.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, the working class people should be standing together and all this sort of business.</div><div id="00:18:43.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so we became good friends and we used to go down there fairly regularly as a group of students.</div><div id="00:18:48.320" class="transcript_line"> But it was there that I was introduced to this thing called toasting.</div><div id="00:18:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never heard of it. I didn&#039;t know what it was.</div><div id="00:18:55.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, some people now would call it rapping.</div><div id="00:18:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, improv.</div><div id="00:19:00.320" class="transcript_line"> It was toasting then. They&#039;d have a sound system set up in the paddle steamer.</div><div id="00:19:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d have this music playing and then somebody would just jump up and do this sort of toasting.</div><div id="00:19:11.320" class="transcript_line"> And then we used to go down there regularly as students and we used to enjoy it.</div><div id="00:19:15.320" class="transcript_line"> But when I came to Newport, there was another one of these places at the Silver Sands, which was down in Pill,</div><div id="00:19:23.320" class="transcript_line"> which was very near to Bolt Street, which was part of the art college.</div><div id="00:19:28.320" class="transcript_line"> So this was one of the sort of local places that we were using regularly on a kind of it was I seem to remember it was a Saturday night.</div><div id="00:19:37.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a we go there on a Saturday and then we&#039;d go to the Hastings, which was on the other side of the road.</div><div id="00:19:42.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d wait until the police had raided it because it was generally a raid every week or so.</div><div id="00:19:49.320" class="transcript_line"> They take someone away, they get busted and then everybody collects and pay the fine.</div><div id="00:19:53.320" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, you&#039;d walk down these steps into the basement and it was thick with the smoke of cannabis.</div><div id="00:20:00.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you had a choice when you got down there. Don&#039;t buy any or just get stoned.</div><div id="00:20:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s mostly what our students did because we couldn&#039;t afford to buy it.</div><div id="00:20:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So it was a great place for us to go to get stoned for free.</div><div id="00:20:13.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where, you know, that&#039;s where I went with Woody, who became Joe Strummer.</div><div id="00:20:22.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was where we would used to go down there with a gang of us.</div><div id="00:20:25.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, much is much has been written and spoke about the myth of Woody, Joe Strummer and his Newport years.</div><div id="00:20:33.320" class="transcript_line"> You were the you were the man who shared a flat with him.</div><div id="00:20:37.320" class="transcript_line"> So you can opportunity for you to put the kind of record straight here.</div><div id="00:20:42.320" class="transcript_line"> How did you come to meet Joe and what was the how would you describe his time?</div><div id="00:20:48.320" class="transcript_line"> He came down to Newport. He came down at the same time as me, actually, in 1971.</div><div id="00:20:54.320" class="transcript_line"> He came down to Cardiff following a girl trying to pick up with who he&#039;d split up with.</div><div id="00:21:01.320" class="transcript_line"> And she wasn&#039;t having any of it. So he called in in Newport on his way.</div><div id="00:21:06.320" class="transcript_line"> This was about September when term started, stopped off at Newport on his way back to London</div><div id="00:21:12.320" class="transcript_line"> and called in on a friend of his who he&#039;d been in college with in London.</div><div id="00:21:17.320" class="transcript_line"> And he stayed with him in North Street in Baineswell for a little while.</div><div id="00:21:22.320" class="transcript_line"> And they went up to the students union and it was there that he saw, I think it was ripoff park playing in the in the hall at the back</div><div id="00:21:32.320" class="transcript_line"> and decided that he would stay and continue his kind of rock and roll journey.</div><div id="00:21:38.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, his parents, from what I remember him telling me now, had given him sort of a time off to find to find himself because he&#039;d been to private school.</div><div id="00:21:49.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, I mean, he wasn&#039;t a, you know, he&#039;d been to public school and they would be and they were giving him a bit of slack to to find his feet.</div><div id="00:21:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And he was determined to learn to play the guitar. And he wanted to become a star.</div><div id="00:22:02.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, even then he was determined and he was writing stuff and he did learn to play the guitar.</div><div id="00:22:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So what happened to you? Did you share a flat with each other? Is that true? And what was it like the young ones or something?</div><div id="00:22:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Entenville, yes, behind the railway station. It was it was I know it&#039;s a bit of a joke, but it was very much like the young ones.</div><div id="00:22:20.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a shithole place. It was falling apart.</div><div id="00:22:24.320" class="transcript_line"> We had the reel to reel tape recorder in there and he would use it a lot.</div><div id="00:22:31.320" class="transcript_line"> And one of the very first songs that he wrote, Crummy Bum Blues, he recorded, we recorded on it.</div><div id="00:22:38.320" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve still got that recording now. I only discovered it a few years ago and it was used in the film about Joe Strummer, which was made a few years ago.</div><div id="00:22:50.320" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s on the cassette or it&#039;s on a it is on the cassette now, Alan.</div><div id="00:22:56.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve digitalized it as well, but it&#039;s it&#039;s on the film as well.</div><div id="00:23:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t piece of historical archive there.</div><div id="00:23:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I see the art college. That&#039;s the other thing.</div><div id="00:23:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I think it was definitely the conduit for a lot of the alternative scene that I wasn&#039;t part of.</div><div id="00:23:14.320" class="transcript_line"> I was I was definitely on the straight, I think the straight and narrow.</div><div id="00:23:19.320" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t delving into any of that side of it.</div><div id="00:23:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So I think it&#039;s very creative time that the art college had a very good reputation anyway.</div><div id="00:23:27.320" class="transcript_line"> People travel for miles to be there.</div><div id="00:23:31.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, the thing is, in Newport Art College, the head of the painting section was a chap called Tom Rathmell and his wife Lillian.</div><div id="00:23:41.320" class="transcript_line"> And their daughter had married Ian Jury.</div><div id="00:23:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:23:45.320" class="transcript_line"> And they produced Baxter and Baxter&#039;s the one who&#039;s on the front cover of New Boots and Panties.</div><div id="00:23:52.320" class="transcript_line"> So Ian would come down.</div><div id="00:23:54.320" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s got his own career now.</div><div id="00:23:56.320" class="transcript_line"> So his grandparents ran the art college in Newport, is that right?</div><div id="00:24:02.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were head of they were head of fine art.</div><div id="00:24:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:24:07.320" class="transcript_line"> So they funny enough, they interviewed me to come to Newport Art College.</div><div id="00:24:12.320" class="transcript_line"> I had two interviews. I had an interview in Falmouth.</div><div id="00:24:15.320" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t get it.</div><div id="00:24:17.320" class="transcript_line"> And Newport was my second choice, but I was, you know, I was glad I did get it and they interviewed me.</div><div id="00:24:22.320" class="transcript_line"> And then every so often, Lillian, the daughter would come down and visit the family and Ian would would come down.</div><div id="00:24:31.320" class="transcript_line"> And of course, he wasn&#039;t a blockhead then.</div><div id="00:24:33.320" class="transcript_line"> He was just he was a lecturer in an art college.</div><div id="00:24:37.320" class="transcript_line"> They met in the Royal Academy.</div><div id="00:24:39.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, see, there&#039;s a history there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:24:43.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:44.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, was there a lot of music going on there as well?</div><div id="00:24:47.320" class="transcript_line"> The college, did they develop that music?</div><div id="00:24:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Well, one of the other things that happened while I was there was that I don&#039;t know if you can remember.</div><div id="00:24:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the Portsmouth Symphonia?</div><div id="00:24:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Is that the group who would get together, a collective of people who couldn&#039;t play the instruments and give them a day to learn it?</div><div id="00:25:06.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:25:07.320" class="transcript_line"> They turned up one day at the art college and asked if there was a group of us who wanted to learn to play a particular piece of music badly.</div><div id="00:25:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So I think about 10 or 12 of us got together and spent a whole day learning how not to play.</div><div id="00:25:21.320" class="transcript_line"> I had to put my finger on something and do that.</div><div id="00:25:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And at the end of it, we opened the curtains on the stage during the afternoon break and played it.</div><div id="00:25:30.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think we drove everybody out.</div><div id="00:25:32.320" class="transcript_line"> But the upshot was that they recorded an album at the Albert Hall that year and we were invited up to sing in the choir and we did the Hallelujah Chorus.</div><div id="00:25:42.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was on the old Grey Whistle test.</div><div id="00:25:47.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:25:50.320" class="transcript_line"> The art college, you know, there was lots of stuff going on in the art college musically.</div><div id="00:25:54.320" class="transcript_line"> The thing was it was very closed, you know, and it was the old union on Stowe Hill.</div><div id="00:26:00.320" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t get many. You had the Labour Club next door.</div><div id="00:26:02.320" class="transcript_line"> You had the Black Clawson&#039;s at the top of the hill.</div><div id="00:26:05.320" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of these working men clubs would have bands.</div><div id="00:26:09.320" class="transcript_line"> And we seemed to have infiltrated the working man&#039;s club because the booze was cheap.</div><div id="00:26:15.320" class="transcript_line"> And we would go to the Black Clawson&#039;s and they&#039;d have a band up there.</div><div id="00:26:19.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go to the Labour Club on Stowe Hill.</div><div id="00:26:21.320" class="transcript_line"> I think I saw Dr John in Labour Club.</div><div id="00:26:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Dr Feelgood, I think I saw on Stowe Hill as well.</div><div id="00:26:29.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, there were all sorts of these bands playing in the working man&#039;s clubs.</div><div id="00:26:33.320" class="transcript_line"> That was before the Stowe, right?</div><div id="00:26:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:37.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know much about the hit.</div><div id="00:26:38.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the Stowe was...</div><div id="00:26:40.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember the Stowe.</div><div id="00:26:42.320" class="transcript_line"> I never remember the Stowe not being there.</div><div id="00:26:44.320" class="transcript_line"> So when do you think that opened?</div><div id="00:26:46.320" class="transcript_line"> I know when it opened.</div><div id="00:26:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Alan, do you know when it opened?</div><div id="00:26:50.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know exactly.</div><div id="00:26:51.320" class="transcript_line"> It would have been the same time as Rudy&#039;s roundabout the same time, I think.</div><div id="00:26:55.320" class="transcript_line"> 72 or 73, was it?</div><div id="00:26:57.320" class="transcript_line"> No, it was a bit late.</div><div id="00:26:59.320" class="transcript_line"> It was, well...</div><div id="00:27:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, was it a disco tech that started putting on?</div><div id="00:27:04.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen the list on the...</div><div id="00:27:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had a look.</div><div id="00:27:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I was trying to find out the date that it opened.</div><div id="00:27:09.320" class="transcript_line"> When it opened, I looked on the internet and it appears that on the Anarchy in the UK, the Sex Pools tour,</div><div id="00:27:17.320" class="transcript_line"> they were about the first or second band to play there.</div><div id="00:27:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:27:23.320" class="transcript_line"> But I thought it was something else before that.</div><div id="00:27:28.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m kind of interested a bit in...</div><div id="00:27:30.320" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a club just down a bit from there called the...</div><div id="00:27:33.320" class="transcript_line"> What was that called, Alan?</div><div id="00:27:35.320" class="transcript_line"> Scamps, is it Scamps?</div><div id="00:27:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was there.</div><div id="00:27:39.320" class="transcript_line"> Scamps was there, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:40.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a strip club, right?</div><div id="00:27:42.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a strip club in the basement.</div><div id="00:27:43.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:27:45.320" class="transcript_line"> At the bottom of Stale Hill.</div><div id="00:27:47.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:27:49.320" class="transcript_line"> And then famously, and again, this is before my time, but the Alexandra opposite the Odeon.</div><div id="00:27:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, I used to go there.</div><div id="00:27:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Famous or infamous for having the police&#039;s first official gig, you know, Sting&#039;s.</div><div id="00:28:03.320" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:28:04.320" class="transcript_line"> They were cherry vanilla&#039;s backing band.</div><div id="00:28:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And part of the deal was that they would open and that was the first date on her tour.</div><div id="00:28:11.320" class="transcript_line"> So did you ever go to the Alex?</div><div id="00:28:13.320" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t known as a rock gig, as far as I can remember.</div><div id="00:28:16.320" class="transcript_line"> No, it was rough as hell.</div><div id="00:28:17.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t go there.</div><div id="00:28:18.320" class="transcript_line"> I did go there once.</div><div id="00:28:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I went there more than once.</div><div id="00:28:22.320" class="transcript_line"> After I left art college, I think it was about 75, I didn&#039;t know anybody really</div><div id="00:28:27.320" class="transcript_line"> because the students kept themselves themselves.</div><div id="00:28:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Everybody went home and I was left in Newport with nobody really.</div><div id="00:28:35.320" class="transcript_line"> And I inadvertently went to the King&#039;s Hotel one night and found myself in the gay,</div><div id="00:28:43.320" class="transcript_line"> the gay center of Newport and became quite friendly with them.</div><div id="00:28:47.320" class="transcript_line"> They had a great scene and they were going over to the discos in Bristol and loved it.</div><div id="00:28:52.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a great time.</div><div id="00:28:53.320" class="transcript_line"> But they used to go to the Alex a lot.</div><div id="00:28:57.320" class="transcript_line"> A lot. That club you&#039;ve just been talking about.</div><div id="00:29:00.320" class="transcript_line"> It was through that scene, which was quite big in Newport.</div><div id="00:29:05.320" class="transcript_line"> I was the sort of straight hanger on, just as I enjoyed going around there.</div><div id="00:29:11.320" class="transcript_line"> It was good laugh.</div><div id="00:29:12.320" class="transcript_line"> There was also a gay club underneath the Stowaway, wasn&#039;t it, called the Speakeasy.</div><div id="00:29:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:29:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:18.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where a lot of people used to go.</div><div id="00:29:20.320" class="transcript_line"> But there was a lot going on at the Stowaway.</div><div id="00:29:23.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember putting on some bands there on a Monday night with Mark Southall.</div><div id="00:29:30.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, Mark used to run Diverse and the place in Cross Street before it.</div><div id="00:29:35.320" class="transcript_line"> What year were you talking about?</div><div id="00:29:37.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m thinking 1973, 1974, 1975, somewhere around there.</div><div id="00:29:41.320" class="transcript_line"> He was a DJ at the time.</div><div id="00:29:43.320" class="transcript_line"> So we were playing a lot of funk.</div><div id="00:29:46.320" class="transcript_line"> There was another guy called David Bamford.</div><div id="00:29:50.320" class="transcript_line"> He was another specialist DJ, you know, and they were playing lots of American funk.</div><div id="00:29:54.320" class="transcript_line"> So we were doing a lot of that and I was bringing in funk bands.</div><div id="00:29:58.320" class="transcript_line"> High Tension, Gonzales.</div><div id="00:30:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember all the names, but it was quite a scene.</div><div id="00:30:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:05.320" class="transcript_line"> On a Monday night.</div><div id="00:30:07.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Sounds really exciting.</div><div id="00:30:09.320" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a Newport for its size, people say, has always kind of managed to have these kind of scenes, you know,</div><div id="00:30:18.320" class="transcript_line"> these kind of kind of cultural scenes.</div><div id="00:30:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Alice from Racing Cars used to...</div><div id="00:30:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Ray Innis.</div><div id="00:30:31.320" class="transcript_line"> Ray Innis would drink with us all in the Oddfellas in Baineswell.</div><div id="00:30:36.320" class="transcript_line"> We used to meet up in there and play darts.</div><div id="00:30:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, the thing is I&#039;d moved, I&#039;d left art college and I&#039;d bought a house in Baineswell in the mid 70s because Baineswell had been condemned.</div><div id="00:30:50.320" class="transcript_line"> It was going to be demolished.</div><div id="00:30:51.320" class="transcript_line"> The whole place.</div><div id="00:30:52.320" class="transcript_line"> The whole place.</div><div id="00:30:53.320" class="transcript_line"> They were going to build a road over the top and flats and shops and all sorts of stuff.</div><div id="00:30:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I bought a house in St. Mary Street for a thousand quid.</div><div id="00:31:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I think it was about 1977, 1976, something like that.</div><div id="00:31:06.320" class="transcript_line"> It was the Queen&#039;s Jubilee and got it for a thousand quid.</div><div id="00:31:11.320" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go over to the Stoway and I remember seeing Reckless Eric in there, Generation X, the Slips, Billy Idol.</div><div id="00:31:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t it the guy, wasn&#039;t it, what&#039;s his name, Walton was doing it?</div><div id="00:31:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think, yes.</div><div id="00:31:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Was the promoter, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:31:29.320" class="transcript_line"> I think he was.</div><div id="00:31:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Andy Walton.</div><div id="00:31:32.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I think in 1978, the Rizzillos came down.</div><div id="00:31:39.320" class="transcript_line"> They were another punk, sorry, they&#039;re not punk really, they&#039;re kind of new wavy, but they were an art college band.</div><div id="00:31:46.320" class="transcript_line"> There was lots of art college formed bands.</div><div id="00:31:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Rizzillos were one.</div><div id="00:31:50.320" class="transcript_line"> The Mekons were another one, of course, with John Langford from Newport who went to Leeds.</div><div id="00:31:56.320" class="transcript_line"> But the Rizzillos came and played in Newport and there was a band called Ralph and the Ponytails who were from Newport and they supported the Rizzillos.</div><div id="00:32:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And the Rizzillos liked them so much that they went on tour with them.</div><div id="00:32:11.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was through the tour, because the Rizzillos had played with the Mekons, that they met John Langford and John produced their first single.</div><div id="00:32:23.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s Ralph and the Ponytails.</div><div id="00:32:25.320" class="transcript_line"> James Bond.</div><div id="00:32:26.320" class="transcript_line"> James Bond, and of course, James Bond&#039;s on both sides of the single.</div><div id="00:32:31.320" class="transcript_line"> Inadvertently, they made a mistake.</div><div id="00:32:34.320" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got a copy of that, so it&#039;s probably priceless now.</div><div id="00:32:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:44.320" class="transcript_line"> One of the things I was hoping to kind of get out of you, if possible, because obviously Alan, you left Newport and went to Los Angeles, right?</div><div id="00:32:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, what happened with Clobber?</div><div id="00:32:56.320" class="transcript_line"> I got out of Clobber because we had six shops and I said to the guys, look, you know, I&#039;ve discovered this thing called Punk and they didn&#039;t know anything about this.</div><div id="00:33:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I was so surreptitiously developing my own business there and I said, look, I&#039;ll take the shop in Bristol if you take the others.</div><div id="00:33:13.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m happy just to have the one shop.</div><div id="00:33:15.320" class="transcript_line"> And they said, go ahead.</div><div id="00:33:16.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was in the Haymarket in Bristol.</div><div id="00:33:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I developed that thing that became really popular as Paradise Garage.</div><div id="00:33:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So then as the year went by, the second year, I decided to open one in Cardiff in St. Mary Street down the bottom there, which was fairly unfashionable and cheap.</div><div id="00:33:32.320" class="transcript_line"> The rent was cheap.</div><div id="00:33:34.320" class="transcript_line"> And that went well.</div><div id="00:33:36.320" class="transcript_line"> And we were getting a lot of bands and a lot of people from the valleys, kids buying their bondage jeans and all the stuff from Sex and London and all the stuff from Boy and the</div><div id="00:33:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Kings Road and it was just becoming quite a scene.</div><div id="00:33:50.320" class="transcript_line"> And there were a lot of little clubs that came off that, you know, that were very influential, I think, at the time.</div><div id="00:34:00.320" class="transcript_line"> And then Clive Taylor, who was the bass player with Amon Corner, was living in LA then by that time with his wife, Madeleine.</div><div id="00:34:09.320" class="transcript_line"> And they came over to visit his mum in Cardiff and they came in the shop and they said, wow, this is like this would go a storm in LA.</div><div id="00:34:16.320" class="transcript_line"> You must you must come over and have a look because there&#039;s so many musicians over there looking for something to wear.</div><div id="00:34:22.320" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no there&#039;s nobody selling it.</div><div id="00:34:24.320" class="transcript_line"> So you must come and have a look.</div><div id="00:34:26.320" class="transcript_line"> So I went over.</div><div id="00:34:27.320" class="transcript_line"> I went over with Kingsley from Rockfield and Ray Martinez, who was one of the guitar players they used on sessions there because they were promoting a new album and they wanted to get signed.</div><div id="00:34:38.320" class="transcript_line"> So they went we went away and then records over there, various other places.</div><div id="00:34:42.320" class="transcript_line"> And I stayed for a week.</div><div id="00:34:45.320" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t think much of it at the time, came back for about a few months and I said, this is this can&#039;t be right.</div><div id="00:34:54.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s going to be more to it than this.</div><div id="00:34:56.320" class="transcript_line"> So I went back again and I stayed this time with Clive and Madeleine and we showed me around.</div><div id="00:35:02.320" class="transcript_line"> I was blown away by it.</div><div id="00:35:03.320" class="transcript_line"> I was blown away by it.</div><div id="00:35:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And by that time, they showed me everything I needed to see really, you know, all the heritage, all the cars and Malibu beaches.</div><div id="00:35:12.320" class="transcript_line"> It was fabulous.</div><div id="00:35:13.320" class="transcript_line"> So we decided to open the shop when we opened in 1981.</div><div id="00:35:18.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was on Melrose Avenue, which was nothing at the time.</div><div id="00:35:21.320" class="transcript_line"> It was just a street full of furniture shops and second hand clothing and a couple of art varks, which was a famous record shop.</div><div id="00:35:31.320" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, we opened in 1981.</div><div id="00:35:33.320" class="transcript_line"> I spoke to Vivian Westwood.</div><div id="00:35:35.320" class="transcript_line"> I said, can we use the name Let It Rock?</div><div id="00:35:37.320" class="transcript_line"> And she was fine about that.</div><div id="00:35:39.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what I did.</div><div id="00:35:41.320" class="transcript_line"> And our first customer was the cars, a band called The Cars.</div><div id="00:35:44.320" class="transcript_line"> They were knocking on the door the night before we opened the shop.</div><div id="00:35:47.320" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to come in and see what we had.</div><div id="00:35:49.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was great.</div><div id="00:35:51.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was fabulous.</div><div id="00:35:52.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a great time.</div><div id="00:35:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:55.320" class="transcript_line"> And they went on from there.</div><div id="00:35:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:57.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s such a good story.</div><div id="00:35:58.320" class="transcript_line"> You then got into rock bands.</div><div id="00:35:59.320" class="transcript_line"> You managed the LA Guns, right?</div><div id="00:36:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, from 1985, 86.</div><div id="00:36:03.320" class="transcript_line"> And then there was the big air scene.</div><div id="00:36:04.320" class="transcript_line"> That was the Sunset Strip, you know, all the glam rock bands then with Guns N&#039; Roses and Poison and Raps and Warrens and Faster Pussycat and blah, blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="00:36:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:16.320" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a natural development really.</div><div id="00:36:17.320" class="transcript_line"> But what I found was the fashion and the music goes together, you see.</div><div id="00:36:21.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the whole point.</div><div id="00:36:22.320" class="transcript_line"> And it always has, you know.</div><div id="00:36:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, these days it&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:36:26.320" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, since 1989 when the Manchester scene came along with the Hacienda and the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays and all that ecstasy and the E-Culture, it got rid of all that fashion, just became baggy t-shirts and baggy jeans.</div><div id="00:36:41.320" class="transcript_line"> It screwed it all up completely.</div><div id="00:36:45.320" class="transcript_line"> I hate Manchester bands.</div><div id="00:36:47.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good turn.</div><div id="00:36:49.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I really do.</div><div id="00:36:52.320" class="transcript_line"> No, but anyway, no, but in the meantime, sorry, you know, during the 70s there was stuff going on, obviously, but it was punk.</div><div id="00:36:59.320" class="transcript_line"> It was, it was, they were funk, as you say, we were doing the funk stuff.</div><div id="00:37:02.320" class="transcript_line"> And then the punk, you know, they became sort of a lot of Bowie fans around at that time, late 70s.</div><div id="00:37:09.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you can&#039;t really underestimate the influence of Bowie.</div><div id="00:37:11.320" class="transcript_line"> No, absolutely.</div><div id="00:37:12.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were big followers.</div><div id="00:37:14.320" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you these people, we had Rudy&#039;s, which was a straight club and was very, like, very formal in lots of ways and very strict policy about letting people in and all that business.</div><div id="00:37:24.320" class="transcript_line"> But I decided to have a go at opening a night for punks.</div><div id="00:37:28.320" class="transcript_line"> This is right in the middle of it all, like, in 1977.</div><div id="00:37:31.320" class="transcript_line"> And of course there were these gangs of kids that were coming down from Mercer on the bus.</div><div id="00:37:36.320" class="transcript_line"> And amongst them was Chris Sullivan, who became very influential and opened the Wag Club in London.</div><div id="00:37:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Steve Strange, Steve Harrington from Blackwood, who was one of them was wearing, and they were all in like bin liners and with chains going through their noses, you know, bright yellow hair.</div><div id="00:37:51.320" class="transcript_line"> It was like, it was like something out of another planet, you know, people that were caught on to it.</div><div id="00:37:58.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were shocked by it.</div><div id="00:38:00.320" class="transcript_line"> They were really shocked by it.</div><div id="00:38:01.320" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of them came from the valleys, you know, down to Newport.</div><div id="00:38:07.320" class="transcript_line"> And that created that bit of a fashion scene.</div><div id="00:38:09.320" class="transcript_line"> And they used to go to Rudy&#039;s.</div><div id="00:38:12.320" class="transcript_line"> There was Baker&#039;s Row, which was in John Frost Square, which was another, which is, there was one in Cardiff, but this Baker&#039;s Row was opened up as a disco.</div><div id="00:38:21.320" class="transcript_line"> So they used to go there.</div><div id="00:38:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Newport, as long as I can remember, has always had sort of a reputation for kind of violence, or at least as a tough turn to put it.</div><div id="00:38:32.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a hard town.</div><div id="00:38:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Was it like that? Was it just worse then?</div><div id="00:38:38.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I think as these guys kept themselves themselves and they were team-handed, you know, so I don&#039;t think people, I think they just moved around.</div><div id="00:38:45.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember them getting into much trouble.</div><div id="00:38:48.320" class="transcript_line"> I just think that they were, they were a lot on them.</div><div id="00:38:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and pretty tough themselves, I would imagine.</div><div id="00:38:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were from, believe me, they were tough.</div><div id="00:38:58.320" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not tough to look at, but you know, they were, you wouldn&#039;t want to mess around with them at all.</div><div id="00:39:03.320" class="transcript_line"> But it was a lot of fun that.</div><div id="00:39:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Then Steve went up to live in London and opened the Blets Club and all that stuff.</div><div id="00:39:09.320" class="transcript_line"> What were you doing, Rich, around about the late 70s?</div><div id="00:39:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I said, 77 was really when the, that was the White Riot tour, when that happened in 77.</div><div id="00:39:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And Mick Foote was in a shared a studio in Newport Art College with Alan Jones.</div><div id="00:39:31.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, another Alan Jones. Good God.</div><div id="00:39:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Alan Jones, who went on to become the editor of Melody Maker and Uncut.</div><div id="00:39:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:39:38.320" class="transcript_line"> So those two shared a studio.</div><div id="00:39:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Now, what happened was that in Mick&#039;s third year, when he was writing his dissertation or tried to write his dissertation, he was writing on rock music.</div><div id="00:39:51.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, Woody, Joe Strummer, had left Pentonville, the flat, and had moved in in Clifford Crescent with Mick and his girlfriend.</div><div id="00:40:01.320" class="transcript_line"> And so in order to not pay rent, he wrote Mick&#039;s dissertation for him.</div><div id="00:40:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So Woody wrote Mick Foote&#039;s dissertation.</div><div id="00:40:12.320" class="transcript_line"> At the end of that term, Joe went back up to London and Mick went back up to London, and he became a squatter in 101 somewhere or other, and they formed the 101ers.</div><div id="00:40:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And Mick got kind of embroiled in it all and ended up being the sound man.</div><div id="00:40:29.320" class="transcript_line"> And so they were doing this UK tour now, the White Riot tour, and they were playing in the Union in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:40:38.320" class="transcript_line"> So I went over to see them and as I said, Mick was doing the sound and they, Joe had given me his ukulele.</div><div id="00:40:48.320" class="transcript_line"> He left his ukulele in Newport when he went back to London and he asked me to bring it over to Bristol, where they were playing the following day in the exhibition centre on the riverfront.</div><div id="00:41:01.320" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, I went over the next day, but luckily I forgot to take the ukulele.</div><div id="00:41:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And when he shouted at me during the soundcheck, where&#039;s my fucking guitar frame?</div><div id="00:41:11.320" class="transcript_line"> I forgot. He said, oh, you may as well keep it. It was bloody useless anyway, because there was no string on it.</div><div id="00:41:16.320" class="transcript_line"> So I got to keep it. But I stayed with him on a couple of the gigs and acted as the bloke who looked after the bouncers, which was an experience.</div><div id="00:41:26.320" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t mind kind of trying to draw some memories at you guys.</div><div id="00:41:34.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve spoken a bit about fashion and quite a lot about music.</div><div id="00:41:39.320" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember of kind of what it was like just to live at that time in Newport, you know, which is a working class town, steel town, I guess it was then kind of defined by Lam-Wurn.</div><div id="00:41:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Would you say that? Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:41:57.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, but, you know, I remember it&#039;s a thriving town.</div><div id="00:42:00.320" class="transcript_line"> It was, you know, the street was busy, commercial street was busy, you know, lots of shops, you know, a lot of activity, lots of pubs.</div><div id="00:42:09.320" class="transcript_line"> I kind of thought it was pretty cool. It was all right. I didn&#039;t have a problem.</div><div id="00:42:12.320" class="transcript_line"> No boarded up. No boarded up. No, no, not like now. No, no, no, not at all.</div><div id="00:42:18.320" class="transcript_line"> No, absolutely. I mean, my dad was involved with, you know, retail on the street.</div><div id="00:42:22.320" class="transcript_line"> He was in London House, which is a big department store there.</div><div id="00:42:26.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember that growing up when he was, you know, I used to go there and wrap presents at Christmas time for the punters, you know, but and then he had a drapery shop on commercial street called Phillips and Hamley.</div><div id="00:42:39.320" class="transcript_line"> I just remember it has been, yeah, a busy town, you know, good stuff.</div><div id="00:42:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Lots of nice people. I don&#039;t remember a lot of aggravation really, I have to say.</div><div id="00:42:52.320" class="transcript_line"> I never got bothered that much.</div><div id="00:42:55.320" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say, when I arrived, I had to spend my first few weeks down in Bolt Street.</div><div id="00:43:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d lived in Cardiff before anyways, and I&#039;d gone down Tiger Bay a lot as a student in foundation.</div><div id="00:43:12.320" class="transcript_line"> So there were a lot of similarities between pill and Tiger Bay. But the one thing that was noticeable down there that the whole place was being about to be demolished.</div><div id="00:43:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And there was this absolute sense of total misery and depression.</div><div id="00:43:29.320" class="transcript_line"> It was the saddest place that I&#039;d ever been to. There were people hanging around on street corners because the roads, the roads of houses have been boarded up.</div><div id="00:43:40.320" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d been shunted out by the council to sort of stay in temporary places up in Bettis and places like that.</div><div id="00:43:46.320" class="transcript_line"> And they just kept returning and there was gangs of people stood on street corners. And it was very sad, you know, they opened the pill advice centre and it was run by a bloke called Cliff Knight, who went on to write lots of books about pill.</div><div id="00:43:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And he was a wonderful man. And they used to go in there for solace more than anything else and he used to comfort them because it was such a massive upheaval.</div><div id="00:44:07.320" class="transcript_line"> So Newport was going through this big change really. They were trying to sweep aside the corn exchange. A lovely building was being demolished.</div><div id="00:44:16.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember it was opposite the King&#039;s Head Hotel and I just couldn&#039;t understand why they were demolished. It was this fantastic building with a lovely clock front.</div><div id="00:44:25.320" class="transcript_line"> So funny enough, I thought it was quite depressing actually at the time. You&#039;re right, the high street was thriving. There was a fantastic market. The market was great.</div><div id="00:44:38.320" class="transcript_line"> I used to have a stall upstairs in the market selling art and I had a badge making business and I would make all the badges by hand.</div><div id="00:44:49.320" class="transcript_line"> And I made all the badges for Tizwas when that started. I jokingly sent off a couple of badges for Spit the Dog and the next programme they were all wearing them.</div><div id="00:45:01.320" class="transcript_line"> I used to get orders in. In fact, I&#039;m wearing a badge now. In fact, this badge here is, I think Richard got one of these, it&#039;s for the photographs of Joe Stromer at the small cemetery.</div><div id="00:45:11.320" class="transcript_line"> But I made all the badges for the prizes for Tizwas and we had a lovely stall up there. It was a great sense of community. Every Saturday the upstairs was open. It was packed up there.</div><div id="00:45:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And the market at Crispa was wonderful. It was lovely.</div><div id="00:45:29.320" class="transcript_line"> In those days, before streaming and computers, you had cinemas, two channels on the TV.</div><div id="00:45:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Anything that you can think of? It doesn&#039;t really matter how off the wall it is that you might want to talk about.</div><div id="00:45:49.320" class="transcript_line"> What was the first IRA event at that time? Any kind of events?</div><div id="00:45:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, in London, the first IRA bombs were going off and I was working as a student up in London during the summer holidays.</div><div id="00:46:02.320" class="transcript_line"> And while I was working up there on one occasion, the bombs went off in the Tower of London. And on the day that I was working and I was drinking in an Irish bar in Piccadilly Circus at the time.</div><div id="00:46:13.320" class="transcript_line"> And they rounded up loads of people. But in the art college, we used to invite a speaker along every month to talk about various things.</div><div id="00:46:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And we ended up one month getting somebody from the IRA came and spoke about things. And it&#039;s a slight different perspective on their point of view.</div><div id="00:46:35.320" class="transcript_line"> And I actually became quite friendly with this. He was a young lad, nice young lad, who was their man in Newport.</div><div id="00:46:47.320" class="transcript_line"> And he used to hang around with our students. I mean, not quite sure what he was up to.</div><div id="00:46:53.320" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, you know, there&#039;s a big Irish population in Newport, of course, second generation, third generation, some of them.</div><div id="00:47:01.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, there was a lot of that. And of course, there was that bomb that went off in Newport in Gorey, which nobody was really sure whether it was just an accident that somebody had left the bomb in a case there and had to skedaddle or something.</div><div id="00:47:14.320" class="transcript_line"> And it went off. Could you accidentally leave a bomb? Well, a police may have turned up and he may have ran. Nobody really knows.</div><div id="00:47:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Bomber Charles Street, am I right? Yes. Opposite Lloyds Bank, just slightly over to the left of Lloyds of the bank.</div><div id="00:47:29.320" class="transcript_line"> It went off just before the pubs emptied. If it had gone off a little bit later, there would have probably been a hell of a lot of injuries.</div><div id="00:47:37.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think there was somebody who was found dead a few days later, if I remember, suspected bomber, but they could never connect the two.</div><div id="00:47:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the silver Jubilee in Newport, Alan? 1977.</div><div id="00:48:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah, go on. Yeah. In Baineswell, we had a carnival and we painted all the herbs, red, white and blue and we had pram races and it was a great carnival for Baineswell because that was in 77.</div><div id="00:48:16.320" class="transcript_line"> And when the carnival was on its knees, Baineswell had now been given a new lease of life.</div><div id="00:48:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Although I bought my house being told it was going to be demolished, they&#039;d given us the all clear after about a year saying, you know, we&#039;re not knocking them down after all now so you can stay there, which was fantastic, you know.</div><div id="00:48:35.320" class="transcript_line"> So it was just a big celebration, the Baineswell carnival.</div><div id="00:48:39.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure now if there would be street parties for a royal celebration, what do you think?</div><div id="00:48:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Probably not.</div><div id="00:48:46.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, times have changed.</div><div id="00:48:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Exactly. Yeah, yeah, indeed.</div><div id="00:48:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve remembered now how it was that Alan and I met. It was through Alexander Cordell, of course.</div><div id="00:49:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Alexander Cordell wrote Rape of the Fair Country in 1959 and Alan met him, I would have thought, during the 70s.</div><div id="00:49:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Hang on, let&#039;s think about this.</div><div id="00:49:15.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I got in touch with John Barnes.</div><div id="00:49:19.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:49:21.320" class="transcript_line"> About this, about this story and about what was happening with it, and I got a letter back from him that was in the late 60s.</div><div id="00:49:30.320" class="transcript_line"> When I was in London, I read the book and I was very, I was taken with it and I decided in grandiose idea that we should do a film.</div><div id="00:49:39.320" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about it now?</div><div id="00:49:41.320" class="transcript_line"> And I contacted John Barnes who lives in New Jersey, who had the rights to the books.</div><div id="00:49:48.320" class="transcript_line"> And that was the first time, but I never met Alex until 81 or 82 when my wife to be came over and she fell down the stairs and went home.</div><div id="00:50:03.320" class="transcript_line"> And we couldn&#039;t go back to the States so she spent the fortnight on her back, basically reading the book.</div><div id="00:50:09.320" class="transcript_line"> And we got it and we decided to go and get in touch with him and we went to stay with him and it was the Isle of Man.</div><div id="00:50:16.320" class="transcript_line"> We flew up to the Isle of Man to see him.</div><div id="00:50:18.320" class="transcript_line"> And I saw him again in Wrexham.</div><div id="00:50:21.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was then, that was early 80s.</div><div id="00:50:25.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because that when his book was published when when I came down to Wales in 66 I was told to read it by my history teacher and then of course, moving to Newport in 1972 was absolutely fantastic because you know here I was at the Westgate Hotel with Bullitt Halls.</div><div id="00:50:42.320" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:50:44.320" class="transcript_line"> But also I was very friendly with the band called Budgie. Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:50:49.320" class="transcript_line"> I used to do the road in for them.</div><div id="00:50:53.320" class="transcript_line"> And Ray, exactly Burke, and we went on one occasion I remember playing in Blenavon in some working man&#039;s club, which was opposite, not the pit the fine works.</div><div id="00:51:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I read the book.</div><div id="00:51:09.320" class="transcript_line"> I went over to the ironworks and of course it had to hadn&#039;t got old of it by then and it was just this derelict depressing sort of site and you could wander around it imagining the words I could hear this Alex&#039;s writing was so colorful as you know, you know, it was fantastic</div><div id="00:51:27.320" class="transcript_line"> to go and see and because we both got to know Alex well.</div><div id="00:51:32.320" class="transcript_line"> I know some people won&#039;t know who Alexander Cordell is so do you want to do a brief introduction about who Alexander Cordell is in the book itself. Alexander Cordell was a writer who wrote a book called Rape of the Fair Country which was published in 1959, and it tells the story</div><div id="00:51:48.320" class="transcript_line"> of a Welsh iron family who live in Blenavon, who get involved in Chartism, who marched down on that fateful night in 1839 to the battle that takes place outside the Westgate Hotel.</div><div id="00:52:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And it tells the story is the story of the family and the conditions in which they lived in and Alex felt very strongly about the working environment in which those working class people struggled to live during the 19th century and it&#039;s a fantastic story.</div><div id="00:52:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think it deserves a reissue at some point. It&#039;s been out of fashion for a while but it was always such a classic.</div><div id="00:52:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, true. And then he wrote like a trilogy, didn&#039;t he, of the three hosts of Rebecca and Sweden Bitter Earth, was it? Yeah, it&#039;s brilliant anyway, brilliant writer.</div><div id="00:52:54.320" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to Rockfield a lot in those days, in the 70s, 74 actually made a single in that, you know, and there was a lot going on there, which kind of put the area on the map, if you like.</div><div id="00:53:07.320" class="transcript_line"> It always adds a bit of history and a bit of a reputation for all the top bands playing there. Yeah, I guess it had to come to Newport.</div><div id="00:53:14.320" class="transcript_line"> I think they used to come into Newport for a drink and all that stuff. They always have actually, because Newport is the nearest place that you&#039;d probably pick.</div><div id="00:53:23.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well it&#039;s the nearest train station. Yeah, somebody told me once, David Bowie at Newport train station in the 80s. I think he&#039;s been, I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s true, he&#039;d been out to Rockfield because Iggy Pop was recording that day, you know.</div><div id="00:53:38.320" class="transcript_line"> And he was just on his own on the platform there. One of the things we haven&#039;t mentioned is, you know, obviously TJ&#039;s, but when, because Johnny, when he first started in Clarence Place, he had that cafe or restaurant called The Cedars.</div><div id="00:53:55.320" class="transcript_line"> That was his first, which he opened with his wife. And at some point, I can&#039;t remember, it was in the mid 70s, early 70s, he came up to the Students&#039; Union because he was looking to sort of develop and expand his kind of little empire down there in Clarence Place, because he acquired the building next door.</div><div id="00:54:14.320" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and what he was looking for was customers and who was, who was his customers going to be and he thought he was going to hijack the students from the Union. I remember him coming up there, I was social secretary.</div><div id="00:54:27.320" class="transcript_line"> And he, he wanted me, he wanted me to show him around. And so I showed him around and it was an absolute dump of a place. So he obviously, you know, was impressed and recreated the same sort of dump that we had up on Stonehill.</div><div id="00:54:41.320" class="transcript_line"> The Union, because they opened it.</div><div id="00:54:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Talking about dumps, a place we haven&#039;t mentioned yet is the Emlin Street Student Union, right? Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:54:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that came way after, that came after Stonehill.</div><div id="00:54:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they closed down on Stonehill and that one came next.</div><div id="00:55:02.320" class="transcript_line"> So Emlin Street was a Students&#039; Union which was by, where the Newport Centre is now, not far from the riverfront. And that was, they used to have bands there, but did you not?</div><div id="00:55:15.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;d left by then.</div><div id="00:55:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:55:18.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when I started going.</div><div id="00:55:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Just out of interest, when was, when did John start putting bands on in the TJs?</div><div id="00:55:29.320" class="transcript_line"> When was that?</div><div id="00:55:30.320" class="transcript_line"> I can tell you what I think, I mean, Richard might go back further than me, but I can remember, one of the things people misremember about TJs in my opinion, I&#039;m in my late 50s, one of the things people don&#039;t</div><div id="00:55:45.320" class="transcript_line"> misremember is basically, you know, if you&#039;re in a, like I was in, I was in bands, is that, is that TJs was quite, could be quite a scary place, you know, it&#039;s got this reputation</div><div id="00:55:58.320" class="transcript_line"> a proper reputation, deserved reputation for being a great rock and roll club, but actually back in the early 80s, it was quite, it could be quite scary, you know, quite frightening.</div><div id="00:56:09.320" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the sort of place that you could, you wouldn&#039;t want to go, you know, and you get some right characters in there, you know.</div><div id="00:56:16.320" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve seen some, I&#039;ve seen some really, I&#039;ve seen some bad violence in there which was quite, quite frightening in my time.</div><div id="00:56:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Richard, but John would always give you a chance to like, nobody, you know, you could be a band mate, nobody would give you a gig, nobody would pay you, you could take the John, or can we just set up and play,</div><div id="00:56:33.320" class="transcript_line"> mates will come, you know, we&#039;ll take 50p on the door and at least they&#039;re going to buy cans off you, you know.</div><div id="00:56:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was the kind of thing with TJs is that I think almost, almost by accident it became this great rock and roll venue, because other places in Newport wouldn&#039;t put these bands on, you know, because they were, these bands were quite, a lot of drugs.</div><div id="00:56:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Radical. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:56:59.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I remember seeing the Darling Buds in there in</div><div id="00:57:07.320" class="transcript_line"> 1889, I don&#039;t remember much from then, I don&#039;t know if Richard does.</div><div id="00:57:14.320" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;d be about right. It might be a good idea to ask Simon when they, when he first started, he used to put on a lot of the gigs, because I can&#039;t be, I can&#039;t remember, I know we used to go there when I just left art college.</div><div id="00:57:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Simon was putting gigs on other places, he was putting gigs on Stoweville Labour Club, and he was putting them on in Pille, in the Irish Club. He wasn&#039;t always, you know, TJs wasn&#039;t the first.</div><div id="00:57:39.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I mean about people misremembering.</div><div id="00:57:42.320" class="transcript_line"> It became this great place, but actually, people tried to go anywhere but TJs at the beginning.</div><div id="00:57:51.320" class="transcript_line"> Fair enough.</div><div id="00:57:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Fair enough.</div><div id="00:57:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Secoes as we call it, TJs.</div><div id="00:57:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Secoes, yeah.</div><div id="00:57:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because Simon put on the, what was called the Party in the Park, and that was, with the Damned. Yeah, that was a fundraising event for us, for our homelessness organisation.</div><div id="00:58:11.320" class="transcript_line"> I did it with him and John, so Cola, and we had the Damned there and Selecta, and it was Skin Dread&#039;s first gig.</div><div id="00:58:21.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when they played the band.</div><div id="00:58:23.320" class="transcript_line"> But it was great meeting the Damned, because obviously, you know, they were the ones who came out with the first punk single, really.</div><div id="00:58:32.320" class="transcript_line"> So it was great having them here.</div><div id="00:58:38.320" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve got any kind of thoughts on how Newport has kind of maybe changed from those early days, the early 70s, then where&#039;s it going, do you think?</div><div id="00:58:46.320" class="transcript_line"> I just think the soul&#039;s been taken out of it, you know, by business, the economy has screwed it up.</div><div id="00:58:53.320" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve put enough money into redeveloping...</div><div id="00:58:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Local politicians?</div><div id="00:58:59.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, probably the council. I don&#039;t know much, I don&#039;t follow it very much.</div><div id="00:59:03.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m constantly disappointed about the way the town is being treated, and it seems there&#039;s been a lot of mismanagement around the place.</div><div id="00:59:14.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m not so despondent, actually.</div><div id="00:59:17.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m the other way.</div><div id="00:59:19.320" class="transcript_line"> I think the High Street, now, I mean, we know that the chap who runs the...</div><div id="00:59:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the Antiques place in Panarth Road, and also the Tram Shed in Cardiff has now redeveloped Newport Market.</div><div id="00:59:35.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s been turned into a sort of food venue offices and all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:59:39.320" class="transcript_line"> The High Street and the market arcade up the top, you know, there&#039;s a lot of money gone into that.</div><div id="00:59:45.320" class="transcript_line"> New shops and things like that are going to be open soon. So that top end of town, you&#039;ve got to start somewhere.</div><div id="00:59:52.320" class="transcript_line"> No, the top end of town. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree. But commercial street, commercial street, the main street, you know.</div><div id="01:00:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was kind of thinking about, I was a child in the 70s, and I remember it being extremely busy and those double-decker buses going through before they paved it over, you know.</div><div id="01:00:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, Newport didn&#039;t get shortlisted to the City of Culture, but I think what it&#039;s done, it&#039;s given it a kind of a, I wouldn&#039;t say a bit of a boost, really, because in order to submit that application, they had to do a joint bid between the other local authorities in Southeast Wales.</div><div id="01:00:29.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think now what they&#039;re going to do is join up together to say, we&#039;ve got a great product down here in Southeast Wales, you know, come and visit us.</div><div id="01:00:38.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think they&#039;re going to work together better, hopefully, so that they will be able to win that on the next time around.</div><div id="01:00:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Work together better, is that your phrase?</div><div id="01:00:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I hope they will, you know, I just hope they will.</div><div id="01:00:56.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pleased there&#039;s some, you know, progress being made. I didn&#039;t know, I wasn&#039;t aware of all that stuff. I&#039;m kind of...</div><div id="01:01:02.320" class="transcript_line"> A sad thing is the demise of a decent local newspaper.</div><div id="01:01:06.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:01:07.320" class="transcript_line"> You know, back in the early 70s, you had a music correspondent, you had a police reporter, you had a reporter for practically everything you could possibly think of. It was a decent sized newspaper.</div><div id="01:01:20.320" class="transcript_line"> And now you&#039;ve got about two or three reporters who cover everything, who never leave the office, who don&#039;t go out and speak to people, who don&#039;t get to know the people, don&#039;t feel the pulse of what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="01:01:35.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve lost a good newspaper. It&#039;s really... and we&#039;ve seen that over the last few decades, certainly since I&#039;ve been here, I&#039;ve noticed that.</div><div id="01:01:46.320" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s got to be the internet, right? People are not buying newspapers like they did.</div><div id="01:01:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Very sad.</div></div></p>
