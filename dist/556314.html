    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m with Brigitte and we&#039;re going to talk about your memories of the Siempris disaster,</div><div id="00:00:11.800" class="transcript_line"> the oil spill and what were your first memories of, how did it first affect you?</div><div id="00:00:17.140" class="transcript_line"> How did it first affect me? What I remember is seeing the news about it the night when the</div><div id="00:00:33.300" class="transcript_line"> storm or something happened and that boat that ran aground and then I had a call from some friends</div><div id="00:00:42.580" class="transcript_line"> in France who said to me, oh we&#039;ve just seen a program about the tanker in Pembrokeshire and</div><div id="00:00:49.700" class="transcript_line"> etc and we&#039;re so sorry to hear that and I was saying well nothing&#039;s happened yet but on the</div><div id="00:00:57.740" class="transcript_line"> French news they had a lot more information than we did and that was my first memory.</div><div id="00:01:07.140" class="transcript_line"> What were you doing at the time in Temby? What was I doing with my life you mean? Well we were</div><div id="00:01:14.220" class="transcript_line"> living in Havertz so it was quite a busy household. James was working in the hotel and I was working</div><div id="00:01:26.860" class="transcript_line"> as a French teacher at the time and kids were little, we were on the beach all the time with</div><div id="00:01:40.700" class="transcript_line"> them and it was really quite scary to watch it happen and think but surely you know can&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:55.980" class="transcript_line"> they do this or why don&#039;t they do that? You know everybody had that way that humans have which is</div><div id="00:02:05.620" class="transcript_line"> to deny what we&#039;re seeing with our own eyes or blame or think there must be a better solution</div><div id="00:02:18.660" class="transcript_line"> and it was it was really quite hectic, didn&#039;t know what to think. So you just walked down to</div><div id="00:02:28.980" class="transcript_line"> the beach? And so it took I don&#039;t remember exactly how long it took, the oil didn&#039;t arrive in Temby</div><div id="00:02:38.140" class="transcript_line"> straight away, maybe took a couple of days or something and the morning it arrived in Temby,</div><div id="00:02:51.220" class="transcript_line"> yeah we walked down to the seafront and just looked at this crowds of people all ages,</div><div id="00:03:05.020" class="transcript_line"> you know everybody was there and people were crying, that was the main thing we could see,</div><div id="00:03:14.980" class="transcript_line"> people were had tears rolling down their faces, old men, teenagers, children, you know everyone</div><div id="00:03:26.140" class="transcript_line"> was just so horrified and grieving, there was a shock and it was horrible,</div><div id="00:03:38.700" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never experienced grief at that scale, I&#039;ve never been such a you know a whole population and</div><div id="00:03:56.660" class="transcript_line"> even those who weren&#039;t there you could feel the whole county was in shock and at the time I was,</div><div id="00:04:10.620" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if I started studying counseling but certainly maybe I was 96, yes I had and</div><div id="00:04:23.100" class="transcript_line"> obviously just feeling that grief and feeling the natural kind of response to grief which is to</div><div id="00:04:35.460" class="transcript_line"> gather up and talk with people and comfort each other and you know all of that, so in the same</div><div id="00:04:49.660" class="transcript_line"> way as if somebody had died, it felt like a natural thing to want to be together and not</div><div id="00:05:06.020" class="transcript_line"> just together in our houses but together by the sea because it felt that there were all these</div><div id="00:05:16.060" class="transcript_line"> animals that had died, millions of things big and small and birds and shells and you know</div><div id="00:05:27.300" class="transcript_line"> it was very strong, strong that feeling that there had been a massive death of creatures</div><div id="00:05:45.260" class="transcript_line"> and obviously for us humans the consequences of that that we understood or didn&#039;t understand</div><div id="00:05:56.340" class="transcript_line"> or knew about or didn&#039;t know about but we could feel the impact and so yeah I went home and took</div><div id="00:06:09.340" class="transcript_line"> my you know it was before computers, before we had computers in our own homes, before we had mobile</div><div id="00:06:17.180" class="transcript_line"> phones so I just took my diary and my phone book and just ran every single number that was on there</div><div id="00:06:30.420" class="transcript_line"> and told people if they wanted to meet up on Castle Hill, maybe a couple of nights from then,</div><div id="00:06:43.100" class="transcript_line"> I was in the fun all day just and then people saying I can&#039;t come but you know I&#039;ll light a</div><div id="00:06:57.060" class="transcript_line"> candle or light a fire in the garden or and so it happened here but I was away, it was also happening</div><div id="00:07:06.580" class="transcript_line"> in other places and then that&#039;s what happened. So how many people came? I don&#039;t know, there was</div><div id="00:07:18.340" class="transcript_line"> quite a lot of, hundreds, probably something like that, wow, a lot of people and we&#039;re just</div><div id="00:07:30.380" class="transcript_line"> looking at the sea. Was it quiet? Yeah it was it was quiet and it was yeah it was quiet and it was</div><div id="00:07:40.020" class="transcript_line"> quite sombre and it&#039;s like you could feel something quite powerful really and then I remember feeling</div><div id="00:08:00.700" class="transcript_line"> a bit not so happy at one moment because the local of VÃ©ca kind of took three paroles, decided to say something</div><div id="00:08:24.460" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t remember what he said but suddenly there was a sort of religious something which</div><div id="00:08:38.100" class="transcript_line"> I felt wasn&#039;t very sensitive because it went way beyond anything human and I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:08:55.100" class="transcript_line"> I thought it was a bit of and at the same time I can see the temptation you know you gather people,</div><div id="00:09:02.100" class="transcript_line"> you need a speaker and there wasn&#039;t one and so he did that and I&#039;m sure for a lot of people it</div><div id="00:09:10.500" class="transcript_line"> was the right thing to do. I find at times like that you have to be sensitive to the language</div><div id="00:09:21.420" class="transcript_line"> that you use so that people don&#039;t feel excluded but then we&#039;re all very used to things like that</div><div id="00:09:33.100" class="transcript_line"> happen so people who wanted to listen and people who didn&#039;t just moved along a little bit and it</div><div id="00:09:41.140" class="transcript_line"> was fine there were lots of kids, lots of families. How long did it last? Maybe an hour,</div><div id="00:09:56.300" class="transcript_line"> something like that. We were there for quite you know quite a few hours obviously we were</div><div id="00:10:08.660" class="transcript_line"> there beforehand and then stayed on talking with lots of people. I met Kara Wilson whom I had not</div><div id="00:10:19.900" class="transcript_line"> met before and we got talking and then ended up doing this event in the Queen&#039;s Hall together</div><div id="00:10:29.140" class="transcript_line"> with also Beatrice from Manabeel Castle. She was involved in our little group and Emma was I think</div><div id="00:10:43.860" class="transcript_line"> Kara&#039;s sister-in-law. Yeah just four of us. We got a little bit of funding, invited these people</div><div id="00:11:00.820" class="transcript_line"> to come and do these workshops and took part in that. Tell me a bit about the people that came</div><div id="00:11:07.180" class="transcript_line"> who did the workshops? There were young people I&#039;ve just reread the you know the posters and</div><div id="00:11:18.220" class="transcript_line"> the bits of paper that I kept from then and it&#039;s better explained on there than but I just remember</div><div id="00:11:25.260" class="transcript_line"> that they were part of a sort of international youth sustainable ecology kind of green group</div><div id="00:11:35.380" class="transcript_line"> and they were touring Europe with display boards and information and they were running workshops</div><div id="00:11:48.500" class="transcript_line"> in schools and community halls and on issues of ecology and so we got them to come to Pembrokeshire.</div><div id="00:12:01.820" class="transcript_line"> They were here for maybe four or five days and contacted lots of schools, primary schools,</div><div id="00:12:09.300" class="transcript_line"> quite a few answered and were keen and so they hosted them and the group delivered sort of art,</div><div id="00:12:22.100" class="transcript_line"> drama workshops. I remember one I think it&#039;s the one they did in 10B because I think one of my</div><div id="00:12:33.020" class="transcript_line"> nieces was in the class where they did it and it was something where they were pretending to make</div><div id="00:12:44.340" class="transcript_line"> the noise of the rain in a rainforest so they started maybe getting them to tap lightly on the</div><div id="00:12:52.220" class="transcript_line"> desk with their finger and then a bit harder and a bit harder and yeah I remember my niece coming</div><div id="00:12:57.980" class="transcript_line"> home and telling me about that so you know they would have done things like that. Did they talk</div><div id="00:13:05.500" class="transcript_line"> about the Sea Empress? Did they relate it directly to it? Well it all happened around the same time</div><div id="00:13:14.780" class="transcript_line"> and I suppose people were connecting it in their mind. I don&#039;t know they weren&#039;t here to</div><div id="00:13:30.140" class="transcript_line"> to make any decisions or any comment about this particular. They were talking in general I think</div><div id="00:13:42.940" class="transcript_line"> about pollution and about yeah all those issues. I don&#039;t know I don&#039;t think they were focusing</div><div id="00:13:59.260" class="transcript_line"> only on the sea. I suppose if it was that fresh they wouldn&#039;t have needed to make the connections.</div><div id="00:14:05.900" class="transcript_line"> No I think everybody including children were very aware around that time that we were going</div><div id="00:14:13.140" class="transcript_line"> through an ecological disaster so everything that had to do with the world and etc they were very</div><div id="00:14:20.100" class="transcript_line"> aware that their world had taken a beating and I think we&#039;re very sensitive to anything that was</div><div id="00:14:32.140" class="transcript_line"> helping them to maybe stay positive and maybe think of the future with a feeling that they</div><div id="00:14:42.980" class="transcript_line"> could do something to enable the planet to survive all these things. I think it was done</div><div id="00:14:53.100" class="transcript_line"> in very much in a future orientated and giving people giving children particularly a sense of</div><div id="00:15:05.220" class="transcript_line"> optimism that we didn&#039;t just have to suffer things like that. We could make gestures and</div><div id="00:15:16.260" class="transcript_line"> decisions and that would lead things in a better direction. That was the idea.</div><div id="00:15:29.220" class="transcript_line"> So and the Queen&#039;s Hall is that&#039;s where you had your? That&#039;s where we did the main we had a</div><div id="00:15:40.820" class="transcript_line"> workshop in the daytime and then there was a gig in the evening and an exhibition and a competition,</div><div id="00:15:53.540" class="transcript_line"> a recycling competition and we had Dennis Curry who came to be our judge and at the time the</div><div id="00:16:13.740" class="transcript_line"> people from the gallery in Arbuth who gave a prize you know it was all very low key but</div><div id="00:16:20.740" class="transcript_line"> the exhibition was called Pollution? Yes, yeah. That run obviously for a longer over a longer</div><div id="00:16:34.860" class="transcript_line"> period a few weeks or something I think and went with that group set we went to different</div><div id="00:16:51.580" class="transcript_line"> places including one day they set up outside I don&#039;t remember what the shop was called at the</div><div id="00:17:00.700" class="transcript_line"> time but one of the supermarket brands in the one that&#039;s in Pembroke Dock next to the library</div><div id="00:17:12.380" class="transcript_line"> and they went and asked the manager if they could set up their little display thing outside the shop.</div><div id="00:17:20.140" class="transcript_line"> Manager was quite happy with that so we spent a few hours there giving leaflets to people and</div><div id="00:17:27.820" class="transcript_line"> etc and I remember obviously they were challenging people&#039;s and it&#039;s interesting</div><div id="00:17:39.980" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;re looking at 20 years ago and of course then people we were all still using plastic</div><div id="00:17:47.580" class="transcript_line"> bags left right and center and and I remember one of them had kind of maybe pushed the boat</div><div id="00:17:59.340" class="transcript_line"> a little bit too much with the people at the till in the shop he got told off I think anyway</div><div id="00:18:09.180" class="transcript_line"> because it was the time when at the till people had access to all these plastic bags</div><div id="00:18:18.140" class="transcript_line"> they were just coming out of the you know people went counting we were just using using using and</div><div id="00:18:26.860" class="transcript_line"> and it was the time when you couldn&#039;t buy anything from like if you bought some cheddar</div><div id="00:18:34.940" class="transcript_line"> they would put that in a see-through plastic bag and then put it in the carrier bag yeah and so</div><div id="00:18:41.660" class="transcript_line"> those young people from set had gone to buy a few things and and had you know stopped the queue and</div><div id="00:18:50.460" class="transcript_line"> and kind of made this big spill that they didn&#039;t want their vegetable or their cheese or etc to be</div><div id="00:18:58.220" class="transcript_line"> put in separate plastic bag in style the plastic bag and people at the till who were saying that</div><div id="00:19:04.940" class="transcript_line"> it was their instruction and they had to do it and so that you know there was a bit of a</div><div id="00:19:10.300" class="transcript_line"> faffle about that but yes that was 20 years ago and a lot of the people around were looking at these</div><div id="00:19:20.540" class="transcript_line"> young young people looking a bit scruffy</div><div id="00:19:27.980" class="transcript_line"> speaking with foreign accents all of them making a fuss about plastic bags and look now yeah</div><div id="00:19:38.300" class="transcript_line"> last progress very slow progress but and look how proud people have been that</div><div id="00:19:45.260" class="transcript_line"> you know that Wales has stopped using plastic bags way before England started it you know and people</div><div id="00:19:55.100" class="transcript_line"> are proud of that so yeah it is interesting to see how and I guess at the time the whole idea with</div><div id="00:20:05.340" class="transcript_line"> this project set was sowing seeds you know just putting ideas out for people to sort of</div><div id="00:20:18.220" class="transcript_line"> look at and maybe challenge or or take on board or</div><div id="00:20:27.500" class="transcript_line"> it must have been quite powerful for kids because they like we said that they they had experience</div><div id="00:20:34.700" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s a real event to link it to I want because now it&#039;s just it just seems so removed doesn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:20:47.660" class="transcript_line"> to what we we experience we&#039;re we&#039;re supposed to be aware but when it&#039;s actually on your doorstep</div><div id="00:20:55.820" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s the whole thing and it&#039;s it&#039;s always been like that and</div><div id="00:21:00.700" class="transcript_line"> you know it&#039;s the the power of the connection that we are able to make or to filter out and</div><div id="00:21:11.020" class="transcript_line"> you know before the seampress and since the seampress there&#039;s been</div><div id="00:21:16.860" class="transcript_line"> huge catastrophes and if you&#039;re connected with you know you might be living in Wales but maybe your</div><div id="00:21:26.060" class="transcript_line"> you know you might be living in Wales but maybe your</div><div id="00:21:31.100" class="transcript_line"> children or best friends or whatever live on the coast of some other countries somewhere else and</div><div id="00:21:41.260" class="transcript_line"> and you hear of a catastrophe like that there and you&#039;re going to feel it a lot more</div><div id="00:21:47.980" class="transcript_line"> than if you don&#039;t know anybody who lives there and then it&#039;s a news item and then it&#039;s you know</div><div id="00:21:55.260" class="transcript_line"> a bad thing and you you kind of you&#039;ll have some level of feelings about it some level of</div><div id="00:22:03.260" class="transcript_line"> thinking about it but unless you&#039;re you&#039;ve been there you&#039;re connected with the land itself or</div><div id="00:22:12.860" class="transcript_line"> you know people there it&#039;s not going to mean the same thing to you and I think that&#039;s just the</div><div id="00:22:19.100" class="transcript_line"> only way we have to cope with the level of information that gives us</div><div id="00:22:29.580" class="transcript_line"> information at the level of the planet it&#039;s it&#039;s a bit too big for most of us I think to really</div><div id="00:22:39.420" class="transcript_line"> take every single thing that happens with the same level of empathy we&#039;ll go mad</div><div id="00:22:44.620" class="transcript_line"> yeah we&#039;ll go mad if we did that and the the exhibition was in june is that right</div><div id="00:22:52.620" class="transcript_line"> I think I saw that on there maybe I can&#039;t quite remember yes in june so all the oil would have</div><div id="00:23:06.860" class="transcript_line"> gone by then or yeah not visible to the eye it wasn&#039;t visible anymore because you know that</div><div id="00:23:15.580" class="transcript_line"> obviously it&#039;s a touristic place and they tried very hard to make the beaches usable by easter</div><div id="00:23:29.020" class="transcript_line"> and were you really amazed at that did you think it was going to just never get back to normal again</div><div id="00:23:36.860" class="transcript_line"> um no we didn&#039;t think it would never get back to normal we knew it would even but we didn&#039;t know</div><div id="00:23:47.660" class="transcript_line"> how long obviously the sort of easter seemed not long enough for sure but then the biggest problem</div><div id="00:23:59.100" class="transcript_line"> was the difference between what you can see and what you can&#039;t see and although the beaches were</div><div id="00:24:07.260" class="transcript_line"> clean you couldn&#039;t see any oil um none of us I&#039;m saying none of us a lot of people didn&#039;t feel</div><div id="00:24:21.420" class="transcript_line"> confident we didn&#039;t go down the beach in pembrokeshire at all we didn&#039;t step on the sand</div><div id="00:24:27.500" class="transcript_line"> really I was gonna ask you about that because I&#039;m quite interested in that fact to sort of</div><div id="00:24:34.540" class="transcript_line"> get an angle on when local people started going back down to the beaches or when you&#039;d go in the</div><div id="00:24:40.700" class="transcript_line"> sea even yeah so you didn&#039;t go down for the whole summer no did you go to other beaches or yeah</div><div id="00:24:48.860" class="transcript_line"> yeah</div><div id="00:24:52.140" class="transcript_line"> but not really you know it wasn&#039;t a it wasn&#039;t a beach summer for we just did other things and</div><div id="00:25:01.660" class="transcript_line"> but um didn&#039;t feel confident I mean my kids were five and seven yeah you know</div><div id="00:25:12.860" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t really want to put them in a</div><div id="00:25:19.020" class="transcript_line"> in a situation that I didn&#039;t know enough to you know I didn&#039;t understand it I don&#039;t know how</div><div id="00:25:25.980" class="transcript_line"> long it takes to break down I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s made you know I had nothing really so I just</div><div id="00:25:33.580" class="transcript_line"> respond to situations with um caution well exactly yeah exactly and were you aware of um any kind of</div><div id="00:25:46.780" class="transcript_line"> health reaction no um but I remember where we lived um there were lots of trees all around the</div><div id="00:25:57.900" class="transcript_line"> house and we had a lot a lot of rook rooks at the front of the house and the back of the house which</div><div id="00:26:07.740" class="transcript_line"> was more towards the sea we had always lots of seagulls flying by and etc you know it was</div><div id="00:26:14.220" class="transcript_line"> rooks and seagulls you&#039;d hear them all day all night well not all night but almost um they</div><div id="00:26:21.820" class="transcript_line"> the soundscape was very familiar of you know these big birds really lots of them</div><div id="00:26:30.540" class="transcript_line"> and they all they all disappeared they&#039;re you know all the birds um you didn&#039;t see any bird</div><div id="00:26:39.340" class="transcript_line"> flying anyway they all went inland um for quite a while because also they were spraying um</div><div id="00:26:51.900" class="transcript_line"> some detergent or something or other um so there was quite a lot of that around as well as the</div><div id="00:27:00.300" class="transcript_line"> fumes and so yeah birds didn&#039;t didn&#039;t stick out the seagulls they were nowhere to be seen for ages</div><div id="00:27:08.380" class="transcript_line"> and um and even the rooks they they went in the forest and they came back but not for a while</div><div id="00:27:18.620" class="transcript_line"> and that was very obvious suddenly it was quite eerie because it was silent</div><div id="00:27:27.020" class="transcript_line"> there was a real hush you know that</div><div id="00:27:32.220" class="transcript_line"> even you know things like as a population of people there was that</div><div id="00:27:39.820" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s hushing down that happens when people are in shock or when people are</div><div id="00:27:49.180" class="transcript_line"> upset or</div><div id="00:27:52.540" class="transcript_line"> yeah and there were you know kind of patches of oil that people were careful to you know like all</div><div id="00:28:04.940" class="transcript_line"> the teams that were down on the beach cleaning and cleaning oh my god you know</div><div id="00:28:11.180" class="transcript_line"> no idea if it was right for people to be down there doing that like that but they did you know</div><div id="00:28:17.900" class="transcript_line"> people did i don&#039;t know what impact that had or would have or um and they were just in you know</div><div id="00:28:30.300" class="transcript_line"> wellies and and just cleaning</div><div id="00:28:36.140" class="transcript_line"> you know gathering buckets and big it was a massive undertaking from a lot of people who gave a lot of</div><div id="00:28:46.940" class="transcript_line"> time and effort and took a lot of risks um yeah and people were careful not to drag all that back</div><div id="00:28:54.700" class="transcript_line"> into the streets but still you could see you could see oil here and then</div><div id="00:29:06.620" class="transcript_line"> and when you did your video did you have any press coverage of it</div><div id="00:29:10.860" class="transcript_line"> do you i had a call from a radio station i can&#039;t remember what</div><div id="00:29:17.260" class="transcript_line"> what</div><div id="00:29:20.060" class="transcript_line"> welsh radio bbc ways could have been sudden some</div><div id="00:29:26.460" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah they ran me in the afternoon</div><div id="00:29:32.140" class="transcript_line"> and</div><div id="00:29:36.380" class="transcript_line"> and that was it really so they weren&#039;t aware of their presence during it no no i don&#039;t think they</div><div id="00:29:42.620" class="transcript_line"> were around and there were some photos in the paper</div><div id="00:29:53.900" class="transcript_line"> i think the vigil there was only that one photo of emily and the amphibian in the paper and that was</div><div id="00:30:03.260" class="transcript_line"> uh</div><div id="00:30:06.220" class="transcript_line"> and i can&#039;t remember his name right now and his best one of any best friend&#039;s dad who took the</div><div id="00:30:12.940" class="transcript_line"> photo who works as a photographer for the local paper</div><div id="00:30:22.540" class="transcript_line"> i think there was as well as um a real kind of</div><div id="00:30:28.220" class="transcript_line"> um</div><div id="00:30:32.540" class="transcript_line"> sense of gratitude that we all felt towards each other for whoever turned up felt for everybody</div><div id="00:30:42.860" class="transcript_line"> else who turned up you know yeah there was a sense of comfort um but there was also</div><div id="00:30:52.460" class="transcript_line"> so inevitably when everything goes well people are divided so there is no reason we should be</div><div id="00:31:02.380" class="transcript_line"> different yeah when things don&#039;t go well and so there were divisions that&#039;s you know showed</div><div id="00:31:11.580" class="transcript_line"> at those times um and i think maybe some people thought it was too</div><div id="00:31:18.780" class="transcript_line"> to uh you know it had to do with emotions and yeah it didn&#039;t sit that well with some people</div><div id="00:31:26.460" class="transcript_line"> i imagine who didn&#039;t come then i imagine and that was fine it is interesting because i&#039;ve spoken to</div><div id="00:31:31.900" class="transcript_line"> quite a lot of people and the the difference of opinions and i can imagine that some people might</div><div id="00:31:40.620" class="transcript_line"> find they wouldn&#039;t want anything um negative you know it&#039;s all about oh we&#039;ve got to be positive</div><div id="00:31:47.500" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got to get it all clean and get all our tourists back here and kind of shove it under</div><div id="00:31:52.700" class="transcript_line"> the carpet in a way yes not shove it under the carpet but just like get rid of the evidence and</div><div id="00:32:00.700" class="transcript_line"> and not have time for that yes sort of what might seem sentimental and yeah yeah after all they</div><div id="00:32:08.940" class="transcript_line"> might say there were no human deaths but it&#039;s not about that was it well no um</div><div id="00:32:20.780" class="transcript_line"> no it it wasn&#039;t about human death and that was what was so</div><div id="00:32:27.100" class="transcript_line"> you know a lot of people have experienced grief from having lost a person</div><div id="00:32:40.940" class="transcript_line"> but this was a grief about environment it was</div><div id="00:32:47.020" class="transcript_line"> identical in the sense of</div><div id="00:32:49.980" class="transcript_line"> identical in the sense of</div><div id="00:32:54.780" class="transcript_line"> um shock and loss and the stages of grief and you know it was identical</div><div id="00:33:04.860" class="transcript_line"> and it was about all the creatures that have died like some people might feel or have felt you know</div><div id="00:33:15.100" class="transcript_line"> uh when we had all the curls that had to happen with the foot and mouth thing and yeah yeah all</div><div id="00:33:24.140" class="transcript_line"> of that you know and and the badger curl and you know all of that it it affects you when</div><div id="00:33:34.140" class="transcript_line"> when you look at a massive amount of creatures who end up dying at the same time you know whether</div><div id="00:33:42.380" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s people or animals it&#039;s it has the power to move us in the same way</div><div id="00:33:58.460" class="transcript_line"> in the same way of course it&#039;s not the same but</div><div id="00:34:00.940" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s in a way that is still very deep and</div><div id="00:34:11.340" class="transcript_line"> but it questions humanity doesn&#039;t it questions why we need to be doing these things</div><div id="00:34:17.020" class="transcript_line"> and and you know it gives people um markers like before the sea empress after the sea empress</div><div id="00:34:26.940" class="transcript_line"> where were you and the sea empress you know it&#039;s those those things they they</div><div id="00:34:34.220" class="transcript_line"> suddenly they kind of put that date on the calendar and and there was the world before</div><div id="00:34:41.020" class="transcript_line"> and the world after and and that also is similar to grief yeah about other things because the</div><div id="00:34:49.260" class="transcript_line"> people are still really emotional about it now when we talk about it yeah a huge impact on</div><div id="00:34:57.100" class="transcript_line"> people&#039;s lives it was that complete uh experience of what you hear about without really realizing</div><div id="00:35:14.220" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like before you have children and then you have children and then you understand and it was</div><div id="00:35:23.100" class="transcript_line"> that same thing suddenly we understood what it made what it meant well what everybody had been</div><div id="00:35:32.460" class="transcript_line"> on about we understood it and what it means to lose something really precious and what it meant</div><div id="00:35:38.380" class="transcript_line"> to have taken something so precious for granted that there was a real sense of</div><div id="00:35:45.980" class="transcript_line"> people were talking a lot about that about that having taken</div><div id="00:35:56.860" class="transcript_line"> things for granted</div><div id="00:35:57.820" class="transcript_line"> it our environment for granted not really ever conceiving that it could be taken away</div><div id="00:36:11.820" class="transcript_line"> and for us it was taken away and it was given back</div><div id="00:36:17.900" class="transcript_line"> um</div><div id="00:36:20.860" class="transcript_line"> i saw this program about joanna joanna lamley in japan and she goes to fukushima</div><div id="00:36:31.020" class="transcript_line"> and goes through the village that people left there and then thinking oh they&#039;ll be back in a</div><div id="00:36:40.860" class="transcript_line"> few days you know once the water kind of recedes and and they&#039;ve never been back</div><div id="00:36:48.380" class="transcript_line"> that was taken away and that&#039;s not given back</div><div id="00:36:57.980" class="transcript_line"> yeah for us we yeah based on the environment looked as if nothing had happened</div><div id="00:37:11.020" class="transcript_line"> which was really weird i can imagine that would be really strange it was and and we didn&#039;t trust it</div><div id="00:37:21.100" class="transcript_line"> a lot of people didn&#039;t trust it a lot of people did and but we&#039;ve never really um and i suppose unless you are</div><div id="00:37:31.500" class="transcript_line"> a marine biologist and you&#039;re involved in doing that research</div><div id="00:37:45.420" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very hard to get information that you are going to trust these days you know and there</div><div id="00:37:53.900" class="transcript_line"> then and still now</div><div id="00:37:58.140" class="transcript_line"> if you heard one person it was like this if you heard another person it was like that</div><div id="00:38:05.100" class="transcript_line"> difficult to find out more than what we are being fed at that time it was a complete unknown</div><div id="00:38:14.460" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it because it hadn&#039;t really happened i mean for a lot of people for a lot of</div><div id="00:38:20.620" class="transcript_line"> biologists and scientists it was something that they just didn&#039;t know what was going to happen</div><div id="00:38:27.100" class="transcript_line"> well it had happened in other places but obviously but for people like the the</div><div id="00:38:35.740" class="transcript_line"> oriolton research center the the rock pools i don&#039;t think anyone knew how it would ever recover what</div><div id="00:38:43.500" class="transcript_line"> what the consequence consequences would be but and of course it was</div><div id="00:38:51.580" class="transcript_line"> although people in situations like that already had access to internet and but</div><div id="00:39:03.260" class="transcript_line"> not everything was on internet like it is now so now if something like that happens you can find</div><div id="00:39:10.380" class="transcript_line"> information at an individual level you know people will just say oh but then it&#039;ll be all right i&#039;ve</div><div id="00:39:18.620" class="transcript_line"> looked it up but yeah exactly um but certainly then people couldn&#039;t even do that people just had to</div><div id="00:39:29.580" class="transcript_line"> gather information from what was in the paper or on the radio or on tv or or if you knew somebody</div><div id="00:39:37.180" class="transcript_line"> who worked more closely with this that and the other and i remember i don&#039;t know how it happened</div><div id="00:39:47.740" class="transcript_line"> i was somewhere</div><div id="00:39:51.020" class="transcript_line"> um i might have been in um because i was teaching in bloomfield at the time</div><div id="00:39:58.940" class="transcript_line"> at the time i don&#039;t know where i met these people three um americans three men who</div><div id="00:40:12.380" class="transcript_line"> were they just flown from america</div><div id="00:40:18.060" class="transcript_line"> to offer</div><div id="00:40:20.060" class="transcript_line"> um to offer the rescue operation um some kind of are they called booms oh yeah the booms booms</div><div id="00:40:36.140" class="transcript_line"> um they had a system to do with that made from straw or something</div><div id="00:40:45.020" class="transcript_line"> or something</div><div id="00:40:48.700" class="transcript_line"> which they could um use to stop to stop the oil going you know people were actually</div><div id="00:40:59.820" class="transcript_line"> flying in coming in from different parts of the world who had already dealt with situations like</div><div id="00:41:07.260" class="transcript_line"> that in other places had products for sale and skills for sale you know and who were coming and</div><div id="00:41:17.340" class="transcript_line"> offering their services and um i remember i introduced them to friends of the earth we were</div><div id="00:41:27.180" class="transcript_line"> they turned up at one of the meetings and it was just a bit chaotic because you know</div><div id="00:41:37.340" class="transcript_line"> as often there was the sort of</div><div id="00:41:43.420" class="transcript_line"> official county council type of way of doing things and then there were groups like friends of the earth</div><div id="00:41:53.180" class="transcript_line"> who had different ideas</div><div id="00:41:59.420" class="transcript_line"> it certainly was a time when people gathered up for all sorts of reasons the vigil was</div><div id="00:42:06.940" class="transcript_line"> gathering up for reasons of sharing common emotions as opposed to experiencing them on your own</div><div id="00:42:19.740" class="transcript_line"> and then they were people who gathered up to look at other aspects of that same situation</div><div id="00:42:29.340" class="transcript_line"> and one of the things that came out of the sea empress disaster was that people became a lot</div><div id="00:42:38.060" class="transcript_line"> more engaged in wanting to know wanting to do something and at the time the the anti they had</div><div id="00:42:52.700" class="transcript_line"> been already an anti ore emulsion</div><div id="00:42:58.860" class="transcript_line"> faction that had already worked hard at</div><div id="00:43:05.260" class="transcript_line"> trying to get the population to fight against ore emulsion</div><div id="00:43:13.900" class="transcript_line"> and i don&#039;t know what would have happened if the sea empress disaster hadn&#039;t happened</div><div id="00:43:22.220" class="transcript_line"> maybe ore emulsion would have happened as it is after the sea empress</div><div id="00:43:34.460" class="transcript_line"> the sort of group that was fighting against ore emulsion coming into pembrokeshire</div><div id="00:43:42.700" class="transcript_line"> and then</div><div id="00:43:45.660" class="transcript_line"> took on a lot more importance and strength and there was a real campaign then that was well</div><div id="00:43:55.820" class="transcript_line"> manned and organized and womaned and organized and was successfully</div><div id="00:44:02.860" class="transcript_line"> stopped ore emulsion being shipped in to</div><div id="00:44:16.220" class="transcript_line"> because that was another really scary thing that was happening at the time and so</div><div id="00:44:23.740" class="transcript_line"> you know we were just experiencing this oil slick knowing that we were under threat to have</div><div id="00:44:35.660" class="transcript_line"> something much more dangerous in terms of human lives then yeah because it had an explosive</div><div id="00:44:47.020" class="transcript_line"> aspect to it well didn&#039;t it so that</div><div id="00:44:54.780" class="transcript_line"> it puts</div><div id="00:44:58.620" class="transcript_line"> you know a lot of communities at risk because the cloud of you know if there was to be a spill of</div><div id="00:45:06.700" class="transcript_line"> ore emulsion my understanding anyway at the time was that the cloud of</div><div id="00:45:14.380" class="transcript_line"> fumes could travel quite far inland and explode</div><div id="00:45:22.300" class="transcript_line"> so you know we were yeah it was a very scary time to to be seeing what was going on with</div><div id="00:45:32.780" class="transcript_line"> an oil spill knowing that unless we did something we were</div><div id="00:45:39.180" class="transcript_line"> we were going to be at risk of something even more yeah so it&#039;s a a warning it was a warning</div><div id="00:45:49.500" class="transcript_line"> but it was also really scary to to think that maybe we wouldn&#039;t be strong enough to oppose it and</div><div id="00:46:00.060" class="transcript_line"> and then we were you know it&#039;s one thing before thinking oh yeah it might happen and yeah we</div><div id="00:46:09.020" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t want it and it&#039;s a bad thing and etc but not really taking on quite how scary it was how bad it was</div><div id="00:46:24.060" class="transcript_line"> so at the time it meant</div><div id="00:46:27.820" class="transcript_line"> it meant um yeah like a double</div><div id="00:46:31.180" class="transcript_line"> it served one you know it helped people to achieve that and to have a stronger voice i imagine and a</div><div id="00:46:41.580" class="transcript_line"> a bigger perspective isn&#039;t it yeah yeah</div><div id="00:46:50.060" class="transcript_line"> so just one last thing do does it ever come up in conversation then has it been you know previous to</div><div id="00:46:58.060" class="transcript_line"> to this um not for a long time not for a long time</div><div id="00:47:11.420" class="transcript_line"> accidentally</div><div id="00:47:18.860" class="transcript_line"> yes so i don&#039;t know um</div><div id="00:47:20.780" class="transcript_line"> um yeah i hadn&#039;t um thought about it much for a while and then came across that photograph</div><div id="00:47:36.620" class="transcript_line"> oh it was in the paper that&#039;s right the photo of emily and the amphibian was in the paper the 10b</div><div id="00:47:44.940" class="transcript_line"> time you know that thing where they look back on okay so this was recently yeah yeah not that long</div><div id="00:47:52.780" class="transcript_line"> ago and so when he put that up in her kitchen and then so suddenly there it was and um we realized</div><div id="00:48:01.500" class="transcript_line"> it had been a while that we hadn&#039;t thought of that time or um i had um</div><div id="00:48:12.300" class="transcript_line"> a nice surprise at christmas um sort of christmas drinks</div><div id="00:48:22.140" class="transcript_line"> um with the the team that i the sort of wider team that i work with in herford west and emma who</div><div id="00:48:32.300" class="transcript_line"> and emma who had been part of our little group that set up this um this project</div><div id="00:48:42.860" class="transcript_line"> i hadn&#039;t seen emma for years and there she was she&#039;s a speech therapist so we work for the same</div><div id="00:48:48.940" class="transcript_line"> inclusion team and that was nice to see each other um and when we do we know that</div><div id="00:49:00.620" class="transcript_line"> that that is the basis of our connection and that&#039;s quite a strong you know you go through</div><div id="00:49:07.900" class="transcript_line"> things like that with people and um and it yeah i haven&#039;t seen cara for a few years but um</div><div id="00:49:20.220" class="transcript_line"> our friendship is linked to that that time when we met under those circumstances</div><div id="00:49:26.060" class="transcript_line"> circumstances and that was before abby asked you if you would oh yeah yeah yeah so and did you feel</div><div id="00:49:33.580" class="transcript_line"> like you didn&#039;t maybe didn&#039;t want to or you&#039;re a bit like i don&#039;t no i i um i was quite taken by the</div><div id="00:49:44.220" class="transcript_line"> idea of your project you know the uh sort of looking back and seeing how things</div><div id="00:49:53.980" class="transcript_line"> have been remembered um in fact i was talking with um somebody saying you know</div><div id="00:50:06.700" class="transcript_line"> how what&#039;s the life expectancy of sea creatures you know i know whales would remember something</div><div id="00:50:16.700" class="transcript_line"> that happened 20 years before and dolphins would and and then uh kai said to me lobsters</div><div id="00:50:28.940" class="transcript_line"> live for many many years so they would have a memory of it because you know most of the</div><div id="00:50:35.980" class="transcript_line"> creatures who were affected by that or a lot i don&#039;t think they last for very long</div><div id="00:50:43.980" class="transcript_line"> no it&#039;s funny to be able to tell their story when we when we had our walk and talk uh thing</div><div id="00:50:49.740" class="transcript_line"> that abby organized the other day there were some limpets that did look quite old so i did try an</div><div id="00:50:56.860" class="transcript_line"> interview yeah yeah but you know some of them because they can last many years so</div><div id="00:51:04.300" class="transcript_line"> we you know we were thinking were they around when it happened because obviously a lot of them died</div><div id="00:51:08.860" class="transcript_line"> but then that&#039;s right and i don&#039;t you know i don&#039;t know i don&#039;t know um you hear about</div><div id="00:51:16.540" class="transcript_line"> whale songs and etc i don&#039;t know how a story gets told or transmitted</div><div id="00:51:26.220" class="transcript_line"> under the sea but it made me think of that when when abby told me about the project</div><div id="00:51:32.060" class="transcript_line"> concept isn&#039;t it i can tell my story of what happened 20 years ago and i was at an age where</div><div id="00:51:40.140" class="transcript_line"> i can remember it my children and he could just about remember some things but not that much she</div><div id="00:51:47.580" class="transcript_line"> was only five emily when i mentioned it to her she said oh yeah you know two years older and already</div><div id="00:51:54.860" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re a lot more you have access to memories but yeah i thought it was interesting because</div><div id="00:52:04.380" class="transcript_line"> immediately triggered memories for me and and immediately made me think you know as humans we</div><div id="00:52:15.100" class="transcript_line"> we keep our memories we we tell them we sing them we write them we paint them we do all sorts of</div><div id="00:52:22.780" class="transcript_line"> things we store them and we pass them on as sea creatures i don&#039;t know or birds i don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:52:33.420" class="transcript_line"> what birds tell each other you know there&#039;s probably some skeptics out there that deny</div><div id="00:52:39.420" class="transcript_line"> you deny it happened or something do you remember that time when we all flew we had to fly inland</div><div id="00:52:48.540" class="transcript_line"> but
