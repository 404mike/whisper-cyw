They don&#039;t call it Evans, they called it Levens.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And in my youth they always called it Evans.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was, let me sit down over here.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, perhaps I will.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousins, Evans&#039; cousins were called Evans.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I named my son Evan, well, I don&#039;t know why Evan he is.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, my grandfather, his wife&#039;s name was Susan.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And he cut out a piece of land, cleared a piece of land and put up a house.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to go to church in their bare feet.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Until they came to a certain rock below the greenhouse.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course one of the first things they did was put up a meeting house.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And when they came to that rock they carried their shoes.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They put their shoes on there, went barefoot, saved the shoes.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they took them off and they went back to the rock and walked home with their bare feet.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What denomination would they have been?</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was Methodist. Methodist as it was years ago.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t a Methodist church there because there still is a Methodist church there but they don&#039;t use it.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Methodists I guess were or became the predominant denomination in Wales, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to have sing songs and use a tuning fork.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know my uncles by marriage learned how to sing from the tuning fork.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry, maybe you said or did you say roughly how many colonists there were?</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but I can name you some of the families.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Saunders and Richards and Evans. There were two different tribes of Evans.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There were the Redbens and the Blackbens. Mine were the Blackbens.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was, oh let me think, Williams and Thomases and Griffiths I think I had in there.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Griffiths are two of the Mary Poppett sisters. Your next generation.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> There are quite a few other Welsh names around the Fredericton area.

No sir.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, there&#039;s a few of them still. There was a Billy Ray that used to live there.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think he was an English boy that came from one of those immigrant kids, you know, and he married one.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Could be.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were several families of Griffiths up there.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, do you have any idea what... well obviously they came from Cardigan&#039;s here in Wales, presumably, or they wouldn&#039;t have given that name to this place that they found it.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s where they came from. And they named their little rocky country after Cardigan.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So there must be rocks in Cardigan in Wales.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, did you say that you thought there were still a few homes there? The place wasn&#039;t completely abandoned?</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, some of them I know because I think some of Uncle David Evans&#039;s family there.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And Uncle David Evans belonged to the Red Evans&#039;s and he married Papa&#039;s aunt.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how he came to be, Uncle David.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And, oh, there was a lot of them out in Woodland and I do know some of their names but I&#039;ve forgotten them.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> See, they spread.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And Woodland, Evans and Sir Woodland, Welsh people as well.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And, oh, it never was, it never got to be a very big place, you know.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But they seemed to be contented there.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But the Baptist Church, while it&#039;s still there, or was last time I was there, has been, they haven&#039;t used it for a long while.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad&#039;s cousin had it all painted and re-shingled in the lake outside and fixed it up the best he could.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But I went in and opened my name in there one day.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> People are visitors of visiting the book, you know.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it&#039;s been a few years since you were there.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, for a long time ago.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I was married but it&#039;s a long time ago, just the same.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And the graveyard had all these old names.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, we were in there looking at some of the names of the people that were relatives of ours.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how it came to be, into the Baptist Church, for some of our people were Baptist.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But after the Baptist Church died down, it was the Mennedists that took over, you see.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody went to the Mennedists Church.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it your mother or your grandmother you were saying was still, your grandmother still spoke Welsh, didn&#039;t you say?</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And your mother knew some words?</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Grandmother only had, she had spoken Welsh when she was young.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> She told me she had forgotten it all but one or two words.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And she just told me what they were and I don&#039;t know if I could say them right or not.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Weirs and gers, ends and ends.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember I tried to find those words in a Welsh dictionary but it could be they were dialect words or something.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t seem to find them, you know.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she had a name for a broom and I don&#039;t know what that was.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> For what?</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> A broom.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t keep up with Welsh after she got married because grandfather spoke English, you see.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought like your old granny talked Welsh but grandmother didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s really interesting.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll tell you, you were saying that your aunt...</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Elizabeth Wood, of course.

over and settled in the Codray Valley in western Newfoundland too.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Closer to home.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They had a ministry that led a whole lot of them, it&#039;s flocked, down to New Zealand.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> His name was McLean I think.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember his name but I remember reading about him.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was quite interesting.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> There Aunt May, just to continue in a different vein, I was wondering if you could tell us what you know about the Durex or relations or cousins here.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of them are still living in the St. John area I believe.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There was Grandmother Hall was a Durex.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> From down here and when she was about 12 or 13 she ran away from home.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> She had 14 different excuses for doing it and I think most of them were from right down to that were just to hear miserable devils and some of that.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> She just wanted to make trouble.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that so?</div><div id="00:16:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She said it was because there was some sort of an epidemic down here but she skinned up a river on the boat, the river boat, and got off at Gage Town.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And the family went to a family by the name of Coy and they kept her for quite a while and her father didn&#039;t know where on earth she was.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went to the captain of the boat and asked him if he&#039;d seen anything of her.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Apparently she wants to hung around the boat some because they used to haul from the boat you know.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway he said yes he took her up to Gage Town with him and she got off there.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So Grandfather, great Grandfather Durex went up to see if he could find her.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Coy&#039;s hit her.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he went away they sent her up to Bear Island.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> To, I don&#039;t know what was the name of the place.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> She lived up Bear Island and she grew up.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And she went by the name of Katherine, Katherine something else.</div><div id="00:17:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The name was Katherine Durex.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But she went by another name, Wilson I think.</div><div id="00:17:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she fell in with Grandfather Hall and when he went to marry her she told him the truth of the matter, who she was.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And so he insisted that they marry, she marry under a right name.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was William Hall and Katherine Durex that got married.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So she changed her religion at that point if not before.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah she was Protestant for the rest of her life.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She was anything.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And anyway they bought a farm at Lower Capital.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And they lived there for a long time.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Well Grandfather was this kind.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> All anyone else had to do was come to him with a hard luck tale.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d give them the last cent he owned while their own family went neat.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was to make Grandmother just raise you.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> She used to knit for sale and she&#039;d wove and she worked outside and she thought what they earned they&#039;d give to their own family.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They had five, five girls.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of them died in childhood and so she raised these four girls.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So finally Grandfather said well, Katie, I guess we can&#039;t get along together.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So we just did well if we separate.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that right?</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So he left.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He says I&#039;ll leave you the farm and he says I&#039;ll go work in the mill.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So he worked in a mill run by a man by the name of Burton and somebody else.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> By the way, Neil Burton was married to my cousin.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was his father I think.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all the miller and grandfather.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And so Grandfather Hall lived and worked in the mill as long as he was able to work.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And Grandmother kept the farm.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Well she lived there by herself.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Well her girls grew up.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Grandma married Sam Howland as Frank&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then two of them came down here and they married back into Catholic religion.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> There was Aunt Min, Allingham, and Aunt Alice Phillips.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They found her eventually up there.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it her father or a brother or something who eventually chased her down?</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Her husband said one day, Casey said I think you should go down to see your people.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And the girls now are old enough to keep house and he says I want you to go down to see your people.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So Casey came down on the boat.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And she asked the boat captain if he knew.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m listening to Michael Durich.</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Michael Durich.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes he says they meet the boat every time it goes down and haul produce to the stores.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He says they&#039;ll be there to meet the boat.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well she said, would you point them out to me?</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> She says I&#039;m their sister but I haven&#039;t seen them since I was 13 years old.</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they think I&#039;m dead.</div><div id="00:20:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well he says I&#039;d do that.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Better than that I&#039;ll take an introduction.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So he took her over and he introduced her to the two men.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And they of course were astounded.</div><div id="00:20:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They knew she was dead.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Her father and mother were gone.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was an Aunt Mary who was an invalid.</div><div id="00:20:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And both Michael and Thomas were married.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So they took her to the house but they didn&#039;t take her to see Aunt Mary until they went in and broke the news.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Joyful news.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So she had a visit with them and then of course she had to go home again.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But every year after that she sent everything that she could, had to sell from the farm, she consigned it to her brothers.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And they sold it to the best advantage and sent her back whatever she wanted in the way of flour and sugar and what not.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And always added a little extra out of their own pockets.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They were very good to her.</div><div id="00:21:37.000" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t write.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She never went to school to learn to write.</div><div id="00:21:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to have to get the postmasters to write her letters.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And her postmasters I knew afterwards, years afterwards.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And anyway.</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> She lived up there on the farm for a good many years.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And when her oldest girl, two older girls, well for one thing her brother lost his wife and he asked one of his girls to go down and keep house for him.</div><div id="00:22:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He had two small children.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the other one came down to learn to be a tailoress.</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And they both married down here.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> As I say one was Aunt Nenalingham and one was Aunt Alice Phillips and their families.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if that means anything around here now or not.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But Aunt Alice is our southern day, the one from not long ago.</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I think my father used to see a bit of them when he was a boy.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes he did.</div><div id="00:22:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He knew James Duritt and Josephine.</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Now they were cousins of Grandmother Hollins.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to treat him and take him for rides in the streetcars I believe.</div><div id="00:22:52.000" class="transcript_line"> James was awful nice.</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He was awful good to them.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I never knew Aunt Alice.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I met one or two of her.</div><div id="00:23:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew Arthur and Lewis and one or two, Rose I think it was, one of her girls.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have seen one or two of them but not to really know them.</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway when Grandmother got ill the word was sent down to Grandmother Hollins, Frank&#039;s mother,</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> that her mother was ill and somebody should look after her.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And she wouldn&#039;t have the neighbors in.</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Just by the side you know.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And so Grandmother went up and they brought her down to live with them.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> She hadn&#039;t much use for Grandmother Hollins to tell you the truth.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But she came because she couldn&#039;t do anything else.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t sit there alone sick.</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And she lived with them for all quite a number of years.</div><div id="00:23:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how long.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I will admit she was not a very pleasant guest.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t care what she said or who she said it to.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She made life miserable for Grandmother, shamed her face more than once.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how to tell you this on the tape or not.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But when her husband died, when he got so he couldn&#039;t look after himself,</div><div id="00:24:23.000" class="transcript_line"> he went to live with the other Protestant sister, Hetty, down in St. Mary&#039;s.</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> She took care of him until he died.</div><div id="00:24:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They never saw one another.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> She old lady didn&#039;t go to see him and he didn&#039;t come to see her.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And when she heard, when he died, Grandmother of course put on black as was expected.</div><div id="00:24:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And she started to go to church one morning.</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> All dressed in her black, you know, the long veil and all this trim that she liked.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course Grandma was prim.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And Grandmother&#039;s two brothers were over across the road,</div><div id="00:25:09.000" class="transcript_line"> lying out on their lawn on a fine, bright, sunny morning.</div><div id="00:25:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Old Grandmother Holl, great-grandmother Holl,</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> put her head out the window and she calls,</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Lodge, Lodge, yes Mrs. Holl, what is it?</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you hear the news?</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think that I did.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The devil&#039;s dead, don&#039;t you see his angel in the morning?</div><div id="00:25:35.000" class="transcript_line"> She said that too.</div><div id="00:25:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Poor Grandma that couldn&#039;t speak, didn&#039;t like Lodge howling anyway,</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and she brought him up to church.</div><div id="00:25:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the sample, that&#039;s just one.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And Frank said it wasn&#039;t living, it was just enduring what she lived with him.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What did Catherine Durek look like?</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t say, there was no picture of her.</div><div id="00:26:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I would judge from her daughter that she probably wasn&#039;t a bad looking woman.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Because Aunt Min wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I never saw an Alice, but Aunt Min was rather nice.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that distinct, was a really nice looking old lady.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, not so old when I knew her, but middle-aged woman,</div><div id="00:26:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and she had kind of reddish hair, glinted red, you know,</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> it wasn&#039;t a bright red like yours is, the definite red,</div><div id="00:26:29.000" class="transcript_line"> but it had red lights in it, and she always had high colored rosy cheeks.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And a very attractive woman, I thought.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if the red hair comes from the...</div><div id="00:26:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Comes from both sides.</div><div id="00:26:41.000" class="transcript_line"> From both sides, does it?</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, Grandfather Howland&#039;s mother was a graven,</div><div id="00:26:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and they scotch, and they were the red scotch.</div><div id="00:26:50.000" class="transcript_line"> There was ever so many redheads in the family.</div><div id="00:26:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I see.</div><div id="00:26:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was one of them were braw boys, and his mother was one of the gravenses.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was Tom Graham had...</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he had three redheads.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> There was redheads all the way through.</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And Elijah&#039;s oldest girl was redheaded, Elijah Howland&#039;s.</div><div id="00:27:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, Grandfather had three of them redheaded,</div><div id="00:27:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and when the third one showed up, he says,</div><div id="00:27:19.000" class="transcript_line"> well, by criminy, that&#039;s the last.</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Not many more redheads out there.</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I thought was often funny.</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after me getting five, I didn&#039;t get a redhead.</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s come out again in the next generation.</div><div id="00:27:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It does.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Gene&#039;s got two redheaded children.</div><div id="00:27:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:27:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re redheaded.</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I like it, you know.</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It seems to go together with black hair, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:27:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Often in our family, at least.</div><div id="00:27:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Either one extreme or the other, either black hair or red hair.</div><div id="00:27:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Look at mine.</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, now, Evans got red hairs.</div><div id="00:28:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Red hairs, amongst his black hair.</div><div id="00:28:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So had Burns.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And so has Ele.</div><div id="00:28:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And Eleanor had four, she got gray.</div><div id="00:28:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Every one of them had red hairs, but they weren&#039;t redheaded.</div><div id="00:28:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:28:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Just the odd red hair here and there in their hair.</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I was sick of the piece when Gene turned up to be a redhead.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when she had two redheaded children.</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, there&#039;s redheads in Laurie&#039;s side of the family,
