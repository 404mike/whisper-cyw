    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 15 in our series in relation to the race riots in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:05.200" class="transcript_line"> This relates to Cardiff and is about the perpetrators, those arrested by the police and charged by the court with riotous assembly leading the riots, which is important.</div><div id="00:00:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Now the reason it&#039;s important is because mobs don&#039;t just happen.</div><div id="00:00:24.560" class="transcript_line"> You may have an instant flare-up but it doesn&#039;t continue for days and it doesn&#039;t continue on a whole range of different sites.</div><div id="00:00:34.080" class="transcript_line"> For that you need agitators, you need leaders, people who inspire a mob.</div><div id="00:00:40.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why the offence of riotous assembly is important.</div><div id="00:00:43.840" class="transcript_line"> These people who we&#039;re going to name here are, except for one, all career criminals.</div><div id="00:00:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Most of them have offences related to stealing and violence and that&#039;s the reason we&#039;re identifying these 10 perpetrators.</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> They were central and are identified by the police consistently as being wherever the violence and robbery was.</div><div id="00:01:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Now in the court case which was held in Swansea County Court, a number of men were found guilty in court of being ringleaders, rioters.</div><div id="00:01:21.520" class="transcript_line"> There were 10 of them.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Now Albert Sparks was 20 years old. He was a sailor. He was sentenced to three months imprisonment.</div><div id="00:01:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Now in relation to Sparks, it&#039;s important to say when he was first arrested, the first offence he was charged with was wearing a sailor&#039;s uniform without authority.</div><div id="00:02:02.160" class="transcript_line"> Which may mean at that time he wasn&#039;t in the Navy or he wasn&#039;t supposed to be in uniform.</div><div id="00:02:11.200" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s important to realize the jobs credited to the men in court are what we&#039;ve listed.</div><div id="00:02:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Not whether they were actually in the army because the likelihood is they were demobbed.</div><div id="00:02:28.960" class="transcript_line"> And if you were demobbed from World War I, you were allowed to wear the uniform for six months after leaving.</div><div id="00:02:36.640" class="transcript_line"> And in fact many of them didn&#039;t actually have any other clothes but the uniform including great coats.</div><div id="00:02:45.120" class="transcript_line"> So they may not have actually been serving soldiers at the time of the riots.</div><div id="00:02:52.560" class="transcript_line"> James Bond, a dock labourer, a career criminal, was given 20 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:02:59.600" class="transcript_line"> William Jones was a coal trimmer. He was given an additional four months imprisonment to be served after a current term already in prison.</div><div id="00:03:11.120" class="transcript_line"> He had an 11 year criminal record.</div><div id="00:03:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Patrick Linehan was age 38. Born in County Cork, Ireland, he was a dock labourer.</div><div id="00:03:20.960" class="transcript_line"> He had a 21 year old criminal record and he was sentenced to nine months hard labour.</div><div id="00:03:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Charles Snell was a soldier. He was age 21. He had a seven year criminal record and was sentenced to nine months hard labour.</div><div id="00:03:36.480" class="transcript_line"> Sidney Blashill was age 36, was a marine engineer.</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> He had an 11 year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:03:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Timothy Clancy, age 30, was a labourer. He had a 12 year old criminal, 12 year criminal record and he was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:03:56.400" class="transcript_line"> William Parker is listed as being a soldier as well, age 24.</div><div id="00:04:01.440" class="transcript_line"> He had a nine year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:04:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Ernest Perkins, age 28, was a labourer. He had an 11 year criminal record. He was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:04:15.280" class="transcript_line"> His criminal record included three offences from 1917 to 1918 of illegally wearing military uniform and wound stripes, which identified invalid soldiers.</div><div id="00:04:30.480" class="transcript_line"> He was charged with false pretenses, which may have related to begging as a wounded veteran.</div><div id="00:04:36.320" class="transcript_line"> James Rees, age 27, born in Swansea, was a soldier.</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> He is listed as being in the New Zealand Army. He had an 18 year criminal record and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.</div><div id="00:04:51.040" class="transcript_line"> The court record shows, although people may have thought he was from New Zealand, and that&#039;s the impression the paper showed, he was also known as Moses Rees.</div><div id="00:05:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Which is interesting because in 1909 Moses Rees of Swansea was court martial for desertion and theft from the Welsh regiment.</div><div id="00:05:12.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s also interesting that none of the white men that were sentenced to prison were merchant seamen and therefore the argument that black people were keeping them out of their jobs was spurious at best.</div><div id="00:05:23.840" class="transcript_line"> It may also have been extremely convenient for men that wanted to steal from properties under the cover of mob violence.</div><div id="00:05:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Now at a later stage we will look at the causes that people have related to the riots.</div><div id="00:05:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Economic conditions, lack of employment, etc. etc. Resentment.</div><div id="00:05:45.440" class="transcript_line"> But one thing is for sure, those 10 perpetrators, ringleaders, all identified by the police were not out of work because of black people taking their jobs.</div><div id="00:06:01.920" class="transcript_line"> The jobs black people could take in Cardiff at the time were limited.</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> In the main they were merchant seamen or people who provided services to merchant seamen such as boarding houses etc.</div><div id="00:06:16.960" class="transcript_line"> What is clear, these men were career criminals and as such benefited considerably from the riot.</div><div id="00:06:26.560" class="transcript_line"> In fact one of them, Sidney Blashill, when arrested had three different outfits of clothes on, all stolen from a shop.</div><div id="00:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for listening.</div><div id="00:06:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Chapter 16, which is part 2 of Cardiff, will relate to the black people who were arrested and what happened to them.</div></div></p>
