    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, good afternoon Dilwyn. This is Jill Jones from Minera talking to Dilwyn Roberts.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So, hello Dilwyn, thank you very much for deciding to talk to us this afternoon.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, would you like to start off by saying your name and your date of birth</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and telling us a little bit about your school days, early life?</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I will thank you Jill. I can mention your name, yes?</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born on the 29th of the 3rd 1930. I started school when I was five years old</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> in the Infants Junior School, Pennegallie Road.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the Infants School for over two years until I became seven.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I was taken to Pennegallie Junior School which was only ten yards across the road from the Infants School.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the Junior School until the age of eleven.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I was transferred to Pennegallie Road Secondary School, Cudpoith.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there until I was fourteen. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t have any education.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, I would have gone to Wrexham Grammar School, but unfortunately I didn&#039;t qualify.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had to seek work.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, in 1944, I had to leave school at fourteen. We all had to.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I actually had an education which I did not, like you just mentioned.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, a little friend of mine who lived a hundred yards away, he worked in the Monero line works.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> His name was Mr. Moss Edwards and we used to call him Uncle Moss.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, is that any work, Dilwyn? I said, no, Uncle.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Looking for work, he said, I&#039;ll have a word with my boss.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he called to see me one day, Dilwyn. Can you start work on Monday?</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I started work in the Monero line works.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So, that sounds good and straightforward. So, what sort of work were you doing in the line works, Dilwyn?</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, in the Monero line works, there were three railway lines.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> One going up to the number one kiln, one going up to the number two kiln, one going up to the crusher.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, on the left, in the bottom, was the manager&#039;s office and the manager was called Mr. Sutton, his wife, and he had a young daughter.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Next to the manager&#039;s office was the clerk&#039;s office and there was a general call by the name of Mr. John Roberts and his assistant called Ivor Owen Roberts who lived in Monero.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So, Dilwyn was given a job in the office.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the office for three weeks and I said to the manager, I&#039;m very sorry, Mr. Sutton, I&#039;m not enjoying this work.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you give me another job in the quarry, whatever, ever?</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No problem, Dilwyn. He said, I&#039;ll give you a job in the seater room with a lovely gentleman called little Sam Bellis.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Sam Bellis lived in Gwynedd. I think Sam lived, he was ninety odd.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He was not small, and I was, what a lovely gentleman.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And the seat room, it was in the seat room, they called it the seat room.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We repaired the seats for when the line was burnt in the number one and number two kilns, the labors had to fill the railway wagons with this burnt line.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Then in case the weather came wet, icy or snowed, we had to cover that line with these sheets, otherwise all the line would dissolve into nothing.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I was in the seat room, Wyle was in the seat room, and the seat was next to the clerk&#039;s office, all them were linked together.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Then next to the seat room, and I&#039;ll give you the history, Mr. Hallam was the foreman, and his cottage was next door to the seat room.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They were all linked together.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Manager&#039;s office, the clerk&#039;s office, seat room, and the foreman&#039;s, Mr. Hallam.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came from, he was a foreman in the quarry in Buxton, in Gavisham.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, while I was working in the seat room, all the spare time I had, I had to walk to the quarry back, I can&#039;t remember the name of the main road to the Menelis, what was it called?</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Mice of Funan.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Mice of Funan Road.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to walk a quarter mile every day, six times a day, from the quarry to the spring.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> In Mice of Funan, to get water for the men, there was no taps there, so that they could have a drink.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was my job.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And have you seen the Dutch people in Holland?</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They had an instrument over their shoulders to carry a bucket on each of them.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had one of them.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my job for about 18 months.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I was there, I done my apprenticeship in the seat room.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, they sent me to the quarry.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I was only a little, five foot nothing, and all the big snappy men, farmers, sons.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I worked on the number one break, on the big drum, with Dye Evans, who was from Gwinnley.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he also had a young son called Stan.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I, unfalterly, you&#039;ve got to take my memory, I can&#039;t hold it in my head, so far, 76 years ago, I can&#039;t remember anything.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But poor Stan, I think he had anemia, and I think Stan passed away very young, in his life.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he did.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can recommend that, a lovely young chap, Stan.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I was on the break with Dye.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, we&#039;d supply three wagons to go down the break, and at the bottom of the break, there&#039;d be a gentleman called Trevor Jones from Gwinnley.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d have his big stallion, waiting for the three wagons.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The three full wagons would go down the break, and they also would supply us in the quarry with four empty wagons.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> That was my job, until I became 18 years old.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I was called to the National Service, and the government put Dillwyn in the Royal Air Force.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> For two years.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, when I finished in the Air Force, when I was 20, I came back to the quarry for two years.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And back, I went with Dye as a breaksman.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Dye&#039;s assistant.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I had to do alternative jobs.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I was sent, only once I ever went, to number two kill.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, Mr. Hallam finished as a poor man.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, a lovely gentleman called Mr. Beech.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He became a, and he also came from Buxton.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, he said, Dillwyn, I would like you to go to number two kill.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, we all had to wear clogs.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to take clogs with us to work, as well as our walking boots, in case we were sent to the kill.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Because, if you went to the kill for one day, you would have no boots to go home in.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Fair enough.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> The heat was that tremendous, it would burn your soles of your shoe.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So, we had to wear clogs, and they were covered in iron underneath.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> All the sole was covered in iron, and the heel.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So, that they wouldn&#039;t burn.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, I only worked there for two days, but I loved it.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But, every day I went home, I had to jump in the bath.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> My feet was that sore, with the temperature.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My mam used to put me in the bath, and she used to put some radux in the bath, so that I could get my feet.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I said, oh mam, I don&#039;t like this yoke.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, don&#039;t do it then.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I said, I won&#039;t refuse.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, luckily, I only done two days there.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, do you want any more information about the quarry?</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, carry on.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, there were, there was, oh, by the way, when I was fourteen and a half, my father was in the war for five years.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in India, fighting the Japanese.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When he come home, till when he said, I&#039;m going to have six weeks off, spend all my immigration money from the army, the Royal Tilly.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And, we used to go to cinema in Kapoor, Parrish Hall in Kapoor, my mam would take us there.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And, I was the oldest.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I was nine.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a brother and a sister.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And, and we saw these ships going on all the pathing hills.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Dill, your dad might be on that boat.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t know where he&#039;s going, but he might be on it.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And, he finished off Columbus Ceylon.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, he come home.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, can you get me a job, Dill, in the limelight?</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, dad, I said.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Alas, Mr. Beats.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I went.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Beats, he was in the time clock, Mr. Beats, always watch everybody come in.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So, if you give us our job for the day.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We signed on with the clock.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Dill went, do this, do that, and he had to go.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, I loved every job there besides the number two kill.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t like that job.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Two out.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I didn&#039;t like heat.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, Mr. Beats, can I sit?</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he said, take him with them while everybody&#039;s coming in first.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> He went and leveled it here.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Come in the office, so everybody knows.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> My father told him, oh, lovely Dill.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And, he said, oh, Mr. Beats, oh, he&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> He gets a little bit malaria, I said, but he&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He gets treatment for it.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been in India.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Still, I&#039;m sorry, Mr. Dill, when he said it.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And my dad&#039;s standing there.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my dad a job there.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So, and my dad is there.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good news.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Still, them, and I come from the Air Force.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, there was ten smallish wagons on the Cloddy face.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was two men, partners to each other.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can name them all, but it&#039;s either going to be at last Christmas.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But my father was partnered with a lovely chap, Uncle Injavis, from Middle Road, Matt.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Injavis.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And his son&#039;s grandson is still alive now, but not as personally like my father.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was ten pairs of them, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the job I was given, too.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Supplying these ten men with a wagon to fill them with limestone.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And a couple of times, I went on the little wading machine on the Cloddy.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had a little engine there.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And Alf Wild was responsible for keeping that engine in good form.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Also the big engine, Bob the Engine.</div><div id="00:12:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Bob, and I think Bob was one good in it.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I think so, Bob.</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And Bob, my big best friend, also Daniel&#039;s, from Nants Square, Matt, good boy.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He was the skunter on the train.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> For the number one kill and number two kill.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And poor Daniel, he lost his sight when he was 34 years old.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, TB.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Best friend of mine, Daniel.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it&#039;s that group of people.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the oldest fella next to me would be Albert Peters.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I remember Albert.</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> From Buchwind or Gwinnett.</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Is he still alive?</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Was his wife called Cain when?</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know?</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I know.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He was in the same class as me in school, the second in school, the good boy.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And he, Ned a go, he was from Middle Road, Nants.</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was the blacksmith.</div><div id="00:14:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Ned a go, Ned a go, his name was, go is a blacksmith.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And Albert was his apprenticeship, apprentice.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And Ned a go was in charge if he had a runaway on the break.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, let&#039;s get down now, then a job I had was with Trevor and Joss.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> With the two stallions.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Trevor wasn&#039;t well, Joss wasn&#039;t well.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Billman, can you do the horses?</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll have a go Mr. Beech.</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I done okay.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I used to, Trevor used to, like he was Trevor, he used to supply number one kill</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> with a limestone.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Three wagons at a time.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the next three wagons, he&#039;d take them over to number two break, to the small break</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and the small drum, supplying number one kill.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And Joss would be in charge of that drum and the wagons and the horse.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Joss.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Then on a Saturday morning, Trevor said to me, we&#039;d like extra work on Saturday morning,</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> same about every six weeks.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Trevor, a bit extra work for you lad, thank you.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to fill a big railway wagon with horse manure.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, where&#039;s the manure going, Trevor?</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, just outside, I think it is in Mach Wheel somewhere, a big mushroom farm to make</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> mushrooms.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, that sounds right.</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Horse manure heats up quickly.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got to have heat for mushrooms.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when we had the horses, on a Monday morning, believe me, we, Trevor, we&#039;d go down, Joss</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> sometimes, past the Mr. Beattie&#039;s house, Sheet Room, Clark and Mr. Sutton&#039;s.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> On the left was a big steep bank with all the wretches, the dust, lime dust.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to work, oh, I didn&#039;t like that job by then.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it didn&#039;t this job.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I did it.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, lower down, 100 yards down the road, there was two fields and the horses were grazed</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> there.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right, I know.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And you, do you know what, do you know what, Jill?</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to cook some, they were wild.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Being let free, you see.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to cook some with hay and horse nests.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, what a job.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But they got used to us and we need being new, now and again.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t used to me, you see.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Horses, like, seen as birds, they go for colour.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you didn&#039;t like your jacket or something, you&#039;d have a job to train them.</div><div id="00:17:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I found that out to Trevor&#039;s telling me all about it.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to me one day, have they got a different colour pullover, Jill?</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, yeah, why?</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> This horse doesn&#039;t like it pullover.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And same as my birds, I keep birds.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t like colour.</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so that was that part of it.</div><div id="00:17:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Then across, right opposite the office and all that, that block, there was a big wane</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> room where Bob the Engine, he&#039;d bring all the wagons down with a lineman.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d have them all weighed.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the big railway wagon from, the big train from Wrexham, number one train, come</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and pick them up and take them to Brombeau Steel to make steel with it, with a line.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they&#039;d also take limestone as well.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then in Brombeau they had a big crusher and they crushed it into dust for the farmers</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> to put on the farms.</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mr. Beats said to me one day, he said, you&#039;re going to have a walk in the morning.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We gave you an accent for it.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Why, Mr. Beats?</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll have to walk to Brombeau for a couple of weeks every morning.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Why, I said, you&#039;re going on the crusher and to load the bags with dust, he said, for the</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> farmers.</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there for two or three weeks.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t like the job but I did it.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very dusty.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to wear a mask and glasses, you know.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did that job.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I would hope so.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, I&#039;m going back to number one kiln.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved landscape.</div><div id="00:18:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a landscaper for five years.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> From when I was 34 years old to when I was 39.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how we became landscaper.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d walk, we only had half an hour for dinner.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have a sandwich in the inn and there was lovely woodlands in the Minerva line, Maxine.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether the habitat had been taken away or not, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s all still there.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The number one kiln, right at the end of the number one kiln, where the line completed.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t go any further.</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The line completed.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there was a break supplying the wagons to come down.</div><div id="00:19:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But that railway line finished there.</div><div id="00:19:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the end of it.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The big buffers stopped the wagons going any further.</div><div id="00:19:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Then on the left there, there was a lovely woodland.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Shrubs away, not big, big trees.</div><div id="00:19:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to suddenly get through them.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew top of all these flowers, Jill.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> All types.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the main one, did you say, you get?</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> The one they all are interested in is the orchids.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, I used to see them orchids.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, in them days.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to love it.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to take some home.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> For me mother.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The smell on them.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And primroses.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> All sorts.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Wild flower vegetation.</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So, hopefully that vegetation is still there.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It is, because they&#039;re part of my list.</div><div id="00:20:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I check.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I, oh, and then there was a Percy Ellis working on the big whey machine.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Percy.</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> When he was working in the Sheets Room, and he married me auntie&#039;s sister from New Brighton.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Percy did.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So, what?</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He had married her then.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He did.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I found out he&#039;d married.</div><div id="00:20:55.000" class="transcript_line"> My auntie Phyllis&#039; sister from New Brighton.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to call her when he had a bit of dinner in the Sheets Room.</div><div id="00:21:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d go there and I&#039;d chat to Percy.</div><div id="00:21:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have a chat, yeah.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And Sam Bellis used to love me when I started working there.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d get a pencil and a paper.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Not bad.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d take it with me.</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to love drawing.</div><div id="00:21:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> What you doing, Dill, when you said, I&#039;m drawing, Sam.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> What you drawing?</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I said Donald Duck.</div><div

I don&#039;t know if he was married or not.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Very, very tall.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Sam was little.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> There was three every Thursday.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:34.000" class="transcript_line"> There were three.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> A big, big, massive paper.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Not like the paper you get now.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Massive.</div><div id="00:22:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have a three every Thursday.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I joined the

class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll send that episode in.</div><div id="00:25:13.320" class="transcript_line"> That was linked to the lion.</div><div id="00:25:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to draw for Sam Billis.</div><div id="00:25:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:21.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where else he want me to go now.</div><div id="00:25:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, shall we stop for a minute?</div><div id="00:25:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Well done, Doreen.</div><div id="00:25:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Can I ask you a question now?</div><div id="00:25:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:34.320" class="transcript_line"> I hope I am going to...</div><div id="00:25:36.320" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re telling me to make an NEL, so I don&#039;t need that said.</div><div id="00:25:39.320" class="transcript_line"> Please tell me, God.</div><div id="00:25:41.320" class="transcript_line"> I do go on, but I&#039;ve got information in my head and it&#039;s coming out.</div><div id="00:25:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I realize.</div><div id="00:25:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Can I just stop you for a minute?</div><div id="00:25:49.320" class="transcript_line"> If you want to stop me, Carol or Jill, stop me.</div><div id="00:25:52.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to stop you.</div><div id="00:25:54.320" class="transcript_line"> If you want to stop me, Carol or Jill, stop me.</div><div id="00:25:57.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:25:58.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:26:00.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got this back now.</div><div id="00:26:02.320" class="transcript_line"> When I pressed it, there was a light saying it was recording.</div><div id="00:26:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And I think it&#039;s still recording now.</div><div id="00:26:09.320" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m worried in case it hasn&#039;t captured.</div><div id="00:26:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Everything.</div><div id="00:26:14.320" class="transcript_line"> Everything.</div><div id="00:26:15.320" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going...</div><div id="00:26:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to...</div><div id="00:26:17.320" class="transcript_line"> I think the best thing to do is to try and check.</div><div id="00:26:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Because what it did, it lights up and it says it&#039;s recording.</div><div id="00:26:27.320" class="transcript_line"> And then it displays some numbers to say it&#039;s recording.</div><div id="00:26:31.320" class="transcript_line"> And then it goes off.</div><div id="00:26:33.320" class="transcript_line"> The writing goes off.</div><div id="00:26:35.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:36.320" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re not quite sure whether it&#039;s still capturing or whether it&#039;s gone off.</div><div id="00:26:41.320" class="transcript_line"> But if it&#039;s recording me talking now, we should be OK because it will have recorded YouTube.</div><div id="00:26:48.320" class="transcript_line"> So what I&#039;m going to do now is I&#039;m going to see if we can go back.</div><div id="00:26:53.320" class="transcript_line"> So it says to play back.</div><div id="00:26:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so do I.</div><div id="00:26:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Because a lot of the men you mentioned, I knew them as savers when I first moved into...</div><div id="00:27:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Are there any names you want to know?</div><div id="00:27:07.320" class="transcript_line"> Um...</div><div id="00:27:09.320" class="transcript_line"> Not...</div><div id="00:27:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Now, one thing&#039;s for certain.</div><div id="00:27:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Sam, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Um, Dye Evans.</div><div id="00:27:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Dye?</div><div id="00:27:18.320" class="transcript_line"> And Stan Evans I knew.</div><div id="00:27:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Did he pass away at the young Stan?</div><div id="00:27:24.320" class="transcript_line"> He did. I remember my husband being white.</div><div id="00:27:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Maybe he died in his mid-30s.</div><div id="00:27:32.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:27:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Now, he had another older brother.</div><div id="00:27:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div></div></p>
