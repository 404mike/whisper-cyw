    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a little bit about your mum?</div><div id="00:00:01.600" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s always been an old lady. She was 41 when I was born and I&#039;ve always been her carer</div><div id="00:00:05.920" class="transcript_line"> as far as I can remember. Her proper name was Fajga Jekyll.</div><div id="00:00:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:11.480" class="transcript_line"> Although she was known as Fanny Jekyll.</div><div id="00:00:13.760" class="transcript_line"> And she was born around when?</div><div id="00:00:15.760" class="transcript_line"> 25th November 1917.</div><div id="00:00:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay, and where?</div><div id="00:00:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Dolina, Poland as was then.</div><div id="00:00:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about her life then?</div><div id="00:00:25.280" class="transcript_line"> As far as I know, when she was a baby they moved to Gelsenkirchen, which is near in</div><div id="00:00:30.320" class="transcript_line"> the Westphalen of Germany. She was about two, three I think. She was brought up there and she had</div><div id="00:00:36.240" class="transcript_line"> a brother and two sisters and I think other children but I&#039;m not sure about the other</div><div id="00:00:41.840" class="transcript_line"> children. And then they had a local synagogue not far from where they lived in Gelsenkirchen.</div><div id="00:00:48.400" class="transcript_line"> And then war broke out and she escaped a roundup. Her sisters were already in the UK then.</div><div id="00:00:55.520" class="transcript_line"> But her brother and parents weren&#039;t. She escaped a roundup but eventually she got caught and as</div><div id="00:01:01.600" class="transcript_line"> far as I know she was taken to a labour camp. And I don&#039;t know when she was rounded up but she was</div><div id="00:01:06.960" class="transcript_line"> taken to a labour camp and worked and they were marching from one place to another and she tripped</div><div id="00:01:15.680" class="transcript_line"> and the guard hit her on the head with his rifle butt and left her for dead and carried on marching.</div><div id="00:01:23.120" class="transcript_line"> And apparently a Lutheran priest found her and thought she was also dead but she wasn&#039;t and he</div><div id="00:01:29.600" class="transcript_line"> brought her back to, nursed her back to life. All I know is she had an indentation in the inside of</div><div id="00:01:35.680" class="transcript_line"> her arm where she had the tattoo numbers taken away. I mean they wasn&#039;t lasered out, they were</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> sort of dug out because she had quite a deep hole in her arm. She had a big, big scar in her head</div><div id="00:01:46.240" class="transcript_line"> always from the rifle butt where she was hit. She was left injured and somehow this priest</div><div id="00:01:55.280" class="transcript_line"> and the underground got her through and got to the UK and that&#039;s as far as I know really.</div><div id="00:01:59.840" class="transcript_line"> And how was her health? Always bad, always bad, bad health, always as I said right in the beginning</div><div id="00:02:07.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always known her as a ill mother. I&#039;ve never known her as a healthy mother. She was completely</div><div id="00:02:14.640" class="transcript_line"> deaf, yeah they made her completely deaf and it got worse over the years. Yeah I think in the early</div><div id="00:02:20.480" class="transcript_line"> days she used to wear a hearing aid and she could hear slightly but then even with the hearing aid</div><div id="00:02:24.560" class="transcript_line"> she couldn&#039;t hear anymore so she just left it off but and she couldn&#039;t hear the English language to</div><div id="00:02:30.960" class="transcript_line"> pronounce it so she spoke to us in German. My father spoke to us in English and we was brought</div><div id="00:02:37.120" class="transcript_line"> up bilingual. You said her sisters got out? Her sisters came out before all hell let loose type</div><div id="00:02:43.440" class="transcript_line"> thing you know and they came over here and they were in service her two sisters because she was</div><div id="00:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> the younger one. I suppose she was too young to go with them I don&#039;t know. She was the younger one</div><div id="00:02:52.320" class="transcript_line"> and yeah they were in service over in London, domestic service. And do you have any information</div><div id="00:02:58.320" class="transcript_line"> about what happened about her parents? Well we found out a couple of years ago that they were taken</div><div id="00:03:03.440" class="transcript_line"> to Latvia and killed in Latvia. So she got out somehow through the underground system? Through</div><div id="00:03:08.960" class="transcript_line"> the underground system she never spoke about it never mentioned it. Where did she end up in the UK</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> then? In a place in a refugee camp called Kitchener Camp and I think she was there for about 18 months</div><div id="00:03:22.400" class="transcript_line"> two years something like that and that&#039;s where she met my dad who was in the forces</div><div id="00:03:27.280" class="transcript_line"> who was a German speaker in the forces that&#039;s where they got married in the Kitchener Camp.</div><div id="00:03:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Did she talk about her time in the Kitchener Camp? No no never spoke about anything. A lot of this is</div><div id="00:03:37.680" class="transcript_line"> what you&#039;ve reconstructed. Yeah.</div></div></p>
