    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> cottage which has variously been the school. That was the school when the village was first built.</div><div id="00:00:07.920" class="transcript_line"> It was said that the lady of the house, Anna Theopho Phillips, daughter of the Lekker Stoke</div><div id="00:00:14.960" class="transcript_line"> fort, found it a little too noisy. So since they owned it they built another one up here, which</div><div id="00:00:22.240" class="transcript_line"> was 10 years later, and then turned the old school into a laundry. It&#039;s always known as laundry.</div><div id="00:00:32.480" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s an interesting thing around the village. There are certain places that have names that have</div><div id="00:00:39.120" class="transcript_line"> absolutely no relationship to what it is. It&#039;s still very much known as the laundry around the</div><div id="00:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> village. It hasn&#039;t been a laundry for decades, half a century or more. The corner at the top</div><div id="00:00:55.040" class="transcript_line"> is where you go around towards the hall. It&#039;s known as the Green Door Bend. There&#039;s no green</div><div id="00:01:01.120" class="transcript_line"> doors there anymore. We talk rather bluntly about the lime heap. There&#039;s a certain thing</div><div id="00:01:12.160" class="transcript_line"> that wasn&#039;t the lime heap. It&#039;s a good story because if you don&#039;t know, it&#039;s the sharp bend</div><div id="00:01:20.080" class="transcript_line"> at the very top of the Red Hill. Many, many years ago, one of the farmers up there wanted a load of</div><div id="00:01:29.840" class="transcript_line"> lime. So the cart had brought the lime up and dumped it out in the field on that bend.</div><div id="00:01:41.360" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, it was the wrong farm or the wrong field.</div><div id="00:01:50.160" class="transcript_line"> Then arose the problem of what happened to the lime. The cart insisted that he had delivered it</div><div id="00:01:57.600" class="transcript_line"> to where he was told to. The owner of the ground said it was absolutely nothing to do with him.</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> The real owner of the ground also said it was in the wrong place, so it was nothing to do with him.</div><div id="00:02:09.520" class="transcript_line"> So it stayed there. It became known as the lime heap bend, the corner. That&#039;s the high point of</div><div id="00:02:17.600" class="transcript_line"> the hill there. If you go through the gate and kick around in the ground, you can still find</div><div id="00:02:22.880" class="transcript_line"> evidence of the lime being there. There&#039;s all sorts of local names that mean something to do with it.</div><div id="00:02:30.080" class="transcript_line"> So, well, initiated with them, but the newcomers completely muttered back at us.</div></div></p>
