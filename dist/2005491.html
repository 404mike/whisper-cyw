    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Chris Harding and I&#039;ve been going to gigs in Newport since 1989.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The first gig I went to in Newport was the Wonderstuff at Newport Centre.</div><div id="00:00:15.920" class="transcript_line"> It would have been December 1989.</div><div id="00:00:18.320" class="transcript_line"> So I would have been 16.</div><div id="00:00:20.400" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re really excited about going to the gig.</div><div id="00:00:22.280" class="transcript_line"> We did the classic thing of going there really early.</div><div id="00:00:24.720" class="transcript_line"> We were queuing outside from about 6 o&#039;clock just so we could be down the front.</div><div id="00:00:28.400" class="transcript_line"> Nowadays you&#039;d be turning up about 9, having missed the support band and just about catching the band.</div><div id="00:00:33.800" class="transcript_line"> So we were first ones in.</div><div id="00:00:35.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we even went to the bar that night when we were kids.</div><div id="00:00:38.520" class="transcript_line"> We saw basically the Wonderstuff at their peak really.</div><div id="00:00:41.920" class="transcript_line"> They were amazing.</div><div id="00:00:42.800" class="transcript_line"> There was about four of us there and obviously we all got separated in the mosh pit.</div><div id="00:00:48.400" class="transcript_line"> It was a great first gig to go to.</div><div id="00:00:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And getting there early we managed to catch the support band which was Ned&#039;s Tom Mcduspin</div><div id="00:00:55.080" class="transcript_line"> who were amazing and we saw them loads of times when they played Newport because they came back.</div><div id="00:00:59.720" class="transcript_line"> And they had two bass players which nobody had at the time.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was kind of their thing.</div><div id="00:01:04.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure it added to the sound at all.</div><div id="00:01:07.200" class="transcript_line"> It was just they were just mates I think.</div><div id="00:01:10.120" class="transcript_line"> We were all massive fans of the Wonderstuff.</div><div id="00:01:12.520" class="transcript_line"> I think Hup the album had come out not that long ago.</div><div id="00:01:16.200" class="transcript_line"> They were massive at that time.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they had maybe a few top four hits which would write the lower end of the charts.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were all really excited to go.</div><div id="00:01:24.280" class="transcript_line"> Miles Hunt was a fantastic frontman.</div><div id="00:01:26.560" class="transcript_line"> The Wonderstuff at that time they did a few minor hits at the lower end of the top 40.</div><div id="00:01:30.880" class="transcript_line"> It was the time before they teamed up with Vic Rees to Dizzy or Sides of a Cow.</div><div id="00:01:36.080" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t quite unknown.</div><div id="00:01:37.800" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t megastars.</div><div id="00:01:38.880" class="transcript_line"> In fact they never went on to become megastars.</div><div id="00:01:41.360" class="transcript_line"> They were kind of a kind of middle-insult level band.</div><div id="00:01:43.840" class="transcript_line"> But they always went down really well in Newport.</div><div id="00:01:46.280" class="transcript_line"> They played the Newport Centre a few times and the gigs were a real sort of party atmosphere.</div><div id="00:01:51.480" class="transcript_line"> Newport Centre was a bit of a mad venue for gigs because when you went in you had the</div><div id="00:01:55.840" class="transcript_line"> swimming pool with the wave machine and stuff.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And often you had people in the pool while the gigs were on.</div><div id="00:02:02.040" class="transcript_line"> So you went into the venue itself.</div><div id="00:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t that big but it was a sports hall.</div><div id="00:02:07.480" class="transcript_line"> But the acoustics were really good and you had plenty of seats there so you had the choice</div><div id="00:02:11.880" class="transcript_line"> of being right down the front in the middle of the mosh pit or as you got older if you</div><div id="00:02:16.160" class="transcript_line"> wanted to go sit in the back and be able to appreciate things a bit more and actually</div><div id="00:02:20.840" class="transcript_line"> watch the band.</div><div id="00:02:21.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a great venue.</div><div id="00:02:23.640" class="transcript_line"> It played host to people like David Bowie played there, The Cure, The Smiths, Stone Roses.</div><div id="00:02:28.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say Newport at that time was more of a lure than Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:32.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think Cardiff had a venue that could touch Newport Centre.</div><div id="00:02:36.960" class="transcript_line"> It was the only second gig I&#039;d ever been to.</div><div id="00:02:38.600" class="transcript_line"> A few weeks beforehand I&#039;d been to the Beautiful South in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:41.400" class="transcript_line"> But I think it was one of the stuff that set my love of guitar bands and sort of alternative music.</div><div id="00:02:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Another thing I remember is at the end of it when we left.</div><div id="00:02:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Seeing all the guys outside selling the dodgy t-shirts which were half the price of the</div><div id="00:02:54.160" class="transcript_line"> ones that were on sale in the venue.</div><div id="00:02:56.360" class="transcript_line"> I remember seeing that the gig would have been advertised in the NME or Melody Maker</div><div id="00:03:01.160" class="transcript_line"> or something like that and then we&#039;d actually physically have to go to the venue to buy</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> the tickets.</div><div id="00:03:06.120" class="transcript_line"> I think you might actually have had to queue up when they went on sale.</div><div id="00:03:09.080" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s none of the days like now where you can just order your tickets online.</div><div id="00:03:12.600" class="transcript_line"> You physically have to go and get them.</div></div></p>
