Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:08.480" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Stephanie Gowna.</div><div id="00:00:11.920" class="transcript_line"> The location is the Swicker office and today&#039;s date is the 1st of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Stephanie, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:24.480" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:00:25.480" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:26.480" class="transcript_line"> G-A-W-N-E.</div><div id="00:00:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Steph, how did you first get involved with Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:33.480" class="transcript_line"> I first got involved with Cardiff Carnival probably a decade ago and it was being approached</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> for my belly dance group to join in the carnival which was then going down from Grangetown</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> up through to town.</div><div id="00:00:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:01:00.440" class="transcript_line"> And the name of the group at that point, can you remember?</div><div id="00:01:02.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if we were the Persian Bells then, I&#039;ve got a feeling we were just Stephanie&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:09.440" class="transcript_line"> belly dance group.</div><div id="00:01:10.440" class="transcript_line"> It did what it said on the tin.</div><div id="00:01:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember.</div><div id="00:01:14.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always thought of you as the godmother of the burlesque scene in Wales and particularly</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:01:21.800" class="transcript_line"> With your burly girl hat on, of course we got together to plan a fun carnival back in</div><div id="00:01:30.400" class="transcript_line"> 2013 I think.</div><div id="00:01:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I think it was, if not 2012, it was one of those, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:01:42.960" class="transcript_line"> This is when you had the stages in town and I think we&#039;ve had three years of stage, being</div><div id="00:01:50.480" class="transcript_line"> on the stages.</div><div id="00:01:51.480" class="transcript_line"> Immediately you said that, I thought one of the highlights of our working relationship</div><div id="00:01:57.440" class="transcript_line"> and it was the first time we got to work together with you on the carnival was to actually watch,</div><div id="00:02:05.280" class="transcript_line"> I think there were 23 of you, 23 wonderful dancers doing the can-can in the sunshine,</div><div id="00:02:15.040" class="transcript_line"> in the centre of Cardiff, in Queen Street and of course the traditional can-can, we</div><div id="00:02:21.240" class="transcript_line"> had the music, but it&#039;s that fantastic, what can I say, Apache war-whooping split at the</div><div id="00:02:29.520" class="transcript_line"> end.</div><div id="00:02:30.520" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking, well if Two Losers Trek was here now, the absence would be on him, putting</div><div id="00:02:36.920" class="transcript_line"> you on the spot, would you care to give us a can-can, what&#039;s that noise like as you</div><div id="00:02:42.920" class="transcript_line"> girls finally go hit the day?</div><div id="00:02:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, that was exactly it, in one.</div><div id="00:02:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Of course carnival, even the carnival, has had many different formats and many different</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> routes, the carnival camp has changed etc.</div><div id="00:03:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Back in 2012, no it was when we first started working again together, the idea was to broaden</div><div id="00:03:08.240" class="transcript_line"> carnival and bring in other groups and the rest of it and I can remember going the December</div><div id="00:03:15.880" class="transcript_line"> before, so it would be December 2011, to the Masonic Lodge and I haven&#039;t been to, I think</div><div id="00:03:25.880" class="transcript_line"> then you were the?</div><div id="00:03:26.880" class="transcript_line"> Burlesque Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Burlesque Cardiff, so I went to see Burlesque Cardiff to see what it was all about, I&#039;d</div><div id="00:03:34.200" class="transcript_line"> heard lots of good things, great night out, very very creative, very very humorous and</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> I went along and I just fell in love with you and your community group and I also saw</div><div id="00:03:47.040" class="transcript_line"> one thing there which I hadn&#039;t seen before and of course it was part of your crossover</div><div id="00:03:52.760" class="transcript_line"> between belly dancing and cabaret, was I saw my first ever pair of ISIS wings, would you</div><div id="00:04:00.840" class="transcript_line"> like to explain what an ISIS wing, where it comes from and what it looks like, because</div><div id="00:04:04.200" class="transcript_line"> even as we sit in the swicker office there&#039;s a whole bevy of them behind us in amazing</div><div id="00:04:08.600" class="transcript_line"> colours, so I hadn&#039;t seen one before and I just thought oh.</div><div id="00:04:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, well the ISIS wings, it&#039;s a belly dance prop, it doesn&#039;t actually have any historic</div><div id="00:04:21.800" class="transcript_line"> basis in belly dance, it&#039;s a completely modern prop that dancers use, it&#039;s a pleated, permanent</div><div id="00:04:30.600" class="transcript_line"> pleated cape which goes around the neck and it will open out to 360 degrees, so it will</div><div id="00:04:40.400" class="transcript_line"> make a complete circle, at least a decent one will make a complete circle or near enough,</div><div id="00:04:46.720" class="transcript_line"> so when you open the sides of the cape have got sticks in them, so when you lift the sticks</div><div id="00:04:53.360" class="transcript_line"> up you can make this big circle and you can make lovely shapes with your cape as you&#039;re</div><div id="00:05:00.680" class="transcript_line"> dancing.</div><div id="00:05:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was interesting because immediately I saw a point of contact with carnival and</div><div id="00:05:06.560" class="transcript_line"> one of my gurus, even to this day of creative carnival, is a man who revolutionised carnival</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> in Trinidad, a man called Peter Minchel who went on to do fabulous things, he reintroduced</div><div id="00:05:18.800" class="transcript_line"> the artist back into the Trinidad carnival, his group were part of not one but two Olympic</div><div id="00:05:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Games ceremony openings and his breakthrough movement was creating a costume called the</div><div id="00:05:32.520" class="transcript_line"> Hummingbird where you had those wings and you had the extension of them through the</div><div id="00:05:40.600" class="transcript_line"> hand and through the sticks and immediately I thought, oh my gosh that looks carnival-esque</div><div id="00:05:45.160" class="transcript_line"> for me and the fact that the Isis wings that you were performing with and which we have</div><div id="00:05:50.040" class="transcript_line"> adopted in a lot of our work were made in bright, shiny, scintillating colours which</div><div id="00:05:58.480" class="transcript_line"> really caught the light and were magical, so that was immediately one thing I was thinking</div><div id="00:06:03.480" class="transcript_line"> oh my goodness we&#039;ve got to get some of those in the wonderful world of carnival, I think</div><div id="00:06:08.560" class="transcript_line"> originally we ended up importing some via a belly dance organiser in South Wales but</div><div id="00:06:18.320" class="transcript_line"> importing them from Egypt. Yeah that was through Sue, that was through Sue who calls herself</div><div id="00:06:25.080" class="transcript_line"> Sophina in Newport and she&#039;s married to an Egyptian. This is just how times have changed</div><div id="00:06:32.840" class="transcript_line"> because actually now you were just, I mean this was only a few years ago, whereas now</div><div id="00:06:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Isis wings you would just easily, easily buy them off the internet directly. Yes and in fact</div><div id="00:06:42.080" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s ultimately what we do now. Yes well I think I certainly think that you and your group</div><div id="00:06:47.120" class="transcript_line"> were part of popularising them here in Wales because you know they were used them to such</div><div id="00:06:52.160" class="transcript_line"> good effect and it&#039;s that whole thing of carnival about how do you transform someone and make them</div><div id="00:06:58.320" class="transcript_line"> larger than life and a pair of Isis wings you know and the way they respond to movement it just</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> touched a chord in me immediately and I thought like oh these are these you know we&#039;ve got a lot</div><div id="00:07:08.320" class="transcript_line"> in common with these people. Yeah we started, I taught a workshop for the carnival crew didn&#039;t I</div><div id="00:07:14.800" class="transcript_line"> for your dances and chapter when you first got your Isis wings just kind of showing them you know</div><div id="00:07:20.480" class="transcript_line"> what you could do what the what the limitations were and how to use them which is fun but the</div><div id="00:07:26.320" class="transcript_line"> actual routine that you saw me do in the burlesque show must have been my war of the worlds</div><div id="00:07:34.640" class="transcript_line"> which sounds like the whole you know which is a real steampunk number which is</div><div id="00:07:38.320" class="transcript_line"> miles away from from from you know carnival. I&#039;m glad I made a leap. Yeah yeah you did make a real</div><div id="00:07:44.320" class="transcript_line"> leap because it was quite a tenuous one yeah yeah yeah great though. No I mean the other thing that</div><div id="00:07:51.440" class="transcript_line"> was quite obvious as I sat there in the Masonic Lodge in Cardiff equally was that here was a very</div><div id="00:07:58.320" class="transcript_line"> upbeat exciting group of people you know with you at the helm and perhaps we should come back to</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> your pivotal role a bit later but the the costumes and the props there was there was a</div><div id="00:08:11.600" class="transcript_line"> a crossover in terms of what can I say transforming dressing up with style and sass and pizzazz</div><div id="00:08:18.240" class="transcript_line"> and I was thinking oh you know here we are coming from we&#039;ve recently sort of left behind us</div><div id="00:08:26.560" class="transcript_line"> our principal international influence of being Caribbean carnival and we were very interested</div><div id="00:08:31.520" class="transcript_line"> at that time in taking on more of a Latin American feel to our work so particularly with</div><div id="00:08:37.360" class="transcript_line"> Adrian Spinola becoming our artistic coordinator of the carnival camp here in Cardiff and elsewhere</div><div id="00:08:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and his interest in headdresses again with the internet making feathers and sequins and braid</div><div id="00:08:51.680" class="transcript_line"> much more cheaply I mean you know feathers used to be an incredible luxury for us and now</div><div id="00:08:57.840" class="transcript_line"> we can import them from China at a massively reduced cost I always think there must be a</div><div id="00:09:03.440" class="transcript_line"> lot of very bald pheasants in China. I don&#039;t like to think about the animal husband</div><div id="00:09:08.320" class="transcript_line"> feathers. Absolutely so having done that I know you and I chatted and in the the format</div><div id="00:09:19.040" class="transcript_line"> that we had for 2012 onwards where we we returned to the city centre we had these street stages</div><div id="00:09:26.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean your groups you had two groups of course you had your balesque group</div><div id="00:09:31.040" class="transcript_line"> also your Persian bells belly dance group and if I mentioned the time warp from</div><div id="00:09:41.680" class="transcript_line"> the Rocky Horror Picture Show this is another standout moment for me so on the one hand</div><div id="00:09:45.840" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got the first and probably only time that the cam can has been performed with such energy</div><div id="00:09:53.680" class="transcript_line"> yeah right in the centre of Cardiff I mean yes there was an audience but as you know people</div><div id="00:09:59.600" class="transcript_line"> gathered I mean there were people coming out of the Queen&#039;s Arcade shopping centre and just</div><div id="00:10:04.720" class="transcript_line"> completely yeah their jaws dropped and you know that can-can moment but another standout moment</div><div id="00:10:12.320" class="transcript_line"> for me was let&#039;s do the time warp again what&#039;s that what&#039;s that bring back in terms of yes</div><div id="00:10:19.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah that was that was a great idea so the time warp is we dance the time warp with the with my</div><div id="00:10:25.200" class="transcript_line"> burlesque treat with the cabaret girls and it comes out quite a lot Halloween events it comes out at</div><div id="00:10:32.960" class="transcript_line"> our sci-fi shows and putting together we always with the carnival we always have a little bit</div><div id="00:10:39.600" class="transcript_line"> of an issue trying to put together routines that don&#039;t involve any striptease which is and</div><div id="00:10:46.080" class="transcript_line"> obviously the time warp we do it as as in the Rocky Horror Picture Show film and we keep our</div><div id="00:10:53.280" class="transcript_line"> clothes on and it&#039;s and it was it was it was great we did doing that in the carnival I think</div><div id="00:10:58.480" class="transcript_line"> was just the year before last of 14 I think yeah yeah it was a real real crowd pleaser and and</div><div id="00:11:09.120" class="transcript_line"> people remember it you know to do routines where people know the music and they you know the</div><div id="00:11:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Rocky Horror Picture Show what are we in the was it 40 years ago it came out Richard O&#039;Brien&#039;s got</div><div id="00:11:19.680" class="transcript_line"> a lot to answer for in a good way it&#039;s a part of a lot of people&#039;s you know childhood or</div><div id="00:11:28.240" class="transcript_line"> early years so people enjoy watching it and and it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s quirky you know the costumes</div><div id="00:11:35.600" class="transcript_line"> are fun and it&#039;s accessible for people so no it went down really well absolutely I mentioned that</div><div id="00:11:41.280" class="transcript_line"> the the the headdresses and particularly those with a sort of Latin American samba feel with feathers</div><div id="00:11:47.760" class="transcript_line"> has it has been something that&#039;s a crossover that both our art forms have enjoyed and certainly</div><div id="00:11:54.880" class="transcript_line"> Swickr Carnival organized specifically for your group headdress making workshops I remember on a</div><div id="00:12:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Saturday morning popping in to return some bank keys I&#039;d forgotten of course that there was another</div><div id="00:12:06.400" class="transcript_line"> sort of carnival workshop going on and this was the caged bra workshop I hadn&#039;t quite understood</div><div id="00:12:12.960" class="transcript_line"> what caged bra was until I opened the door would you care to elucidate yeah well we</div><div id="00:12:20.240" class="transcript_line"> we were going to do some work we did some other work with you which was going to be more carnival</div><div id="00:12:26.480" class="transcript_line"> more Rio style so I we had to do a swift learning curve I learned how to do a non-pay samba and</div><div id="00:12:38.960" class="transcript_line"> you know a basic samba and worked out a basic samba routine for for my performers who then needed</div><div id="00:12:45.760" class="transcript_line"> to be dressed and I think we did that in yeah we did that in one of the Burlesque art of shows and</div><div id="00:12:50.160" class="transcript_line"> when we did the same routine in the carnival so then the girls are looking at costumes and there&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:55.920" class="transcript_line"> all these amazing costumes on the internet yes they&#039;re seeing all the girls all the professional</div><div id="00:13:00.640" class="transcript_line"> dancers from Rio and the big carnivals and a lot of whom are wearing caged bras so it&#039;s like an</div><div id="00:13:07.520" class="transcript_line"> underwire so it&#039;s the underwire of your bra and so the underwire is kind of keeping the boobs</div><div id="00:13:15.280" class="transcript_line"> up and then you&#039;ve got which is always good and then you have pattern within that the the cup</div><div id="00:13:21.520" class="transcript_line"> shape so it might be a flower or a star or or whatever pattern you&#039;ve got all this is made with</div><div id="00:13:27.040" class="transcript_line"> wire which is then covered with tape and then embellished and decorated so it&#039;s an it&#039;s an</div><div id="00:13:35.360" class="transcript_line"> underwire I mean it could be as as naked or as covered as you wanted it to be but it&#039;s very much</div><div id="00:13:40.720" class="transcript_line"> a sort of a staple of the um of the traditional you know Brazilian sort of samba um carnival</div><div id="00:13:50.960" class="transcript_line"> and and what&#039;s great is is through doing that doing the workshops with the girls so I just and</div><div id="00:13:56.320" class="transcript_line"> I was actually teaching a samba work you know a weekly class for a while here in chapter</div><div id="00:14:01.280" class="transcript_line"> um I had um Mitzi come over from Bristol teach me and then I taught my my girls and and um and</div><div id="00:14:10.480" class="transcript_line"> found what I could on YouTube and stuff and taught you know for for for six months uh kind</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> of explored the whole sort of samba samba side of things what was nice was Mitzi then picked</div><div id="00:14:21.760" class="transcript_line"> off one of my dancers Gillian and Gillian you know works as a samba dancer for Mitzi where Mitzi needs</div><div id="00:14:30.160" class="transcript_line"> professional performers for her you know her the gigs she gets in restaurants or or whatever it</div><div id="00:14:35.200" class="transcript_line"> being so through us having the link together you know we brought that awareness of of the authentic</div><div id="00:14:44.240" class="transcript_line"> cabaret costumes to the I don&#039;t know 50 or whatever girls I was teaching at that time</div><div id="00:14:50.720" class="transcript_line"> some of which wanted to explore it further and came and did samba classes and actually learn a</div><div id="00:14:55.120" class="transcript_line"> proper to do the proper samba step and some of which went off and actually performed you know are</div><div id="00:15:00.320" class="transcript_line"> you know for want of a better word professional samba dancers with full costumes and and a little</div><div id="00:15:05.200" class="transcript_line"> costumes as well but they made themselves you know some of these samba costumes you see them on the</div><div id="00:15:11.200" class="transcript_line"> internet and they are amazing but we&#039;re looking at there&#039;s you know 400 500 quid with amazing</div><div id="00:15:16.880" class="transcript_line"> headdresses you know the g strings the the thong bottoms the underwire the cuffs and the headdress</div><div id="00:15:23.920" class="transcript_line"> you know and the the things on the shins as well but you know Gillian made all her own costume you</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> know a bit of help from swicker well a lot of help from swicker a lot of help madrian and a glue gun</div><div id="00:15:36.080" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re off as she&#039;s away and that&#039;s 500 saved and it&#039;s amazing what you do a little bit</div><div id="00:15:40.560" class="transcript_line"> gardening wire isn&#039;t it amazing when you do gardening wire and you know yeah it takes the</div><div id="00:15:45.520" class="transcript_line"> whole it takes people&#039;s experience of dance and where it&#039;s going to go where it will lead so we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:15:52.800" class="transcript_line"> done every single every so many different styles for swicker everything from the time walk to the</div><div id="00:15:56.880" class="transcript_line"> can can to you know samba dances um yeah it&#039;s been great um obviously uh when you&#039;ve been performing</div><div id="00:16:06.960" class="transcript_line"> with card of carnival which is very much a a family orientated as you say uh no striptease no</div><div id="00:16:12.880" class="transcript_line"> titillation i think it&#039;s safe to say that uh uh you know uh we were we were both in family friendly</div><div id="00:16:19.040" class="transcript_line"> mode oh definitely um burlesque in cardiff in wales um i always refer to you as the godmother</div><div id="00:16:27.520" class="transcript_line"> of the the welsh burlesque scene uh i i yes how did you get into it and and perhaps</div><div id="00:16:36.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah is it even now understood i mean uh what what kind of barriers have you met historically and</div><div id="00:16:43.120" class="transcript_line"> and do they exist now or whatever so um i got into burlesque as i was teaching a lot of belly</div><div id="00:16:53.040" class="transcript_line"> dance i i was uh living in turkey married to a turk and and got into belly dance that way</div><div id="00:17:02.240"

class="transcript_line"> people started to come in and teach belly dance um and you know the the whole you know with the</div><div id="00:17:29.120" class="transcript_line"> internet things get uh people are seeing more and the whole thing has become slightly more diluted</div><div id="00:17:35.040" class="transcript_line"> at the same time um i met my partner robert um so that must have been about eight years ago from</div><div id="00:17:44.720" class="transcript_line"> now well my background before moving to turkey was um very much commercial theater so cabaret</div><div id="00:17:52.960" class="transcript_line"> floor shows pantomime summer seasons um musical my training was in musical theater um and i you know</div><div id="00:18:01.680" class="transcript_line">

really</div><div id="00:18:20.560" class="transcript_line"> just coming from that jobbing background well it made perfect sense when there was this burlesque</div><div id="00:18:24.800" class="transcript_line"> revival for me to think well this is my background you know i&#039;ve got the belly dance i&#039;ve got the</div><div id="00:18:29.840" class="transcript_line"> bumps and grinds i&#039;ve got the physicality um and then there&#039;s all this other stuff there&#039;s the</div><div id="00:18:36.560" class="transcript_line"> all this you know the the showgirl stuff the jazz dance the funky stuff that i&#039;ve done</div><div id="00:18:44.080" class="transcript_line"> in my work as a commercial dancer um you know from the age of sort of 19 to sort of i suppose</div><div id="00:18:50.880" class="transcript_line"> 27 when i moved to 28 so i have all that all those different um genres behind me so actually to</div><div id="00:18:59.920" class="transcript_line"> then go i didn&#039;t think about necessarily burlesque we were cabaret when i started the classes and i</div><div id="00:19:05.760" class="transcript_line"> think the first class i did was with my belly dance group and that was mine hair again which</div><div id="00:19:10.240" class="transcript_line"> has been a great staple that&#039;s come out we&#039;ve done it at the carnival we&#039;ve done all over the place</div><div id="00:19:14.320" class="transcript_line"> um and then from mine hair i i did a few choice i did a few solos um i did the mariontonette solo</div><div id="00:19:22.800" class="transcript_line"> i did little red riding herd i did just a few solos um as a burlesque performer but there was</div><div id="00:19:30.080" class="transcript_line"> burlesque there was the um in carnival before i started because i remember going to see um lady</div><div id="00:19:37.440" class="transcript_line"> lollipop and um johnny cage&#039;s ex-wife um at minskies when it was what the butler saw i don&#039;t know if</div><div id="00:19:47.760" class="transcript_line"> you ever went to any of those so there was there were i went to minskies i didn&#039;t catch that there</div><div id="00:19:51.920" class="transcript_line"> was a little bit of an underground burlesque movement but i think what i did was i kind of</div><div id="00:19:57.360" class="transcript_line"> um branded myself as burlesque cardiff which was a little bit like it was a big which is a good</div><div id="00:20:03.520" class="transcript_line"> thing to do and because my background has always been teaching i had this big band of ladies around</div><div id="00:20:08.560" class="transcript_line"> me coming to classes those people then became in the went into the shows and then through those</div><div id="00:20:14.480" class="transcript_line"> lessons we&#039;ve had some amazing international performers have come through so we&#039;ve had</div><div id="00:20:19.600" class="transcript_line"> the likes of sandy shaw who you know is all over the place we&#039;ve got betty blue eyes who&#039;s a</div><div id="00:20:24.400" class="transcript_line"> fantastic international performer barry island who&#039;s my drag king we&#039;ve got had katie von cupcakes</div><div id="00:20:32.800" class="transcript_line"> yee-hee sexton we&#039;ve had a lot of again gillian who is is uh epic so she&#039;s you know bonita boudoir</div><div id="00:20:40.080" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s going to be in the culture wars at my festival in november so it&#039;s it&#039;s created this</div><div id="00:20:45.600" class="transcript_line"> real um this real little sort of workhouse of performers and shows and you know the amount of</div><div id="00:20:52.960" class="transcript_line"> material that you know we&#039;ve done over the last eight years with sort of i don&#039;t know how many</div><div id="00:20:57.280" class="transcript_line"> shows a year probably about five five or six different shows a year um always putting out</div><div id="00:21:03.440" class="transcript_line"> always pumping out new material yes i mean to some people but particularly those who well</div><div id="00:21:08.720" class="transcript_line"> exclusively those who actually haven&#039;t been to see what you do they in their minds i have some</div><div id="00:21:14.720" class="transcript_line"> kind of sleazy connotations whereas it seems to me quite plain and particularly you know when you</div><div id="00:21:20.560" class="transcript_line"> meet the group and then get a sense of who these women are what they&#039;re getting out of it and the</div><div id="00:21:26.480" class="transcript_line"> way they treat each other um don&#039;t put words in your mouth but yes where would you say it&#039;s</div><div id="00:21:32.560" class="transcript_line"> coming from you know faced with that criticism all that all that unfounded prejudice i mean i</div><div id="00:21:38.400" class="transcript_line"> think it is i think it&#039;s quite threatening for people when they&#039;re not involved in it and i</div><div id="00:21:43.040" class="transcript_line"> think when i i know talking talking to people who i think you know at the school gates who i think</div><div id="00:21:48.400" class="transcript_line"> are going to be you know um we have we have a friendship and i think that they&#039;re just about</div><div id="00:21:53.200" class="transcript_line"> this is the right time to tell them you have to judge the moment um but i am actually koo koo</div><div id="00:21:57.920" class="transcript_line"> labelle and i&#039;m a international burlesque performer it it&#039;s it&#039;s people don&#039;t really want to</div><div id="00:22:04.960" class="transcript_line"> know they want to think oh that&#039;s stephanie that&#039;s meg&#039;s mum they don&#039;t want to think about you as a</div><div id="00:22:11.440" class="transcript_line"> striptease artist when they see what i do when they see me come in say as the butterfly in my</div><div id="00:22:18.160" class="transcript_line"> cocoon crawling along the floor i mean there&#039;s a lot of humor in your work and in the group&#039;s work</div><div id="00:22:23.120" class="transcript_line"> my work there&#039;s there&#039;s an awful lot of humor yes um and and i think burlesque it&#039;s it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:22:30.880" class="transcript_line"> striptease and it&#039;s not necessarily very even very sexy and i think this is what people have told me</div><div id="00:22:37.920" class="transcript_line"> when they&#039;ve seen the shows in the nicest possible way no absolutely that&#039;s great fun but it&#039;s it&#039;s</div><div id="00:22:43.760" class="transcript_line"> not sexy because the girls are so in control so it&#039;s not like you&#039;re watching anything that&#039;s</div><div id="00:22:50.800" class="transcript_line"> particularly pornographic or anything like that unless you you know you might have a performer who</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> who has that sexuality but they&#039;re always dressed to a degree yeah and let&#039;s say there&#039;s no full</div><div id="00:23:03.040" class="transcript_line"> nudity there&#039;s no nudity you know we&#039;re we&#039;re by law not allowed to show any genitalia which</div><div id="00:23:08.320" class="transcript_line"> includes clues areola so there&#039;s no nipples on display there&#039;s no nothing on display the</div><div id="00:23:13.760" class="transcript_line"> costumes can get very very risque but it&#039;s all to do with the with the um the environment that</div><div id="00:23:19.760" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re putting on the shows and how the shows and how the acts are set up um saying that you know we</div><div id="00:23:24.960" class="transcript_line"> have some brilliant soloists and we invite people to perform with us who are internationally known</div><div id="00:23:31.200" class="transcript_line"> and very very very high standard standard very high caliber of performers but the group that performs</div><div id="00:23:37.680" class="transcript_line"> um it&#039;s rare that everybody who comes to my class wants to do a full striptease and actually bear</div><div id="00:23:44.240" class="transcript_line"> all and the women i think get an awful lot of you know for me as a person it&#039;s made me a lot</div><div id="00:23:49.280" class="transcript_line"> more empowered and a lot more aware of my sexuality and women&#039;s sexuality as a whole um</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and i think that&#039;s what they get out of it i think that&#039;s what the women get out of it who come to</div><div id="00:23:59.200" class="transcript_line"> the classes and and other professional performers i know are very um i don&#039;t want to buzz things</div><div id="00:24:05.440" class="transcript_line"> about um you know are amazingly sort of strong strong women no i i i as i say i mean one of the</div><div id="00:24:12.080" class="transcript_line"> things i like about the group is the group identity yeah the way they look after each other</div><div id="00:24:17.760" class="transcript_line"> as you say strong independent and but also a cohesive group um and and the last thing i</div><div id="00:24:24.160" class="transcript_line"> associate with you know yes anybody who&#039;s hoping for some kind of uh what can i say uh dark erotic</div><div id="00:24:32.240" class="transcript_line"> buzz is is it&#039;s far more likely to get yeah is it i don&#039;t associate burlesque and as you brought it</div><div id="00:24:38.640" class="transcript_line"> and made it popular in cardiff with salacious material far more with belly laughing and grinning</div><div id="00:24:44.560" class="transcript_line"> and and cheering at the people joining in and supporting there&#039;s there&#039;s nothing you know the</div><div id="00:24:50.960" class="transcript_line"> dirty macro brigade are never going to fight they&#039;re never going to get their kicks through</div><div id="00:24:55.360" class="transcript_line"> through this art form it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s you know no it&#039;s it&#039;s far more loving and warm and and uh</div><div id="00:25:02.560" class="transcript_line"> yes and humorous i mean if anything it mocks sexuality in in in that sort of carnival fool</div><div id="00:25:09.360" class="transcript_line"> for a day type routine it turns things on its head it does and and actually burlesque means satire</div><div id="00:25:15.120" class="transcript_line"> so that&#039;s what it&#039;s meant meant to mean and it you know it it can be dark i mean i&#039;ve got some sort</div><div id="00:25:21.440" class="transcript_line"> of you know like the my pris act yes tris is dark and she&#039;s very she&#039;s a very erotic figure</div><div id="00:25:28.240" class="transcript_line"> which is completely untouchable um so so it&#039;s just it&#039;s playing is playing with and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:25:35.440" class="transcript_line"> what i love about the burlesque and the cabaret um format is it&#039;s rather like a carnival passing</div><div id="00:25:42.560" class="transcript_line"> you you&#039;ve got you know something&#039;s in front of you it&#039;s there for five minutes and then something</div><div id="00:25:46.720" class="transcript_line"> else is coming along so if you don&#039;t like that no there&#039;d be something else but so is a feast for</div><div id="00:25:50.880" class="transcript_line"> the eye it&#039;s the creativity the costumes you know as you say i mean you come on in a</div><div id="00:25:56.480" class="transcript_line"> a morphed sleeping bag as a cocoon it&#039;s like what you know how is this gonna and then very very</div><div id="00:26:03.280" class="transcript_line"> cleverly you know it moves on and and and a show where performance is given and uh you only have</div><div id="00:26:09.040" class="transcript_line"> to listen to the cheering at the end to know that yeah message given and understood you know yeah</div><div id="00:26:14.160" class="transcript_line"> and i think when you&#039;re going back to the group and the cohesiveness of the group what what really</div><div id="00:26:19.920" class="transcript_line"> keeps the us all going after eight years is the friendships and the connections that arise in</div><div id="00:26:24.800" class="transcript_line"> that group and what&#039;s interesting as a teacher and somebody who&#039;s leading these this troop along</div><div id="00:26:29.520" class="transcript_line"> is to see relationships develop within the group and little supporting networks develop within the</div><div id="00:26:35.200" class="transcript_line"> groups that have coped with cancer and bereavement and divorce and all sorts of stuff within within</div><div id="00:26:42.720" class="transcript_line"> that group um and i think that&#039;s i feel mentally proud of them for making those connections and</div><div id="00:26:50.640" class="transcript_line"> for making their world a bit brighter and giving themselves coping mechanisms with each other</div><div id="00:26:57.120" class="transcript_line"> so it is a little bit a self-help help group but it works very well on all sides um stef thank you</div><div id="00:27:05.600" class="transcript_line"> so much for that interview um i am pleased to declare on behalf of carnival that you are now</div><div id="00:27:11.520" class="transcript_line"> officially a carnival hero uh i&#039;m sure you&#039;re going to accept this verbal award on behalf of</div><div id="00:27:18.640" class="transcript_line"> yourself and the uh the broader group which we still like the nickname because uh uh the burley</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> girls yeah the burley girls the burley girls uh will always be close to our carnival hearts</div><div id="00:27:29.680" class="transcript_line"> thank you very much indeed</div></div></p>
