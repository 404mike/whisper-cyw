    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, I&#039;m Sharon and I work at Mencap but for the last nine years I&#039;ve been the</div><div id="00:00:08.360" class="transcript_line"> leader of Masquerade which is an integrated theatre company for people</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> with and without learning disabilities based here in Llanfellin.</div><div id="00:00:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to introduce yourself Rob?</div><div id="00:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Hi, I&#039;m Rob.</div><div id="00:00:24.560" class="transcript_line"> And where do you live Rob?</div><div id="00:00:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Llanfellin.</div><div id="00:00:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Now Rob, I&#039;ve been leading Masquerade like I just said for about, this is my ninth year</div><div id="00:00:36.560" class="transcript_line"> but you have been doing Masquerade longer than that.</div><div id="00:00:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m going to be in charge of it this time.</div><div id="00:00:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Great, I think that would be perfect.</div><div id="00:00:43.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll be the teacher.</div><div id="00:00:44.560" class="transcript_line"> When it comes to me to say bye bye, my work here is done.</div><div id="00:00:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll have to pass it over to you Rob.</div><div id="00:00:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:50.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve been a brilliant leader.</div><div id="00:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:52.560" class="transcript_line"> So tell me what do you really like doing in Masquerade?</div><div id="00:00:56.560" class="transcript_line"> What are your favourite things out of all the things that we do?</div><div id="00:01:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Shall I remind you of some of the things we do?</div><div id="00:01:04.560" class="transcript_line"> First and foremost we are performers.</div><div id="00:01:07.560" class="transcript_line"> So we act, we sing, we dance, but we also do lots of art things don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:01:16.560" class="transcript_line"> We make scenery and we make props.</div><div id="00:01:19.560" class="transcript_line"> So out of all them, which are the things that really fire you up?</div><div id="00:01:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Which things do you really like doing?</div><div id="00:01:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Could it be the acting and the singing?</div><div id="00:01:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Because when I see you, you take it all so seriously, you get all your fantastic costumes</div><div id="00:01:36.560" class="transcript_line"> and your masks and then you perform with complete focus out to the audience.</div><div id="00:01:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you enjoy doing that?</div><div id="00:01:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Why do you enjoy performing so much?</div><div id="00:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know?</div><div id="00:01:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Is it just something that comes naturally to you?</div><div id="00:01:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;re right because out of everybody in Masquerade, all you need to do is put on</div><div id="00:02:02.560" class="transcript_line"> some item of clothing or costume and you just become that character in your body straight away.</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And even on Zoom, which is much more difficult to be focused on,</div><div id="00:02:16.560" class="transcript_line"> sometimes you&#039;ve come on and you&#039;ve come on in a mask or a costume and you&#039;ve literally</div><div id="00:02:23.560" class="transcript_line"> stayed in that mask and been in that character for the whole of Zoom.</div><div id="00:02:28.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:02:29.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re so good at getting into characters and being other people.</div><div id="00:02:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:02:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So tell us something about singing because you really love singing as well, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:02:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:41.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just showing my voice.</div><div id="00:02:42.560" class="transcript_line"> How&#039;s it?</div><div id="00:02:43.560" class="transcript_line"> It could tickle there.</div><div id="00:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> You have to do some voice warm-ups.</div><div id="00:02:46.560" class="transcript_line"> What do we do for warming up voices?</div><div id="00:02:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Mmm.</div><div id="00:02:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Mmm.</div><div id="00:02:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Or aah.</div><div id="00:02:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Or la la la la la.</div><div id="00:03:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Fabulous.</div><div id="00:03:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Well done.</div><div id="00:03:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:03.560" class="transcript_line"> So when we do our Masquerade performances, what are your favourite songs that you like to sing?</div><div id="00:03:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Mmm.</div><div id="00:03:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m thinking about musicals really.</div><div id="00:03:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s why I got a CD at home.</div><div id="00:03:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Mmm.</div><div id="00:03:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So out of all the things we&#039;ve done, all the songs we&#039;ve sung, what was your favourite</div><div id="00:03:25.560" class="transcript_line"> song that you&#039;ve ever done?</div><div id="00:03:27.560" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s Joseph and Lesley.</div><div id="00:03:30.560" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve got a DVD now.</div><div id="00:03:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:33.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a real one this time.</div><div id="00:03:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic.</div><div id="00:03:35.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;re brilliant.</div><div id="00:03:36.560" class="transcript_line"> I know you&#039;re a big fan of Les Mis.</div><div id="00:03:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I know you&#039;ve seen it like a hundred, probably a hundred times.</div><div id="00:03:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:43.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not going in London yet because there are no trains running yet.</div><div id="00:03:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And the theatres haven&#039;t opened yet either.</div><div id="00:03:49.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:03:50.560" class="transcript_line"> All series B ones.</div><div id="00:03:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Because Dermot&#039;s going to book one in series B.</div><div id="00:03:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they&#039;re meant to be opening later this month.</div><div id="00:03:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:57.560" class="transcript_line"> I think it will be, Be Dean the Beast.</div><div id="00:03:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m going to be sitting right at the front.</div><div id="00:04:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:04:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I just wanted to talk about your favourite song that you sang when you had the lead part,</div><div id="00:04:10.560" class="transcript_line"> which was Any Dream Will Do, and Joseph.</div><div id="00:04:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us if you enjoyed that?</div><div id="00:04:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we must do it again.</div><div id="00:04:19.560" class="transcript_line"> You were fantastic.</div><div id="00:04:20.560" class="transcript_line"> You had your beautiful multicoloured dream coat on.</div><div id="00:04:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Did my dad come to it?</div><div id="00:04:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, your dad came to it.</div><div id="00:04:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And he was so impressed afterwards because it was the first time you&#039;d done a solo.</div><div id="00:04:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Normally, you were always in the group and the chorus.</div><div id="00:04:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think the light was shining in my eyes.</div><div id="00:04:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, on the stage, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:04:41.560" class="transcript_line"> The light shining in your eyes.</div><div id="00:04:43.560" class="transcript_line"> So you were very brave, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:04:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Very brave.</div><div id="00:04:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And you took it on.</div><div id="00:04:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I didn&#039;t need to go for a week because you know how to hold it in.</div><div id="00:04:53.560" class="transcript_line"> No, and you know what&#039;s really good is, Rob, since I began...</div><div id="00:04:57.560" class="transcript_line"> I was flaredesh with her, wasn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:04:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Since I began, you used to get so nervous at the beginning of shows.</div><div id="00:05:02.560" class="transcript_line"> You were just almost so anxious.</div><div id="00:05:05.560" class="transcript_line"> I was going to be sick.</div><div id="00:05:07.560" class="transcript_line"> You were going to be sick.</div><div id="00:05:08.560" class="transcript_line"> You wanted to go to the loo all the time and it was really almost so difficult for you.</div><div id="00:05:13.560" class="transcript_line"> But I think over the years, you&#039;ve got much, much better.</div><div id="00:05:18.560" class="transcript_line"> So I wouldn&#039;t say you&#039;re relaxed now, but I would say you&#039;re so much more confident.</div><div id="00:05:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you agree with that?</div><div id="00:05:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;re so confident in your performances.</div><div id="00:05:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Because when I look back at all those DVDs of all the shows, you really stand out</div><div id="00:05:34.560" class="transcript_line"> because your performances are so out there, so confident, so focused.</div><div id="00:05:40.560" class="transcript_line"> You know exactly what to do and you do it.</div><div id="00:05:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And it looks amazing.</div><div id="00:05:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And the audience, they just believe it.</div><div id="00:05:49.560" class="transcript_line"> They believe in everything you&#039;re doing and it&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:05:52.560" class="transcript_line"> So well done, you.</div><div id="00:05:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So I also thought we could just have a quick talk about all the places in Lambethlin that we&#039;ve performed.</div><div id="00:06:00.560" class="transcript_line"> So I think since it&#039;s begun, we&#039;ve done St. Muthlin&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> So can you remember what we&#039;d usually do at St. Muthlin&#039;s Day in the town?</div><div id="00:06:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the parade.</div><div id="00:06:11.560" class="transcript_line"> We must do that again.</div><div id="00:06:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we must do that again. We do the parade.</div><div id="00:06:14.560" class="transcript_line"> So what do we do in the parade as masqueraders?</div><div id="00:06:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, we get our instruments and our drums and we dress up, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:06:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And we go all together in a long train.</div><div id="00:06:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes we&#039;ve got...</div><div id="00:06:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, the Maverick one.</div><div id="00:06:32.560" class="transcript_line"> And that as well, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes we&#039;ve got our cups.</div><div id="00:06:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And especially when they wind up.</div><div id="00:06:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Cup.</div><div id="00:06:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Trophy, it&#039;s gone back to Nicola.</div><div id="00:06:42.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s gone back to...</div><div id="00:06:43.560" class="transcript_line"> The Maverick show.</div><div id="00:06:44.560" class="transcript_line"> For the best costume.</div><div id="00:06:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, so we must get that back again.</div><div id="00:06:48.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know who&#039;s going to win it now.</div><div id="00:06:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:06:51.560" class="transcript_line"> It won&#039;t be me this time.</div><div id="00:06:52.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be on this year, Rob, so don&#039;t worry about that.</div><div id="00:06:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, we performed at Myford.</div><div id="00:06:57.560" class="transcript_line"> We did Space and we did the Plastic Queen, remember, the environmental show.</div><div id="00:07:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Did a couple of shows at Myford and we paraded a little bit there, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:07:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And where else have we done?</div><div id="00:07:09.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done there, we&#039;ve done the town in St. Muthlin&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:07:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Crosskeys.</div><div id="00:07:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:07:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And we did a performance in the Crosskeys, a fundraiser.</div><div id="00:07:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you bet.</div><div id="00:07:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Next time, make sure it&#039;s been the right place.</div><div id="00:07:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I think maybe we could do it in Newtown for a change.</div><div id="00:07:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we could.</div><div id="00:07:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so sugar mom could actually come out and watch it.</div><div id="00:07:33.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve done one in Newtown just before I started at the Monty Club.</div><div id="00:07:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Remember that, with Iris?</div><div id="00:07:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;d better do that again and go outside.</div><div id="00:07:41.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll talk to Sian about that.</div><div id="00:07:42.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good idea, something in Newtown.</div><div id="00:07:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Outside, yeah, in that lovely park there.</div><div id="00:07:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that would be a really good idea.</div><div id="00:07:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll do that.</div><div id="00:07:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, brilliant.</div><div id="00:07:52.560" class="transcript_line"> So mom could see it this time.</div><div id="00:07:56.560" class="transcript_line"> She could come out from the shop and I think that&#039;d be quite nice for her to come out too.</div><div id="00:08:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and see you in Newtown, because you grew up in Newtown, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:08:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so not too far away.</div><div id="00:08:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant idea.</div><div id="00:08:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, is there anything else you&#039;d like to talk about to do with Masquerade?</div><div id="00:08:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Anything else you&#039;d like to do?</div><div id="00:08:17.560" class="transcript_line"> We have done a lot of things, I have to say.</div><div id="00:08:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Looking back, we&#039;ve done pirates, ghosts, around the world in 59 minutes.</div><div id="00:08:26.560" class="transcript_line"> What else have we done?</div><div id="00:08:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Fairy tales.</div><div id="00:08:29.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done the Greeks, Here Come the Greeks.</div><div id="00:08:31.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the last one we did, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And do you know that Masquerade in the town is very valued by people?</div><div id="00:08:39.560" class="transcript_line"> People absolutely love coming to see Masquerade, because more than anything else, they say it really cheers them up.</div><div id="00:08:46.560" class="transcript_line"> I have people saying Masquerade is like the local panto when we do our Christmas show.</div><div id="00:08:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Bless you.</div><div id="00:08:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that&#039;s why we always get a good audience, really, because people want to come and see you, because you make them happy.</div><div id="00:09:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, I love it.</div><div id="00:09:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there we go.</div><div id="00:09:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Right then, well, it&#039;s been lovely to chat, and let&#039;s hope Masquerade comes back soon, in all its glory.</div><div id="00:09:14.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been OK on Zoom, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:16.560" class="transcript_line"> At least we&#039;ve kept in touch with each other and seen each other.</div><div id="00:09:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:21.560" class="transcript_line"> How have you found it on the computer?</div><div id="00:09:24.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:09:25.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve enjoyed it, yeah, good, good.</div><div id="00:09:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen on mum&#039;s iPad?</div><div id="00:09:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:09:33.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen you on mum&#039;s iPad, yeah, you often come on when you&#039;re at mum&#039;s.</div><div id="00:09:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I left mine behind.</div><div id="00:09:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:09:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll get you on next week on somebody&#039;s computer, it&#039;ll be fine.</div><div id="00:09:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, brilliant. Well, it&#039;s lovely to chat, Rob.</div><div id="00:09:49.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll see you next Wednesday, Masquerade, 6.30 on Zoom.</div></div></p>
