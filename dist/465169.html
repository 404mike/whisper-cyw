    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in London at the time and I couldn&#039;t believe it really. I had no idea.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know where Abervane was, but I remember sitting reading it on the paper and then seeing the dreadful, dreadful things.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That actually was another big thing, wasn&#039;t it? But I remember Abervane very, very clearly. I had no idea how bad it was.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I came up here, talking to Welsh people, I came from a place like Caerphilly and so on, just down the road.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They told us what it was like and how dangerous it was with all the things overhanging the valley.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to say, oh, we knew it was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was something like, again, you live in London, you don&#039;t know much about Wales.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not patronising, you just don&#039;t. You just don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember anything you particularly saw in the coverage on television?</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I remember that. Some of the families were interviewed.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the details, but I can remember these totally distraught people who just couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The parents of the kids and so on who died in the school.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they spoke in this much stronger accent, which we aren&#039;t familiar with.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And the shots of the slurry and so on.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a guy called Harry Webb, I seem to remember, who spoke very powerfully about it.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> More than powerfully, he was very, very angry.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He wanted to, I think he wanted to charge the National Cold War with murder, I think.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure about that, but it was very, very emotional.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the emotion came over off the television very strongly.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So actually that was probably as strong as the moon landing.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div></div></p>
