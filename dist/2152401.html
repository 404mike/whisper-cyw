    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Today is Friday the 17th of November 2023 and we are in Fun at the Fair or of the Fair?</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Fun of the Flair.</div><div id="00:00:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Fun of the Flair has been hard again.</div><div id="00:00:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Could you introduce yourselves?</div><div id="00:00:18.960" class="transcript_line"> I am Bethan Mererik-Kent and I&#039;m Creative Director of Abicon and our Animation Group.</div><div id="00:00:26.920" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m Rowan Alleyne with Bethan.</div><div id="00:00:29.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m co-founder of Kedicom Animation Group and Abicon under the umbrella of WOW, Wales</div><div id="00:00:38.240" class="transcript_line"> One World Film Festival.</div><div id="00:00:42.140" class="transcript_line"> So how did you both meet each other?</div><div id="00:00:45.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve always had a fascination with animation ever since I was a kid.</div><div id="00:00:55.360" class="transcript_line"> I grew up with Disney and then it gradually came to anime and Japanese animation.</div><div id="00:01:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And we kind of met because I wore a Sprite t-shirt since I&#039;m a fan of My Neighbor Totoro</div><div id="00:01:14.760" class="transcript_line"> is my favorite Ghibli film.</div><div id="00:01:18.920" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I wore the t-shirt and I&#039;m very much confident in anime at the moment.</div><div id="00:01:32.640" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, I met Rowan because of a t-shirt and you were working part-time with</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> learning disabilities at the time?</div><div id="00:01:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, at the time I&#039;d recently moved back to Cardigan, which is where I grew up in here</div><div id="00:01:55.120" class="transcript_line"> as well.</div><div id="00:01:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And I started to work for ClinV Carefob and I was supporting a gentleman who was coming</div><div id="00:02:04.080" class="transcript_line"> along to Gateway Clubs, which you&#039;re a key part in.</div><div id="00:02:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I am.</div><div id="00:02:11.640" class="transcript_line"> So really we would just be there and hanging out and socializing.</div><div id="00:02:15.560" class="transcript_line"> And I spotted this young woman with a Totoro t-shirt on and I was like, you like Ghibli?</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I like Ghibli.</div><div id="00:02:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And that was kind of...</div><div id="00:02:27.440" class="transcript_line"> Our conversation was endless.</div><div id="00:02:30.400" class="transcript_line"> We talked about a lot of things.</div><div id="00:02:32.320" class="transcript_line"> And one of the main things is because I&#039;ve been going to London Comic Con and anime conventions</div><div id="00:02:41.360" class="transcript_line"> my teenager years.</div><div id="00:02:44.480" class="transcript_line"> And I always thought, why do I have to come to Comic Con in London even though I still</div><div id="00:02:51.200" class="transcript_line"> do it?</div><div id="00:02:52.200" class="transcript_line"> I still go to London Comic Con.</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> I just thought, why not have it here in Cardigan, my home county?</div><div id="00:03:04.880" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a lot of buzz.</div><div id="00:03:06.560" class="transcript_line"> There are anime fans in Cardigan.</div><div id="00:03:09.520" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s thousands of us, I think.</div><div id="00:03:12.840" class="transcript_line"> And so we were talking about that, weren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:03:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:17.320" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, the reason I realized, well, I recognized the characters on Beth Ann&#039;s t-shirt</div><div id="00:03:23.200" class="transcript_line"> was because, well, A, I worked for a film festival, freelance.</div><div id="00:03:30.600" class="transcript_line"> And B, when I was a student, I went to Japan and I studied Japanese language and culture.</div><div id="00:03:37.560" class="transcript_line"> So in those days, it was probably more of a rarity to have anime fans.</div><div id="00:03:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but now it&#039;s mainstream now.</div><div id="00:03:47.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the most popular media.</div><div id="00:03:49.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s even beaten comic books and DC and stuff like that because I&#039;m not going</div><div id="00:03:56.200" class="transcript_line"> into that dilemma.</div><div id="00:03:57.200" class="transcript_line"> That dilemma, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s mainstream now.</div><div id="00:04:01.920" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s like a real conversation starter, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:04.960" class="transcript_line"> What anime do you like?</div><div id="00:04:06.920" class="transcript_line"> You used to ask, what music do you like?</div><div id="00:04:08.720" class="transcript_line"> But now these days, it&#039;s like, what anime are you into?</div><div id="00:04:10.960" class="transcript_line"> And then you can kind of get an idea of what level people are on, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:04:15.640" class="transcript_line"> It brings people together, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:18.120" class="transcript_line"> Common interest.</div><div id="00:04:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but there are still people that probably see what kind of music you&#039;re into as well.</div><div id="00:04:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, true.</div><div id="00:04:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, true, true.</div><div id="00:04:28.360" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, we got to know each other.</div><div id="00:04:30.640" class="transcript_line"> It was quite gradual, wasn&#039;t it, over the course of a few months?</div><div id="00:04:34.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:36.920" class="transcript_line"> And then I think I came to Bethan with a bit of a proposal, really.</div><div id="00:04:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Because I heard about her ideas for Habacon.</div><div id="00:04:47.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:48.280" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, let&#039;s see if we can do it as part of the festival.</div><div id="00:04:53.480" class="transcript_line"> So we made it happen.</div><div id="00:04:57.280" class="transcript_line"> We made it happen.</div><div id="00:04:59.480" class="transcript_line"> It was really joyful.</div><div id="00:05:01.360" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been doing animation for how many years now?</div><div id="00:05:05.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was 2018, I believe, that we started.</div><div id="00:05:10.080" class="transcript_line"> We must have met in 2017.</div><div id="00:05:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:05:13.080" class="transcript_line"> But our first project was 2018, I think.</div><div id="00:05:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, our first project.</div><div id="00:05:17.240" class="transcript_line"> And we kept going.</div><div id="00:05:20.280" class="transcript_line"> Even through COVID.</div><div id="00:05:22.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely through COVID.</div><div id="00:05:25.120" class="transcript_line"> It was like the most important thing, really, to keep it going.</div><div id="00:05:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:29.120" class="transcript_line"> Because the second year of Habacon was, unfortunately, we had to unfortunately cancel because we</div><div id="00:05:35.280" class="transcript_line"> had to do two.</div><div id="00:05:38.600" class="transcript_line"> Because I know a lot of my friends are disabled and who have medical problems.</div><div id="00:05:42.760" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t want to cause them to be severely ill.</div><div id="00:05:48.920" class="transcript_line"> So it was a heavy heart.</div><div id="00:05:51.720" class="transcript_line"> And mid of the 2020, I uploaded a video on Facebook saying that we were postponing or</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> I said postponing, but we really cancelled it further along the line.</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> Saying that we postponed Habacon because we don&#039;t want anybody to get severely sick.</div><div id="00:06:17.960" class="transcript_line"> But we did open Habacon early on this year.</div><div id="00:06:23.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:06:24.640" class="transcript_line"> So we came back for our second in-person Habacon this year in 2023.</div><div id="00:06:30.360" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve been doing things throughout that time, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve made other films.</div><div id="00:06:35.880" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done screenings and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:06:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, true.</div><div id="00:06:41.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done screenings at Small World Theatre.</div><div id="00:06:44.480" class="transcript_line"> How many films have we made now?</div><div id="00:06:48.080" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember?</div><div id="00:06:50.440" class="transcript_line"> I think we made three.</div><div id="00:06:55.600" class="transcript_line"> And sort of some unpolished ones.</div><div id="00:06:58.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, unpolished ones.</div><div id="00:07:01.200" class="transcript_line"> Your most recent one was called Wild Words.</div><div id="00:07:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Wild Words.</div><div id="00:07:09.280" class="transcript_line"> We did some animation on poetry about wild animals.</div><div id="00:07:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Wild animals here in Wales or fictional.</div><div id="00:07:19.640" class="transcript_line"> I think there was a unicorn and a dragon.</div><div id="00:07:23.200" class="transcript_line"> And I did a bunny.</div><div id="00:07:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Bethan did a bunny.</div><div id="00:07:26.680" class="transcript_line"> We had a worm, a wriggling worm.</div><div id="00:07:29.200" class="transcript_line"> We had elves and voles.</div><div id="00:07:35.720" class="transcript_line"> What we&#039;re trying to do with our animation is to bring awareness to certain topics like</div><div id="00:07:43.600" class="transcript_line"> animals, the environment.</div><div id="00:07:46.560" class="transcript_line"> And the most, one of our probably most proudest ones was Tweeters Equally, where we talked</div><div id="00:07:54.880" class="transcript_line"> about our disability rights.</div><div id="00:07:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and we connected it all with wider, like human rights as well.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s obviously intersectional.</div><div id="00:08:06.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s something I&#039;ve noticed with Abacon is that a lot of people who are, so from the</div><div id="00:08:11.720" class="transcript_line"> LGBTQ community, are attracted to Abacon and interested in anime.</div><div id="00:08:17.520" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a lot of crossover.</div><div id="00:08:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;re all inclusive with different types of people.</div><div id="00:08:22.320" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t matter if you are with a disability or you&#039;re LGBT or anything else.</div><div id="00:08:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Or you could be a complete norm or identifying as a norm.</div><div id="00:08:31.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:36.720" class="transcript_line"> But it doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:08:38.640" class="transcript_line"> And we opened with, we also catered to the old and the young.</div><div id="00:08:44.480" class="transcript_line"> I think we had a lot of children, some families.</div><div id="00:08:48.640" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s good because...</div><div id="00:08:51.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s been the wonderful thing, I think.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The public facing events that we&#039;ve done together.</div><div id="00:08:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Because Bethan obviously is creative director, center stage, but you&#039;re doing it for everybody.</div><div id="00:09:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m doing it for everyone.</div><div id="00:09:07.920" class="transcript_line"> I just want people to be happy and have fun because I know how bleak the world is at the</div><div id="00:09:14.640" class="transcript_line"> moment.</div><div id="00:09:15.640" class="transcript_line"> And I just want to get them to stay cleared of the problems of the world and just have</div><div id="00:09:21.800" class="transcript_line"> some fun and just live, like I said in Tweeters equally.</div><div id="00:09:30.080" class="transcript_line"> Life is colorful and bright and we should embrace that.</div><div id="00:09:33.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Sure, there&#039;s going to be the cloudy judgment of reality and stuff like that and problems</div><div id="00:09:39.880" class="transcript_line"> and things I really don&#039;t want to get into.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the examples of those sort of colorful and bright things, I think, are your costumes.</div><div id="00:09:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:50.480" class="transcript_line"> I am a cosplayer and I do cosplay as different anime characters.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s your favorite one?</div><div id="00:09:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I was really proud recently of this, like, Whales from Italia.</div><div id="00:10:05.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s one of my favorites, but I realized that the anime and the fandom was dying down</div><div id="00:10:13.240" class="transcript_line"> because of new animes that are popping up.</div><div id="00:10:17.560" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m into two other big anime and things at the moment, like Twisted Wonderland and</div><div id="00:10:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Hypnosis Mike.</div><div id="00:10:30.840" class="transcript_line"> But I really think that I was really proud on my costume this year and I&#039;m really proud</div><div id="00:10:36.880" class="transcript_line"> to be a cosplayer.</div><div id="00:10:38.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you cosplay?</div><div id="00:10:42.680" class="transcript_line"> I think she only cosplayed once and that was Tombo from Kiki&#039;s Delivery Service at first.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Were the people at the con dress up?</div><div id="00:10:54.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we...</div><div id="00:10:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I like it when people dress up.</div><div id="00:11:00.520" class="transcript_line"> I think I saw different types of people at our first con that I recognized from anime.</div><div id="00:11:07.160" class="transcript_line"> I think there was a Darby from My Hero Academia and lots of other anime characters, but it&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:16.160" class="transcript_line"> not just anime, it&#039;s just geeky thing in general.</div><div id="00:11:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it&#039;s one of the features of the day about the con, is the cosplay competition.</div><div id="00:11:26.480" class="transcript_line"> So at the end of the day, we&#039;d announce the winners.</div><div id="00:11:30.920" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s always been lots of fun.</div><div id="00:11:33.320" class="transcript_line"> And you involve other people that way because people are attracted to come and cosplay,</div><div id="00:11:39.120" class="transcript_line"> even if they haven&#039;t been part of the group previously.</div><div id="00:11:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and we have actually broadened our horizon with the animation group, because it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:11:50.960" class="transcript_line"> just in Carradine.</div><div id="00:11:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I think we have somebody in Cardiff and some people in the north.</div><div id="00:11:59.880" class="transcript_line"> That came about in lockdown.</div><div id="00:12:03.280" class="transcript_line"> So in lockdown, when we had to cancel the second Abacon, we took the money we would</div><div id="00:12:09.640" class="transcript_line"> have spent on that.</div><div id="00:12:11.500" class="transcript_line"> People generously didn&#039;t hold us to our contracts with them.</div><div id="00:12:15.720" class="transcript_line"> It was really nice.</div><div id="00:12:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And we had funding from the National Lottery and they said, you do whatever is best for</div><div id="00:12:24.200" class="transcript_line"> the people that you&#039;re serving.</div><div id="00:12:25.900" class="transcript_line"> So we decided eventually to keep going on Zoom, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:12:29.240" class="transcript_line"> And I think it was one of the best things that we&#039;ve done.</div><div id="00:12:31.360" class="transcript_line"> We still did it even after lockdown.</div><div id="00:12:34.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re still doing Zoom.</div><div id="00:12:35.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so successful.</div><div id="00:12:38.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not right for everybody, but there is something I think for some people who have</div><div id="00:12:46.760" class="transcript_line"> difficulty in a group setting and who might sit in the corner and be quiet, can suddenly</div><div id="00:12:52.240" class="transcript_line"> come alive through a Zoom call.</div><div id="00:12:54.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mean come alive, that sounds really derogatory, sorry.</div><div id="00:12:58.920" class="transcript_line"> But I mean just really seem much more confident on screen.</div><div id="00:13:03.880" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s really been something that we&#039;ve picked up on.</div><div id="00:13:08.480" class="transcript_line"> And so we think it&#039;s worthwhile continuing with the Zooms.</div><div id="00:13:11.520" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve also returned to meeting in person because a lot of people for whom Zoom is actually</div><div id="00:13:16.960" class="transcript_line"> really challenging.</div><div id="00:13:17.960" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve got a bit of a balance going.</div><div id="00:13:19.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a bit of a balance.</div><div id="00:13:20.960" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s meant that we can invite people from outside of Carrot&#039;s Oceans to come and be</div><div id="00:13:25.720" class="transcript_line"> part of it all.</div><div id="00:13:27.920" class="transcript_line"> And we have really talented people in our circle.</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re talented.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Their drawings are amazing.</div><div id="00:13:37.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re just trying to bring them out of their shells basically.</div><div id="00:13:42.560" class="transcript_line"> And everybody&#039;s got a unique style.</div><div id="00:13:45.160" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve seen people even develop their styles over the course of the past few years.</div><div id="00:13:50.880" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="00:13:51.880" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;m the most improved because my drawings are getting way more better now.</div><div id="00:13:57.760" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s your style, Bethan?</div><div id="00:14:00.080" class="transcript_line"> My style is the cute style, the kawaii style.</div><div id="00:14:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, 100%.</div><div id="00:14:09.040" class="transcript_line"> With the films that you&#039;ve made already, how do you make them?</div><div id="00:14:20.080" class="transcript_line"> So we do a stop motion kind of style, not like with the clay kind of like or art men</div><div id="00:14:31.880" class="transcript_line"> or anything like that.</div><div id="00:14:33.400" class="transcript_line"> We usually use paper and stuff because it&#039;s much easier.</div><div id="00:14:37.720" class="transcript_line"> I doubt they would ever do clay.</div><div id="00:14:42.360" class="transcript_line"> Would we or is it way too advanced?</div><div id="00:14:46.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think clay is way too advanced.</div><div id="00:14:47.960" class="transcript_line"> I just think we&#039;ve got used to using paper.</div><div id="00:14:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ve been using paper.</div><div id="00:14:55.840" class="transcript_line"> We did go on a claymation workshop once.</div><div id="00:14:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember?</div><div id="00:14:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we did.</div><div id="00:15:00.120" class="transcript_line"> We went down to Kotatsu Festival of Japanese Animation in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:15:04.920" class="transcript_line"> We went on a trip down there and there was an amazing animator who came from Japan.</div><div id="00:15:10.440" class="transcript_line"> Then he ran the workshop and there must have been like 20, 30 people in there plus a little</div><div id="00:15:15.560" class="transcript_line"> group of Mencap Kerozegi&#039;an members came down from Cardigan.</div><div id="00:15:18.680" class="transcript_line"> That was a really fun day.</div><div id="00:15:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was really fun.</div><div id="00:15:23.840" class="transcript_line"> You made some really beautiful stuff that day.</div><div id="00:15:28.680" class="transcript_line"> But no, we haven&#039;t done so much of it in our workshops.</div><div id="00:15:34.080" class="transcript_line"> If you imagine a person, then you think about all the parts that a person would move, so</div><div id="00:15:42.640" class="transcript_line"> their hands would move separately from their arms, from their body and their head.</div><div id="00:15:49.600" class="transcript_line"> You would design your character, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:15:52.640" class="transcript_line"> Then you break all those bits down into individual parts to make a puppet, like a paper puppet.</div><div id="00:15:59.240" class="transcript_line"> You can make that move with stop motion.</div><div id="00:16:04.280" class="transcript_line"> They will probably stick with paper, but we might consider other methods.</div><div id="00:16:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Do you use an animate?</div><div id="00:16:18.080" class="transcript_line"> We try to keep everything as accessible as possible.</div><div id="00:16:22.720" class="transcript_line"> We use technology that a lot of people have these days on their iPads or their phones.</div><div id="00:16:28.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a couple of apps.</div><div id="00:16:31.200" class="transcript_line"> One is called Stop Motion Studio.</div><div id="00:16:33.760" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s what we use.</div><div id="00:16:35.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we tend to use a lot of the time.</div><div id="00:16:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Another one is called Flip a Clip.</div><div id="00:16:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Each of them have got their benefits.</div><div id="00:16:42.640" class="transcript_line"> Flip a Clip is a bit like a flipbook animation style.</div><div id="00:16:48.960" class="transcript_line"> You can draw a bit and then you can draw it slightly different on the next page and</div><div id="00:16:52.640" class="transcript_line"> slightly different on the next page.</div><div id="00:16:53.840" class="transcript_line"> It works like that.</div><div id="00:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> So some of our members have started using Flip a Clip as well.</div><div id="00:17:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes we can combine the two and we can combine photography.</div><div id="00:17:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So the characters might move against a background,</div><div id="00:17:13.360" class="transcript_line"> which could be a painting or it could be a photograph.</div><div id="00:17:21.600" class="transcript_line"> We all make our own backgrounds as well and our own things.</div><div id="00:17:26.320" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t want to make anyone conform to one particular style</div><div id="00:17:30.560" class="transcript_line"> because everybody has their unique creative style ability.</div><div id="00:17:38.480" class="transcript_line"> We want it to include everybody.</div><div id="00:17:41.040" class="transcript_line"> So it doesn&#039;t matter if your drawing skills are different from others.</div><div id="00:17:47.040" class="transcript_line"> We can mash it all together and it produces something wonderful</div><div id="00:17:52.160" class="transcript_line"> that represents everybody who&#039;s contributed.</div><div id="00:17:54.960" class="transcript_line"> You can see, you know they say with the Aardmans stop motion animations,</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> you can see the fingerprints of the animator in the clay.</div><div id="00:18:04.080" class="transcript_line"> I think you can see all the personalities and characteristics of everybody in the animation</div><div id="00:18:09.920" class="transcript_line"> club and all the work that we&#039;ve done.</div><div id="00:18:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Nothing is modernized at all.</div><div id="00:18:13.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:14.320" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t use templates or anything like that.</div><div id="00:18:16.160" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:17.840" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the point of that?</div><div id="00:18:19.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like being everybody else and who wants to be like everybody else?</div><div id="00:18:24.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great that we use these methods because we get our struts are like a unique kind of</div><div id="00:18:31.680" class="transcript_line"> blend of different styles and different things.</div><div id="00:18:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, mine is the cutie style.</div><div id="00:18:38.880" class="transcript_line"> So I probably would, mine is really simple.</div><div id="00:18:42.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just probably circles and things and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:18:47.600" class="transcript_line"> But others are way more better.</div><div id="00:18:50.160" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t describe them as being better.</div><div id="00:18:54.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s different, like different styles and tastes, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:18:58.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like some people, Matty, for example, he&#039;s got quite a dark, dry sense of humor.</div><div id="00:19:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:04.720" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s Jamie.</div><div id="00:19:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Jamie is quite wacky and sort of a little bit horror inspired at times.</div><div id="00:19:13.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:14.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, his Joker cut is amazing.</div><div id="00:19:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:19.200" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant character.</div><div id="00:19:21.120" class="transcript_line"> And then there&#039;s Tom.</div><div id="00:19:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Tom&#039;s got a real way with words.</div><div id="00:19:25.920" class="transcript_line"> So he writes a lot of the kind of poetry or sometimes writes scripts and dialogue and things.</div><div id="00:19:31.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s bringing up the talent of the people that we are.</div><div id="00:19:36.640" class="transcript_line"> And some people can do digital arts like there&#039;s Sol.</div><div id="00:19:43.600" class="transcript_line"> Sol&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He draws everything in.</div><div id="00:19:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember this program called Paint?</div><div id="00:19:49.760" class="transcript_line"> You can get on Microsoft.</div><div id="00:19:51.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:19:52.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So he uses that for his animations and they are stunning.</div><div id="00:19:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they are really stunning.</div><div id="00:19:59.700" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re professional.</div><div id="00:20:00.500" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re really professional.</div><div id="00:20:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Like a jimmy painting.</div><div id="00:20:05.460" class="transcript_line"> Have you seen that?</div><div id="00:20:07.140" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just the way he makes these lovely smooth curves within Paint.</div><div id="00:20:13.380" class="transcript_line"> I just think, wow, that is just like such dedication.</div><div id="00:20:17.940" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s got a whole world of characters of his own.</div><div id="00:20:20.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:21.380" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s created.</div><div id="00:20:23.860" class="transcript_line"> Really, that&#039;s his personal strength, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:20:28.340" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we&#039;re doing is working with people&#039;s personal strength and supporting you all to showcase them.</div><div id="00:20:36.900" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:37.460" class="transcript_line"> Show them all.</div><div id="00:20:38.980" class="transcript_line"> So do you think that there is...</div><div id="00:20:45.860" class="transcript_line"> So we all tell stories in different ways, but usually they follow a similar...</div><div id="00:20:51.380" class="transcript_line"> ...structural pattern.</div><div id="00:20:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that people with learning disability or neurodiverse people have their own particular way of telling a story?</div><div id="00:21:00.100" class="transcript_line"> What do you think is influenced by stories that people...</div><div id="00:21:05.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, if we&#039;re trying to begin with a new project, we brainstorm of different ideas and stuff and get the opinions of the people that we&#039;re working with, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:21:21.860" class="transcript_line"> If we&#039;re going into a new project, we brainstorm of ideas, what we can do.</div><div id="00:21:28.980" class="transcript_line"> We just go back and forth and see everybody&#039;s opinion.</div><div id="00:21:32.980" class="transcript_line"> And then when we can come to an inclusion, then we go for it.</div><div id="00:21:38.180" class="transcript_line"> And then we work hard on it for how many months?</div><div id="00:21:43.140" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s usually over the course of three, four, five months.</div><div id="00:21:46.420" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Bit by bit, we get through the work, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:21:56.200" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not doing the animation club at the moment.</div><div id="00:22:00.600" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re probably having a little break at the moment, aren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:22:04.280" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had a little break since March, but we&#039;re about to begin again in January.</div><div id="00:22:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:11.340" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got just after Christmas.</div><div id="00:22:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:14.380" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, come back to the question about do people with learning disabilities tell stories differently?</div><div id="00:22:20.220" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think we do.</div><div id="00:22:22.060" class="transcript_line"> I mean, everybody has their own way of telling their story.</div><div id="00:22:25.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:27.100" class="transcript_line"> Some try to be extra with their stories.</div><div id="00:22:32.300" class="transcript_line"> And again, Tom is a perfect example of his storytelling and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:22:38.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think the other thing is that what we&#039;ve noticed within this group is there&#039;s so much love and support for each other within the group.</div><div id="00:22:48.940" class="transcript_line"> And the teamwork is incredible.</div><div id="00:22:54.940" class="transcript_line"> You know, people take on jobs, they decide what they want to do, and then you make sure you get them done.</div><div id="00:23:02.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:03.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s the really like stellar thing that maybe like the rest of society.</div><div id="00:23:13.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not really trying. Society is just trying to be taken, trying to get the unique and making them extremely normal.</div><div id="00:23:25.440" class="transcript_line"> And I say to myself, who wants that? I want to be the extra kind of person.</div><div id="00:23:31.440" class="transcript_line"> I want to be the bright person that probably shouts out loud, well, not really because I&#039;m a well-mannered kind of person, but you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:23:39.440" class="transcript_line"> But if everybody in society treats each other as well as the members of the animation club do, in my experience, then I think we do away with a lot of the issues that we have.</div><div id="00:23:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Like we&#039;d be closer to each other.</div><div id="00:23:55.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be less isolated.</div><div id="00:23:57.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:58.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;d be able to achieve things that, you know, we thought maybe we&#039;re outside of our capabilities or what people expect of us.</div><div id="00:24:08.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:09.440" class="transcript_line"> So I kind of think it&#039;s like a model to be held up.</div><div id="00:24:14.440" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I&#039;m over exaggerating that.</div><div id="00:24:16.440" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s real.</div><div id="00:24:18.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a really wonderful community.</div><div id="00:24:20.440" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s something that I think of all the work that I&#039;ve done in my life, I feel the most proud of.</div><div id="00:24:27.440" class="transcript_line"> And, you know.</div><div id="00:24:30.440" class="transcript_line"> And a great friendship has been through this between me and Rowan.</div><div id="00:24:37.440" class="transcript_line"> We are our business partners to the end.</div><div id="00:24:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:44.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ve got that level of commitment to this thing.</div><div id="00:24:47.440" class="transcript_line"> And Hannah and Jake is also part of our little group.</div><div id="00:24:52.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think they say other things.</div><div id="00:24:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Jake, for example, is a filmmaker and he&#039;d probably talk at length about how unique he finds the storytelling and the style.</div><div id="00:25:04.440" class="transcript_line"> And Hannah?</div><div id="00:25:06.440" class="transcript_line"> And Hannah has a wonderful visual artist.</div><div id="00:25:12.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Who everybody loves Hannah.</div><div id="00:25:17.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:18.440" class="transcript_line"> So the people mix is really interesting.</div><div id="00:25:21.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:22.440" class="transcript_line"> In this club.</div><div id="00:25:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:25.440" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I think for all intents and purposes, I think we have a really good thing going on.</div><div id="00:25:34.440" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ll hope what&#039;s in here.</div><div id="00:25:36.440" class="transcript_line"> A few more questions.</div><div id="00:25:38.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:25:39.440" class="transcript_line"> I thought you were trying to wrap it up.</div><div id="00:25:41.440" class="transcript_line"> We were.</div><div id="00:25:45.440" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the first anime you ever saw?</div><div id="00:25:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, if we have specifics, I&#039;ve really remembered this.</div><div id="00:25:56.440" class="transcript_line"> It was in.</div><div id="00:25:58.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:25:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Most typically, probably my first anime is like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:26:06.440" class="transcript_line"> But I really went into anime in 2007 while I was in Florida because I was obsessed with Disney for a long while.</div><div id="00:26:19.440" class="transcript_line"> And I still am.</div><div id="00:26:20.440" class="transcript_line"> I like, I love Disney.</div><div id="00:26:22.440" class="transcript_line"> And don&#039;t tell.</div><div id="00:26:26.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to edit this, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:26:28.440" class="transcript_line"> But don&#039;t tell this.</div><div id="00:26:30.440" class="transcript_line"> But I stayed up well past one of the nights that I should have.</div><div id="00:26:35.440" class="transcript_line"> And I stumbled across Toonami&#039;s animation block where they were airing some of the anime, animes that was on it, like Full Metal Alchemist.</div><div id="00:26:49.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think, I think Blood X and stuff like that and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:26:55.440" class="transcript_line"> And I just saw this and I said, Whoa, what is this?</div><div id="00:27:00.440" class="transcript_line"> And then that&#039;s how I discovered anime.</div><div id="00:27:03.440" class="transcript_line"> And then I realized, Oh, Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh are also animes.</div><div id="00:27:09.440" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, that&#039;s what got me into anime.</div><div id="00:27:14.440" class="transcript_line"> But and then I slowly developed from there with lots of other things.</div><div id="00:27:22.440" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m a big anime fan now and I&#039;m currently watching some animes at the moment, which are pretty good.</div><div id="00:27:31.440" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, that&#039;s my taster to anime is usually Pokemon, Beyblade, Yu-Gi-Oh, stuff like that.</div><div id="00:27:42.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re over-mockery.</div><div id="00:27:45.440" class="transcript_line"> I think I was, although I studied Japanese at university, I wasn&#039;t an otaku type.</div><div id="00:27:52.440" class="transcript_line"> But I think I was in Japan and I was doing a homestay.</div><div id="00:27:58.440" class="transcript_line"> And my Japanese sister with a family who I was living with, she was really into Doraemon.</div><div id="00:28:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Doraemon, yeah.</div><div id="00:28:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s this funny blue cat with a white face.</div><div id="00:28:12.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, Doraemon.</div><div id="00:28:14.440" class="transcript_line"> With a helicopter hat.</div><div id="00:28:17.440" class="transcript_line"> And they with a Dora-yaki.</div><div id="00:28:20.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, like Paddington Bear always has a marmalade sandwich under his hat.</div><div id="00:28:24.440" class="transcript_line"> So this cat always has like a red bean pancake in its little pouch at the front.</div><div id="00:28:29.440" class="transcript_line"> I recently ate a Dora-yaki recently and I got a minute.</div><div id="00:28:36.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, actually, no, that was a custard Dora-yaki.</div><div id="00:28:39.440" class="transcript_line"> It was a custard one.</div><div id="00:28:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Custard one.</div><div id="00:28:41.440" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t touched the red bean paste, but I did taste the custard one.</div><div id="00:28:46.440" class="transcript_line"> And then the first feature was probably, oh, it was when I was in a student halls and somebody brought a copy of Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke.</div><div id="00:28:58.440" class="transcript_line"> And we watched that and it totally blew my mind.</div><div id="00:29:02.440" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, like Ghibli is Ghibli as a, you know, studio.</div><div id="00:29:10.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s such, it&#039;s got a lot of depth.</div><div id="00:29:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Like there are a lot of political statements and statements about the environment and the damage that we&#039;ve done to it and things.</div><div id="00:29:19.440" class="transcript_line"> And so I think for me in the club, I can&#039;t help but bring that kind of thing in as a sort of a nod to Coreda.</div><div id="00:29:29.440" class="transcript_line"> Coreda. What&#039;s his name?</div><div id="00:29:32.440" class="transcript_line"> Can you edit that bit out, please?</div><div id="00:29:34.440" class="transcript_line"> Different Japanese writer.</div><div id="00:29:36.440" class="transcript_line"> Miyazaki.</div><div id="00:29:38.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Miyazaki.</div><div id="00:29:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I like to do Ghibli as well.</div><div id="00:29:44.440" class="transcript_line"> There are the serious things with Howl&#039;s Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke.</div><div id="00:29:49.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:29:51.440" class="transcript_line"> That was me.</div><div id="00:29:52.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Diana Wynne-Jones, amazing Welsh writer of fiction for young adults.</div><div id="00:29:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:00.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all older teens.</div><div id="00:30:02.440" class="transcript_line"> And the thing is, I like Miyazaki more since I heard that he actually came to Wales during the mining strike and he actually cemented in Laputa Castle or Castle of the Sky.</div><div id="00:30:20.440" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s this mining village that one of the main characters, Pardew, I think his name is.</div><div id="00:30:30.440" class="transcript_line"> So I think he was inspired by Welsh socialism and Wales&#039;s communities.</div><div id="00:30:37.440" class="transcript_line"> And you see that in his film, Laputa Castle and the Sky.</div><div id="00:30:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:30:43.440" class="transcript_line"> So that increased my respect for Haya Miyazaki because he says he loves Wales as well.</div><div id="00:30:52.440" class="transcript_line"> And to bind the two nations that I like the most, Japan and Wales, my birthplace and the country that I admire,</div><div id="00:31:00.440" class="transcript_line"> although I do realize that Japan has a few problems of their own that I will not go into really.</div><div id="00:31:12.440" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to ask you about Comic-Con actually.</div><div id="00:31:16.440" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned a good welcoming place, your Mavicon.</div><div id="00:31:21.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Are the other cons not so welcoming, do you think?</div><div id="00:31:28.440" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say that because I went to Comic-Con recently at the end of October and I wouldn&#039;t say it would have been unpleasant.</div><div id="00:31:41.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very welcoming.</div><div id="00:31:42.440" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two places in the world that I feel totally normal.</div><div id="00:31:48.440" class="transcript_line"> One of them is Disneyland and the other is Comic-Con.</div><div id="00:31:53.440" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s about creating a Mavicon in West Wales, in rural Wales.</div><div id="00:31:59.440" class="transcript_line"> I think the point was the geographical location.</div><div id="00:32:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Beth, you obviously have the motivation and the resources to travel.</div><div id="00:32:10.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Not everybody does.</div><div id="00:32:14.440" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I wanted Comic-Con because not everyone will go to London or Birmingham or these other places where the big ones won&#039;t have the time, money or, lack of the words, buses and travel and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:32:33.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just to make it remote and to people with disabilities who can&#039;t go to the...</div><div id="00:32:38.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m lucky because I got an auntie in London that I could stay with.</div><div id="00:32:46.440" class="transcript_line"> But not everybody has an auntie in London or anything.</div><div id="00:32:50.440" class="transcript_line"> Not everybody stops their own Comic-Con.</div><div id="00:32:54.440" class="transcript_line"> The other thing about Comic-Con is unlike the other anime festivals, we&#039;re not purists in the sense of only screening in with subtitles.</div><div id="00:33:06.440" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s that meme, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:33:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Like double sub.</div><div id="00:33:08.440" class="transcript_line"> What would you choose?</div><div id="00:33:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, don&#039;t I know it.</div><div id="00:33:13.440" class="transcript_line"> We screen the anime where there is a dubbed version.</div><div id="00:33:20.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s dubbed into English.</div><div id="00:33:22.440" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s important for accessibility for us.</div><div id="00:33:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because we&#039;re catering to the general public and probably the general public doesn&#039;t want to read the subtitles every single time.</div><div id="00:33:34.440" class="transcript_line"> And plus, like I said, we have families and probably young children that probably don&#039;t want to read.</div><div id="00:33:40.440" class="transcript_line"> I need to be willing.</div><div id="00:33:41.440" class="transcript_line"> Disability might not be able to read the subtitles.</div><div id="00:33:44.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m able to read the subtitles because then again, I watch anime constantly every day.</div><div id="00:33:50.440" class="transcript_line"> But in subbed, I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s subbed or dubbed kind of thing.</div><div id="00:34:00.440" class="transcript_line"> So again, but I&#039;m more catered to the people who can&#039;t read subbed all the time and young families, especially with young kids and children that probably don&#039;t want to read and just want to have a good time.</div><div id="00:34:18.440" class="transcript_line"> So if people say that that we&#039;re just catering to the mainstream of dubs, I would just tell them, hey, we&#039;re catering for little kids and children and families and other people with disabilities who probably don&#039;t want to read half the time.</div><div id="00:34:42.440" class="transcript_line"> They just want to have fun.</div><div id="00:34:43.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my argument.</div><div id="00:34:45.440" class="transcript_line"> Hey, what did you think of Panda phonics?</div><div id="00:34:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Panda phonics was amazing.</div><div id="00:34:51.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll talk a little bit about that.</div><div id="00:34:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Now, Panda phonics is this guy.</div><div id="00:34:56.440" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember his name.</div><div id="00:34:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Theo.</div><div id="00:35:00.440" class="transcript_line"> And he makes great remixes of an anime and I think animations.</div><div id="00:35:08.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:09.440" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like a VJ.</div><div id="00:35:11.440" class="transcript_line"> VJ kind of DJ.</div><div id="00:35:13.440" class="transcript_line"> He mixes his music with clips from movies and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:35:18.440" class="transcript_line"> And he did really well with the last app.</div><div id="00:35:24.440" class="transcript_line"> An absolutely amazing job to get a theatre.</div><div id="00:35:29.440" class="transcript_line"> Well, in that cinema, I think it&#039;s just over 100 seats.</div><div id="00:35:32.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:33.440" class="transcript_line"> And it was packed out.</div><div id="00:35:34.440" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely sold out.</div><div id="00:35:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:36.440" class="transcript_line"> And everybody is up on their feet dancing and clapping along.</div><div id="00:35:39.440" class="transcript_line"> It did have like Stiggy Ghibli, Pokemon, anime, stuff like that.</div><div id="00:35:45.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:46.440" class="transcript_line"> And again, it&#039;s like showcasing somebody&#039;s talents.</div><div id="00:35:49.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s really worked hard to learn how to use the software, to take the visual mixes and the audio mixes and to get these things working together.</div><div id="00:36:00.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Just brilliant.</div><div id="00:36:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:05.440" class="transcript_line"> I think we can ask visitors to the exhibition.</div><div id="00:36:07.440" class="transcript_line"> And this is a note for Anna when she added to this to say whether they prefer dubbed or subtitled.</div><div id="00:36:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:16.440" class="transcript_line"> Because I know you actually.</div><div id="00:36:18.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:36:21.440" class="transcript_line"> Have there been any depictions of people with a learning disability in any anime films, if you&#039;re aware of them?</div><div id="00:36:27.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well.</div><div id="00:36:32.440" class="transcript_line"> I know that there&#039;s several characters from animation that have had inklings of probably autism.</div><div id="00:36:41.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I think there was this one.</div><div id="00:36:45.440" class="transcript_line"> I think Spatula from Raya, the new cartoon of Raya that I&#039;m mixing up my words.</div><div id="00:36:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Then She-Ra, Masters of the Universe.</div><div id="00:37:04.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:05.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think Spatula, who is the mechanic, it&#039;s implied that she has autism.</div><div id="00:37:12.440" class="transcript_line"> I think that she has autism because she has her interests and she&#039;s not very good with communicating with people.</div><div id="00:37:18.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, that&#039;s kind of like a stereotype with the autistic person.</div><div id="00:37:22.440" class="transcript_line"> Does that depiction make you feel good that there&#039;s someone with autism on screen or does it make you feel uneasy because, like you said, it&#039;s a bit stereotypical?</div><div id="00:37:31.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m okay with it if they just broaden the horizon with autistic characters.</div><div id="00:37:37.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there is something called Rayman and stuff like with Dustin Hoffman that depicts as an autistic character.</div><div id="00:37:49.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never seen the movie and what I&#039;ve heard about it is he&#039;s kind of a typical stereotype for an autistic person.</div><div id="00:38:01.440" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m actually, can I say that something else about...</div><div id="00:38:14.440" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s this character on Sesame Street that is not animated, but she has been animated in picture books and stuff, and she&#039;s fully autistic.</div><div id="00:38:26.440" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m so proud of Sesame Street, too, aware of how autistic people are, even though Julia is on the far end of the spectrum with nonverbal communication and easy.</div><div id="00:38:43.440" class="transcript_line"> And she gets the...she&#039;s not very good with loud noises and she doesn&#039;t say hi.</div><div id="00:38:50.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m okay with that.</div><div id="00:38:53.440" class="transcript_line"> As an autistic person myself, I broaden the horizon of many anime characters or any person with a disability in animation.</div><div id="00:39:05.440" class="transcript_line"> So I was just looking up, trying to find the name of this anime that I&#039;d seen a few years ago.</div><div id="00:39:13.440" class="transcript_line"> But what I remember about it was it was about the Hikikomori.</div><div id="00:39:17.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, Hikikomori.</div><div id="00:39:19.440" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s...and now I&#039;m just Googling it, I actually found that there&#039;s a whole bunch of anime that feature Hikikomori.</div><div id="00:39:25.440" class="transcript_line"> So these are people who, for some reason or another, have decided to stay at home, usually young people.</div><div id="00:39:32.440" class="transcript_line"> So perhaps through some psychological problems or how society deals with them.</div><div id="00:39:41.440" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s really sad. It&#039;s really sad for the Hikikomori.</div><div id="00:39:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Again, I&#039;m not bashing Japan. I love Japan. I love the culture. I love the food. I love the history of this thing.</div><div id="00:39:56.440" class="transcript_line"> But they do have social problems.</div><div id="00:39:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so these are people who actually feel excluded, I guess.</div><div id="00:40:03.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they&#039;ve withdrawn or they&#039;re not accepted in mainstream Japanese culture.</div><div id="00:40:10.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, even though I praise Japan for their culture and the food and the animation,</div><div id="00:40:19.440" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s stuff in Japan that I will agree that is a bit too much.</div><div id="00:40:25.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m only going to say this one, but the workforce in Japan is brutal.</div><div id="00:40:33.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, not everyone could be a salary man, the salary person.</div><div id="00:40:38.440" class="transcript_line"> And they just jam, jam.</div><div id="00:40:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Not to say that I fully respect Japan. I&#039;m not attacking Japan. Japan, I love you, Japan.</div><div id="00:40:50.440" class="transcript_line"> I support you in football and as well as Wales and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:40:57.440" class="transcript_line"> I will admit that Japan has their own social problems like any other country has their own social problems.</div><div id="00:41:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:41:08.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll go bring things to a close there. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:41:11.440" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
