    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But first thing now, can you just tell us your name and where you were born, both in English and also in Urdu?</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Urdu is not my language.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your language?</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My language is Gujarati, but there&#039;s not many Gujaratis in Nepal.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you okay to say it in English and Gujarati?</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to have the two languages.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be great. I would like to hear. I don&#039;t even know what it sounds like actually.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you speak Urdu?</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t speak Urdu. It&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay?</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay. My name is Yasmin Jetwa. I was born in Africa, in East Africa, in Uganda.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And my birthplace was Kampala.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And in 1971, when EDM had overthrown the country, we were overthrown to different countries.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But because my mum had a British passport, we ended up in Britain as refugees.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But loads and loads of us came. So they were all scattered to Canada and India and Rome.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad went to Rome because he had a citizenship for that country. He couldn&#039;t join us.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And my uncle. And so when we come to Britain, it was October 1971, I think.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was snowing that time.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So the charity, there&#039;s charity, they&#039;re very popular.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Red Cross came to receive us on the bottom of the plain.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Took us to the camps. And the camp was in North Wales.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a RAF camp. There was a big camp, but they were not occupied by them.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was empty. So they replaced all the refugees in there.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Since two different places, but we ended up there anyway.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We were well looked after. They took lovely care of us.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Given us each and everything. Because when we came, we did an Avna thing.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> On your suitcase?</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were only, I was only young then. I think I was about 14.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we stayed there. After a couple of months, they moved us to Leamington Spa in Warwickshire.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from there we stayed a couple of months, still refugees.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we went to Kensington in London.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> In a big posh building they put us all in there.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from there I think we had to decide where we would like to go.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And to settle down. So they gave us a couple of choices.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But we couldn&#039;t decide because my dad and my uncle was not still here.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They were in Rome. So we had to wait for them to come over to join us.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So our family, my uncle, auntie&#039;s family, we were together with the children.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So when they came, then they sent them to Pontypryd and other different places.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave you a couple of choices. So when they, both uncle and my dad went to Pontypryd.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> When they seen the sceneries, they were so beautiful and greenery.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And they thought, oh wow, they were somewhere in Kashmir.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had three houses between two families.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And from A to Z they provided us in the house. Everything brand new.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We were six siblings, my mom and dad.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was eight of us. They gave us one one of each of one one thing.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But they done it all nice for us, looked after us.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So we started going to school. But I was never ever interested in school.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> In Uganda the English was compulsory. That was your language.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Their language, native, that was the next language, but very important language.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I knew how to speak English anyway.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to the school over there in Pontypryd for a couple of months.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Till I think I come to sixteen. Then I had a Saturday job.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then from that onwards I just worked, worked.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And after in 1976 I married and moved to Newport.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And ever since I live in Newport.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was still working till 1990. In between I had my children.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So I stopped in 1990. Then I became a housewife.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m from housewife. I found out slowly slowly there&#039;s some groups around.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to computer classes and some sewing classes.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we met some of the friends which we are here. We met through the some.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> From that I started going more and more and more out.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Different groups. See any people. I talk to them and find out is there anything happening.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And since that time I just kept occupied of myself and got involved with so many groups.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But my age alive group was first. Which I got committed to it.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think it started in 2008. Is that right?</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m terrible with the dates you know.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Very first when Leon Taylor started the group.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember when you were about like 9 years old or 8 years old.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And what that was like growing up in Uganda.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> My memory is not too good but I can just think of some things.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very hardship growing up.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we were not high class. We were not well off. We were just in between.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad was just working and over there women stayed home. My mum stayed home.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And the kids were only small then you know.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And me and my sister was brought up at my grandmother&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> While she was 10 and I was 12.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we had to look after her.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she had a stroke and all that.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And the rest of the family started moving out to other different countries.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So our childhood was a bit of a sad.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we couldn&#039;t go to school anything. Because we were busy looking after granny.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But in between my auntie did try to put us in school to go and study you know.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a bit of education from there not too much.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The childhood was ok but hard time.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We seen the poverty and we seen the hard times.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the curfews and things were happening before we were thrown out.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know we were looking after my grandmother and my sister.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very scary.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My auntie was living next door but they were not much involved.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So me and my sister we seen a hardship since childhood.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you say that taught you? Is there anything that taught you?</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That was teaching you around that time?</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It taught us to see how people are to you.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you are not well off person or something.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t count it like you know.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> When you are a basic person you don&#039;t count in that society.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And even your relatives put you down.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we didn&#039;t have a house or anything. We just had a rented property.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But the rest of the families were well off.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the low ones.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But we survived and from that it teaches you about poverty and all that.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we had gone through that. We got that feeling.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we see these Simon Seeker coming or they have got nothing you feel for them.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You can relate can&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That related is that.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I say to my sister sometimes she wears things.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I say don&#039;t forget your past.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You were brought up in a very simple way.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So you know don&#039;t forget your past.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Keep your past on.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So then you are what?</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You said twelve you came over here.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Twelve to fourteen.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Fourteen.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You were coming over here.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that adjustment period?</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The changing over.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that like for you?</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Having to start.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Being settled in a new life and things like that.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very very different from there.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Totally different.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> First the snow was snowing.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was so cold we never seen snow.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But going through that we went to the camp.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> All the people who were there never bought.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We became like families.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But they had school in the camp as well.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was provided in the doctor.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just like a little shopping.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> You know like your own camp with everything.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Facilities in there.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We had entertainments.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to take us out on the day trips.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave us a lot and they did a lot for us.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So going through that it was giving us a happy moment.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we had never seen that over there.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially our family you know.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And though my dad was not there so we were happy.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were happy.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were happy.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And though my dad was not there so these people were looking after us as well.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So the experience was coming good.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But after settling in Pontypridd it was hard.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we were in a community where there was no Asians or anybody.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> In a Welsh community.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the beginning we had a hard time.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But after I started working they all became my friends.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody knew you because it was a small village there.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was keeping us happy then.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And what would you say was your favourite memory from that time?</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> My favourite memory?</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you were not married and you were just free.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had friends.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You did so many things together.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Committed to anything.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was happy moments isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You were free then isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> In Africa?</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> The most important thing was because over there the lifestyle was different.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Even though you didn&#039;t have much but you were happy.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes the family used to take you on picnics and things which we were looking forward to there.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was nice.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Food wise you had your own.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The food we ate there was nice, fresh.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was different from here.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> When we came first we missed all that.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it was totally different.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good times as well and bad times.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So what about the culture as well?</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the culture and your practice of the culture?</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Here?</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning it was hard.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But the thing is when we were living, staying there because we knew there were no Asians.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to adapt to wear English clothes as well.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> When you go to work you can wear your own clothes.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ll be an old one out.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to start adapting to it.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But we still kept our culture.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Till now I try to keep my culture.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But the children, they do half.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> How were you able to keep your culture?</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What things were you doing?</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> When there&#039;s an occasion, or when there&#039;s respect for the elders.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Or if there&#039;s a death they must go and respect.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> This is all our culture.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You can sit with them and make some time and sympathize with them.</div><div id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re emotional.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t forget your culture.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Keep your culture going with your food specially.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Your language.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s number one.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It happened with my children.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother-in-law showed that my children had to have the mother tongue.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No English was allowed.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Where now my grandchildren don&#039;t even speak our language.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they speak English.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The parents are English speaking to the kids.</div><div id="00:12:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Which we don&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not happy.</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But these days you can&#039;t say nothing to them.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You try to guide them the right way.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> When you come to your religion, you guide them to keep your religion.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t go off to track.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t change into yourself too westernized.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m open minded.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So we leave it to half and half.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And don&#039;t push them too much.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I still want them to carry on with little bit which we got in our culture.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Like we have our festivals and things.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They should know about it.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And on that day we must get together.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And share food and all that.</div><div id="00:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> If you didn&#039;t remind them, they&#039;ll know about it.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s so many other distractions now that can really deter away the people.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of the time they&#039;re in school.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They live in school more than.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And work.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re only in the evening for a little short time.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We still live in Ponty Prid.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I live in Newport.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved in Newport in 1976.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then my son was born in 1977.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married and moved here in 1977.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had my first son.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been since I&#039;m in Newport.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us about that time moving to Newport?</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Newport, yeah it was hard.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when my husband and their family come from.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re originally cousins.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum&#039;s cousins they were.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Me and my husband are distant cousins.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we can marry with cousins that time.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But now the kids won&#039;t have it.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They said they&#039;re my brother or my sister.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were really close.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were really close.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But then the kids won&#039;t have it.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They said they&#039;re my brother or my sister.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But that time when I got married to my husband.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They were living in one room.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> In somebody&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We had two rooms already.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My in-laws were staying in one room.</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Me and my husband were living in one room.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So we seen a hardship.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he came as well after.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Before we got married.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t have a job or anything.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were only about 18.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to see very hardship.</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We both had to work.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes he didn&#039;t have much food.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he didn&#039;t have much money.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the wage was only nine pounds then.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And we didn&#039;t have nothing.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to start from the scratch.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Going through difficulty.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Afterwards, Mother-in-law was collecting money for us.</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> She supported us.</div><div id="00:14:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we bought a house after a long time.</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> A unity.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the family had a unity.</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> This time they haven&#039;t.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t even know what your son or daughter earns.</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When they have a wage.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t even ask them.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Because times have changed now.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But our time, we had to bring a wage.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And give Mother-in-law the money in Iran.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was kept into the culture.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And respect.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But she was doing good for us.</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Because she was collecting money for us to have a property.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So we worked very, very hard to reach here.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Not well, well off.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But we are comfortable.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you speak about certain jobs?</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there certain jobs that you&#039;ve had that you&#039;ve enjoyed as well?</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What might have been a new point?</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> What would have been?</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, before I was working in the supermarkets.</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was my favourite.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I loved talking to people.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a lot of friends.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But then when I got married I had to come to Newport.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And then start in a sewing factory.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a hard time.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it was all white.</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was only Asian.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And because I had little experience from Conti Pits.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because that was a white area.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m blending alright with them.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I kept my limit.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had to blend in with them.</div><div id="00:16:12.000" class="transcript_line"> To keep me going.</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise if I didn&#039;t I&#039;d be in one corner.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But then you always find one or two.</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was very nasty people.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But we survived.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So since then I just worked in the sewing factories.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Till 1990.</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then where did you go?</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I finished because I had to look after my mother-in-law.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Who looked after us.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s become ill for eight years.</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to look after her then.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You were talking about kind of even the money aspect of when we were working.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were giving it to your mother-in-law.</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then that was helping you in terms of building the house.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> How important is that?</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And what ways can we...</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there certain ways that we can start getting back to that in a way?</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very good because I was very happy to be able to help my mother-in-law.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was very happy to be able to help her.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very kind.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very nice.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very kind.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very nice.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very kind.</div><div id="00:17:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very good because that time you had the limit of spending money as well.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because instead of a bank, it was collected for you, for your future.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like she was putting her money, my husband was putting mine.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Like going in a little money box or wherever.</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was very important.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> If we didn&#039;t do that, we wouldn&#039;t have a house now.</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We would spend and spend.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And we wouldn&#039;t have been in a council house or something.</div><div id="00:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we did get in a council house.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> From after we got married, we had one boy.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And because the condition of the house was very bad, they put us in an old way.</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a big, beautiful four bedroom house.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> For four people.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We could have stayed there all our life, but we didn&#039;t want that lifestyle.</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We wanted to work hard and have your own property to stay in.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody will check you out or anything.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Because all the days are rough, all the way.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why it helped us, you know, having a unity.</div><div id="00:18:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But we wish that unity was still there.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But everybody got their own mind now.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;ve been grown up in this country and they...</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Back home, we used to have a lot of money.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But we didn&#039;t have a lot of money.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had to work hard.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to work hard.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to work hard.</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to work hard.</div><div id="00:18:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We were grown up in this country and they...</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Back home, we used to do the same, I think.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Parents were in charge and they always thought good things for your children.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were much more connected.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Connected with each other.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But that connection is not the same like...</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I agree.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So speaking about kind of connection, can you speak more about your connection to kind of age alive as well?</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Since I got connected to age alive, there was only a handful of people.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But we recruit...</div><div id="00:19:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it was a multi-BME group.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to have all cultures which we liked.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So we recruited people and brought them to the group.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Me and my sister, we gave a lot of time.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning, this lot was not even there.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It was only a handful.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you see anybody on the road with a smile, you say,</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, would you like to come in and join our group?</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lovely group. Get you out of the house.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Come and join. Come and see what it&#039;s like.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And through that, people started coming.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So you see our group is multicultural.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I started going to Shalom, I told them about it because they were all Jamaican people there.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I brought them here as well.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I put my heart deep into age alive.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Until today, we took all the commitments to let it run.</div><div id="00:19:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just part of my family.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Age alive is...</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think age alive has supported other black, Asian, minority or majority groups?</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It helped them come out of their houses.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of them were housewives, I think Asian culture ones.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Pushed them to come to the group, have the enjoyment, have the exercise and this and that.</div><div id="00:20:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And they started enjoying all that.</div><div id="00:20:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re looking forward once a week to go to the group.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s a big day for them.</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody look forward to see each other on Wednesdays.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Go on the trips, which they all love.</div><div id="00:20:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So that kept us all together.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And we hope that carries on and continues in the future.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And the last question is, have you got any kind of memorabilia, which is any photos and things like that, that you&#039;d like to share?</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Photos from where?</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> From whether you&#039;re younger or with family or any of the experiences that we spoke about.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Or even your first times in age alive?</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> If anything like that that you&#039;d like to share.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d love to have a look for photos from I think age alive.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The good times we were having when we were going on trips and all year in there.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all big groups that time.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And a few of the friends passed away from age alive, which I miss them terribly.</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially my friend who went to the Navy.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a lot of connection, so much connection, till she died.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You can still see her.</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Good old memories.</div><div id="00:21:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that you&#039;d like to share?</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well done to Roy, he keeps us going.</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Till the last moment, we pray for him.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s the only one keeping us going, one man with all the women.</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But other language might be a bit awkward for me.</div><div id="00:22:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Like my language or the... Can I just leave it to English?</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes you can.</div></div></p>
