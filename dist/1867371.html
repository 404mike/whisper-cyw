    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, it&#039;s the 17th of May 2019 and I&#039;m here with Mr Clive Powell at his bike shop in Raider.</div><div id="00:00:07.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Stephanie Cruise of the Ellen Lynx Project.</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Clive, have you always lived in Raider?</div><div id="00:00:13.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I haven&#039;t always lived in Raider. My family lived here for a few generations,</div><div id="00:00:19.520" class="transcript_line"> but I spent my youth mostly in South Wales and I came to live around this area in my early twenties.</div><div id="00:00:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Right, and when did you take on the bike shop, running the bike shop?</div><div id="00:00:33.120" class="transcript_line"> Uh, 1994. I started my bike business in 1985, running guided mountain bike trips,</div><div id="00:00:43.280" class="transcript_line"> and I used to keep a few bits and pieces, parts and so on, in a box, and then after a while</div><div id="00:00:50.640" class="transcript_line"> that box became a cupboard, and then finally the cupboard wasn&#039;t big enough and I had to open a shop.</div><div id="00:00:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Right, and the guided bike trips, were they around this area, up the valley?</div><div id="00:01:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Yep, in the Ellen Valley, yeah, all off-road. It was what was the beginning of the mountain bike thing.</div><div id="00:01:10.400" class="transcript_line"> Because there used to be motorbike races around here, I understand.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right, off-road motorcycling is a big sport in this area.</div><div id="00:01:20.080" class="transcript_line"> But you started the off-road bicycles.</div><div id="00:01:22.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah, I mean when I used to come riding into town on my mountain bike covered in mud,</div><div id="00:01:28.080" class="transcript_line"> people used to look at me in amazement. They were used to seeing motorbikes coming through town with dirt on them,</div><div id="00:01:35.120" class="transcript_line"> but to see somebody riding a bicycle with dirt on it, they just couldn&#039;t figure it out.</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Was it hard in the early days getting the business started? Was there a lot of interest in?</div><div id="00:01:45.840" class="transcript_line"> No, I mean it was very much a minority sport in those days, but it quickly expanded,</div><div id="00:01:55.040" class="transcript_line"> it snowballed right from the start.</div><div id="00:01:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Good, and the building that we&#039;re in at the moment is quite fascinating.</div><div id="00:02:05.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you know anything about the history of it?</div><div id="00:02:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, more or less. It started off life as an agricultural building,</div><div id="00:02:12.640" class="transcript_line"> and bits were added to it over a fairly short period of time.</div><div id="00:02:18.080" class="transcript_line"> And after not very long, I believe, it became a pub, and it was a pub for 400 years until I took it on.</div><div id="00:02:28.080" class="transcript_line"> So had it closed down as a pub before you took it on, or was it still?</div><div id="00:02:32.880" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t operating as a pub, it had been operating as a pub up until about six months before I bought it.</div><div id="00:02:40.080" class="transcript_line"> It was a very, very well-known pub in the area, a very popular pub, so I did make a few enemies to begin with.</div><div id="00:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Very different trade, really.</div><div id="00:02:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but yeah, fascinating building.</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> So how have you found running a business in Raider?</div><div id="00:02:58.640" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously over the years there&#039;s been economic fluctuations.</div><div id="00:03:03.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean it&#039;s not an accident, but it&#039;s a bit of a shock.</div><div id="00:03:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean it&#039;s not an affluent area, people don&#039;t have a lot of money,</div><div id="00:03:12.400" class="transcript_line"> and even though it&#039;s a tourism destination, it&#039;s fairly small,</div><div id="00:03:17.840" class="transcript_line"> sitting as it is in between the Snowdonia National Park and the Brecon Beacons National Park.</div><div id="00:03:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Nobody knows this area, and not that many people come, so I&#039;m drawing on quite a small customer base, really.</div><div id="00:03:32.640" class="transcript_line"> You get people coming back year after year?</div><div id="00:03:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, people that know the area, they get to love it and they do tend to come back every year.</div><div id="00:03:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And how have you found the electric bike development?</div><div id="00:03:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s taken a while to get going, but it&#039;s now sort of developed full steam and it&#039;s really taking off.</div><div id="00:03:55.440" class="transcript_line"> And probably in terms of turnover, we&#039;re selling more in e-bikes than any other type of bikes.</div><div id="00:04:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Wow, and are they being used locally? Are they used up in the valley?</div><div id="00:04:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, mostly.</div><div id="00:04:09.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so what do you think the future holds for your business?</div><div id="00:04:15.040" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of it will be in e-bikes in the immediate future and the long-term future.</div><div id="00:04:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Are there any more plans for bike races?</div><div id="00:04:32.640" class="transcript_line"> As in organising them? I probably won&#039;t organise any myself.</div><div id="00:04:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Bike organisation has become much more formalised and structured and there&#039;s less scope for small people like myself to be putting on events.</div><div id="00:04:51.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the governing bodies mostly that are taking it on.</div><div id="00:04:54.640" class="transcript_line"> Do they come here? Do they use Ellen Valley as one of their venues?</div><div id="00:05:00.240" class="transcript_line"> Not really, they&#039;re mostly closed circuits.</div><div id="00:05:04.640" class="transcript_line"> Right, thank you very much for that, Nick. That&#039;s really, really helpful.</div></div></p>
