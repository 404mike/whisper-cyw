    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s important to understand that the race riots in Wales, the race riots in England,</div><div id="00:00:08.400" class="transcript_line"> were not totally in isolation and they&#039;re treated as if they were in isolation.</div><div id="00:00:14.480" class="transcript_line"> But much was happening in America at the same time and much was said about that.</div><div id="00:00:22.220" class="transcript_line"> But there are things that connect them.</div><div id="00:00:24.640" class="transcript_line"> So, chapter 17 and 18 of our project will relate to Elaine Arkansas, the brutal events</div><div id="00:00:35.960" class="transcript_line"> of 1919.</div><div id="00:00:36.960" class="transcript_line"> And for that we link our work to the superb work of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation.</div><div id="00:00:47.040" class="transcript_line"> And this is narrated by the actor Ozzie Davis.</div><div id="00:00:53.080" class="transcript_line"> This is part one, Elaine Arkansas.</div><div id="00:00:56.080" class="transcript_line"> In October of 1919, one of the greatest tragedies in American history occurred near the town</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> of Elaine, Arkansas and Phillips County.</div><div id="00:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> We are certain that a reign of terror against the black population of that part of Phillips</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> County took place.</div><div id="00:01:28.960" class="transcript_line"> We are certain that machine gun crews went out looking for people to gun down.</div><div id="00:01:36.320" class="transcript_line"> We are certain that blacks were brought into, in effect, concentration camps and held in</div><div id="00:01:42.360" class="transcript_line"> all violation of all the laws of the state of Arkansas.</div><div id="00:01:47.360" class="transcript_line"> For the next 80 years, many people, blacks and whites, preferred to pretend it never happened.</div><div id="00:01:55.360" class="transcript_line"> Colored people had more fear than they&#039;ve gotten now.</div><div id="00:01:59.360" class="transcript_line"> A lot of things that they were scared to just read or talk about.</div><div id="00:02:04.360" class="transcript_line"> Thus, not only was a major catastrophe ignored, but even more important, the legacy that rose</div><div id="00:02:10.360" class="transcript_line"> out of its ashes was also forgotten.</div><div id="00:02:15.360" class="transcript_line"> My name is Ozzie Davis and I&#039;m an actor.</div><div id="00:02:18.360" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Cogdell, Georgia in 1917, two years before the tragedy in Elaine.</div><div id="00:02:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Yet, despite geographical differences, the world of rural Arkansas was not much different</div><div id="00:02:31.360" class="transcript_line"> from the world of rural Georgia.</div><div id="00:02:34.360" class="transcript_line"> Both were part of the South.</div><div id="00:02:37.360" class="transcript_line"> Then a region where black people were segregated from whites by custom and law.</div><div id="00:02:44.360" class="transcript_line"> As a black person, I was forbidden to eat in the same restaurant, study in the same school,</div><div id="00:02:50.360" class="transcript_line"> pray in the same church, or be admitted to the same hospital.</div><div id="00:02:54.360" class="transcript_line"> Like every other southern black person, I was expected to learn my place as a second-class citizen.</div><div id="00:03:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And if I didn&#039;t, calamity could strike me down suddenly and without warning.</div><div id="00:03:11.360" class="transcript_line"> I still remember the terrifying stories I heard as a child of how white men in white hoods</div><div id="00:03:17.360" class="transcript_line"> burned crosses, whipped, hung, and burned to death black men and women who had transgressed the racial codes.</div><div id="00:03:27.360" class="transcript_line"> To me, these tales always carried with them the smell of burning flesh.</div><div id="00:03:35.360" class="transcript_line"> In the South of my childhood, whites considered the cotton fields the best place for most black people.</div><div id="00:03:42.360" class="transcript_line"> White planters needed cheap black labor to grow and pick their cotton.</div><div id="00:03:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Among the richest fields in the world are hundreds of thousands of square miles of land in the Arkansas Delta.</div><div id="00:03:55.360" class="transcript_line"> The men and women who work the land are supposed to receive half the cotton crop in exchange for their labor.</div><div id="00:04:03.360" class="transcript_line"> But many landlords cheat them out of their rightful share.</div><div id="00:04:08.360" class="transcript_line"> The man would take your cotton, and then the man that stole your credit, he&#039;d run the books up on you, so you didn&#039;t have nothing.</div><div id="00:04:15.360" class="transcript_line"> You worked a whole year and hand-picked 40 pairs of cotton and come out with nothing.</div><div id="00:04:21.360" class="transcript_line"> They kept him in debt, this black or white, particularly blacks, and he never did get out of debt.</div><div id="00:04:30.360" class="transcript_line"> So he might be living on the same plantation for 10, 15, 20 years and never get out of debt.</div><div id="00:04:36.360" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d whip you like a dog or something, they would do you just like you would do an old dog a hog or something.</div><div id="00:04:47.360" class="transcript_line"> This is the way things were in the South in the early 20th century.</div><div id="00:04:51.360" class="transcript_line"> But although nobody knew it then, the winds of change are rising, set in motion by a catastrophic war.</div><div id="00:05:00.360" class="transcript_line"> In 1917, America enters World War I, which Woodrow Wilson proclaims will make the world safe for democracy.</div><div id="00:05:13.360" class="transcript_line"> Black soldiers fight with courage, bringing honor to themselves and their country.</div><div id="00:05:20.360" class="transcript_line"> As they return home, they are greeted with the fiery words of the black leader W.E.B. Du Bois.</div><div id="00:05:27.360" class="transcript_line"> By the God of heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if we do not marshal our brain and brawn</div><div id="00:05:34.360" class="transcript_line"> to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.</div><div id="00:05:46.360" class="transcript_line"> Whites react violently to this new militancy.</div><div id="00:05:50.360" class="transcript_line"> In the red summer of 1919, so-called because blood flows in the streets, race riots erupt in over 350 cities.</div><div id="00:06:00.360" class="transcript_line"> In Chicago, 23 blacks and 15 whites are killed.</div><div id="00:06:06.360" class="transcript_line"> In Washington, D.C., four whites and two blacks.</div><div id="00:06:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Whites are astounded that blacks dare to fight back.</div><div id="00:06:20.360" class="transcript_line"> On the night of September 30, 1919, in Phillips County, Arkansas, a small group of black men and women</div><div id="00:06:27.360" class="transcript_line"> are also planning a fight against their oppressors.</div><div id="00:06:31.360" class="transcript_line"> They have organized into a union, the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America.</div><div id="00:06:38.360" class="transcript_line"> Their plan is to sue their landlords for money owed them for their crops and for an itemized accounting of their charges at the store.</div><div id="00:06:48.360" class="transcript_line"> But the farmers&#039; plans are known to their enemies.</div><div id="00:06:52.360" class="transcript_line"> Even as they meet, two white law enforcement officers arrive at the church.</div><div id="00:06:57.360" class="transcript_line"> Shots are fired, and in the confusion, a white man is killed.</div><div id="00:07:04.360" class="transcript_line"> His death triggers a massive reprisal.</div><div id="00:07:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Terror reigns. Whites falsely claim blacks are the victims of the war.</div><div id="00:07:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Whites are the victims of the war.</div><div id="00:07:19.360" class="transcript_line"> Whites are the victims of the war.</div><div id="00:07:22.360" class="transcript_line"> Terror reigns. Whites falsely claim blacks are in a state of insurrection.</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> A local white sheriff sends out a call for men to hunt Mr. Nigger in his lab.</div><div id="00:07:37.360" class="transcript_line"> The call went out for Mississippians to come to the rescue of the white men in Phillips County who were under severe attack.</div><div id="00:07:47.360" class="transcript_line"> And so they jumped into cars and they jumped into trains, and at least according to the oral sources that I&#039;ve talked to, they fired out of the windows at every black they saw.</div><div id="00:07:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Women in the fields, it didn&#039;t matter. If it was black and moving, it was target practice.</div><div id="00:08:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Hundreds of farmers are trapped. Among them is Frank Moore.</div><div id="00:08:07.360" class="transcript_line"> The whites sent word that they was coming down here and killed every Nigger they found.</div><div id="00:08:12.360" class="transcript_line"> There were 300 or 400 more white men with guns shooting and killing women and children.</div><div id="00:08:20.360" class="transcript_line"> Farmers are not the only target for the mob.</div><div id="00:08:24.360" class="transcript_line"> Dr. D.A.E. Johnson, a prominent dentist from Helena, Arkansas, and his three brothers are seized.</div><div id="00:08:31.360" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re chained together in a car and shot to death.</div><div id="00:08:36.360" class="transcript_line"> Soldiers from the U.S. Army eventually restore order.</div><div id="00:08:40.360" class="transcript_line"> By the time the shooting ends, officially 25 blacks and five whites are dead.</div><div id="00:08:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Some say, however, that as many as 200 blacks might have been killed, their bodies dumped in the Mississippi River, or left to rot in the cane break.</div><div id="00:09:01.360" class="transcript_line"> The stench of the dead can be smelled for miles.</div><div id="00:09:05.360" class="transcript_line"> Officially, blacks are blamed for the riot.</div><div id="00:09:10.360" class="transcript_line"> The general reaction of the white establishment in Phillips County in the aftermath of the riot was a charge that was leveled against the black population</div><div id="00:09:26.360" class="transcript_line"> that they were in a secret conspiracy to rise up and to overthrow the white power structure and the landowning class in eastern Arkansas.</div><div id="00:09:39.360" class="transcript_line"> I think the Elaine riot was about the fact that black farmers in Phillips County were tired of not sharing the wealth that they were producing.</div><div id="00:09:49.360" class="transcript_line"> And the Progressive Farmers and Household Union was an attempt on their part to share the wealth.</div><div id="00:09:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Because white men have been killed, more black men must die.</div><div id="00:10:01.360" class="transcript_line"> Hundreds are detained, 67 are sent to prison, and 12 are tried by an all-white jury for the murder of whites.</div><div id="00:10:10.360" class="transcript_line"> As the trial begins, a mob surrounds the court building, warning the court that if the accused are not sentenced to death, the mob will lynch them.</div><div id="00:10:22.360" class="transcript_line"> For a black defendant to go into that atmosphere was almost ridiculous in the sense that they hadn&#039;t even talked to their attorneys who had been appointed for them.</div><div id="00:10:38.360" class="transcript_line"> For example, in the first trial, the attorney stood up and said, ladies and gentlemen, I hadn&#039;t even talked to my client.</div><div id="00:10:49.360" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s always been the effort of the establishment in the South to always maintain that black people get a fair shape.</div><div id="00:10:58.360" class="transcript_line"> And the basic story is that when you have a black person charged with an offense, the judge would say, well, you know, boy, I&#039;m going to make sure that you get a good lawyer.</div><div id="00:11:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Then I&#039;m going to make sure that you get a fair trial, and then we&#039;re going to hang you.</div><div id="00:11:15.360" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s in essence kind of what happened in the Elaine case.</div></div></p>
