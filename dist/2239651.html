I&#039;ve got about three years.</div><div id="00:00:43.920" class="transcript_line"> About three years. Was it a good job? Yeah, it wasn&#039;t bad. I was a young</div><div id="00:00:50.880" class="transcript_line"> just ever driver. I passed my chest when I was 17. Right. And the boss of</div><div id="00:00:55.840" class="transcript_line"> in Canton, he came out and he stripped the lorry down of all the unnecessary stuff</div><div id="00:01:03.040" class="transcript_line"> that was on it.

Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:12.720" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that&#039;s how it started.

And they were bought out by</div><div id="00:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> Winkhamton. Yeah.

Yeah, I think.</div><div id="00:01:37.360" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t quite remember. No, exactly. Yeah. And why did you leave?</div><div id="00:01:43.440" class="transcript_line"> One of the things, a different job. Yeah. What did you go into?</div><div id="00:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I worked in the factory at one day. Right. After that. Yeah. And what was the factory doing?</div><div id="00:01:55.520" class="transcript_line"> Sorry. What was the factory doing? With a metal. All sorts of things. Race, but all.</div><div id="00:02:01.920" class="transcript_line"> You know, everything in the gut. A better and right mostly.

I was made.</div><div id="00:02:25.440" class="transcript_line"> There are big boilers there that used to cook the rice really. And used to go in on the big</div><div id="00:02:34.960" class="transcript_line"> trays with a dozen of them and they just circle around in the boiler for a certain amount of time.</div><div id="00:02:42.960" class="transcript_line"> And then go up the other end and then you&#039;d more and more in. Well, it just changed.</div><div id="00:02:49.120" class="transcript_line"> I would use to be here. And when you were driving the lobby,</div><div id="00:02:55.440" class="transcript_line"> did you do the same round every day? More or less. Yeah. What was that round?</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Lord. The place to go. To lay away and everything. I remember there was one particular</div><div id="00:03:11.280" class="transcript_line"> place. I used to enjoy going there. As you enter to lay, you down the hill as a farm,</div><div id="00:03:19.200" class="transcript_line"> right on edge of the village, it only left on the side. And I used to pull up there every morning.</div><div id="00:03:24.880" class="transcript_line"> And there was a whitehead fox area on Stun. So I used to get out of the lobby.</div><div id="00:03:33.440" class="transcript_line"> I used to come round and jump in. The round entail then went around to lay.</div><div id="00:03:40.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m back out there both 100 yards under same road where the farm was.</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> The teddy would come round and we&#039;d sit in the passenger seat.</div><div id="00:03:50.480" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d stopped there and before he hit in the main road.</div><div id="00:03:54.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d open the door and let him out. That was every day. What was his name?</div><div id="00:03:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;m not sure. I never saw the farm. I don&#039;t know if you can remember.</div><div id="00:04:03.760" class="transcript_line"> But the dog was your friend. Yeah. Every day.</div><div id="00:04:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, lovely. So when you went out on your rounds, how many rounds a day would you do?</div><div id="00:04:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes three. Depends on some drivers never turned up or something. Yeah. A couple of us</div><div id="00:04:23.680" class="transcript_line"> were going to cover the... But normally? Two, two normally.</div><div id="00:04:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So what time would you start?</div><div id="00:04:30.800" class="transcript_line"> Half a certain. Half a certain. And finish? Typically?</div><div id="00:04:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, three, half a three. Okay. Okay.</div><div id="00:04:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And how many turns on the laundry?</div><div id="00:04:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got up yet. I haven&#039;t got up yet. I haven&#039;t got up yet.</div><div id="00:04:45.680" class="transcript_line"> But what kind of laundry well said that? A bed-fund laundry. Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:50.400" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes you had a rack on top. So you could put extra turns on and down.</div><div id="00:04:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Was it a hard job?</div><div id="00:05:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Heavy. It&#039;s not all the stung. The same height as the laundry. You know, you&#039;re either at a lift</div><div id="00:05:11.760" class="transcript_line"> them on or drop them or something. So you&#039;re just a couple of sleepers.</div><div id="00:05:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. You know. So that was harder then?</div><div id="00:05:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:24.960" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them too, but really? Once you got used to it.</div><div id="00:05:29.040" class="transcript_line"> And did you get to know the farmers? A couple of them. Yeah. One thing I got to my credit,</div><div id="00:05:35.360" class="transcript_line"> I think, I never left the farmer behind.</div><div id="00:05:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Well done. A lot of drivers. If the children weren&#039;t there,</div><div id="00:05:44.160" class="transcript_line"> they don&#039;t. Gone in the farm, out of trips, in the middle of kids, some of them in those days.</div><div id="00:05:49.600" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have the transport like they got now. Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:53.760" class="transcript_line"> So if I&#039;d wait about 10 minutes and if you hadn&#039;t come down there,</div><div id="00:05:58.160" class="transcript_line"> now you&#039;re too, if I was able to go up to the farm. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:02.640" class="transcript_line"> And if they were really late, what would the humps go? You know, some breakfast when we finish off?</div><div id="00:06:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s nice. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:10.640" class="transcript_line"> And I can say, I remember my father coming home with chicken, and bread,</div><div id="00:06:17.520" class="transcript_line"> and vegetables, you know, and I never thought much about it.</div><div id="00:06:24.160" class="transcript_line"> But then I was having that then because I was waiting for the farmer and the following day,</div><div id="00:06:29.920" class="transcript_line"> or a couple of days later, they&#039;d be a chicken on the stand,</div><div id="00:06:33.440" class="transcript_line"> or the box of vegetables, or the bag of potatoes. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:38.240" class="transcript_line"> Thank him, he for waiting, you know. That happened quite a lot.</div><div id="00:06:43.360" class="transcript_line"> The same, and it was the same farmer, or often or not.</div><div id="00:06:47.520" class="transcript_line"> There was always legs. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:49.920" class="transcript_line"> So what I&#039;m hearing then is that they appreciated your,</div><div id="00:06:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah. Your health. Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:55.120" class="transcript_line"> And you were really part of that community. I never left anyone behind.</div><div id="00:06:59.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I&#039;m sure a lot of people were very grateful for that.</div><div id="00:07:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, in those days, it didn&#039;t have the transport that they got today.</div><div id="00:07:06.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, to take the milk to the factory. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> And what happened in the summer when it was hot with the milk?</div><div id="00:07:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the, it was oily in the morning, it didn&#039;t really affect it.</div><div id="00:07:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:07:20.640" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes there was the drip wet sacks over it, it says.</div><div id="00:07:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But that was very sad.</div><div id="00:07:27.840" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if I wouldn&#039;t have got very cold in the winter.</div><div id="00:07:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was cold. I&#039;m in the gym.</div><div id="00:07:32.720" class="transcript_line"> You never fought much of a load of it, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:07:35.680" class="transcript_line"> You just, you just did it. Just got on with it.</div><div id="00:07:38.960" class="transcript_line"> You were young. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:41.040" class="transcript_line"> And you would left before the winter of 63, then, did you?</div><div id="00:07:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:47.120" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t have to struggle through the snow. No.</div><div id="00:07:49.040" class="transcript_line"> No. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:50.160" class="transcript_line"> That was, uh, you were lucky there.</div><div id="00:07:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Um, so what were the best bits of the job?</div><div id="00:07:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Painting.</div><div id="00:08:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it a well-paid job?</div><div id="00:08:04.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it was obviously. I think I don&#039;t think it was,</div><div id="00:08:06.960" class="transcript_line"> you went over paid, just a few of it, then.</div><div id="00:08:09.600" class="transcript_line"> But it, uh, you know, you had your time, you had to</div><div id="00:08:13.760" class="transcript_line"> maybe to go to the camp, then, uh,</div><div id="00:08:16.160" class="transcript_line"> obviously, no, and things like that.</div><div id="00:08:18.240" class="transcript_line"> It was all right.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And how many days a week did you work?</div><div id="00:08:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, some days, seven.</div><div id="00:08:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Worked for a small stay.</div><div id="00:08:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Of course. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:31.040" class="transcript_line"> After six days a week, normally.</div><div id="00:08:33.840" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve been there.</div><div id="00:08:37.040" class="transcript_line"> And you, you know, it&#039;s sort of like, you couldn&#039;t say like,</div><div id="00:08:41.600" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re having a read Wednesday, office, and then, you could, like,</div><div id="00:08:45.280" class="transcript_line"> a Tuesday this week, Wednesday next week.</div><div id="00:08:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:08:49.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, to cope with all of it,</div><div id="00:08:51.920" class="transcript_line"> somebody else to do your own, you know.</div><div id="00:08:53.680" class="transcript_line"> What would be other drivers like?</div><div id="00:08:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Sorry. What would the other drivers like?</div><div id="00:08:58.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were good.</div><div id="00:09:00.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:01.840"

class="transcript_line"> We</div><div id="00:09:12.880" class="transcript_line"> 25, 30 hours going out every day.</div><div id="00:09:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:09:18.160" class="transcript_line"> And then in the factory?</div><div id="00:09:20.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all possible.</div><div id="00:09:23.040" class="transcript_line"> 100 or more.</div><div id="00:09:25.440" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re all doing different kinds of work, you know.</div><div id="00:09:28.080" class="transcript_line"> What we got back to the factory with the children,</div><div id="00:09:32.160" class="transcript_line"> you put them in and put them on in so that they weigh each farm.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that was a, and then you load up the empties again and then off again.</div><div id="00:09:43.040" class="transcript_line"> And how did they know which milk came from which farm?</div><div id="00:09:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:09:47.760" class="transcript_line"> They were, they were the label on them.</div><div id="00:09:51.600" class="transcript_line"> And you take the label off,</div><div id="00:09:54.400" class="transcript_line"> the four terms or whatever.</div><div id="00:09:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:57.120" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d be way that.</div><div id="00:09:59.360" class="transcript_line"> But it was continued, it wasn&#039;t, it wasn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:10:01.840" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t stop, you know.</div><div id="00:10:03.680" class="transcript_line"> We just kept waiting for each farm out and the guy

just pulled in there and re-bossed back out.</div><div id="00:11:42.080" class="transcript_line"> And there was a bloody bull used to come and meet me every moment.</div><div id="00:11:46.480" class="transcript_line"> Wherever in the field he was, wherever in the eye pulled up.</div><div id="00:11:50.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:51.200" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s all the words, there&#039;s a wide offense the other side of the road,</div><div id="00:11:54.560" class="transcript_line"> of the lane.</div><div id="00:11:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I could come thunder and out,</div><div id="00:11:58.880" class="transcript_line"> and get into a stop beyond barely rain and dig in.</div><div id="00:12:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s like a great funerary.</div><div id="00:12:08.640" class="transcript_line"> Teasing and there and there.</div><div id="00:12:09.920" class="transcript_line"> And I was frightened and the beginning was thinking he&#039;d come through the fence.</div><div id="00:12:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:13.760" class="transcript_line"> He never did.</div><div id="00:12:15.360" class="transcript_line"> We got to escape to say hello, right?</div><div id="00:12:18.160"

class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember anything, really bad.</div><div id="00:12:42.160" class="transcript_line"> No accidents.</div><div id="00:12:44.880" class="transcript_line"> No,
