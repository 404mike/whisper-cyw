    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Julie Lawrence and I am interviewing Sue Birch, one of the volunteers at</div><div id="00:00:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Frenzive Cardiff Reservoirs about her involvement with the Reservoirs.</div><div id="00:00:11.160" class="transcript_line"> My earliest memories of the Reservoir is when my family learnt to sail there</div><div id="00:00:15.880" class="transcript_line"> between the late 19th and early 90s. My husband learnt to sail first and continued</div><div id="00:00:23.680" class="transcript_line"> to volunteer and Wednesday evening classes for the youngsters for many years. Get in the</div><div id="00:00:29.320" class="transcript_line"> boats ready and helping taking the youngsters out on the water.</div><div id="00:00:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So have you got any particularly special memories of events that happened while you were attending</div><div id="00:00:40.240" class="transcript_line"> the Reservoir and your husband was volunteering helping children learn to sail?</div><div id="00:00:45.360" class="transcript_line"> When the legato was on I won the things I remember is my middle daughter, capsizing just after</div><div id="00:00:51.440" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d set off and my husband had to go and help rescuer. I remember all the little</div><div id="00:00:59.960" class="transcript_line"> frogglets that used to be on the ropes that kept the boats mored to the pontoon and just</div><div id="00:01:06.800" class="transcript_line"> generally wandering around the Reservoir and observing the wildlife while the children</div><div id="00:01:10.840" class="transcript_line"> were out sailing. When I learnt to sail myself at the end of the course you had to do a</div><div id="00:01:18.560" class="transcript_line"> capsize and I did my capsize drill, I was quite petrified. I came up underneath the sail</div><div id="00:01:26.800" class="transcript_line"> which was most disconcerting. The worst thing of all was when I actually got back up and</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> in the boat I had lost one of my shoes. I remember it was a yellow white striped marks</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and spencers canvas shoe which I assume is still lying at the bottom of the Reservoir</div><div id="00:01:45.520" class="transcript_line"> somewhere. How do you think coming to the Reservoir</div><div id="00:01:50.760" class="transcript_line"> affected you as a family? I think we find it as a, apart from the actual</div><div id="00:01:56.240" class="transcript_line"> form of learning to sail, the atmosphere was great, you could wander around in between</div><div id="00:02:02.200" class="transcript_line"> and it was tranquil and it&#039;s always stuck with me. When you look at the Reservoirs as they</div><div id="00:02:08.960" class="transcript_line"> are today what does that mean to you now? It brings down lots of family memories, but</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> when we all used to be here it&#039;s amazing to see it now as it is with the ability to</div><div id="00:02:20.120" class="transcript_line"> walk around it, having to get a licence. Just to see how much is improved and how much</div><div id="00:02:25.960" class="transcript_line"> the people are now going to learn to sail into water sports here. What wonderful facilities</div><div id="00:02:34.640" class="transcript_line"> they have. You&#039;ve become a volunteer yourself. What have you enjoyed about that? I&#039;ve enjoyed</div><div id="00:02:44.040" class="transcript_line"> trolling around the Reservoir, watching the wildlife as I go around chatting to people,</div><div id="00:02:50.200" class="transcript_line"> some of the activities that&#039;s been done such as well as in the word with the Simon Seeker</div><div id="00:02:55.160" class="transcript_line"> families has been really, really worthwhile and I think I will enjoy all the ongoing activities</div><div id="00:03:01.160" class="transcript_line"> that are there that keep me coming around the Reservoir. Once the Reservoir closed to people</div><div id="00:03:07.240" class="transcript_line"> sailing, did your families continue to sail? Or what did you do? My childhood didn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:03:16.840" class="transcript_line"> but my husband had a boat in Mandagvier than we sailed a couple of times up there.</div><div id="00:03:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Now that it&#039;s open again for water sports do you think that you might participate in that</div><div id="00:03:27.880" class="transcript_line"> in the future? Yes, I probably will. My husband certainly will, I&#039;ll go with sailing and I know that</div><div id="00:03:34.280" class="transcript_line"> one of my daughters wants to come up here to go paddle boarding and probably my grandchildren as well.</div><div id="00:03:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh that would be lovely to have three generations. I promise.</div><div id="00:03:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else that you&#039;d like to tell us about your involvement with the Reservoir?</div><div id="00:03:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Well when my family visit from Manchester and Reading, grandchildren and my daughters</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> always come for walk around the Reservoir, it&#039;s one of their destinations when they come to Cardiff</div><div id="00:03:59.480" class="transcript_line"> to visit. No, absolutely. Can you tell me anything about some of the wildlife that you&#039;ve seen at the</div><div id="00:04:05.480" class="transcript_line"> Reservoir? Well there&#039;s plenty of defted ducks and little greaves, loads of nodes and little greaves,</div><div id="00:04:12.440" class="transcript_line"> but in the summer I was doing a patrol here once and there were big flock of swifts that came</div><div id="00:04:18.360" class="transcript_line"> back and forth circulating and then disappeared. That&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve seen a flock of swifts</div><div id="00:04:23.320" class="transcript_line"> and it was quite amazing. Have you ever spotted anything that&#039;s particularly excited or surprised you?</div><div id="00:04:38.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any memories of nature being at the Reservoir while the sailing was going on?</div><div id="00:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a larger number of geese and one of the tasks of the volunteers was to clean all</div><div id="00:04:49.240" class="transcript_line"> the goose-strottings off the boats before the kids could take them out.</div></div></p>
