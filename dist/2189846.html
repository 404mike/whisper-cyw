    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m speaking to Pat Ashworth, who lives currently in Duganwy, but was living in Llandudno during the war.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, Pat.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, Vicki.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me your memories.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my memories during the war, one vivid memory was being quite terrified when the Germans were bombing Liverpool</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> and after they dropped their bombs, they flew over Llandudno.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And during that time, they dropped a bomb on Nantegamma Mountain and then flew over Conway and out to sea.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember we had double summertime then, so it was light till midnight.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember standing at the end of my bed, holding the bed frame and shaking because we could see all the lights on Liverpool from the bombs that were dropped by the Germans.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So Liverpool was a light and you could see the brightness from it.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. And then hearing the planes flying over was quite terrifying because I didn&#039;t know what they were going to do next.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s my biggest memory of the war really.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And of being really scared that you would be the next.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially Lantegamma was relatively close. I didn&#039;t know there was a bomb that dropped on Lantegamma.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Was anyone killed?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. I don&#039;t know if the crate is still there.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder whether it is. So you were quite young.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was about nine or eight. I was at junior school.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a gas mask to go to school? Was that considered important in Llandudno?</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We had gas masks. All school children had gas masks.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the Ministry of Finance were here, weren&#039;t they, in Llandudno?</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So Llandudno must have been full of strangers. Did it feel as though your town had been taken over?</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not particularly. My mother worked in the Income Tax Office at what was the hotel, the Marine Hotel.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, all the hotels were taken over, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I know the Imperial was taken over.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was called the Boulevard recently, but I can&#039;t remember the name during the war, but the BBC were there.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And they broadcast all the ITMA programmes and the news.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of help here in Llandudno for everybody.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So the Germans dropped the bomb on Nantegama presumably by accident, but perhaps if they&#039;d known what was going on in Llandudno, they might have aimed them a bit more accurately.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but they dropped them to make their aircraft lighter to fly back to Germany.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I know you were rationed. Did it feel uncomfortable? Did you feel hungry?</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, we didn&#039;t. We were rations.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And one thing I remember, I&#039;d lost my sweet coupons and I couldn&#039;t find them anywhere.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And then that was the summertime. And I was in the brownies then. And then when I went, started with the brownies again in September, there was my sweet coupon in my brownie pocket.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you didn&#039;t have sweets that time? Because I remember after the war we had sweet coupons.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t a great hardship. There was always enough, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> No, and my mother did all the cooking and we weren&#039;t short of food.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So was your father away in the services perhaps?</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No, my father, he was in the Air Force in Carnarvon and he had an accident. So he was invalid out of the Air Force. So he didn&#039;t, he wasn&#039;t in good health.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was home during the war?</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, thank you very much. Have you got any other things that you think you might have remembered?</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I remember walking home from school, which was Craigadon School.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And there would be a man walking around and he&#039;d have a photograph in his hand and come up to you and say, show you the photograph and say, have you seen this man?</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was terrifying because what was he looking for, you know, a spy? I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever find out what he was looking for?</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, but he&#039;s not quite a fuel of a school of children because there were no buses then.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We all walked home from school, walked to school and walked back at lunchtime home because no school meals.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The weather was bad. My mother would bring sandwiches for us.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And you never found the strange man they were looking for?</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh goodness. I wonder who he was.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I wonder. Never know.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Never know. No. Oh, thank you very much. I really enjoyed your memories. Thank you so much. I&#039;m going to put it off now.</div></div></p>
