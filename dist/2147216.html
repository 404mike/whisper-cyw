id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Am I okay?</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> President&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Huh?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re good.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Magnificent.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, but I want to make sure.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want, because she&#039;s the first one who&#039;s going to tell me where,</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> you couldn&#039;t get somebody to just do that, or fix that, or drag that, or.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll go start there, if you give us an introduction to yourself, please.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Ready?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Roy Grant.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Jamaica and came to the United Kingdom at the age of 19 years of age.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a wonderful childhood marred by affliction, but of a good, good parentage.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> My parents sent me here to the United Kingdom at the age of 19,</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> because after leaving school, I loved to do engineering, and I began my engineering apprenticeship.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Arriving in this country, oh my goodness, what a change.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And so much, so different from what I&#039;m used to.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Cold wind, my hands, my fingers numbed, my body shivers.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I arrived in Southampton by a ship called the SSB Gona, 11 days a night aboard the ship,</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> which wasn&#039;t a very nice experience.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I arrived at Southampton, we got on a train to Victoria, and then from Victoria,</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to Birmingham and there to live with my cousin.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I spent the first week getting used to the family I now become, to adopt,</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and the home that is going to be my own for no, well, in fact,</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> on my application to come to this country, I had to put on it, I&#039;ll be here for five years.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So, at that point, I would have been, all my intention that I was going to spend five years in the country,</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;ll be going back to Jamaica.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> However, I had the first week to get used to the place as it were,</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> and the family that was about to adopt me as their own.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And after a week, I was taken to what they call the labour exchange in those days,</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> which is the employment department, the job centre, which is now known as,</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and sign on for a job.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And at the same time, I was purchasing the evening news to see what vacancies were available.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, between these two outlets, I saw quite a number of vacancies for apprentices for engineering,</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and I thought, this is great, I wouldn&#039;t have a problem here.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> However, I would send for applications, and applications would come along,</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> but in them days, the post was pretty good.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And furthermore, in some of these notices for engineers, there used to be a little write in there,</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> which you fill in, and you get through to the engineer works that you seek out very quickly.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, when I received some sort of confirmation that my request was being looked at,</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and I fill in these applications, send them back, they would quickly send to me and say,</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> well, come in for an interview.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is the strangest thing is, when I remember speaking to one or two people at this job,</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> at the works, and they were so enthusiastic about me, because my English wasn&#039;t any different from what it is now.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So they wouldn&#039;t realize that I was black, and it was just a matter of Bromie English,</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s not really straight English in many places.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And they say, come in. But when I got there, and two words, you know, where do you live? I said.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> How long have you been in the country? I said, well, a month.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they say, well, who did you learn your engineering with? I say, in Jamaica.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I say, well, I&#039;m sorry, but we can&#039;t have you because you have a broken apprenticeship.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was turned down, dreadful.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And this repeat itself on several occasions. So I was really fed up.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, what is the worst thing about this discriminative attitude?</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember going to the door of a few engineering places, and in those days, they had a window like a hatchet.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And like a hatchet, you slide this hatchet door open, and the receptionist or whoever it is speak to you.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember walking up to the door, and the door was in a position where you could see the hatchet window.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I could see the lady sitting at the desk looking out through the hatchet window to see who was coming through the door.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as she sees me, the hatchet went, clunk, shuts tight.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And she walked away and shut the door behind her in her room because they didn&#039;t want any black people.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It later come to my knowledge that, you see, engineering or precision engineering in the 60s were the rose-roised trade for the poor man,</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> those who couldn&#039;t send their kids to university or who didn&#039;t pass the 11 plus.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And for a black man to take those spaces was very rare.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, the workers or the tradesmen who have a boy child who would want to continue being an engineer would put their names down,</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> just like they used to do in the schools, would put their names on as a child so that when they leave school, they go straight into that engineering work.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So you have father, grandfather, grandchildren, all family in that engineering.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was so fed up that I wrote to my cousin who lived in Wales, and I told her what the situation was,</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, it&#039;s discrimination and nobody wants to give me a job because I wasn&#039;t intent to do anything else.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, no, as far as she&#039;s concerned, people in Wales are very, very nice, they&#039;re very cooperative and so on.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So come down. And I came to Wales.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you?</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came to Wales, I came to Wales on the, yes, I came to Wales, I can remember now, the last week in July, 1962, and just on my 20th birthday.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was what they call the two weeks shut down holiday, the summer holidays.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And the newspaper came out, which was the, I can&#039;t remember if it&#039;s the Echo or the August, came out or the early August,</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and I read it and it says, engineer apprentice wanted.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t stop to think, I just, and there was a telephone number, and I picked up and I rang.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And this gentleman said to me, yes, we want an apprentice, we want apprentices, you know, if you want to come along.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I went and I saw the form and because at this engineering work, which was grinding engineering,</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said to me, yes, but I can&#039;t give you the yes today.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to come back a following week and see the owner and they will give you yes.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I went back the following week and you wouldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on top form because they said yes, I, they would take me on.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so pleased.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the beginning of my future as an engineering, position engineering apprenticeship in Wales.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I am grateful to come into Wales because I succeed in doing what I set out to do.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Now you have been working in engineering, you have grown up.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When did your wife or your fiance come over?</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, in those early days, what the government, the government was stopping everyone from coming.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But if you have dependent relatives or your fiance, they could come.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> However, for fiancees, fiancees could come with one premises that you have to get married within three months of arriving in the country.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it wasn&#039;t long before I put everything I could together to send for my fiance.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And the following year in 1963, she came and we got married in December of that year.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it wasn&#039;t long after we made our life together and we ended up having four kids, wonderful children.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> One girl and three boys, well, plus one other boy, make five kids.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, however, I don&#039;t know if this interview is the right place to do it, but I have to tell you this.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Whenever everyone who succeeds, every black person who came here during the 60s and succeed in doing anything that is very important,</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> they have to sacrifice something.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And unfortunately, my family, unwittingly, I sacrificed my family to develop my engineering skill because I have to work twice as hard as the white man.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had to be twice as clever as the white man because within a short time, the introduction of nylon to the manufacturing industry, especially textile,</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> create the need for wrapping cutting tools.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was the man who was rushed to develop that wrapping cutting tool in tungsten carbide,</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> which makes the company and a lot of other people very rich.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was a nobody to the English. I was black. I wasn&#039;t rich.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, I have no right to say, to have any say in the development as what would I think in saying I could take ownership of the fact that this is what I&#039;ve done as evidence.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> No, everything was pointed out to the ownership of the owner of that engineering.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can only say it with conviction that I&#039;ve done it, but I cannot embrace a certificate to say, well, this is what I have done and I can be and I am satisfied that I&#039;ve been compensated.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but I feel good because engineering is what I love and I have done it so no one can take that away from me.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> When you say Wales, where are you?</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales, well, I say that I talk about Birmingham carries a lot of treated me with resentment and discrimination.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t mean to say that there is not there wasn&#039;t discrimination and resentment in Wales.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> There was, but it was undermined a lot different from in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham, it was on the doorstep. In Wales, it&#039;s under the carpet.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And the different was a subtlety because, for instance, during my engineering work and I was developing this stuff so rapidly and to compensate me and to keep me within that work environment so that I wouldn&#039;t be poached or go anywhere else.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I was rapidly promoted from charging to foreman to production manager.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember, you know, one of the men who made friends with me and he was the one who gave me the first cup of tea.</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, he went to the, this is what the foreman told me after the event.</div><div id="00:16:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And he apparently he told the foreman, he went to the foreman and asked the foreman if this black bastard come to give me authority, a job or what should I do?</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And the foreman was looked at him and this is what and I quote what they are saying.</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The foreman said, when I give you a job to do, what do you do?</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And he answered, he carried it out. So he said, you know that I&#039;m a Polish man.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, yes. So the foreman answered and said, well, what is the difference?</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And the strangest thing is I did not know anything about this that went on.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It was only when the foreman then took me in his confident and advised me to be very careful and to be very straight with everyone.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t give anyone the right, the chance to build up any resentment against me.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And he start to share out all these things that might affect me, might affect my project, my progress, you know, in becoming a good boss as it were then.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> When was then the next turning point?</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The next turning point is I reached a production manager.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been having to and this is the this is this is the underline of the discrimination comes in.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They brought in five different other people to take on the job that I have been doing.</div><div id="00:18:41.000" class="transcript_line"> In other words, to to manage me in the work and set them up as production manager.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to teach those guys what to tell me what to do.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was ridiculous. So after a time, I just got fed up and I said, well, I&#039;m changing my arm.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m changing from engineering and I went into into taxi proprietary and I was a taxi proprietor for over five years.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And and, you know, it was very successful.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But there again, to make it successful, I sacrifice a lot of time building it because I was black and no one wants to to call a black taxi man to take their their daughter to church on the way for their wedding and all like that or to take them out when they&#039;re properly dressed.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> No one wants a black man to drive them or.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And it takes a while to build up the business.</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you and during that time, I sometime have neglected my children because when they want me to take them to sports and so on.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was busy working to, you know, and helping somebody else or something like that.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So I have I have a lot of regret in the fact that I did not.</div><div id="00:20:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I did not equate the important.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is what I&#039;m telling you guys.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No matter how much you want something, when you have a family, try to mesh what you&#039;re doing that is equally divided between what you want and what your family is required of you.</div><div id="00:20:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it can come back to bite you on the ass.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not saying my kids resent me now, but they could, you know.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> They they they it&#039;s hard to forget.</div><div id="00:21:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I was speaking about the blindness.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve been being a taxi propriety.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t long after, you know, people take advantage and they smashing up the vehicle left, right and center.</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I decided to take a change and that change led me into into.</div><div id="00:21:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Develop catering a mobile catering business.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And this mobile catering business was was supplying.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Break break meals, break snacks for the workers, because in those days is very few.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Companies, manufacturers have a canteen whereby, you know, people could go into and.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And get something to eat.</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They would have to send someone to up to the shop.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a it&#039;s all, you know, the company would be we would be losing at least three quarter of an hour for the person to go to the shop.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> At least three quarters of an hour every day.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lot of time over the week.</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was going in and I was taking in all these snacks for these people so that they could stay within the workplace and have their snacks and so on.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And that went on for a few years and I was very successful at it.</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> However, like.</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The overall of over 20 years of of hard work and and.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Stress.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Create diabetes.</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the diabetes.</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Become so great taking over my body so much that it caused hemorrhage in my right eye and rendered me blind.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Completely blind. Oh, you heard me say my right eye.</div><div id="00:23:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So what about my left eye? Well, like I said in the beginning.</div><div id="00:23:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a good childhood, but it was flawed.</div><div id="00:23:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when I was two years of age, I lost sight to an accident in my left eye.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I only had one eye, even though I was insistent on being an engineer and was successful at it.</div><div id="00:23:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So diabetes cause hemorrhage on the optic nerves in my right eye.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was completely blind.</div><div id="00:23:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And my my mobile catering business went.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I could no longer drive.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I lost my license.</div><div id="00:24:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I lost my business and.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I lost my head because the shock.</div><div id="00:24:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Look at me and he explained something to you.</div><div id="00:24:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I just I just finished having my Sunday dinner.</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And we sat at the dinner table and we were all happy having a laugh and a joke.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I pick up my pipe because we smoke a pipe.</div><div id="00:24:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I smoke a pipe by then.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I clean the pipe and in them days, you know, you smoke in the house, you smoke around the table.</div><div id="00:24:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And and I clean my pipe.</div><div id="00:24:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And no before I could fill my pipe and bend in my head like this, cleaning it out.</div><div id="00:24:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s as though I&#039;m looking at a piece of glass like this and somebody drop a tip of well, I didn&#039;t know it was blood.</div><div id="00:24:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Something red.</div><div id="00:25:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just flowing over this piece of glass.</div><div id="00:25:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And it flows and until all I could see was.</div><div id="00:25:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Blaring light around the square ends of this glass.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was it. So I ran in the bathroom, washed my face and all that.</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s nothing happening.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so shocked. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> How the hell did I get into the bathroom and I couldn&#039;t see? I was blind.</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> How did I get there?</div><div id="00:25:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But I got there to the bathroom, washed my face and nobody will my aunt.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Until this day, I can&#039;t tell you how I got there.</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the trauma and that&#039;s where the trauma began because I went to the hospital and there was no one there to tell me.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> How am I going to see again or if I will ever see again or they can do anything.</div><div id="00:25:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was sent home.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The following day I went back.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Same thing.</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And it took three days until the specialist came back from where all the day where he were.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came back and then they begin to panic.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And start to phone up all the different hospitals to find out who was the best person to clean.</div><div id="00:26:23.000" class="transcript_line"> To take away this sort of mushroom thing that left on the optic nerves from the bleeding.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it took I think about three weeks or so for the hospital to make an appointment when for this procedure to take place.</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And it did take place.</div><div id="00:26:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first time I went and they done it, which was Moorfield in London.</div><div id="00:26:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So disappointed.</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t work.</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It took another six weeks for them to do this surgery again, once again.</div><div id="00:27:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And that time this time, the minute they took away the bandage and off my eye.</div><div id="00:27:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What I can only describe as pink balloon, pink jelly.</div><div id="00:27:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I was looking through a glass of pink jelly.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And from there on, my sight began to get stronger and stronger.</div><div id="00:27:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, I was discharged and went home.</div><div id="00:28:01.000" class="transcript_line"> However, I couldn&#039;t remember how to pronounce a word.</div><div id="00:28:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My brain, I was like, I couldn&#039;t write, I couldn&#039;t do nothing.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t remember things.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like a vegetable.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> However, it took, it took months.</div><div id="00:28:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the advice was to do as much as you can with your eyes so that you will train it to, you will exercise it.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Keep exercising it and get it so that it becomes to strengthen it so it&#039;s stronger.</div><div id="00:28:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether they were right or wrong.</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was doing it.</div><div id="00:28:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did all the things that they asked me to do to strengthen the muscles in the eye and the eye and all like that.</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Until I could see what was happening on the television.</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was, you know, after a few months, that was really, really good news.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But my brain was something else.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> However, my children didn&#039;t say to me, well, see what happened to you now.</div><div id="00:29:29.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They were there for me.</div><div id="00:29:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And my family were there for me.</div><div id="00:29:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m so grateful to them.</div><div id="00:29:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the beginning of my, of the real change in my growing, in my life.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I have to learn to start living off pension and not able to work.</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I can tell you this.</div><div id="00:30:01.000" class="transcript_line"> 1996, I have learned, since 1996, I have learned a pay packet.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I have learned my hand out for a pay packet.</div><div id="00:30:10.000" class="transcript_line"> 1996 till 2000, till 2000, I was, I was, 1998, 1998 till 2000, I was literally blind.</div><div id="00:30:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was registered blind in 2020, in 1998, because I could no longer drive a car.</div><div id="00:30:43.000" class="transcript_line"> My license was taken away from me.</div><div id="00:30:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t go anywhere by then.</div><div id="00:30:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t see in the dark.</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Anywhere I go, I have to have someone in me.</div><div id="00:30:55.000" class="transcript_line"> However, as the site began to develop, my friends, the initiative, Community First Initiative was playing a big role in Wales.</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> As they identified Dufferin, where I live, as one place of high deprivation.</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And a few people were creating a group to meet, to help, to meet those needs.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And they asked me to join in.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, my speciality is in engineering.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I have been walking the street before I went blind, and even with the little sight that I had,</div><div id="00:31:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to see those kids take anything they could get all of, whether a piece of iron, a spanner, or a machete.</div><div id="00:32:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, not so much a machete, but the kitchen knife.</div><div id="00:32:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were hammering and cutting and doing whatever they liked to these precision pieces of engineering.</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And it really grieves me.</div><div id="00:32:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So I set about and I developed a community psych-care club that teaches the children how to repair their bikes in a safe environment.</div><div id="00:32:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And also create a psych club to take these kids riding, take them out into the countryside.</div><div id="00:32:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We said, take them out into the countryside for bike ride.</div><div id="00:32:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The council was on board, the police was on board, Alford was on board, and Youth Service was on board.</div><div id="00:33:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So much so.</div><div id="00:33:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I put a, and this is the big thing, I put a big ad in the Argos to say that if you have an old bike</div><div id="00:33:11.000" class="transcript_line"> or something that you no longer use, we will pick it up.</div><div id="00:33:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to pick up these bikes from all over the place.</div><div id="00:33:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, the police used to have a lot of bikes that people steal and no one claimed them.</div><div id="00:33:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to get those bikes and we used to strip them and use the good parts of them and build up good parts.</div><div id="00:33:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was really, really good.</div><div id="00:33:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where my volunteering service began.</div><div id="00:33:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, alongside volunteering, of course, when, like I said, I was encouraged to exercise my eye.</div><div id="00:34:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, by exercising my eye, and of course, my brain was all over the place.</div><div id="00:34:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t remember things, I couldn&#039;t even remember how to pronounce a word and so on and so on.</div><div id="00:34:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I went back to, I take up the option of going back to the high school during the holiday to learn how to read and write and all like that.</div><div id="00:34:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And because this obsession to see again, to be back to where I was,</div><div id="00:34:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I create an obsession to write, to strengthen my eye and to get my brain into gear.</div><div id="00:34:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And this becomes, or it became a real obsession to write.</div><div id="00:34:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I just could not stop writing.</div><div id="00:34:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And the more I write, well, the better it became.</div><div id="00:35:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And today, I can tell, you know, for those who don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:35:09.000" class="transcript_line"> if you were to look under the heading of Roy McPenfield,</div><div id="00:35:14.000" class="transcript_line"> you will have some idea of the number of books, novels that I&#039;ve written, plays,</div><div id="00:35:21.000" class="transcript_line"> plays that have been performed in Pill Millenium, New Seasons Church, Burleigh Academy, Riverfront, Doleman Theatre.</div><div id="00:35:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So quite a number of plays and quite a number of magazines,</div><div id="00:35:46.000" class="transcript_line"> quite a number of books I have written.</div><div id="00:35:50.000" class="transcript_line"> However, again, once the obsession take hold, family gets squeezed.</div><div id="00:36:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I don&#039;t know if I never learned, but was I selfish?</div><div id="00:36:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:36:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was no one there to point and say, well, either you never learn or you&#039;re unselfish.</div><div id="00:36:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I just did what I felt I had to do.</div><div id="00:36:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, whilst I&#039;m doing all these, whilst the need to write, I began, and like I said,</div><div id="00:36:52.000" class="transcript_line"> they said to write a story of my journey.</div><div id="00:36:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I wrote that story. I was so pleased to do it in the first place.</div><div id="00:37:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;ve been joined another group, which was the Black Heritage Association,</div><div id="00:37:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Kumere, which is an offspring to the Southeast Race Relations Council,</div><div id="00:37:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and sister to Gabo, which is a grant association for volunteer.</div><div id="00:37:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And at the time, there was a then chair.</div><div id="00:37:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Usually at the end of each year, they would have a celebration function,</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> or so many times a year they have a sort of what they call a concert, and people would tell stories.</div><div id="00:38:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And Lester would record these stories.</div><div id="00:38:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, being as I was in that state of obsessive writing, I went to Lester and I said,</div><div id="00:38:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Lester, I will write, I will record and write these stories,</div><div id="00:38:25.000" class="transcript_line"> regardless of the fact that you are doing it on tape.</div><div id="00:38:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because if we are doing these stories for the generation in the future,</div><div id="00:38:36.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not going to be easy for them to get to the tape that you are keeping there,</div><div id="00:38:42.000" class="transcript_line"> because you will be only bringing those tapes out once a year.</div><div id="00:38:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Furthermore, those tapes, if more than one person is using those tapes, they get broken, they get, you know,</div><div id="00:38:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and only a limited number of people could see those tapes at any given time.</div><div id="00:39:05.000" class="transcript_line"> If you have it written, it can be seen by a lot of people more often,</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and it can be easily transported, and mothers and parents can read it to their children,</div><div id="00:39:25.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, their stories, or the children can read it to their friends,</div><div id="00:39:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and it will be better transportable, and it will serve for a longer time.</div><div id="00:39:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody agreed with that.</div><div id="00:39:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I set about with, what do you call it, is it Omega? No.</div><div id="00:39:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I set about with a little handheld recorder, and I managed to do 16 recordings.</div><div id="00:40:06.000" class="transcript_line"> However, let me tell you something, bro.</div><div id="00:40:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very difficult having people to tell any stories at all.</div><div id="00:40:18.000" class="transcript_line"> People did not want to tell their stories.</div><div id="00:40:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, black people have been so down-beaten and trod,</div><div id="00:40:30.000" class="transcript_line"> that they didn&#039;t want to start raking up any stories of how they might feel, or how they were treated,</div><div id="00:40:38.000" class="transcript_line"> or the situation from which they came, because they want to pursue a different life.</div><div id="00:40:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not like today, when nobody is ashamed to say, well, my parents are poor.</div><div id="00:40:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Years ago, you don&#039;t want to tell anyone that your parents are poor,</div><div id="00:41:01.000" class="transcript_line"> because they would treat you worse than how they should have.</div><div id="00:41:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So therefore, in those days, people didn&#039;t like to talk about they were poor,</div><div id="00:41:12.000" class="transcript_line"> or their life story, or they didn&#039;t get the education that is now people take for granted.</div><div id="00:41:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So therefore, it was very difficult.</div><div id="00:41:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, I persist, and I did 16 stories.</div><div id="00:41:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And the 16 stories created the first literature exhibition in Newport</div><div id="00:41:36.000" class="transcript_line"> for the 2010 celebration at the library.</div><div id="00:41:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The year when the Ryder Cup and Newport celebrate the most prestigious event of all time,</div><div id="00:41:56.000" class="transcript_line"> you had, because it was the year when Barack Obama becomes president, and he visited Newport.</div><div id="00:42:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So you can imagine, it was a wonderful time.</div><div id="00:42:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And all these stories, and all these books, and all the things that I&#039;ve done, don&#039;t forget, they are all in the library.</div><div id="00:42:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You can go there, and you can see them.</div><div id="00:42:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And my story is packed to the rafter within all the establishments, like the Aberystwyth and so on.</div><div id="00:42:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So that is the highlight, as it were, then.</div><div id="00:42:51.000" class="transcript_line"> However, at the same time, like I said before, the Welsh government bringing the Community First initiative,</div><div id="00:43:01.000" class="transcript_line"> at the same time, there was no provision for black minority ethnic, 50 plus, all minority ethnic people.</div><div id="00:43:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a little bit of provision for what they call a Young People&#039;s Partnership Board,</div><div id="00:43:18.000" class="transcript_line"> which was primarily dealing with the Somalis.</div><div id="00:43:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was nothing for black people, especially Caribbean people.</div><div id="00:43:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And at that point in time, when it was Giavro who was the lead in presenting the case,</div><div id="00:43:47.000" class="transcript_line"> that achieved some funding for both the Somali people and with the church and other groups trying to get funding,</div><div id="00:44:06.000" class="transcript_line"> or some recognition for the plight of minority ethnic people.</div><div id="00:44:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They were lucky, and the Welsh government decided, yes, we will recognize minority ethnic people.</div><div id="00:44:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And they wanted evidence.</div><div id="00:44:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And David Phillips.</div><div id="00:44:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No, first of all, it was Omar Ali.</div><div id="00:44:36.000" class="transcript_line"> He did a study on the Somali people and the situation and their condition and the need for some sort of funding and help.</div><div id="00:44:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when the Welsh government decided that right overall, Community First is needed to acknowledge these people need some help,</div><div id="00:45:09.000" class="transcript_line"> David Phillips was asked to present a study, and he used the Omar Ali present survey plus the survey of Newport as a whole and minority ethnic.</div><div id="00:45:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was presented to the Welsh government by Robert Lenbeck and Brian Hadash and Willem, is it Willem?</div><div id="00:45:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The then manager for Giavro, and they successfully had five people to carry out seminars, five workers to carry out seminars to identify the shortfall, the need.</div><div id="00:46:13.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the need that was created for help for people in community.</div><div id="00:46:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you add in health, you add in housing, you add in education and so on, make five people.</div><div id="00:46:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, whilst I was carrying out the writing of the 16 storybooks for Caribbean people, I had an application.</div><div id="00:46:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was given an application from SUREC at the time and the BBC wanted application for membership to their council.</div><div id="00:47:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was called the BBC Broadcasting Corporation.</div><div id="00:47:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it was the governance unit and I was in the governance unit, I was in governance for five years.</div><div id="00:47:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And within that five years, there was discussion about people with least voice.</div><div id="00:47:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought this is something new and this is something that I like to do.</div><div id="00:47:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And so when the seminars take place and the search for the different bodies of different people who needed to have a voice, I joined the seminars.</div><div id="00:48:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And 50 plus network was created in 2008.</div><div id="00:48:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And in 2008, the black minority 50 plus network was created through GAVO.</div><div id="00:48:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was a part of that, I was part of that group.</div><div id="00:48:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And we done the training and we done the introduction and they given us, because what the Welsh Government wanted, the Welsh Government did not want a support worker or what you call worker to lead people.</div><div id="00:49:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They wanted people to lead or to carry out what their main, to address their needs, to say what they want, to give people a voice.</div><div id="00:49:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I was very interested in people letting their voices heard.</div><div id="00:49:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So then how do we get from the black minority, I think, from the 50s group network to the black minority?</div><div id="00:49:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and this is the heart of this conversation here, is that in 2008, like I said, the group was created.</div><div id="00:49:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And in 2009, but 2008, 2009, I was still working on those 16 books for the 2010 thing.</div><div id="00:50:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But in 2009, I was elected chair for the group, even though I was still working on a, didn&#039;t mean to say that my eye was better.</div><div id="00:50:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was back to square one. I was still doing damage into my eye, but I was obsessed.</div><div id="00:50:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And the problem is all the people at that time, nobody had the experience of running a group except for Vanessa.</div><div id="00:50:42.000" class="transcript_line"> All the other people, they were all people who have interest in the community or in business also.</div><div id="00:50:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But to run a group, it was a different matter. So I was elected chair.</div><div id="00:50:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, being elected chair, I had to create all the paperwork.</div><div id="00:51:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Everything was, I created everything in the first, between, well, while I was doing the exhibition and all that,</div><div id="00:51:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was still working on the creation of the group.</div><div id="00:51:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you see, if you were to look at the 2010 celebration, that will be the 2010 celebration, it&#039;s booklets, an exhibition, which you find in the library.</div><div id="00:51:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It plays a big role in the group creation, because the same, most of the people within the group were part of that exhibition.</div><div id="00:51:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So was the Somali young people. And so they both grew up together.</div><div id="00:52:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And age alive come into force in 2012, because after the 2010 exhibition, and black minority ethnic 50 plus people begin to like what they see,</div><div id="00:52:24.000" class="transcript_line"> all of these people coming together each week and discussing what they want and what they don&#039;t want.</div><div id="00:52:32.000" class="transcript_line"> What happened is that we decided, well, it was probably me.</div><div id="00:52:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I put it to the membership that already you have five different groups, which is black minority ethnic, so and so for health, so and so black minority ethnic for education, black minority ethnic for.</div><div id="00:52:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, this is too complicated. It&#039;s going to cause mix-ups. So let&#039;s change our name. Let&#039;s model our name and give ourselves a brand.</div><div id="00:53:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So all sorts of names, I put all sorts of names, all sorts of names comes up and we opt for age alive.</div><div id="00:53:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Age alive, two little word, which means respect for the individual, regardless of religion or ethnicity, preference, black or white, brown or whatever.</div><div id="00:53:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, doesn&#039;t matter. Respect for the individual is what matters.</div><div id="00:53:56.000" class="transcript_line"> If you can&#039;t respect the individual, you cannot accept the individual as an individual. You have to respect that.</div><div id="00:54:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that is age alive was born on respect.</div><div id="00:54:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we created age alive. And that was my. That was my.</div><div id="00:54:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That again is another obsession. That was my obsession to make it successful.</div><div id="00:54:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I am. And again, once again, I have to be thankful to my children.</div><div id="00:54:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t run the street and say my dad is not my dad because he don&#039;t do anything for me.</div><div id="00:54:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He do it doing it for other people and not for me.</div><div id="00:54:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and I am so grateful to them for putting up with me doing so much stuff for other people.</div><div id="00:55:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And they didn&#039;t get what they supposed to have.</div><div id="00:55:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So age alive has got the best of my the best years of my life.</div><div id="00:55:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And age I have I have with a few other with a few other dedicated people carry the membership through to a very successful end.</div><div id="00:55:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, not a very successful end to a very successful place where we can sit down and we can talk about our stories.</div><div id="00:55:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Age alive have created the platform where Asian people can tell their story,</div><div id="00:55:52.000" class="transcript_line"> knowing that their their contribution to society is being given a worthwhile platform.</div><div id="00:56:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the one thing that the one thing that I think is very important to me,</div><div id="00:56:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and I think it&#039;s very important to me, is that the age of age alive is very important to me.</div><div id="00:56:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the one thing that the one thing that I I I feel I failed in,</div><div id="00:56:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I failed in not being able to have more of the male group within the male within the group.</div><div id="00:56:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I failed. I I feel I have failed because although we started with four male people in the group,</div><div id="00:56:59.000" class="transcript_line"> we it&#039;s gently petered down to just me.</div><div id="00:57:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And what the real cause for that is it is too young to tap that cause to to to to the dismantle</div><div id="00:57:22.000" class="transcript_line"> the philosophy behind the reason why male don&#039;t that too much in depth.</div><div id="00:57:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s a cultural thing for which I which I would not want to interfere.</div><div id="00:57:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It does for another generation.</div><div id="00:57:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But that is my only failure as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:57:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But I am also thankful to the old souls, the family for giving those people who are members of age alive</div><div id="00:57:57.000" class="transcript_line"> the opportunity to have their voices heard.</div><div id="00:58:01.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the the the the biggest triumph of this group for those people to have their voices heard,</div><div id="00:58:13.000" class="transcript_line"> because no one no one of those people in age members Asian men in in in can have can speak out</div><div id="00:58:23.000" class="transcript_line"> unless the family accept that they will do so.</div><div id="00:58:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, so I am very, very young.</div><div id="00:58:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I am very pleased that the work that I have done and the and what I have introduced the group to</div><div id="00:58:42.000" class="transcript_line"> to does not detract detract these people from their cultural beliefs and and practices.</div><div id="00:58:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Speaking of voices and stories, can you tell us about some voices to project?</div><div id="00:59:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Today, I can with with I can with pride say to you that to celebrate our well,</div><div id="00:59:29.000" class="transcript_line"> well, it&#039;s more than 10 years, but to celebrate 10 years of what the skeptics said, it will never work.</div><div id="00:59:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Today, we can we can lift our heads I and said, yes, we have surpassed those remarks.</div><div id="00:59:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And those remarks are labeled that not as reminders, but for the next generation to add to to to take note of</div><div id="01:00:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and to realize that we have overcome those milestones because this project have created the platform for people to set to give this story</div><div id="01:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> in in silent voice. It didn&#039;t it didn&#039;t take me to do it.</div><div id="01:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It take a lot of people, a lot of time, a lot of convincing to to make it happen.</div><div id="01:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But it is it is it is about to be explored in on the scene for everyone to to see and to read and to enjoy.</div><div id="01:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And silent voice will help the younger generation to understand a little bit more about togetherness.</div><div id="01:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And and then you have the full story of the building of Age Alive in It Will Never Work.</div><div id="01:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That is a comprehensive story. Newport and and Newport, how it manages to not surrender,</div><div id="01:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> but to incorporate needs, requests and the right for their voices to be heard in the society that they&#039;re trying to develop.</div><div id="01:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We are also thankful to their help in making this this this project a reality.</div><div id="01:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And we are grateful for every help that is being given by many people who thought this will never happen.</div><div id="01:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We are thankful.</div><div id="01:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Personally, personally, my for me, I have given it I have given I have given it my best.</div><div id="01:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, my greatest regret and when I say regret is not regret in saying that I&#039;ve done something wrong and I need forgiveness.</div><div id="01:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My greatest regret is that I did not have someone to point out to me a if you continue to to be obsessive and to give everything you&#039;ve got to this or to that.</div><div id="01:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Your children are going to be upset in the years to come.</div><div id="01:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I did not have that person because I could see doing something that makes someone else that bring happiness to someone else or to be or give justice to someone else or to or to make someone else&#039;s life.</div><div id="01:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> That less stressful or to help someone to find their way through.</div><div id="01:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It makes me happy.</div><div id="01:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But little did I know that it wasn&#039;t what makes my children happy.</div><div id="01:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in me, I feel that what I know what I do, it was for me and it would be for my children.</div><div id="01:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I I don&#039;t know, but I regretfully think that they could read my mind and to be understanding as I have been.</div><div id="01:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But those are my final words and I hope that as the years go by, someone else will come along and make age alive.</div><div id="01:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I hope that the next year will be the cornerstone that brings more people together so that people recognize the ones who did the work.</div><div id="01:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> People like Brian, Brian Lenbeck, people like Griffiths, people like even David Phillips, people like Vanessa Cyrille.</div><div id="01:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, those people are grassroot people who have done so much for our community.</div><div id="01:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we and hopefully age alive, what age alive have done will help the younger people to make up their mind and to be understanding and to to help their generation to grow.</div><div id="01:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
