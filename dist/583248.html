    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Good morning. The Gulf War is over, but we still live in a world that is sick, riddled</div><div id="00:00:21.560" class="transcript_line"> with fear and in great danger. The Gospel does not take evil lightly. There&#039;s never any suggestion</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> that the world is not such a bad place after all, and that man&#039;s a fine fellow at heart, and if we</div><div id="00:00:39.640" class="transcript_line"> only leave humanity to itself and give it a chance, it&#039;ll muddle through in time. There is no assurance</div><div id="00:00:48.080" class="transcript_line"> that man is really a very decent fellow, and if he does make mistakes, he&#039;s doing his best,</div><div id="00:00:56.360" class="transcript_line"> and anyhow he&#039;s very sincere. Especially at this time, we can have no illusions. We cannot,</div><div id="00:01:05.960" class="transcript_line"> if we are honest, blame all the ills on the shoulders of one man. Lots of people made handsome</div><div id="00:01:14.040" class="transcript_line"> prophets by helping Saddam Hussein on his evil way. The world&#039;s sickness extends to the hungry</div><div id="00:01:22.920" class="transcript_line"> and the homeless and the poor, the abused, and the reliance of nations on war as a weapon of</div><div id="00:01:30.360" class="transcript_line"> justice. But having said that, the Gospel is not a Gospel of do. Yes, the world is in danger,</div><div id="00:01:40.880" class="transcript_line"> and the Gospel says so because it strips off all unreality and fearlessly exposes the truth. The</div><div id="00:01:50.880" class="transcript_line"> Gospel alone can do that because it also has a remedy. When you&#039;re ill, you can face the worst</div><div id="00:02:01.200" class="transcript_line"> diagnosis if you know there is a certain cure, and there is. The world as we see it reflects the</div><div id="00:02:11.560" class="transcript_line"> soul and the thinking of man. The world is the outward expression of mankind&#039;s inner thoughts,</div><div id="00:02:18.480" class="transcript_line"> and those thoughts can undergo the most radical change. The good news that Jesus brought is the</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> proclamation that the reign of God is there for the taking. Now we might have thought that such</div><div id="00:02:36.400" class="transcript_line"> a Gospel would have been grasped by humankind with joyous gratitude, but on the contrary,</div><div id="00:02:42.320" class="transcript_line"> its very goodness has been the ground of its rejection. It&#039;s been condemned without trial</div><div id="00:02:49.680" class="transcript_line"> as too good to be true. We have seen that the impending disaster is a material one,</div><div id="00:02:58.960" class="transcript_line"> the homeless on our streets, the starving millions of Africa, but we know that behind it and the</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> cause of it is a spiritual disaster. By allowing God&#039;s thoughts to begin to determine our thoughts,</div><div id="00:03:15.960" class="transcript_line"> the spiritual regeneration is set in motion. In the mind of God, there is already a new world</div><div id="00:03:24.920" class="transcript_line"> order. Let that mind be new, which was also in Christ Jesus. We think of God as being almighty.</div><div id="00:03:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Can we also think of God as love and to believe that love is almighty, that love can overcome</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> all things? It&#039;s a thought. No, no, it&#039;s more than a thought. It&#039;s a revolution.</div></div></p>
