But when I was working in the canty, the kitchen and tables, they wanted me to go down on the counters.</div><div id="00:05:41.960" class="transcript_line"> So I said, yeah, they didn&#039;t give my friend a job, only me. So I worked on the counters then for about two years,</div><div id="00:05:49.960" class="transcript_line"> enjoyed that because you were meeting different people all the time.

I had loads of friends there in the Littlewoods,</div><div id="00:07:15.960" class="transcript_line"> and then I left there then and I went to the Yvanna.</div><div id="00:07:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, so how old were you when you got to the Yvanna bakeries?</div><div id="00:07:22.960" class="transcript_line"> I must have been 18.</div><div id="00:07:28.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what year that was?</div><div id="00:07:31.960" class="transcript_line"> I was born in 1940, so that&#039;s 58, wouldn&#039;t it?

I said, it was your fault.</div><div id="00:08:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Then we used to have a line, I was on the Mazapan counter at first, that&#039;s where it was then.</div><div id="00:08:31.960" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m sorry, I was on the Dundee case, put the nets on when I first went.</div><div id="00:08:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um.</div><div id="00:08:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember how you got the job?</div><div id="00:08:43.960" class="transcript_line"> I went for an interview.</div><div id="00:08:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, can you tell me something about that?</div><div id="00:08:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I went for the interview and, of course now.</div><div id="00:08:51.960" class="transcript_line"> There was a nurse there as well and a few questions, you know, where did you work before and all this.</div><div id="00:09:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course I&#039;d only had one job before.</div><div id="00:09:04.960" class="transcript_line"> So straight away, as soon as they asked me other questions, I said, right, the job was yours, start Monday.</div><div id="00:09:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember your first day there? Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:09:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe that to me?</div><div id="00:09:15.960" class="transcript_line"> When I arrived there, it was a Monday and I thought, and there was another friend, Marian, started the same day as me.</div><div id="00:09:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, we didn&#039;t know this. We went in on the Monday, they gave us our overalls out here, brings the children out to put them on.</div><div id="00:09:32.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um, they brought us down onto the floor and, when I think about that job, went down on the floor and we were putting the cakes onto the trolleys, onto the racks.</div><div id="00:09:47.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was great, but you had to be quick as you could miss them coming off of the conveyor belt.</div><div id="00:09:54.960" class="transcript_line"> So, OK, I got on with that. So I was on after the weekend, Saturday morning we went in and he wanted us to do the Dundee cakes with my friend.</div><div id="00:10:02.960" class="transcript_line"> So we didn&#039;t know this, we were there putting his nuts on now, 12 o&#039;clock, 1 o&#039;clock and my husband, well, my boyfriend then, was outside waiting for me.</div><div id="00:10:12.960" class="transcript_line"> And it must have been about 4 o&#039;clock and they took the charge on from upstairs, um, Josie Guy.</div><div id="00:10:18.960" class="transcript_line"> What are you doing here? Putting nuts on?</div><div id="00:10:23.960" class="transcript_line"> She said, well, you&#039;re not supposed to be here now, you should have gone at 12 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:10:27.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, why didn&#039;t somebody tell us? I said, we knew, you know, we&#039;ve only been here the week. Oh, she said, stop what you&#039;re doing, go and get your clock out and go.</div><div id="00:10:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you get paid for those then?</div><div id="00:10:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I made sure I clocked out. So I got paid for that.</div><div id="00:10:43.960" class="transcript_line"> Then, as the time was going by and I was getting more used to the job and I was on a machine then, putting the cakes on to slice them.</div><div id="00:10:54.960" class="transcript_line"> But you had to put a big roll of paper on, but it had to be straight because there was a magic eye on the paper.</div><div id="00:11:02.960" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s a magic eye?</div><div id="00:11:04.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a mark on the paper which corresponds with the eye in the machine and that folds them right.</div><div id="00:11:11.960" class="transcript_line"> If you haven&#039;t got it right, waste of time.</div><div id="00:11:16.960" class="transcript_line"> So I always used to do mine and my friends and another one.

I said, we&#039;ll have to sweep up first.</div><div id="00:12:00.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, tell you what I&#039;ve done, I said they&#039;re on the floor.</div><div id="00:12:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, OK. But I got used to it then, I could do it.</div><div id="00:12:07.960" class="transcript_line"> But when you first go on there, it&#039;s difficult, I tell you.</div><div id="00:12:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s no space in between them.</div><div id="00:12:13.960" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re coming down behind each other.</div><div id="00:12:16.960" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, I mastered that.</div><div id="00:12:18.960" class="transcript_line"> So then they wanted me to go on the creamery.</div><div id="00:12:20.960" class="transcript_line"> I thought, this is it now.</div><div id="00:12:22.960" class="transcript_line"> So you put the cream on.</div><div id="00:12:25.960" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, well I&#039;d been watching the girl doing it, so I&#039;m going to do it how she&#039;s done it.</div><div id="00:12:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And I was doing OK, because you&#039;ve got to get it so it doesn&#039;t go off the edge of the thing.</div><div id="00:12:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Of course, you&#039;ve got no space and you&#039;re like this all the time.</div><div id="00:12:37.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s coming down the conveyor belt, so you&#039;ve got to be quick.</div><div id="00:12:40.960" class="transcript_line"> So I mastered that.</div><div id="00:12:43.960" class="transcript_line"> Then I had to go out doing the fruitcake.</div><div id="00:12:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I was doing that.</div><div id="00:12:53.960" class="transcript_line"> And then I would—</div><div id="00:12:56.960" class="transcript_line"> I was a little mad.</div><div id="00:12:58.960" class="transcript_line"> When I think about then, there was Len Jones.</div><div id="00:13:02.960" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d forgotten the other one.</div><div id="00:13:04.960" class="transcript_line"> They were the charge owners downstairs.</div><div id="00:13:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;re not supposed to wear rollers in your hair, right?</div><div id="00:13:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, on a Saturday, I used to come in with rollers in my hair.</div><div id="00:13:12.960" class="transcript_line"> At the tribunal.</div><div id="00:13:14.960" class="transcript_line"> And Josie Guy, the one up in the office, used to come down.</div><div id="00:13:18.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d be like, get them off.</div><div id="00:13:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;d forgotten.

this?</div><div id="00:13:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s about eight o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:14:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:14:01.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re supposed to be here half past seven.</div><div id="00:14:03.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I said, but the bus wasn&#039;t there for me.</div><div id="00:14:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:14:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I had the cake, I had the cake, I had the cake, I had the cake.</div><div id="00:14:11.960" class="transcript_line"> So when they went upstairs then we all had a feast.</div><div id="00:14:14.960" class="transcript_line"> I was, as I told you, the ringleader.</div><div id="00:14:16.960" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d been here about a year then.</div><div id="00:14:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:19.960" class="transcript_line"> So tell me, there&#039;s a few things I wanted to ask you.</div><div id="00:14:23.960" class="transcript_line"> You talked about the uniform.</div><div id="00:14:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Did they supply it?</div><div id="00:14:27.960" class="transcript_line"> They supplied it and they washed them.</div><div id="00:14:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d come in the next day, the next day.</div><div id="00:14:32.960" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d go in the office and you&#039;d see what size you were.</div><div id="00:14:35.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d just take them off.</div><div id="00:14:36.960" class="transcript_line"> The turban she did herself.</div><div id="00:14:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:14:40.960" class="transcript_line"> So you weren&#039;t given a turban?</div><div id="00:14:43.960" class="transcript_line"> We were given one, but we washed it ourselves.</div><div id="00:14:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:14:46.960" class="transcript_line"> And describe the uniform for me.</div><div id="00:14:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Colour and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:14:50.960" class="transcript_line"> It was white.</div><div id="00:14:51.960" class="transcript_line"> It was white.</div><div id="00:14:52.960" class="transcript_line"> White with the buttons down and then you tied the belt round.</div><div id="00:14:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Then the turban was white and you just tied it.</div><div id="00:15:02.960" class="transcript_line"> All your hair had to be under.</div><div id="00:15:04.960" class="transcript_line"> All your hair had to be under and very pretty.</div><div id="00:15:07.960" class="transcript_line"> And the shoes you wear, whatever shoes you want then, you know.</div><div id="00:15:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Because it didn&#039;t bother.</div><div id="00:15:14.960" class="transcript_line"> But no...</div><div id="00:15:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Rings and things.</div><div id="00:15:20.960" class="transcript_line"> No nail polish.</div><div id="00:15:22.960" class="transcript_line"> No nail polish.</div><div id="00:15:24.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was that.</div><div id="00:15:26.960" class="transcript_line"> No nail polish, no rollers.</div><div id="00:15:28.960" class="transcript_line"> Definitely no rollers, but I did do it.</div><div id="00:15:30.960" class="transcript_line"> Because my friend used to do my hair then, lunchtime for me.</div><div id="00:15:34.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d get him in the rollers ready for her to do.</div><div id="00:15:38.960" class="transcript_line"> But I was a devil.</div><div id="00:15:40.960" class="transcript_line"> And this one day, now Len Jones, he said, right, he said,</div><div id="00:15:47.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not doing your job properly.</div><div id="00:15:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Which I was, but he was messing about.</div><div id="00:15:51.960" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re going in the washroom.</div><div id="00:15:54.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay.</div><div id="00:15:56.960" class="transcript_line"> So I go to the washroom now.</div><div id="00:15:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Well in there, there&#039;s all the foreign women working in there, right?</div><div id="00:16:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Well they haven&#039;t got a clue, a lot of English anyway.</div><div id="00:16:06.960" class="transcript_line"> So what it is, they&#039;re washing all the tins in these great big tubs.</div><div id="00:16:11.960" class="transcript_line"> So they show me what to do now, these things.</div><div id="00:16:14.960" class="transcript_line"> So I was leaving the cleaners in and putting the dirty ones out.</div><div id="00:16:17.960" class="transcript_line"> And I can see the boss laughing like hell outside this window.</div><div id="00:16:22.960" class="transcript_line"> So, and they were going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this.</div><div id="00:16:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:16:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And I still do it the other way.</div><div id="00:16:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, come on, Doryn, out.</div><div id="00:16:33.960" class="transcript_line"> And that was my way of getting out.</div><div id="00:16:35.960" class="transcript_line"> So I go back on my own job then.</div><div id="00:16:38.960" class="transcript_line"> So you said there were foreign workers.</div><div id="00:16:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Where did they come from, the women?</div><div id="00:16:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Were they women?</div><div id="00:16:44.960" class="transcript_line"> Men and women.</div><div id="00:16:45.960" class="transcript_line"> In the washroom.</div><div id="00:16:46.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, they were like Pakistani ones and Indians and things like that, you know.</div><div id="00:16:52.960" class="transcript_line"> So they did employ that type of people, but that&#039;s where they were down there.</div><div id="00:16:57.960" class="transcript_line"> And then another time, right, you go in the fruit room.</div><div id="00:17:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, off it goes.</div><div id="00:17:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Now it goes in the fruit room now and there&#039;s a glass window, a little glass window.</div><div id="00:17:13.960" class="transcript_line"> And then there was Chinese in there.</div><div id="00:17:17.960" class="transcript_line"> So show me what to do.</div><div id="00:17:19.960" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got, they&#039;re putting the fruit in the two, what do you call them, hops.</div><div id="00:17:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Like they come through an autoconveyor belt.</div><div id="00:17:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And then they go into a big tub at the back.</div><div id="00:17:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;ve got to take all the stalks off.</div><div id="00:17:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes you get stalks that will come through the machine.</div><div id="00:17:40.960" class="transcript_line"> I leave the stalks on and take the currents out.</div><div id="00:17:46.960" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, this is great.</div><div id="00:17:48.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no, no, they&#039;ve stopped the machine.</div><div id="00:17:50.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:17:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:17:54.960" class="transcript_line"> Started back up.</div><div id="00:17:56.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d let a few go through.</div><div id="00:17:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Then I let the stalks go through them.</div><div id="00:17:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;ve got to go through the barrel again, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:18:03.960" class="transcript_line"> It was wicked.</div><div id="00:18:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Was that just to get out of doing those jokes?</div><div id="00:18:06.960" class="transcript_line"> No, just for the laugh.</div><div id="00:18:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Because I knew they were watching me.</div><div id="00:18:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:18:10.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d come out to there then after about an hour, back onto my job.</div><div id="00:18:14.960" class="transcript_line"> They said, you&#039;re a little soon, so are you.</div><div id="00:18:16.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, why?</div><div id="00:18:17.960" class="transcript_line"> He said, you knew you were doing wrong.</div><div id="00:18:19.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, don&#039;t put me in there then.</div><div id="00:18:25.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d go on with my other job.</div><div id="00:18:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Then on a Saturday then, on a Friday and a Saturday, we&#039;d be by the ovens.</div><div id="00:18:32.960" class="transcript_line"> And as the cakes had come out of the ovens, put them onto the belt.</div><div id="00:18:36.960" class="transcript_line"> No, somebody else was putting them onto the trays.</div><div id="00:18:38.960" class="transcript_line"> We were just checking they were okay.</div><div id="00:18:40.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d have a good sing song.</div><div id="00:18:42.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be singing away, enjoying ourselves.</div><div id="00:18:44.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was actually great.</div><div id="00:18:47.960" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember, was it the music, was it radio?</div><div id="00:18:52.960" class="transcript_line"> It was the radio.</div><div id="00:18:53.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what it was, what the programmes were?</div><div id="00:18:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, it was all music programmes, so I couldn&#039;t tell you really what it was.</div><div id="00:19:00.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what the songs were?</div><div id="00:19:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was Lulu, there was The Beatles.</div><div id="00:19:11.960" class="transcript_line"> No, not The Beatles.</div><div id="00:19:13.960" class="transcript_line"> There was Manfred Mann.</div><div id="00:19:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and I tell you, Frankie Vaughan.</div><div id="00:19:18.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to love Frankie Vaughan.</div><div id="00:19:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And lots of all the fifties it was.</div><div id="00:19:23.960" class="transcript_line"> And did you know all the words?</div><div id="00:19:25.960" class="transcript_line"> I knew all the words then.</div><div id="00:19:27.960" class="transcript_line"> I could sing along and I was brilliant.</div><div id="00:19:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:19:30.960" class="transcript_line"> I can still, if a rebel comes on, I can sing it word to word.</div><div id="00:19:35.960" class="transcript_line"> But when I get in my head, I can&#039;t.</div><div id="00:19:38.960" class="transcript_line"> When I hear it on the, which I got on here, I know word to word.</div><div id="00:19:44.960" class="transcript_line"> But, um.</div><div id="00:19:46.960" class="transcript_line"> So did the music play all day?</div><div id="00:19:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, until we told them to turn it off.</div><div id="00:19:51.960" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d say, right, we&#039;ve had enough now, turn it off.</div><div id="00:19:55.960" class="transcript_line"> But that was after a couple of hours.</div><div id="00:19:57.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;d have our breaks come down and it&#039;d still be on for us, you know.</div><div id="00:20:01.960" class="transcript_line"> And then, um.</div><div id="00:20:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So tell me, um, what, the smell of the factory, could you describe that to me?</div><div id="00:20:10.960" class="transcript_line"> It was, um, it was very cakey, obviously.</div><div id="00:20:13.960" class="transcript_line"> It was, you can smell them being cooked like you would at home.</div><div id="00:20:18.960" class="transcript_line"> You could smell the cakes being cooked and it was absolutely lovely.</div><div id="00:20:22.960" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have to come home and change your clothes.</div><div id="00:20:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Because it wasn&#039;t on your clothes, because you had the overalls.</div><div id="00:20:28.960" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it was great and your hair was covered, so you didn&#039;t have to wash your hair all the time.</div><div id="00:20:33.960" class="transcript_line"> So was the smell nice?</div><div id="00:20:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, it was a lovely smell.</div><div id="00:20:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Not too overpowering?</div><div id="00:20:39.960" class="transcript_line"> No, it made you feel hungry, really.</div><div id="00:20:41.960" class="transcript_line"> As you know, because I was getting up the cakes.</div><div id="00:20:44.960" class="transcript_line"> So tell me, you used to come to work then from Ely and you said about the bus.</div><div id="00:20:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Were the buses, was it public transport or were they laid on by the company?</div><div id="00:20:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Public.</div><div id="00:20:57.960" class="transcript_line"> You used to get off the bus every morning and get off at the bus station and walk over the bridge and under the bridge.</div><div id="00:21:05.960" class="transcript_line"> So there you were then.</div><div id="00:21:07.960" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d do that at seven o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:21:09.960" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes that bridge was, um, flooded.</div><div id="00:21:14.960" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d have to walk up and get off the railway and down the other side.</div><div id="00:21:19.960" class="transcript_line"> And you had to be very quick.</div><div id="00:21:21.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;d be a couple of us, I wouldn&#039;t do it on my own.</div><div id="00:21:24.960" class="transcript_line"> And we used to do that.</div><div id="00:21:26.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um...</div><div id="00:21:28.960" class="transcript_line"> So, you were supposed to be in work at half seven?</div><div id="00:21:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:34.960" class="transcript_line"> And so you clocked in, did you?</div><div id="00:21:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to clock in, so I&#039;d lose the time, obviously, because I was late.</div><div id="00:21:41.960" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes I&#039;d work a bit over, because you were allowed to.</div><div id="00:21:46.960" class="transcript_line"> But then very often they&#039;d ask me to go in at six o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:21:50.960" class="transcript_line"> And I used to be terrified because round there, there was always a lot of rapes in that street around that area.</div><div id="00:21:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d get off the bus now, and of course you&#039;ve got to go under that bridge.</div><div id="00:22:01.960" class="transcript_line"> My eyes are everywhere.</div><div id="00:22:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So I did that a few times.</div><div id="00:22:05.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um...</div><div id="00:22:07.960" class="transcript_line"> I thought, no more, I&#039;m not doing that again.</div><div id="00:22:10.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s okay if you live near, but I was too far.</div><div id="00:22:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Why were you asked to go in at six o&#039;clock?</div><div id="00:22:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Why would that be?</div><div id="00:22:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Because they would have so many orders.</div><div id="00:22:21.960" class="transcript_line"> It was Marks and Spencer&#039;s we were working for.</div><div id="00:22:23.960" class="transcript_line"> It was their cakes.</div><div id="00:22:25.960" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s so many Marks and Spencer&#039;s, as you know.</div><div id="00:22:28.960" class="transcript_line"> So we had to cater for all of them.</div><div id="00:22:31.960" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d have a big order in, and had to get it out.</div><div id="00:22:35.960" class="transcript_line"> So there was lots of... I mean, what were your usual hours?</div><div id="00:22:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Half past seven, so, um...</div><div id="00:22:43.960" class="transcript_line"> I think it was five o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:22:45.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s pretty long anyway, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:22:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was long hours.</div><div id="00:22:48.960" class="transcript_line"> We did have a quarter of an hour for break, morning and afternoon.</div><div id="00:22:52.960" class="transcript_line"> And an hour for lunch.</div><div id="00:22:54.960" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:22:56.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um, but there was a chance for overtime, was there?</div><div id="00:23:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Always. There was always a chance for overtime if you wanted it.</div><div id="00:23:03.960" class="transcript_line"> Which I did, because I was getting married.</div><div id="00:23:05.960" class="transcript_line"> So it helped me, you know.</div><div id="00:23:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Did they pay more for overtime, or was it...?</div><div id="00:23:10.960" class="transcript_line"> You used to get time and a half for the weekend, and only for the week.</div><div id="00:23:16.960" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d do a weekend if I could.</div><div id="00:23:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Not a Sunday, a Saturday now.</div><div id="00:23:22.960" class="transcript_line"> And a Saturday was overtime.</div><div id="00:23:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Anytime.</div><div id="00:23:27.960" class="transcript_line"> But we went in on a Saturday on the first day, not knowing we shouldn&#039;t have been there.</div><div id="00:23:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Like fools.</div><div id="00:23:33.960" class="transcript_line"> So, um, what were the wages like then?</div><div id="00:23:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Tell me what your wages were when you went there first.</div><div id="00:23:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness now.</div><div id="00:23:46.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say about £5 or £5 something.</div><div id="00:23:49.960" class="transcript_line"> About £7 something if you did overtime.</div><div id="00:23:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Was that good?</div><div id="00:23:54.960" class="transcript_line"> It was good then, because you could do a lot with it.</div><div id="00:23:56.960" class="transcript_line"> My mum used to have £2, and I&#039;d have the rest.</div><div id="00:24:00.960" class="transcript_line"> That was a lot of money then?</div><div id="00:24:02.960" class="transcript_line"> That was a lot of money.</div><div id="00:24:04.960" class="transcript_line"> But I used to put it away, see, because of getting married, as I said.</div><div id="00:24:08.960" class="transcript_line"> And, um, yeah, I think about £5, £7 if you worked overtime, sometimes, you know.</div><div id="00:24:16.960" class="transcript_line"> Then when I got married, you went up again, then, see.</div><div id="00:24:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Every year it sort of went up.</div><div id="00:24:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Inflation, you know.</div><div id="00:24:26.960" class="transcript_line"> But, um, yeah, it was good, you know.</div><div id="00:24:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Apart from putting it away, what else did you use to do with your money?</div><div id="00:24:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Um, I never used to drink.</div><div id="00:24:36.960" class="transcript_line"> That was after my boyfriend.</div><div id="00:24:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Um, we&#039;d go out.</div><div id="00:24:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we used to go to the Pavlovah dancing in Crantham, or the Cairnads in Cattays.</div><div id="00:24:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Or then I used to go roller skating in Barry, or roller skating in Cattays.</div><div id="00:24:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Down there.</div><div id="00:24:58.960" class="transcript_line"> And that was what we used to do.</div><div id="00:25:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Go down to the parks, go for walks, you know.</div><div id="00:25:04.960" class="transcript_line"> So where was the Pavlovah in Cattays?</div><div id="00:25:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, um, oh, Radio Craft is a shop.</div><div id="00:25:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:16.960" class="transcript_line"> At Tesco&#039;s.</div><div id="00:25:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, where Tesco&#039;s is.</div><div id="00:25:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Where Tesco&#039;s is.</div><div id="00:25:21.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where it used to be up there, and you had to go upstairs to it.</div><div id="00:25:23.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:25:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Boys went inside, girls the others.</div><div id="00:25:26.960" class="transcript_line"> And sarsaparalla and coke for it to drink, you know.</div><div id="00:25:30.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:25:31.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to love that, and driving away.</div><div id="00:25:34.960" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say, what kind of music, so it was rock and roll?</div><div id="00:25:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Rock and roll, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any of the songs you used to dance to?</div><div id="00:25:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:43.960" class="transcript_line"> Um, Treadin&#039; the Dreamers.</div><div id="00:25:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I&#039;m trying to think of the boy that used to come there, aren&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:25:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, goodness.</div><div id="00:25:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Sheridan.</div><div id="00:25:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Um, he&#039;s still going now, actually.</div><div id="00:26:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God.</div><div id="00:26:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Billy Sheridan.</div><div id="00:26:04.960" class="transcript_line"> I know of something Sheridan.</div><div id="00:26:07.960" class="transcript_line"> His name was, and he used to be the little band in there, like, you know, in the pub.</div><div id="00:26:14.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to dance to.</div><div id="00:26:15.960" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t records, it was live.</div><div id="00:26:19.960" class="transcript_line"> A band, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:21.960" class="transcript_line"> Rock and roll band.</div><div id="00:26:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:23.960" class="transcript_line"> Tommy Sheridan?</div><div id="00:26:24.960" class="transcript_line"> He should have been.</div><div id="00:26:26.960" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s Sheridan, but I can&#039;t think of his first name.</div><div id="00:26:33.960" class="transcript_line"> What about, um, Kennads?</div><div id="00:26:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Where was that in?</div><div id="00:26:36.960" class="transcript_line"> That was in, um, in Catays.</div><div id="00:26:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Where was that in Catays?</div><div id="00:26:41.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think now, because we used to wait under the bridge,</div><div id="00:26:45.960" class="transcript_line"> but come over to Ely Bridge and wait on that bridge there,</div><div id="00:26:48.960" class="transcript_line"> and get the bus to take you to the Kennads.</div><div id="00:26:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think where exactly that was.</div><div id="00:26:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, goodness.</div><div id="00:26:57.960" class="transcript_line"> It was on a corner, it was.</div><div id="00:26:59.960" class="transcript_line"> It was only about three or four stops away from there,</div><div id="00:27:03.960" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d all go there.</div><div id="00:27:05.960" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d be a lot of us.</div><div id="00:27:08.960" class="transcript_line"> And then you said you went roller skating in Badie.</div><div id="00:27:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember where that was?</div><div id="00:27:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:16.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you know where the C-Print is?</div><div id="00:27:18.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got the shops, you&#039;ve got your grass, the road,</div><div id="00:27:21.960" class="transcript_line"> and the shops there.</div><div id="00:27:23.960" class="transcript_line"> On the end, up the stairs, we used to go.</div><div id="00:27:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:27:27.960" class="transcript_line"> And then the other one was in Catays then, and that was down,</div><div id="00:27:32.960" class="transcript_line"> that was only a few stops away.</div><div id="00:27:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Good, I just, I could find it now.</div><div id="00:27:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we used to have some fun.</div><div id="00:27:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Glad you could do them.</div><div id="00:27:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:27:43.960" class="transcript_line"> I was never still, I was always on the go.</div><div id="00:27:45.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, when I think about it now,</div><div id="00:27:47.960" class="transcript_line"> well, today you&#039;ve got time to do it.</div><div id="00:27:50.960" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, it was great.</div><div id="00:27:52.960" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed my youth thoroughly.</div><div id="00:27:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Were you unionised in Ivana Bakeries?</div><div id="00:27:59.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:28:00.960" class="transcript_line"> Nobody a member of the union?</div><div id="00:28:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any disputes there at all?</div><div id="00:28:05.960" class="transcript_line"> No, not what I would say.</div><div id="00:28:07.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:28:09.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:28:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Was it a kind of, were they good employers then?</div><div id="00:28:15.960" class="transcript_line"> They were brilliant, absolutely brilliant.</div><div id="00:28:17.960" class="transcript_line"> They looked after their staff.</div><div id="00:28:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, every year we&#039;d have a dinner and dance.</div><div id="00:28:23.960" class="transcript_line"> And where was the dinner?</div><div id="00:28:24.960" class="transcript_line"> That was in the Angel Hotel.</div><div id="00:28:26.960" class="transcript_line"> In the Angel Hotel.</div><div id="00:28:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Every year, and it was beautiful.</div><div id="00:28:29.960" class="transcript_line"> A meal put on for us.</div><div id="00:28:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Dance after, we&#039;d be there till about 12 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:28:36.960" class="transcript_line"> The coach&#039;d take us home.</div><div id="00:28:40.960" class="transcript_line"> So it was all set up.</div><div id="00:28:42.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to look forward to that every year.</div><div id="00:28:44.960" class="transcript_line"> You heard him, you dress, let&#039;s go.</div><div id="00:28:47.960" class="transcript_line"> What about other social occasions?</div><div id="00:28:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about the, how many women and how many men worked in the Ivana?</div><div id="00:28:58.960" class="transcript_line"> More women than men.</div><div id="00:29:00.960" class="transcript_line"> More women than men.</div><div id="00:29:02.960" class="transcript_line"> But there was a lot of men as well because of the Evans.</div><div id="00:29:05.960" class="transcript_line"> Because women didn&#039;t work on the Evans.</div><div id="00:29:08.960" class="transcript_line"> And upstairs then, they used to do the,</div><div id="00:29:13.960" class="transcript_line"> these were upstairs, oh they set the cakes.</div><div id="00:29:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Like we did the slab cakes, they did the little cakes upstairs.</div><div id="00:29:23.960" class="transcript_line"> They did the packing of them.</div><div id="00:29:25.960" class="transcript_line"> These had come down from somewhere and they packed them.</div><div id="00:29:28.960" class="transcript_line"> And they dared me one day to go down the slope.</div><div id="00:29:34.960" class="transcript_line"> They had to send the stuff straight down and they used to go down along the conveyor belt.</div><div id="00:29:41.960" class="transcript_line"> The conveyor belt to the rollers, to the drivers.</div><div id="00:29:45.960" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d put them in the van.</div><div id="00:29:48.960" class="transcript_line"> So there was this thing that it had to go through.</div><div id="00:29:51.960" class="transcript_line"> If there was anything in it, it would ring.</div><div id="00:29:54.960" class="transcript_line"> So then they dared me to go down there and into the loading bay.</div><div id="00:30:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t dare to ring.</div><div id="00:30:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So I did, I laid down on this thing.</div><div id="00:30:06.960" class="transcript_line"> I went down there.</div><div id="00:30:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d forgotten about the rollers.</div><div id="00:30:10.960" class="transcript_line"> So I went across the road, bump bump bump bump bump bump now.</div><div id="00:30:13.960" class="transcript_line"> And who should be there was Max and Spencer.</div><div id="00:30:17.960" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two of them, there&#039;s only two little men there were.</div><div id="00:30:19.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll always remember that.</div><div id="00:30:21.960" class="transcript_line"> And they looked at me and I looked at them and I thought, that&#039;s it, I&#039;ve got the sack.</div><div id="00:30:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Well they were in stitches.</div><div id="00:30:26.960" class="transcript_line"> They said, well, did you come down there?</div><div id="00:30:29.960" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s easy.</div><div id="00:30:31.960" class="transcript_line"> I just laid back, just come down.</div><div id="00:30:34.960" class="transcript_line"> They said, well, don&#039;t do it again.</div><div id="00:30:36.960" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:30:38.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to really enjoy it.</div><div id="00:30:43.960" class="transcript_line"> I had some good friends there.</div><div id="00:30:45.960" class="transcript_line"> It was great.</div><div id="00:30:47.960" class="transcript_line"> So then I left to get married.</div><div id="00:30:49.960" class="transcript_line"> I was just going to ask you before you go on to that.</div><div id="00:30:52.960" class="transcript_line"> What about the camaraderie who said you had good friends there?</div><div id="00:30:55.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you used to go out with the girls as well?</div><div id="00:30:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes, yes, I got with them.</div><div id="00:31:00.960" class="transcript_line"> And then another friend then needed to do my hair.</div><div id="00:31:02.960" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t need a boyfriend.</div><div id="00:31:04.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to make a foursome and go out.</div><div id="00:31:06.960" class="transcript_line"> And it was great.</div><div id="00:31:08.960" class="transcript_line"> So there was a good feeling?</div><div id="00:31:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:31:11.960" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t mind getting up in the morning and going to work.</div><div id="00:31:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Because you knew it was going to be fun.</div><div id="00:31:16.960" class="transcript_line"> Your friends were there and whatever.</div><div id="00:31:18.960" class="transcript_line"> It was never a dull day.</div><div id="00:31:21.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so because I used to make it a good day.</div><div id="00:31:24.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know a lot of us like.</div><div id="00:31:27.960" class="transcript_line"> So the work was quite separate, was it between the men&#039;s work and the women&#039;s work?</div><div id="00:31:31.960" class="transcript_line"> No, because we had some men working with us.</div><div id="00:31:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, I was on the Mazza plant thing at one time.</div><div id="00:31:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And John Strudgen was there and he was outside and I was his side.</div><div id="00:31:40.960" class="transcript_line"> So I tied his laces up so he couldn&#039;t get up there first.</div><div id="00:31:43.960" class="transcript_line"> There was quite a few rounds of packing.</div><div id="00:31:48.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, on the machines as well as myself.</div><div id="00:31:51.960" class="transcript_line"> But there was more women than the men doing it.</div><div id="00:31:54.960" class="transcript_line"> What was the relationship between the men and the women?</div><div id="00:31:58.960" class="transcript_line"> We all got on great.</div><div id="00:32:00.960" class="transcript_line"> We all got on great.</div><div id="00:32:02.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we used to go off for days, a load of us.</div><div id="00:32:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Meet up in Barry.</div><div id="00:32:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Meet up in other places, you know, Pothco.</div><div id="00:32:12.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d see you there at a certain time.</div><div id="00:32:15.960" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be about 12 of us.</div><div id="00:32:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you go for trips from the factory kind of thing?</div><div id="00:32:23.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:32:25.960" class="transcript_line"> They never had any like that.</div><div id="00:32:28.960" class="transcript_line"> Why do you think the men were the bakers?</div><div id="00:32:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Why did the men do the Evans?</div><div id="00:32:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a man&#039;s job then.</div><div id="00:32:39.960" class="transcript_line"> It was more of a man&#039;s job than a woman&#039;s job.</div><div id="00:32:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Because the stuff that came out there was very, very hot.</div><div id="00:32:45.960" class="transcript_line"> If you worked by then, like I said, we did when it was coming out.</div><div id="00:32:49.960" class="transcript_line"> And it was very, very hot.</div><div id="00:32:51.960" class="transcript_line"> And you worked there in the summer.</div><div id="00:32:53.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:32:54.960" class="transcript_line"> But they did that.</div><div id="00:32:56.960" class="transcript_line"> The women never did that part.</div><div id="00:32:58.960" class="transcript_line"> Did they used to bake at a different time to you as well?</div><div id="00:33:02.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:03.960" class="transcript_line"> They were baking all day.</div><div id="00:33:05.960" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t bake in the middle of the night?</div><div id="00:33:07.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:33:08.960" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:33:10.960" class="transcript_line"> No, it was in the day.</div><div id="00:33:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Because it was always baking when we were there.</div><div id="00:33:15.960" class="transcript_line"> You know.</div><div id="00:33:16.960" class="transcript_line"> But like I said, the men were great.</div><div id="00:33:19.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to get on with them, have a bit of fun, you know.</div><div id="00:33:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Everything was clean fun.</div><div id="00:33:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Those days.</div><div id="00:33:26.960" class="transcript_line"> You could have a bit of fun with them and it was great.</div><div id="00:33:29.960" class="transcript_line"> It was nice going at work in there.</div><div id="00:33:32.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:33.960" class="transcript_line"> What about holidays and things?</div><div id="00:33:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you have paid holidays?</div><div id="00:33:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had a fortnight off.</div><div id="00:33:41.960" class="transcript_line"> And I kept mine for when I got married.</div><div id="00:33:47.960" class="transcript_line"> So you could choose?</div><div id="00:33:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, you choose when you want it.</div><div id="00:33:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:53.960" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:33:58.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to choose our own holidays.</div><div id="00:34:01.960" class="transcript_line"> After April, obviously.</div><div id="00:34:04.960" class="transcript_line"> And go and tell them when you wanted.</div><div id="00:34:07.960" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d book it in and say, yeah, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:34:10.960" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d go off and then come back two weeks later.</div><div id="00:34:14.960" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it was great.</div><div id="00:34:16.960" class="transcript_line"> No problem.</div><div id="00:34:17.960" class="transcript_line"> What about holidays?</div><div id="00:34:19.960" class="transcript_line"> We used to do...</div><div id="00:34:23.960" class="transcript_line"> I think we saw the Monday off.</div><div id="00:34:27.960" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think we did.</div><div id="00:34:30.960" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it was around then.</div><div id="00:34:33.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, we had the bank holidays, but we...</div><div id="00:34:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Of course you got me now, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:34:42.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I should imagine we did.</div><div id="00:34:45.960" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think, now that we did or didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:34:49.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say we must have had them off.</div><div id="00:34:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Because they were good to work for, so I should imagine we did.</div><div id="00:34:57.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Christmas time we didn&#039;t work, obviously.</div><div id="00:35:01.960" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t open.</div><div id="00:35:04.960" class="transcript_line"> What about the facilities and the factories?</div><div id="00:35:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Were they okay? Were there conditions?</div><div id="00:35:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they had a sick room.</div><div id="00:35:13.960" class="transcript_line"> We had a lovely canteen.</div><div id="00:35:16.960" class="transcript_line"> You can buy food there if you wanted to or bring your own, it was up to you.</div><div id="00:35:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d go there every Friday to collect your wages.</div><div id="00:35:23.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d be there every Friday to collect your wages.</div><div id="00:35:26.960" class="transcript_line"> A couple of goes at a time.</div><div id="00:35:29.960" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it was lovely, you know.</div><div id="00:35:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was huge, absolutely huge.</div><div id="00:35:37.960" class="transcript_line"> I had my 21st birthday there.</div><div id="00:35:40.960" class="transcript_line"> And my birthday was in April.</div><div id="00:35:44.960" class="transcript_line"> I was getting married in October, so my mum couldn&#039;t afford to do two parties.</div><div id="00:35:49.960" class="transcript_line"> So I said, well, I&#039;ll get married then instead, you know.</div><div id="00:35:52.960" class="transcript_line"> So, unknowing to me, I went in on my birthday.</div><div id="00:35:57.960" class="transcript_line"> I was called up to the staff room.</div><div id="00:36:03.960" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh, what&#039;s happening?</div><div id="00:36:05.960" class="transcript_line"> When I got up there, there was a great big two-tier cake.</div><div id="00:36:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Two brothers had made for me, because they knew I wasn&#039;t having anything.</div><div id="00:36:13.960" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of presents up there for me.</div><div id="00:36:16.960" class="transcript_line"> And I thought I&#039;d have to get a taxi home that day in balloons.</div><div id="00:36:20.960" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, that was a really surprise.</div><div id="00:36:22.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s how good they were, you know.</div><div id="00:36:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Now when I left, I had a lot of stuff off them.</div><div id="00:36:27.960" class="transcript_line"> And when I left, they collected, you know.</div><div id="00:36:30.960" class="transcript_line"> So it was really good.</div><div id="00:36:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Apart from that, what were the perks at working there?</div><div id="00:36:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Could you buy cheap cakes?</div><div id="00:36:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:36:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Downstairs, you can buy them down there.</div><div id="00:36:44.960" class="transcript_line"> And, oh, half price probably.</div><div id="00:36:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Half the price, maybe less again.</div><div id="00:36:51.960" class="transcript_line"> They had plenty then.</div><div id="00:36:53.960" class="transcript_line"> They used to bring the stuff down from Ryska.</div><div id="00:36:55.960" class="transcript_line"> I think they had it up in Ryska.</div><div id="00:36:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So you can buy smaller cakes as well, like, you know, puddings and stuff.</div><div id="00:37:02.960" class="transcript_line"> So we can do that.</div><div id="00:37:05.960" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, we had the perks that way.</div><div id="00:37:08.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was good.</div><div id="00:37:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Besides what we had in between.</div><div id="00:37:13.960" class="transcript_line"> So how long were you there altogether?</div><div id="00:37:17.960" class="transcript_line"> 18, 19, 20, 21.</div><div id="00:37:20.960" class="transcript_line"> That was three years.</div><div id="00:37:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Then I left and I got married.</div><div id="00:37:25.960" class="transcript_line"> I think I didn&#039;t go back straight there.</div><div id="00:37:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Where did I go?</div><div id="00:37:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, goodness.</div><div id="00:37:39.960" class="transcript_line"> So you left to get married, did you?</div><div id="00:37:43.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, in 1961.</div><div id="00:37:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:37:47.960" class="transcript_line"> October 1961.</div><div id="00:37:49.960" class="transcript_line"> So why did you leave when you got married then?</div><div id="00:37:53.960" class="transcript_line"> Is that what people did?</div><div id="00:37:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;re giving you notice in?</div><div id="00:37:59.960" class="transcript_line"> No, what I mean was you could have worked.</div><div id="00:38:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I could have carried on.</div><div id="00:38:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I could have carried on.</div><div id="00:38:06.960" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t want me to work after we were married.</div><div id="00:38:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Right, I see.</div><div id="00:38:11.960" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, well, hang on, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:38:13.960" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t want me to work after we were married.</div><div id="00:38:15.960" class="transcript_line"> He said, I&#039;ll keep it.</div><div id="00:38:17.960" class="transcript_line"> He was getting about £14 a week then.</div><div id="00:38:19.960" class="transcript_line"> And then we had our own house in Arl.</div><div id="00:38:23.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was in Lambrammy.</div><div id="00:38:25.960" class="transcript_line"> It was a lovely house there.</div><div id="00:38:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Were you sorry to leave though?</div><div id="00:38:29.960" class="transcript_line"> I was.</div><div id="00:38:31.960" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think what I did.</div><div id="00:38:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I know what I did.</div><div id="00:38:35.960" class="transcript_line"> My sister said, come and work with me in Lionites,</div><div id="00:38:39.960" class="transcript_line"> in Sanatorium Road down Canton.</div><div id="00:38:43.960" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where they make music boxes.</div><div id="00:38:45.960" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:38:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, God, I went down there.</div><div id="00:38:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what a place.</div><div id="00:38:51.960" class="transcript_line"> It was horrible.</div><div id="00:38:53.960" class="transcript_line"> And all I could smell was the glue.</div><div id="00:38:55.960" class="transcript_line"> And I was there for about two months, if that.</div><div id="00:38:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Maybe a little bit more.</div><div id="00:39:01.960" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, I can&#039;t stand this.</div><div id="00:39:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So I went out and I went down to Yvonne and asked her if I could have.</div><div id="00:39:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, perfect.</div><div id="00:39:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Said yes, come back.</div><div id="00:39:11.960" class="transcript_line"> And I had my job back and I stayed there then</div><div id="00:39:13.960" class="transcript_line"> until another two years.</div><div id="00:39:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Maybe.</div><div id="00:39:21.960" class="transcript_line"> I think no.</div><div id="00:39:23.960" class="transcript_line"> So what did you say to your husband then?</div><div id="00:39:25.960" class="transcript_line"> You said, oh, I&#039;ve got, I mean, I&#039;m just asking</div><div id="00:39:27.960" class="transcript_line"> because you left because he wanted you to leave.</div><div id="00:39:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:31.960" class="transcript_line"> But you went back to work, so.</div><div id="00:39:33.960" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t mind then.</div><div id="00:39:35.960" class="transcript_line"> He realised what he said was wrong because I was home on my own.</div><div id="00:39:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:39:39.960" class="transcript_line"> To no any children then.</div><div id="00:39:41.960" class="transcript_line"> And I went back to Yvonne then for about a year, year and a half,</div><div id="00:39:45.960" class="transcript_line"> something like that.</div><div id="00:39:47.960" class="transcript_line"> I left there.</div><div id="00:39:49.960" class="transcript_line"> Then I went to.</div><div id="00:39:51.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you leave then because you were expecting?</div><div id="00:39:55.960" class="transcript_line"> No, that was at the cigar factory.</div><div id="00:39:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, OK.</div><div id="00:39:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Can I just ask you, before we leave the</div><div id="00:40:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Yvonne altogether,</div><div id="00:40:03.960" class="transcript_line"> what was the age of the women working there?</div><div id="00:40:05.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, were they, were you all young?</div><div id="00:40:07.960" class="transcript_line"> All ages.</div><div id="00:40:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Were they married?</div><div id="00:40:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Did they have children?</div><div id="00:40:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were married with children.</div><div id="00:40:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Some were young like myself.</div><div id="00:40:17.960" class="transcript_line"> A lot of us, that&#039;s where we used to sit together.</div><div id="00:40:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, there was a lot.</div><div id="00:40:21.960" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them.</div><div id="00:40:23.960" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them.</div><div id="00:40:25.960" class="transcript_line"> We got on with the married women,</div><div id="00:40:27.960" class="transcript_line"> the married men,</div><div id="00:40:29.960" class="transcript_line"> the single men.</div><div id="00:40:31.960" class="transcript_line"> We all sort of clicked together.</div><div id="00:40:33.960" class="transcript_line"> It was really, it was like a family, really.</div><div id="00:40:35.960" class="transcript_line"> When you think, you know, when I think back on it.</div><div id="00:40:37.960" class="transcript_line"> And then we all</div><div id="00:40:39.960" class="transcript_line"> hit it off.</div><div id="00:40:41.960" class="transcript_line"> There was never no animosity there.</div><div id="00:40:45.960" class="transcript_line"> So why did you leave for the second time then?</div><div id="00:40:47.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think</div><div id="00:40:49.960" class="transcript_line"> why I left there.</div><div id="00:40:53.960" class="transcript_line"> Of course I&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:40:55.960" class="transcript_line"> a shot on the brain now, haven&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:40:59.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to stop.</div><div id="00:41:01.960" class="transcript_line"> So,</div><div id="00:41:03.960" class="transcript_line"> why did you leave</div><div id="00:41:05.960" class="transcript_line"> the Yvonne?</div><div id="00:41:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Because my sister said she can</div><div id="00:41:09.960" class="transcript_line"> get a job for me in the Goaman</div><div id="00:41:11.960" class="transcript_line"> cinema with more money.</div><div id="00:41:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Because I was</div><div id="00:41:15.960" class="transcript_line"> getting married.</div><div id="00:41:17.960" class="transcript_line"> I was married.</div><div id="00:41:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so I</div><div id="00:41:21.960" class="transcript_line"> thought she got the job for me.</div><div id="00:41:23.960" class="transcript_line"> I packed in my job, went down there</div><div id="00:41:25.960" class="transcript_line"> and they said, no there&#039;s no job here, we haven&#039;t got any</div><div id="00:41:27.960" class="transcript_line"> jobs and we can&#039;t have two sisters</div><div id="00:41:29.960" class="transcript_line"> working together.</div><div id="00:41:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, why was that?</div><div id="00:41:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a bit of an excuse</div><div id="00:41:35.960" class="transcript_line"> there. It was. There was jobs there</div><div id="00:41:37.960" class="transcript_line"> but they wouldn&#039;t give it, they said, because</div><div id="00:41:39.960" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t allow two sisters working together.</div><div id="00:41:41.960" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, oh right, so I&#039;m out of</div><div id="00:41:43.960" class="transcript_line"> a job. Sorry and all that.</div><div id="00:41:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Then I got a job in</div><div id="00:41:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Vaughan&#039;s Laundry.</div><div id="00:41:49.960" class="transcript_line"> I was in there for a couple of months.</div><div id="00:41:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I went from there to another laundry</div><div id="00:41:53.960" class="transcript_line"> round the corner but can&#039;t remember</div><div id="00:41:55.960" class="transcript_line"> the name of it. I wasn&#039;t there</div><div id="00:41:57.960" class="transcript_line"> long. I left there</div><div id="00:41:59.960" class="transcript_line"> and I went to the cigar</div><div id="00:42:01.960" class="transcript_line"> factory.</div><div id="00:42:03.960" class="transcript_line"> So can you tell me,</div><div id="00:42:05.960" class="transcript_line"> did you have to have an interview for the...</div><div id="00:42:07.960" class="transcript_line"> I had to have an interview to get into the cigar</div><div id="00:42:09.960" class="transcript_line"> factory.</div><div id="00:42:11.960" class="transcript_line"> I think I worked there</div><div id="00:42:13.960" class="transcript_line"> about</div><div id="00:42:15.960" class="transcript_line"> a year, year and a half</div><div id="00:42:17.960" class="transcript_line"> and then I became pregnant.</div><div id="00:42:19.960" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so should we</div><div id="00:42:21.960" class="transcript_line"> go back to just when you</div><div id="00:42:23.960" class="transcript_line"> first went there?
