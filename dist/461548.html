    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In your opinion, what effect has the televising of rugby had?</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s allowed the whole nation basically to see and witness what goes on.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Lots of people in their lifetime will not have seen a live game of rugby,</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it&#039;s locally or at a major club level, and certainly not at an international level.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve gone to games and I&#039;ve spoken to people who know it&#039;s their first time being there</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and the excitement of being able to get a ticket.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly the television has put pressure on ticket sales, along with the cost of tickets nowadays of course.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So television has brought to the public that opportunity of enjoying that spectacle, that arena.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like putting the gladiators in, in a sense. There&#039;s the ball.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a moment really that certainly over the years, if you don&#039;t have Sky in England for a while,</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> sold the rights of all the games to Sky so that everybody could see the England game.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I know there was a lot of disgust at that, whereas they&#039;ve taken it off the actual, the normal channels of BBC.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think for a year or two I think, I&#039;m not sure, if ITV had some of the rights and their coverage was quite poor by comparison.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe there was a line still, maybe they&#039;re going to offer the tangent.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But certainly television has brought to everybody&#039;s home the opportunity of sharing in that encounter,</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> in that hopefully triumph, and sharing then that moment of pride, enjoyment.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it certainly does. It&#039;s a moment where you feel, well, that was good.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you think televising rugby has had an effect on the community?</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it does. It does. I believe that in the locality there&#039;s a number of clubs that have started in the late 70s and 80s</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because of what was happening at the national level.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And that goes with a lot of communities in South Wales.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of clubs have sprung up in the last 30, 40 years because of what was happening in the 70s with Welsh rugby at the national level.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s had a major, major impact in that respect.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s also kickstarted a lot of mini rugby movements within rugby clubs that didn&#039;t exist before.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> People basically played rugby at secondary school level.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the first time they would encounter it and then throw youth and whatever else.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But nowadays it&#039;s certainly prevalent in most of the junior schools, rugbyers in some shape or form.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And at most clubs have major numbers attending on Sunday mornings to play mini rugby.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s because of the impact of television that&#039;s had on it.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Why can&#039;t we make that available to younger people?</div></div></p>
