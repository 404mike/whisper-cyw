    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather&#039;s factory was absolutely ruined amongst well other people.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They were evacuated because of the commotion and fear.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean they were very frightened.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Winston Churchill, as you probably recall, he sent in the troops and the riot act was read there.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> They destroyed the factory.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother was pregnant at the time.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> This was in July and the baby was due in August.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And Alfred de Rothschild offered them his home for some of the Jewish people who literally lost everything.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandparents went there to Somers State just outside London.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The baby was born, my aunt, and she called him Alfreda after Alfred de Rothschild, which is a very interesting thing.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the government made a full inquiry into the Tredegar riots.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> They came out on the side of the Jewish people that they had been so badly treated.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean the troops were sent here by Winston Churchill, riot act read outside Tredegar County Hall.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were all given compensation.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, being a nosy one, when I was a bit younger, I went to the county archives in Cwmbran to have a look at it all.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a letter from my grandmother in her own hand written acknowledging the payment of compensation in 1913 of Â£800, which is an enormous amount of money.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the other Jewish people who had all their businesses literally destroyed were penniless, had substantial compensation.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So out of that evil came a little bit of good.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The government came out against the perpetrators.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them were arrested.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They were given various sentences or various hard letters.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite amazing.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was one fly in the ointment.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a gentleman there who was the chief constable by the name of Bozenke.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wrote a damning letter to Winston Churchill, which I&#039;ve actually seen in the archives, which stated that these Jews come from Russia to Tredegar with absolutely nothing.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Within a year or so, they become property owners and all terrifically anti-Semitic.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite astonishing how bitter they were, envious, but they don&#039;t realize how hard these people were.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They came with nothing, yes.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You only have to go to the cemetery in Merthyr Tydfil above Kevon, which is still there,</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and you look at the gravestones dated 1870s, 1880s, from all over Europe, how these people came and how they started and how they got on their feet.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a quite incredible story.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was only because they worked hard.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they didn&#039;t inherit anything.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It all came from just sheer hard work.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And yet it bounded back in them because there was a story going round that they were forcing the people to go and work in the shops that they owned.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the times, there was the Irish strike, there was a lot of strikes going on with the miners and God knows what,</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and unfortunately the Jewish people became a scapegoat of it all.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, it&#039;s that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I was even thought of.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but you have a sort of family memory.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, my grandmother never forgot it and my grandparents used to talk about it.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in fact, they lived to death.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You can imagine a mob like they were, and they were rough.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they weren&#039;t Welsh.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them were Irish.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> You see, the Tredegar Iron and Coal Works at that time was the largest in Europe, employed about 6,000, 7,000 people.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The population of Tredegar, which was a little town, one of the busiest Welsh towns in South Wales,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and it attracted people from Russia who had family over here and they got jobs.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them were miners, a lot of them were steelworkers, but they all prospered.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite phenomenal.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandfather was one of 14 children and they all grew up in Tredegar, most of them.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, they all diversified.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of them went to university, they became professionals.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The history of the family is quite astonishing, how they got themselves up and how they put themselves forward.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It really is.</div></div></p>
