    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Steve&#039;s Stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swicker Carnival who</div><div id="00:00:08.480" class="transcript_line"> have organised Cardiff Carnival ever since. Steve&#039;s Story Number 4. Cardiff Carnival</div><div id="00:00:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Under Attack. Cardiff Carnival&#039;s philosophy has always been one of interculturalism and</div><div id="00:00:22.120" class="transcript_line"> inclusion. However, this vision was violently opposed by some in the early days of the carnival&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:28.920" class="transcript_line"> history. The first incident of racist attack took place in 1991 and involved Swicker Carnival&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:36.440" class="transcript_line"> minibus being vandalised while parked overnight in Riverside. Acid was used to etch Nazi swastikas</div><div id="00:00:43.280" class="transcript_line"> and the logo of the far-right racist group Combat 18 on every panel of our poor minibus.</div><div id="00:00:49.480" class="transcript_line"> The most shocking incident was the knife attack by a bare-chested skinhead on Cardiff Carnival&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> wrapper in residence whilst he was performing on the bandstand in the haze as part of the</div><div id="00:01:02.640" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival finale in 1995. Our wrapper was badly shaken and his shirt slashed wide open,</div><div id="00:01:10.280" class="transcript_line"> but he recovered quickly and even managed to continue his set. I helped the special constable</div><div id="00:01:17.240" class="transcript_line"> supporting the carnival to identify the attacker and he was quickly arrested and so I returned to</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> the bandstand to ensure the finale continued smoothly. However, the sweaty skinhead was as</div><div id="00:01:29.560" class="transcript_line"> slippery as an eel and managed to break free from the arresting police officers and take off at full</div><div id="00:01:35.800" class="transcript_line"> pelt down the haze before skidding behind Jury&#039;s Hotel. Sadly, just as the attacker was about to</div><div id="00:01:44.680" class="transcript_line"> be re-arrested, the lead constable, who was not a swimmer, fell into the canal and had to be saved</div><div id="00:01:51.840" class="transcript_line"> from drowning by his colleague. So unfortunately, justice was not served in this instance.</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> In the early days, the police themselves were ambivalent about Cardiff Carnival. I distinctly</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> remember in 1994 a friendly police officer explaining how the penny had finally dropped</div><div id="00:02:10.840" class="transcript_line"> for him when he fully realised that Cardiff Carnival Parade was a massive and joyous celebration on the</div><div id="00:02:16.800" class="transcript_line"> road and ought not be policed as some sort of riotous, politically contentious demonstration</div><div id="00:02:23.160" class="transcript_line"> or protest. It is to Cardiff Carnival&#039;s credit that all those involved withstood any early setbacks</div><div id="00:02:32.200" class="transcript_line"> and misunderstandings, thereby allowing it to grow year by year and become a widely accepted and</div><div id="00:02:39.120" class="transcript_line"> much loved family event. In short, to become the biggest and brightest collective celebration of Cardiff by Cardiff.</div></div></p>
