Well, the first thing to establish is that I founded the company with a dear friend and</div><div id="00:01:14.240" class="transcript_line"> colleague who is still a dear friend and colleague, Stuart Cox, who has been living in Mexico for 13</div><div id="00:01:20.480" class="transcript_line"> years. I&#039;m very profoundly pleased to say that we&#039;re working on a project together in Cuba at</div><div id="00:01:28.400" class="transcript_line"> the moment. That we had worked together, we&#039;d met and worked together in the 70s in Triple Action</div><div id="00:01:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Theatre and then we&#039;d worked together under the first company I formed called Theatre Saga here.</div><div id="00:01:45.040" class="transcript_line"> And we had wanted to look initially at simply developing a one-man show that we would jointly</div><div id="00:01:56.160" class="transcript_line"> script and that I would perform and Stuart would direct. And so initially it was planned to be in</div><div id="00:02:06.560" class="transcript_line"> fact a double project in Sri Lanka that we would mount a project about the Welsh shaman and non-conformist</div><div id="00:02:15.520" class="transcript_line"> William Price and that we would do a children&#039;s show to go with that. And we wanted to explore</div><div id="00:02:23.840" class="transcript_line"> the very fertile and rich Sri Lankan mask tradition. Neither of us had worked very extensively</div><div id="00:02:29.840" class="transcript_line"> with masks, so there was a technical aspect to this project. We got quite some work done,</div><div id="00:02:35.120" class="transcript_line"> we got quite some way towards a residency in the University of Colombo, British Council was supportive</div><div id="00:02:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and then the civil war broke out ferociously once again and the Foreign Office was saying we can&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:50.800" class="transcript_line"> offer you any kind of protection. So the project price went on the back burner and</div><div id="00:02:59.280" class="transcript_line"> we thought we developed for children and we came across a collection, a retelling of a collection of</div><div id="00:03:04.880" class="transcript_line"> very ancient Indian fables about a character called Dr. Bidpai. The stories were from a collection</div><div id="00:03:11.440" class="transcript_line"> called the Panchatantra which means the five treatises and go back to Buddhist times before</div><div id="00:03:17.520" class="transcript_line"> before Christ. And a good claim can be made for them that these stories have traveled in one form</div><div id="00:03:23.760" class="transcript_line"> or another because they&#039;re parables like Aesop involved in the story of the five</div><div id="00:03:27.840" class="transcript_line"> parables like Aesop involving talking animals and so on around the world. So we developed this as a</div><div id="00:03:34.080" class="transcript_line"> children&#039;s show and then decided that we added additional material and it became a family show</div><div id="00:03:42.880" class="transcript_line"> and then by reorientating material something for adults and toured widely, played in all manner of</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> places, lots of schools, lots of art centers and village halls, all kinds of venues.</div><div id="00:03:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Then we had the good fortune to have contact with the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, the Institute of Indian</div><div id="00:04:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Culture in West London where most unusually in India classical musicians do not play as accompanists</div><div id="00:04:20.960" class="transcript_line"> for theatre or dance shows. It simply isn&#039;t done, it&#039;s not part of the protocol.</div><div id="00:04:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Other musicians do that work and very fine they are but on this occasion due to our contacts and</div><div id="00:04:31.440" class="transcript_line"> due to the the chemistry being right, a sitar teacher and the tablet teacher both extremely</div><div id="00:04:38.480" class="transcript_line"> fine players in their own right agreed to part compose part improvise a score for the performance</div><div id="00:04:47.920" class="transcript_line"> and so in a way the apogee of performance was to tour with this and where possible</div><div id="00:04:58.240" class="transcript_line"> a double bill with a short concert an interval and then</div><div id="00:05:02.160" class="transcript_line"> a word in the stargazer&#039;s eye was the title that we made.</div><div id="00:05:08.880" class="transcript_line"> So that had a life in its various forms of something like five years and then after that we</div><div id="00:05:17.680" class="transcript_line"> had a very good positive response. Clearly I&#039;m not ready to do another one man show so</div><div id="00:05:24.640" class="transcript_line"> we started to think about the possibilities of working given our passion for the Indian performing</div><div id="00:05:30.480" class="transcript_line"> arts with the variety of Asian communities on our doorstep in Cardiff and the most advanced</div><div id="00:05:42.880" class="transcript_line"> community manifestation of that was Samarja Cultural Centre, a cultural and religious centre</div><div id="00:05:49.600" class="transcript_line"> in Grangetown and we spent a year really supporting ourselves by other means</div><div id="00:06:00.880" class="transcript_line"> having at some point decided that we would give to promote a word in the stargazer&#039;s eye,</div><div id="00:06:07.440" class="transcript_line"> we would promote ourselves and give ourselves a company name and we talked about various options</div><div id="00:06:14.160" class="transcript_line"> and I had always been attracted by the shamanic nature of this legendary stroke actual bard with</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> poems from the sixth century but legends about whom existing from the middle ages certainly</div><div id="00:06:33.360" class="transcript_line"> perhaps they were much older that that turn constantly on the idea of transformation that&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:39.360" class="transcript_line"> what I mean when I say shamanic that that humans turn into animals and vice versa</div><div id="00:06:45.760" class="transcript_line"> and transforming is what performers do to varying degrees all the time in whatever mode they&#039;re</div><div id="00:06:51.840" class="transcript_line"> operating so this established first of all the kind of Welsh focus of the company and</div><div id="00:06:57.760" class="transcript_line"> and</div><div id="00:07:00.660" class="transcript_line"> as I say led us to spend a year negotiating with the Gujarati community and largely from</div><div id="00:07:08.880" class="transcript_line"> Kutch in western Gujarat about making a production with members of the community</div><div id="00:07:18.320" class="transcript_line"> in the Samarja so that took place in the company started in summer 84</div><div id="00:07:24.320" class="transcript_line"> and in 1986 we using the Irish and Welsh material at the root of the European Tristan and Ezell myth</div><div id="00:07:37.200" class="transcript_line"> Tristan and Ezold as it&#039;s most widely known through Wagner we use this material as a as a classic</div><div id="00:07:45.440" class="transcript_line"> eternal triangle between an old king and his young bride and a young lover and other adventures</div><div id="00:07:53.040" class="transcript_line"> with dragons and so on so together with a professional core and</div><div id="00:08:00.480" class="transcript_line"> a multilingual production that we rough scripted what there was in English and</div><div id="00:08:08.960" class="transcript_line"> staged together with something like</div><div id="00:08:13.360" class="transcript_line"> 30 to 40 community participants of all ages and this production created quite a stir I think it</div><div id="00:08:21.280" class="transcript_line"> was the fair to say it&#039;s the first of this kind in Wales and we made a BBC radio documentary about</div><div id="00:08:27.840" class="transcript_line"> it there was a sort of a significant swell of interest in the ideas behind the premises</div><div id="00:08:36.240" class="transcript_line"> behind the project that we were using Welsh or pan-Celtic narrative material</div><div id="00:08:43.440" class="transcript_line"> of a sufficiently universal character to as a magnet to bring people around with a story that</div><div id="00:08:47.840" class="transcript_line"> they could relate to</div><div id="00:08:55.920" class="transcript_line"> and obviously that was the first of a trilogy of Indo-Celtic community plays it was after that</div><div id="00:09:03.360" class="transcript_line"> first play that you came and I think you actually visited me in London where I was working at the</div><div id="00:09:09.200" class="transcript_line"> time you explained about the success of Tristan and Ezold the first Indo-Celtic community play</div><div id="00:09:18.400" class="transcript_line"> certainly your passion for interculturalism and celebration and the intergenerational nature of</div><div id="00:09:26.480" class="transcript_line"> the vision that you laid before me when I was working in London was so strong that I thought</div><div id="00:09:32.160" class="transcript_line"> I better join you in this and I relocated to Cardiff in 1987 and well over to you what happened next</div><div id="00:09:42.560" class="transcript_line"> well we were of course very gratified by the warmth of the response to the project and</div><div id="00:09:51.680" class="transcript_line"> clearly the ideas that were almost assumed not in terms of simply of being citizens of the world but</div><div id="00:09:59.360" class="transcript_line"> of bringing together artistic techniques Welsh clogging and Gujarati folk dance and</div><div id="00:10:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Indian music and Indian music and scales from older Celtic music and Indian scales</div><div id="00:10:19.360" class="transcript_line"> the aesthetic issues were because they were practical ones how shall we do this where shall</div><div id="00:10:23.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody stand what how shall we make this particular kind of music together</div><div id="00:10:29.760" class="transcript_line"> were the primary practical questions and problems and challenges that working artists had to face</div><div id="00:10:36.560" class="transcript_line"> but with the kind of looking at the documentary or sorry the</div><div id="00:10:43.120" class="transcript_line"> the film footage and trying to think through some of the resonances that the production</div><div id="00:10:49.440" class="transcript_line"> gave rise to we I have to put it that way around that the the practical aesthetic challenges</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> were first because those we we couldn&#039;t shell but you had to deal with on a day-to-day basis that was</div><div id="00:11:01.040" class="transcript_line"> the nature of the work so then the wider resonances of what the work might represent</div><div id="00:11:06.800" class="transcript_line"> came after on reflection and thought well we&#039;ve done this people seem to think it&#039;s a good thing</div><div id="00:11:14.080" class="transcript_line"> to do and they enjoyed the show and took its collaborative celebratory spirit to heart</div><div id="00:11:25.440" class="transcript_line"> we should go on and do another how do we extend expand develop mutate the idea without simply</div><div id="00:11:36.160" class="transcript_line"> repeating ourselves and not boxing ourselves into some kind of creative ghetto so as you say Steve</div><div id="00:11:47.520" class="transcript_line"> as you say Steve with your</div><div id="00:11:53.040" class="transcript_line"> workaholic presence helping to put the company on a on a on a more sensible</div><div id="00:12:01.520" class="transcript_line"> organizational and administrative and financial backing</div><div id="00:12:07.520" class="transcript_line"> we began to think about how we should extend it as I said and and the issue then of of</div><div id="00:12:13.440" class="transcript_line"> of perhaps bringing a company from India to work with a core of</div><div id="00:12:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Wales-based performers of whatever ethnicity and the community which wasn&#039;t closed it wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:12:26.880" class="transcript_line"> or rather it wasn&#039;t open only to Gujarati but but the center itself was very open anybody could come</div><div id="00:12:34.240" class="transcript_line"> that was a basic condition that we set down for the collaboration and I don&#039;t think there was</div><div id="00:12:39.200" class="transcript_line"> any real difficulty with that there was certainly a long process of quite understandably because</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> this was a first and because I believe I&#039;m right in saying that the city council had turned down</div><div id="00:12:49.360" class="transcript_line"> an application to financially support the building of the center so it was funded simply from</div><div id="00:12:55.520" class="transcript_line"> collections from the local community and so what became a center then to some degrees became a</div><div id="00:13:02.800" class="transcript_line"> fortress not only because of elements of gross racism and graffiti and so on but simply because</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> of the tendency for a community to turn in upon itself if there is not an active warm welcome</div><div id="00:13:20.800" class="transcript_line"> from the host community or so we broached the issue with the community elders and they thought it was</div><div id="00:13:29.760" class="transcript_line"> a good idea and so Stuart spent a time in the spring of 88 I think I&#039;m right in saying or 87</div><div id="00:13:42.560" class="transcript_line"> and I in the autumn of 87 looking at traditional folk theaters in both north and southern</div><div id="00:13:49.360" class="transcript_line"> India I think it is um</div><div id="00:13:53.200" class="transcript_line"> it was very valuable for us to be able to draw some comparative picture of the state of</div><div id="00:13:59.520" class="transcript_line"> folk theater in India predominantly rural folk theater um in retrospect it seemed terrifyingly</div><div id="00:14:07.760" class="transcript_line"> obvious that we should have brought a Gujarati company so that the community would have been</div><div id="00:14:15.280" class="transcript_line"> able to speak to the performers and whilst that&#039;s what we did it&#039;s one of those things</div><div id="00:14:20.480" class="transcript_line"> that research throws up you don&#039;t the obvious isn&#039;t clear until you&#039;ve been around the houses</div><div id="00:14:26.560" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t know what your own front door looks like until you&#039;ve been into the next street so</div><div id="00:14:32.880" class="transcript_line"> following that research um arrangements were made for uh the predominant form in in Gujarat</div><div id="00:14:40.240" class="transcript_line"> called Bhavai which a company had never been outside India before to bring a something like</div><div id="00:14:51.600" class="transcript_line"> 15 16 17 people a synthesis of two troops together with um their supporters and from</div><div id="00:14:59.360" class="transcript_line"> the administrative office from the National Theatre of India in Bombay to to bring a troop</div><div id="00:15:07.840" class="transcript_line"> to Wales to make a new production uh to tour shows of their own and and to create</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> as as big a splash as we could uh as an example of a living vibrant</div><div id="00:15:26.560" class="transcript_line"> non-classical traditional art form that at its grassroots level was still hugely popular</div><div id="00:15:33.520" class="transcript_line"> which meant that um companies Bhavai companies toured in rural Gujarat they would arrive at a</div><div id="00:15:42.400" class="transcript_line"> village uh perhaps at the weekend and would play a series of very brief extracts trailers</div><div id="00:15:50.640" class="transcript_line"> from their repertoire which was huge of both ballad operas and sung plays spoken plays and the</div><div id="00:15:59.520" class="transcript_line"> the villagers would choose which pieces they wanted to see so it was like cinema trailers</div><div id="00:16:05.360" class="transcript_line"> so this was an entirely fascinating tradition um a six and seven hundred year old tradition</div><div id="00:16:12.240" class="transcript_line"> terms of age that we&#039;re used to thinking about classical theater in Asia no in Japan and so on</div><div id="00:16:20.960" class="transcript_line"> but that had survived that stayed the same by changing as many populist and folk traditions</div><div id="00:16:29.520" class="transcript_line"> do by by continually updating and changing their material so they came to Wales where we</div><div id="00:16:39.120" class="transcript_line"> this time we chose the narrative material of Tumshan Khatti the Welsh bandit to outline a</div><div id="00:16:46.640" class="transcript_line"> problem that was unquestionably a problem in Wales in the 18th century and that still is in India where</div><div id="00:16:53.360" class="transcript_line"> um fathers and mothers have lots of sons and um they divide the farms down into smaller and smaller</div><div id="00:17:02.240" class="transcript_line"> dimensions and areas and units that become economically unviable and young his son simply</div><div id="00:17:08.560" class="transcript_line"> go off and they either go to the city or they become outlaws they they live by robbing and</div><div id="00:17:13.920" class="transcript_line"> stealing because farming is no longer an option so we developed this production with</div><div id="00:17:26.400" class="transcript_line"> greater degree of community participation there was a great deal of communal pride in</div><div id="00:17:33.040" class="transcript_line"> these artistic cousins coming from India and and and showing off if you like to Britain the the</div><div id="00:17:41.280" class="transcript_line"> some of the cultural riches of of the state of Gujarat</div><div id="00:17:45.840" class="transcript_line"> uh in particular and they toured their own shows and we we did a number of workshops with the</div><div id="00:17:54.560" class="transcript_line"> London International with lift the international festival for people and um BBC Wales made a tv</div><div id="00:18:01.200" class="transcript_line"> documentary and and so it made the event made a bigger splash as we hoped it would</div><div id="00:18:09.120" class="transcript_line"> um and by then I would think we were sort of making the work and doing the administration</div><div id="00:18:14.480" class="transcript_line"> but also trying to promote an active agenda of the virtues and the value of interculturalism of</div><div id="00:18:25.040" class="transcript_line"> people simply opening to others through participation in projects like this</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> is. So it was a spoken and sung in English, Welsh and Gujarati or Kutchis, Rusty,</div><div id="00:18:40.400" class="transcript_line"> piece which again produced a very positive reaction bigger waves I would say.</div><div id="00:18:50.880" class="transcript_line"> I think that I have to say that we had many supporters from the Welsh language community</div><div id="00:18:59.200" class="transcript_line"> but I think there were also it&#039;s fair to say um naysayers who found this</div><div id="00:19:08.000" class="transcript_line"> agenda a muddying of waters that they wished only to exist between Welsh speakers and English</div><div id="00:19:13.920" class="transcript_line"> speakers and um who in other words were simply wishing to edit out the reality of the multi-ethnic</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> communities of Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and a little bit in</div><div id="00:19:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Connors Quay in northeastern Wales that uh this didn&#039;t simply figure in their picture of Wales.</div><div id="00:19:35.680" class="transcript_line"> We understand the kind of cultural breakdown and talk about one individual&#039;s sense of what Wales</div><div id="00:19:41.360" class="transcript_line"> means to them what their Wales is uh and I was naive naive enough to be</div><div id="00:19:48.400" class="transcript_line"> shocked I think by some of the arguments sometimes heated arguments</div><div id="00:19:58.480" class="transcript_line"> um that uh I think in all soberness that uh reeked of um straightforward fascism.</div><div id="00:20:06.880" class="transcript_line"> I need to say that people who are saying these people should simply be deported or given the</div><div id="00:20:15.040" class="transcript_line"> opportunity at best to learn to speak fluent Welsh in one year. All those failing some kind of</div><div id="00:20:20.080" class="transcript_line"> test should be deported. I heard this from scores of people so it was some group of people&#039;s notion</div><div id="00:20:28.800" class="transcript_line"> of an agenda at that time so I&#039;m simply wanting to draw attention to the fact that this this</div><div id="00:20:34.880" class="transcript_line"> reasonably enough ideas transformative ideas are never received smoothly and there were um</div><div id="00:20:43.680" class="transcript_line"> um people who were consciously against such an agenda.</div><div id="00:20:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Um the trilogy continued and and grew a pace I remember in particular as we moved on to the third</div><div id="00:21:00.320" class="transcript_line"> play that the the participatory elements and some of the tasters that Tally-Es-In some of the things</div><div id="00:21:06.640" class="transcript_line"> that Tally-Es-In, Tally-Es-In Wales were bringing to Cardiff for the first time</div><div id="00:21:10.720" class="transcript_line"> you know the whole idea of a multicultural community orchestra um I can remember organising</div><div id="00:21:18.720" class="transcript_line"> first ever Ghanaian drumming sessions as part of these projects um I think I am right when I suspect</div><div id="00:21:28.480" class="transcript_line"> the roots of Samba Galez are probably in there as well as we began to explore community percussion</div><div id="00:21:33.920" class="transcript_line"> in lots of different ways so um take us on to community play number three because</div><div id="00:21:40.800" class="transcript_line"> your observations are absolutely acute Steve in that that in and around and after Tumsun Katty</div><div id="00:21:50.080" class="transcript_line"> uh we were all very much well aware of simply the time it took to it would took at least a year to</div><div id="00:21:59.120" class="transcript_line"> develop the various strands to make beginning such a production feasible, organisational,</div><div id="00:22:06.640" class="transcript_line"> financial, particularly organisational but at the ground level that is to say in South Cardiff we</div><div id="00:22:12.720" class="transcript_line"> wanted to try to push a little bit or or um expand out from the samargin organising events</div><div id="00:22:23.520" class="transcript_line"> um in South Cardiff or anywhere really um that would function on their own function on their own</div><div id="00:22:34.960" class="transcript_line"> right but also hopefully feed into uh the the larger shows which would make community involvement</div><div id="00:22:45.600" class="transcript_line"> that much more real that much fuller and that&#039;s much more enjoyable so we ran</div><div id="00:22:54.720" class="transcript_line"> cross-cultural music concerts in chapter we ran a community orchestra we did projects in schools</div><div id="00:23:02.880" class="transcript_line"> including two that I remember with great and profound pleasure in a school for the deaf and</div><div id="00:23:09.200" class="transcript_line"> hearing impaired and sully one with a South Asian and um uh Welsh team and one with an African</div><div id="00:23:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Caribbean group um both particularly percussion and drum base that was received I have truly to</div><div id="00:23:25.280" class="transcript_line"> say ecstatically by the school the children many of whom were resident and the head teacher and it</div><div id="00:23:32.320" class="transcript_line"> was a great source of sorrow that we couldn&#039;t when the money ran out that we couldn&#039;t carry those on</div><div id="00:23:36.960" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;re some of the projects that I feel proudest of so we were looking for opportunities</div><div id="00:23:44.640" class="transcript_line"> to to run dance classes drama classes um through the year to to to widen the net to to build the</div><div id="00:23:54.880" class="transcript_line"> the links of the web uh to connect more people with more people through art so that was a kind</div><div id="00:24:03.360" class="transcript_line"> of significant shift which meant that we were um working locally through the year on those kinds</div><div id="00:24:11.280" class="transcript_line"> of projects um taking on people because you can&#039;t do everything running projects uh one in a Welsh</div><div id="00:24:17.840" class="transcript_line"> language junior school in specifically in relation to some of the things I&#039;ve just been saying um</div><div id="00:24:24.160" class="transcript_line"> um so I think that expansion of activity is an important</div><div id="00:24:35.280" class="transcript_line"> um growth and development probably between the second and third of this I&#039;d call them a triad</div><div id="00:24:43.680" class="transcript_line"> more than a trilogy uh because they weren&#039;t they weren&#039;t uh directly thematically linked but they</div><div id="00:24:49.760" class="transcript_line"> were they were politically linked by the underlying premises of our intercultural</div><div id="00:24:56.960" class="transcript_line"> premise or premises and so the third piece</div><div id="00:25:06.080" class="transcript_line"> playing fast and loose with the legend of Madog uh the 13th century Welsh prince who sailed away</div><div id="00:25:14.480" class="transcript_line"> from north Wales and allegedly discovered America and that there is a memory with the</div><div id="00:25:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Mandan indigenous American people just west of the Mississippi of blue-eyed and blonde haired ancestors</div><div id="00:25:32.880" class="transcript_line"> uh that we involved not only other Asian groups the Punjabi um Bangra group of young people and</div><div id="00:25:43.920" class="transcript_line"> an African Caribbean young girls or teenage girls dance group as well as you were saying Steve a</div><div id="00:25:50.400" class="transcript_line"> sort of cross-cultural uh percussion group so we were looking at all kinds of resources and um</div><div id="00:25:59.920" class="transcript_line"> we had a dear colleague of mine whose early death saddens me as I speak of it uh Elvira Lewis</div><div id="00:26:07.280" class="transcript_line"> where else in the world would you have a minister who leads a double life as an actor it&#039;s</div><div id="00:26:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure there are elsewhere but it&#039;s a peculiarly kind of Welsh set of circumstances</div><div id="00:26:17.040" class="transcript_line"> and one of our South Asian supporters playing Queen Elizabeth singing um jailhouse rock</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> at the end of part one so that&#039;s what I mean by saying playing fast and loose with cultural</div><div id="00:26:28.880" class="transcript_line"> references and creating a kind of playground where men can play women anybody could be anybody</div><div id="00:26:38.080" class="transcript_line"> by adopting costumes by by mutual agreement by a set of circumstances affinities playground rules</div><div id="00:26:45.760" class="transcript_line"> of saying this is just like a children&#039;s dressing room where here are the costumes let&#039;s try on what</div><div id="00:26:52.640" class="transcript_line"> we like and see what kind of roles we might care to play out and so um in that the third piece was</div><div id="00:27:05.120" class="transcript_line"> a promenade uh the previous piece had been two-sided and four-sided seating in the</div><div id="00:27:12.240" class="transcript_line"> rectangular samarj but madhok was a promenade piece the audience stood and we simply acted amongst them</div><div id="00:27:22.080" class="transcript_line"> and the the premise that of anybody could be Welsh if as the historian who wrote the book</div><div id="00:27:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Gwynedd William said if you make his view as a marxist internationalist if you make a commit to</div><div id="00:27:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Wales what&#039;s the problem with being Welsh a view that we espoused and very glad that he came and</div><div id="00:27:46.880" class="transcript_line"> said a few words on the opening night of the show and was 100 behind the project</div><div id="00:27:50.720" class="transcript_line"> of making it globally available we speak largely in the current times about</div><div id="00:28:05.280" class="transcript_line"> on the one hand how</div><div id="00:28:09.040" class="transcript_line"> colossal theoretical sums of money pass in a nanosecond around the globe they&#039;re simply noughts</div><div id="00:28:14.640" class="transcript_line"> on a computer screen but the movement of peoples at the moment the focus is on</div><div id="00:28:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Africa and the Mediterranean and people drowning in boats globalization produces</div><div id="00:28:27.200" class="transcript_line"> changes some of which are difficult and challenging to deal with</div><div id="00:28:32.160" class="transcript_line"> as our ideas about what our work meant and what it might mean and what its potential significance</div><div id="00:28:40.800" class="transcript_line"> that it was a response to changing circumstances that in the intervening years have changed even</div><div id="00:28:50.720" class="transcript_line"> further this movement of peoples has not stopped it is simply one of the most significant features</div><div id="00:28:57.440" class="transcript_line"> of the world we live in like it or not that is the case and so I think that we hope artists have</div><div id="00:29:05.680" class="transcript_line"> their antennae out and are looking at social trends so whilst as artists I wouldn&#039;t pretend</div><div id="00:29:13.280" class="transcript_line"> that our priority wasn&#039;t with solving the aesthetic problems that we set ourselves</div><div id="00:29:19.600" class="transcript_line"> we were at in and of the same time and especially discussions with you Steve</div><div id="00:29:25.040" class="transcript_line"> continually sifting and resifting and thinking about how are people who are opposed to this</div><div id="00:29:31.760" class="transcript_line"> what might they think was this simply bigotry or fear of change which we all recognize in ourselves</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> of the people who came and said I couldn&#039;t recognize my own country at one of our performances</div><div id="00:29:47.360" class="transcript_line"> at which we we have to reflect on the kind of subjective nature of of what or confusing the</div><div id="00:29:54.800" class="transcript_line"> subjective and and the kind of officially approved view of Wales that you largely see</div><div id="00:30:01.840" class="transcript_line"> it for example it&#039;s one picture of Wales I&#039;m not against it it&#039;s not illegitimate but it&#039;s not the</div><div id="00:30:08.560" class="transcript_line"> only one and it&#039;s that sense that that many projections and images overlap conflict yes they</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> do conflict but many overlap and that is the kind of kaleidoscopic social situation we were in then</div><div id="00:30:23.280" class="transcript_line"> and we were hoping the work would reflect so what seems to be quite clear is in terms of</div><div id="00:30:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Swicker&#039;s origins and again you know the birth of Cardiff Carnival that Theatre Taliesin Wales</div><div id="00:30:35.600" class="transcript_line"> certainly for me was a a fabulous eye-opener and that some of the central tenants that</div><div id="00:30:43.600" class="transcript_line"> I took and helped make the foundation for Swicker were the the interculturalism</div><div id="00:30:49.440" class="transcript_line"> the openness of spirit the importance of involving and being inclusive and accessible</div><div id="00:30:58.240" class="transcript_line"> and probably most important because these were fabulous groundbreaking works which still stand</div><div id="00:31:04.960" class="transcript_line"> the test of time today which was that the upbeat and ultimately life-affirming and</div><div id="00:31:12.720" class="transcript_line"> celebratory nature of what Theatre Taliesin was doing the the come down for the you know hundreds</div><div id="00:31:20.800" class="transcript_line"> who took part or watched particularly the participants at the end of a 10-week making</div><div id="00:31:27.120" class="transcript_line"> period for the theatre was massive and so it it it created it&#039;s shone a shone a beacon as to what</div><div id="00:31:37.280" class="transcript_line"> might be possible and could be possible in addition to all the great work with Taliesin</div><div id="00:31:42.160" class="transcript_line"> was doing so we&#039;re going to return to this conversation in a couple of weeks</div><div id="00:31:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Nigel can I thank you very much indeed for that you&#039;re most welcome Steve and I&#039;d just like to</div><div id="00:31:52.560" class="transcript_line"> to conclude at length not too great a length by simply saying that even though it was difficult</div><div id="00:32:00.880" class="transcript_line"> for us at the time I think that the growth I my view of the growth of sugar is simply that</div><div id="00:32:07.760" class="transcript_line"> that I think like all good work in any form in the performing arts somehow if it&#039;s localized if it&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:18.320" class="transcript_line"> if it&#039;s based in a great spirit of place generates further ideas which ripple out</div><div id="00:32:25.120" class="transcript_line"> and in terms of our you know there were three of us really the organization couldn&#039;t sustain</div><div id="00:32:33.440" class="transcript_line"> the amount of work that people wanted to do and so that we split the company in two and thought</div><div id="00:32:38.800" class="transcript_line"> that that would be the best way forward to promote a specifically grassroots community events program</div><div id="00:32:48.000" class="transcript_line"> that could garner a great deal more money whilst we looked at at perhaps working abroad or</div><div id="00:32:56.240" class="transcript_line"> elsewhere where people said well why don&#039;t you come and do something with us</div><div id="00:33:00.800" class="transcript_line"> it didn&#039;t work out for Taliesin partly for health reasons and I should say that many people working</div><div id="00:33:07.040" class="transcript_line"> in new work experimental modes of performance groundbreaking there&#039;s often a great health</div><div id="00:33:13.120" class="transcript_line"> strain because three people did eight people&#039;s work for a long time and I don&#039;t wish to be</div><div id="00:33:22.640" class="transcript_line"> in any way mawkish but but this is true of so many organizations so the idea of modest financial</div><div id="00:33:29.440" class="transcript_line"> financial remuneration to to round the clock working easy to shrug at but it should be</div><div id="00:33:35.040" class="transcript_line"> remembered that these things don&#039;t happen without a certain level of obsessiveness by those people</div><div id="00:33:41.440" class="transcript_line"> involved and it takes its toll so I&#039;m absolutely delighted to go on the record to say that I</div><div id="00:33:50.480" class="transcript_line"> congratulate Steve on his what 30 years 25 25 of swicker and and that the carnival mode that he</div><div id="00:34:00.400" class="transcript_line"> chose that seems to me the absolutely correct one to maximize all the kind of potential creativities</div><div id="00:34:08.240" class="transcript_line"> of its participants when I was talking about a room full of a children&#039;s room full of</div><div id="00:34:14.720" class="transcript_line"> costumes and masks and anything can be anything that could expand everybody&#039;s individual creativity</div><div id="00:34:22.240" class="transcript_line"> so I wish the company and if as long as he wants it another 25 years if he wants</div><div id="00:34:29.440" class="transcript_line"> it. Heartiest congratulations. Thank you very much. We&#039;re equally cursed and blessed by that I think.</div><div id="00:34:35.680" class="transcript_line"> Take care.</div></div></p>
