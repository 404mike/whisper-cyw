how do you say it, boarding houses in Paris, because in Paris, Greeks were gathering, there was something like this.</div><div id="00:07:44.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, that&#039;s

here, I think, I don&#039;t know exactly where it was, but before 1950 and the war, because the war was very Greek here, very, very Greek here, and they left after Greece was liberated.</div><div id="00:08:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Here were the Ship&#039;s Channels, the messengers who, I don&#039;t know how you say it in Greek, were the dissidents, the messengers, the</div><div

there.</div><div id="00:09:31.880" class="transcript_line"> No, I spoke with the sailor and he told me that he spoke with the sailor, the sailor was a philosopher, he could speak to me later, so he could tell me about the pictures.</div><div id="00:09:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, nice, nice.</div><div id="00:09:37.880" class="transcript_line"> And I also spoke with the sailor, who sent me some information, he sent me some pictures.</div><div id="00:09:43.060" class="transcript_line"> The sailor has no more pictures.</div><div id="00:09:46.060" class="transcript_line"> He has no more pictures.</div><div id="00:09:47.060" class="transcript_line"> He has no more pictures.</div><div id="00:09:49.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know his name.</div><div id="00:09:51.060" class="transcript_line"> As a philologist, I don&#039;t know him from before, because in Greece he has even more pictures.</div><div id="00:09:55.060" class="transcript_line"> He was a philologist, and he was a philologist, he was the one whose son gave him 15,000 people in the church yesterday.</div><div id="00:10:04.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:05.060" class="transcript_line"> Do we have a contact with philologists?</div><div id="00:10:07.060" class="transcript_line"> No, not with the ship.</div><div id="00:10:11.240" class="transcript_line"> But do they have any old photographs?</div><div id="00:10:13.240" class="transcript_line"> No, they must have.</div><div id="00:10:14.240" class="transcript_line"> This one was usually in Paris.</div><div id="00:10:18.240" class="transcript_line"> This was the painting.</div><div id="00:10:20.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I had a copy of the painting.</div><div id="00:10:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:10:25.240" class="transcript_line"> The pigmalion that is on the plaque, he was a firefighter and he was a priest in the church.</div><div id="00:10:34.240" class="transcript_line"> This is the man who was on the plaque.</div><div id="00:10:37.240" class="transcript_line"> He was the captain.</div><div id="00:10:39.420" class="transcript_line"> The</div><div id="00:10:42.260" class="transcript_line"> people who started the war, most of them were Cassiopeians, Antiochians, and the Cypriots.</div><div id="00:10:53.260" class="transcript_line"> The Cypriots came after the war.</div><div id="00:10:55.260" class="transcript_line"> Kostas, look.</div><div id="00:10:57.260" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:10:59.260" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:11:01.260" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s exactly what I wanted.</div><div id="00:11:03.260" class="transcript_line"> I wish I knew more.</div><div id="00:11:05.260" class="transcript_line"> If I didn&#039;t want a father who was in my life, I would have told you there.</div><div id="00:11:08.280" class="transcript_line"> He would have educated you there.</div><div id="00:11:11.280" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s a joy to gather.</div><div id="00:11:13.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s exactly what we want to do.</div><div id="00:11:16.280" class="transcript_line"> We want to make a map.</div><div id="00:11:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Where we can put the census.</div><div id="00:11:22.280" class="transcript_line"> If you go to the census.</div><div id="00:11:25.280" class="transcript_line"> 1911 is it?</div><div id="00:11:28.280" class="transcript_line"> 1901 is it?</div><div id="00:11:30.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m looking the director.</div><div id="00:11:32.280" class="transcript_line"> I think you might find stuff in the census.</div><div id="00:11:34.300" class="transcript_line"> It was a George Andriadis.</div><div id="00:11:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Remember when I told you that it was the Cypriots who had the coffee house?</div><div id="00:11:51.300" class="transcript_line"> I think before they took it and made it coffee house, it was a George Andriadis there.</div><div id="00:11:59.320" class="transcript_line"> The Cypriots were rafters.</div><div id="00:12:02.320" class="transcript_line"> They sold on the steamships.</div><div id="00:12:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Wherever there was a steamer, they went there with their jacket and shoes.</div><div id="00:12:09.320" class="transcript_line"> Because they didn&#039;t know how to speak.</div><div id="00:12:11.320" class="transcript_line"> They went on the steamer and spoke.</div><div id="00:12:13.320" class="transcript_line"> In the meantime, I remember something else.</div><div id="00:12:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Down here, where are we?</div><div id="00:12:17.320" class="transcript_line"> In the Beaux Street.</div><div id="00:12:19.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember the Beaux Street again.</div><div id="00:12:21.320" class="transcript_line"> Where we talked about the lamp.</div><div id="00:12:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Where is it for the lamp?</div><div id="00:12:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And the lamp here.</div><div id="00:12:28.340" class="transcript_line"> Here was a brewery called the White Heart.</div><div id="00:12:38.340" class="transcript_line"> This brewery was owned by a Greek.</div><div id="00:12:42.340" class="transcript_line"> I think that the father of the Greek,</div><div id="00:12:46.340" class="transcript_line"> his father had married a Yugoslava.</div><div id="00:12:50.340" class="transcript_line"> Because the Greek was half Yugoslav and half Greek.</div><div id="00:12:54.360" class="transcript_line"> He was Greek, that is, he was educated in Greece.</div><div id="00:12:58.360" class="transcript_line"> They had the brewery here,</div><div id="00:13:01.360" class="transcript_line"> as you enter the Beaux Street, left.</div><div id="00:13:05.360" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if this brewery exists now.</div><div id="00:13:08.360" class="transcript_line"> I think they have it.</div><div id="00:13:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Not the one that was here, in the corner where there are some photos.</div><div id="00:13:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Not this one.</div><div id="00:13:17.360" class="transcript_line"> You will go to the beginning of Beaux Street, where the hotel is.</div><div id="00:13:21.380" class="transcript_line"> There you will go a little further.</div><div id="00:13:23.380" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if this brewery still exists.</div><div id="00:13:26.380" class="transcript_line"> But this was owned by a Yugoslav.</div><div id="00:13:35.380" class="transcript_line"> And the daughter of the Yugoslav took the future shipbroker.</div><div id="00:13:41.380" class="transcript_line"> It was not a shipbroker.</div><div id="00:13:43.380" class="transcript_line"> It was a shipbroker.</div><div id="00:13:45.380" class="transcript_line"> Correct.</div><div id="00:13:46.380" class="transcript_line"> Ship-chandler.</div><div id="00:13:48.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a ship-chandler.</div><div id="00:13:51.400" class="transcript_line"> He took the ship-chandler</div><div id="00:13:54.400" class="transcript_line"> and his daughter Mary married the ship-chandler.</div><div id="00:13:59.400" class="transcript_line"> And his son Antonis Kalinikos</div><div id="00:14:02.400" class="transcript_line"> was educated in Greece.</div><div id="00:14:06.400" class="transcript_line"> And he was a priest from 1964 until 1985.</div><div id="00:14:12.400" class="transcript_line"> He closed the church.</div><div id="00:14:14.420" class="transcript_line"> Because until then all the port had fallen.</div><div id="00:14:21.420" class="transcript_line"> There was once a Greek port-captain.</div><div id="00:14:28.420" class="transcript_line"> Port-captain, that is, when the Greek ship was sailing in the Carinthia,</div><div id="00:14:37.420" class="transcript_line"> they went to the port-captain, the port-captain,</div><div id="00:14:40.440" class="transcript_line"> who was

class="transcript_line"> There was a office here that was Greek,</div><div id="00:14:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Greek servants who worked for the Greek state.</div><div id="00:14:57.440" class="transcript_line"> They would hit the ships, the captains were in charge, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Yannis Kinios was the port-captain.</div><div id="00:15:06.460" class="transcript_line"> He was a slave.</div><div id="00:15:09.460" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what he did, but he was also a nun.</div><div id="00:15:14.460" class="transcript_line"> You understand?</div><div id="00:15:15.460" class="transcript_line"> They were the ones who left.</div><div id="00:15:18.460" class="transcript_line"> Around 1960 they all
