We speak the patois and the French.</div><div id="00:00:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Are you able to also introduce yourself in terms of your name and where you were born</div><div

Okay.</div><div id="00:00:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Je m&#039;appelle Madame May Lida et je suis née à L&#039;Hémorice en 1946.</div><div id="00:00:47.440" class="transcript_line"> J&#039;ai 5 enfants et j&#039;habite à Newport à présent.</div><div id="00:00:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the area that you grew up in?</div><div id="00:00:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Bobassa.</div><div id="00:01:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Bobassa, okay.</div><div id="00:01:01.080" class="transcript_line"> And what was it like growing up there?</div><div id="00:01:04.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s this village, quiet, people know each other.</div><div id="00:01:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Those days life was just easy going.</div><div id="00:01:14.880" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know what it&#039;s like to have worry.</div><div id="00:01:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have to go to work.</div><div id="00:01:17.880" class="transcript_line"> I was in school, just running around after school, coming home.</div><div id="00:01:26.280" class="transcript_line"> We were just happy, easy going.</div><div id="00:01:28.600" class="transcript_line"> We get along with the neighbours.</div><div id="00:01:30.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a lot of family to get together.</div><div id="00:01:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Every Sunday we&#039;re never home.</div><div id="00:01:35.440" class="transcript_line"> We can, we either by the sea or go to church on the pilgrim day.</div><div id="00:01:40.840" class="transcript_line"> And we have a picnic so that was a routine every Sunday.</div><div id="00:01:44.600" class="transcript_line"> Different beaches every week.</div><div id="00:01:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And weddings and parties, always something at the weekend, never boat.</div><div id="00:01:51.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:01:53.720" class="transcript_line"> What was your favourite memory as a child?</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> School, going to school, going to church, singing the choir, going for rehearsal.</div><div id="00:02:05.880" class="transcript_line"> I was in the girls guide as well so we did that Saturday morning.</div><div id="00:02:09.920" class="transcript_line"> We had to go for meetings.</div><div id="00:02:13.800" class="transcript_line"> So it was good.</div><div id="00:02:16.920" class="transcript_line"> And what about the opposite?</div><div id="00:02:18.520" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the fondest memory of your childhood?</div><div id="00:02:22.200" class="transcript_line"> Is there something else that you didn&#039;t really enjoy in your childhood?</div><div id="00:02:26.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, my mum died.</div><div id="00:02:28.600" class="transcript_line"> I was seven and I didn&#039;t know my father.</div><div id="00:02:32.240" class="transcript_line"> And we lived with my grandmother then when my mum died in her house.</div><div id="00:02:38.400" class="transcript_line"> And then my grandmother moved.</div><div id="00:02:41.720" class="transcript_line"> I moved with my great grandmother until I was eleven.</div><div id="00:02:44.680" class="transcript_line"> She died.</div><div id="00:02:45.680" class="transcript_line"> So I went back to my maternal grandmother.</div><div id="00:02:49.480" class="transcript_line"> We lived with her until I met my husband.</div><div id="00:02:52.600" class="transcript_line"> We got married and we came here.</div><div id="00:02:55.400" class="transcript_line"> So that was a short childhood I think.</div><div id="00:02:59.400" class="transcript_line"> Everything went so quick from there.</div><div id="00:03:02.520" class="transcript_line"> How old was you when you married?</div><div id="00:03:03.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I was seventeen because he had to leave the country.</div><div id="00:03:09.400" class="transcript_line"> And then when we came here we had a religious, because we had to have a civil marriage.</div><div id="00:03:15.240" class="transcript_line"> And we hadn&#039;t been a minor those days.</div><div id="00:03:17.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re not allowed to get married without consent.</div><div id="00:03:21.800" class="transcript_line"> So we just had a quick civil marriage.</div><div id="00:03:23.880" class="transcript_line"> And when we came to Newport we had a religious marriage.</div><div id="00:03:29.680" class="transcript_line"> So of course then, what type of celebrations can you also remember as a child?</div><div id="00:03:37.960" class="transcript_line"> Wedding, being bridesmaid.</div><div id="00:03:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Every wedding, every family would be asked to be bridesmaid.</div><div id="00:03:44.600" class="transcript_line"> It was good fun, dressing up, it was nice.</div><div id="00:03:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And what type of traditions would you say are different within those types of weddings</div><div id="00:03:53.400" class="transcript_line"> towards the Western forms of weddings?</div><div id="00:03:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Well here, if you go to a wedding the organisation is not the same.</div><div id="00:04:02.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like family orientated.</div><div id="00:04:06.200" class="transcript_line"> Everybody isn&#039;t united, it&#039;s all different.</div><div id="00:04:11.960" class="transcript_line"> They stay in their corner and they don&#039;t like converse.</div><div id="00:04:16.120" class="transcript_line"> But not like at home, no way.</div><div id="00:04:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Since you come in you&#039;re meeting people and you have your toast, the bride and groom dance.</div><div id="00:04:26.440" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;ll be dancing till four o&#039;clock in the morning before we go home.</div><div id="00:04:31.960" class="transcript_line"> What type of customs in terms of like, is there music, is there drumming?</div><div id="00:04:35.560" class="transcript_line"> We did modern music like ballroom dancing.</div><div id="00:04:42.920" class="transcript_line"> And then we got our original dance which is the Sega, come from Africa.</div><div id="00:04:48.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s our national dance.</div><div id="00:04:50.440" class="transcript_line"> But then you keep that till the end.</div><div id="00:04:53.080" class="transcript_line"> But in the beginning it&#039;s the walls and the slow and a bit of a mix.</div><div id="00:04:57.960" class="transcript_line"> So the Sega come at the end when it&#039;s the final then.</div><div id="00:05:02.360" class="transcript_line"> Near the end of the reception.</div><div id="00:05:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Was there any kind of other celebrations that you enjoy too?</div><div id="00:05:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Well it&#039;s always been dinner party on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:05:14.120" class="transcript_line"> It could be a christening, it could be a holy communion, or engagement.</div><div id="00:05:21.960" class="transcript_line"> Or just going for a picnic on a beach.</div><div id="00:05:26.120" class="transcript_line"> What was that like as well, having water very very close to you and a part of your childhood?</div><div id="00:05:35.240" class="transcript_line"> We like paddling but none of us like to swim.</div><div id="00:05:38.920" class="transcript_line"> We just paddle and some are good swimmers but there&#039;s been a couple of deaths.</div><div id="00:05:46.200" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s put me off when we see your friends drown.</div><div id="00:05:51.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s put me off that is going in deep.</div><div id="00:05:57.080" class="transcript_line"> So then if we were moving over to travel into the UK you said you travelled through marriage and you come straight to Newport?</div><div id="00:06:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes straight to Newport.</div><div id="00:06:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Why was that?</div><div id="00:06:07.720" class="transcript_line"> When my husband came, his uncle was in London, his cousin was already here.</div><div id="00:06:13.480" class="transcript_line"> 1962 he got married and came here.</div><div id="00:06:17.480" class="transcript_line"> The thing is his father-in-law used to work on a boat and another friend from Mauritius.</div><div id="00:06:23.640" class="transcript_line"> So when they docked in Newport it was a nice place to settle.</div><div id="00:06:28.040" class="transcript_line"> So they stayed here and when he was coming his cousin said you don&#039;t need to go to London in a flat.</div><div id="00:06:35.400" class="transcript_line"> I already got a house in Bill.</div><div id="00:06:37.800" class="transcript_line"> So he had a room with them so this is where we stayed.</div><div id="00:06:41.480" class="transcript_line"> But we commute, family in France, London and it was fun.</div><div id="00:06:48.040" class="transcript_line"> They like coming to Wales, the park, the beach, we take them out.</div><div id="00:06:53.400" class="transcript_line"> And they love it, the countryside.</div><div id="00:06:57.400" class="transcript_line"> We were not all in one place.</div><div id="00:07:00.200" class="transcript_line"> So when we see each other it was nice.</div><div id="00:07:04.440" class="transcript_line"> And then you go home and then you see each other again.</div><div id="00:07:08.200" class="transcript_line"> So it was good like that.</div><div id="00:07:10.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s 1962 then?</div><div id="00:07:12.920" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:13.960" class="transcript_line"> Your cousin was in 1962?</div><div id="00:07:16.840" class="transcript_line"> He came first, my husband came in 1964.</div><div id="00:07:19.880" class="transcript_line"> He is already settled in Newport.</div><div id="00:07:22.120" class="transcript_line"> And you came in 1964?</div><div id="00:07:24.120" class="transcript_line"> I came after 1965.</div><div id="00:07:26.120" class="transcript_line"> And did you have any expectations of the UK before you came?</div><div id="00:07:30.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:07:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t even know where I was going.</div><div id="00:07:33.480" class="transcript_line"> Just calling the place.</div><div id="00:07:35.480" class="transcript_line"> How did that feel as well actually?</div><div id="00:07:37.480" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit sad.</div><div id="00:07:39.480" class="transcript_line"> It was on my own mind.</div><div id="00:07:41.480" class="transcript_line"> And when I got to London we got to come to Newport by train.</div><div id="00:07:47.160" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t got a clue of where Newport was.</div><div id="00:07:49.800" class="transcript_line"> And my husband never told me.</div><div id="00:07:51.800" class="transcript_line"> And he just sit there and I see people getting off.</div><div id="00:07:55.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, where is Newport?</div><div id="00:07:57.800" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t say nothing.</div><div id="00:07:59.800" class="transcript_line"> Everybody&#039;s getting off.</div><div id="00:08:01.800" class="transcript_line"> It was a small train those days.</div><div id="00:08:03.800" class="transcript_line"> He stopped at Caldy Court, something, something.</div><div id="00:08:05.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going, where is Newport?</div><div id="00:08:07.800" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t say nothing.</div><div id="00:08:09.800" class="transcript_line"> He was laughing.</div><div id="00:08:11.800" class="transcript_line"> And then finally we got to Newport.</div><div id="00:08:13.800" class="transcript_line"> And the high street was a lot of people going up and down.</div><div id="00:08:18.440" class="transcript_line"> And then we walked from the train station to town.</div><div id="00:08:20.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think there&#039;s buses there.</div><div id="00:08:22.440" class="transcript_line"> We go to Peel and I can&#039;t remember that bit.</div><div id="00:08:26.440" class="transcript_line"> But I could see a lot of people walking.</div><div id="00:08:28.440" class="transcript_line"> It was nice.</div><div id="00:08:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Different.</div><div id="00:08:32.440" class="transcript_line"> It was strange.</div><div id="00:08:34.440" class="transcript_line"> But I make friends.</div><div id="00:08:36.440" class="transcript_line"> Because I am very talkative and not shy.</div><div id="00:08:40.440" class="transcript_line"> And so the landlord was Asian.</div><div id="00:08:44.440" class="transcript_line"> And they speak to me.</div><div id="00:08:47.080" class="transcript_line"> And they say, how come you speak English?</div><div id="00:08:49.080" class="transcript_line"> And I said, well, I only left school a year ago to get married.</div><div id="00:08:53.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, so I was teaching them English.</div><div id="00:08:57.080" class="transcript_line"> So we became friends since then.</div><div id="00:08:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Even if they see me now, they&#039;re like, oh, hello lady.</div><div id="00:09:03.080" class="transcript_line"> Remember you?</div><div id="00:09:05.080" class="transcript_line"> They all know me.</div><div id="00:09:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they remember.</div><div id="00:09:09.080" class="transcript_line"> So it sounds as if you had loads of opportunities which you took in order to settle in.</div><div id="00:09:13.720" class="transcript_line"> So that made him a bit more comfortable being here now?</div><div id="00:09:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise I would have been lonely.</div><div id="00:09:17.720" class="transcript_line"> It was only a bedside man we had.</div><div id="00:09:19.720" class="transcript_line"> And when my husband said to me to go to the post office, I said, where&#039;s the post office?</div><div id="00:09:25.720" class="transcript_line"> He said, there&#039;s only one main road.</div><div id="00:09:27.720" class="transcript_line"> You won&#039;t get lost.</div><div id="00:09:29.720" class="transcript_line"> And he said, just take the main road and then come back.</div><div id="00:09:33.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:09:35.720" class="transcript_line"> This is how I learn.</div><div id="00:09:37.720" class="transcript_line"> And I know.</div><div id="00:09:40.360" class="transcript_line"> You said you spoke about that bit of sadness of having to leave home.</div><div id="00:09:46.360" class="transcript_line"> What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:09:50.360" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother.</div><div id="00:09:52.360" class="transcript_line"> She was old.</div><div id="00:09:54.360" class="transcript_line"> Now she wanted probably see me and my family very often but being the distance.</div><div id="00:10:02.360" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:10:04.360" class="transcript_line"> I went to see her once and then she died after.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Very similar to my staff as well.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Same thing.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I went and then it was time for her to go.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> With your grandmother as well, because you grew up living at your grandmother&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did I give you that opportunity in the space to learn loads of the traditions and learn more about your culture as well?</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because your grandmother was the one teaching you.</div><div id="00:10:33.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, since teachers have begun to go to church, you know, the right way we learn to do housework.</div><div id="00:10:45.640" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s the main thing a girl ought to learn.</div><div id="00:10:49.640" class="transcript_line"> Because if she gets married she&#039;s got to learn to cook and clean and teach all the basics.</div><div id="00:10:56.280" class="transcript_line"> So you lost her one day because she did say to me, I am not getting any younger, you know.</div><div id="00:11:04.280" class="transcript_line"> So you got to do all that and then to survive.</div><div id="00:11:10.280" class="transcript_line"> So then coming here then?</div><div id="00:11:12.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only reason she agreed for me to come here.</div><div id="00:11:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Because she said if anything happens to her, where would I go?</div><div id="00:11:18.920" class="transcript_line"> And I was just going to say, so you were kind of equipped and being able to be here and fend and live for yourself because you had been taught how to do so.</div><div id="00:11:30.920" class="transcript_line"> And how was that as well then after you had settled in to Newport?</div><div id="00:11:36.920" class="transcript_line"> What can you say was kind of the best things about being in Newport and even the worst as well?</div><div id="00:11:42.920" class="transcript_line"> One, as you said, coming here and then why you settled in in Newport?</div><div id="00:11:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Because my husband got a job there, he never thought of moving.</div><div id="00:11:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Because everything was so close, like hospitals, schools, you just have to walk.</div><div id="00:11:59.560" class="transcript_line"> But if I lived in London I would have had to learn to catch buses and underground.</div><div id="00:12:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I come from a village, just walk and catch the bus to go visit friends, family on a Sunday.</div><div id="00:12:14.200" class="transcript_line"> That was the tradition, you had to go and visit your family and have a chat, something to eat and come back.</div><div id="00:12:22.200" class="transcript_line"> But I said if I live in London, how am I going to go shopping?</div><div id="00:12:26.200" class="transcript_line"> So I stayed in Newport because I felt more settled here.</div><div id="00:12:32.200" class="transcript_line"> I could walk the children to school, come home, do my shopping by the time they come home.</div><div id="00:12:38.840" class="transcript_line"> If I had a doctor&#039;s appointment, it was only down the road.</div><div id="00:12:40.840" class="transcript_line"> If I had to go to the hospital, it was only 20 minutes walk from my house.</div><div id="00:12:44.840" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite handy.</div><div id="00:12:48.840" class="transcript_line"> But his heart was in London where all his uncles, sisters were.</div><div id="00:12:54.840" class="transcript_line"> And we tried to move but we looked at the price of houses because he had a job in Dagenham.</div><div id="00:13:00.840" class="transcript_line"> He was commuting, coming home and staying with my brother-in-law in Arsenal.</div><div id="00:13:07.480" class="transcript_line"> We did look at the houses, they were not suitable.</div><div id="00:13:11.480" class="transcript_line"> And the children said, no we are not leaving our schools, so we never move.</div><div id="00:13:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Did that give you the space again to start teaching the children about your ways and upskilling them as well?</div><div id="00:13:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Always, yes.</div><div id="00:13:29.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I took Jordan to see how we lived.</div><div id="00:13:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Not everybody got to story houses.</div><div id="00:13:36.120" class="transcript_line"> My family is still poor, living in bungalow.</div><div id="00:13:40.120" class="transcript_line"> So they appreciate life a bit better.</div><div id="00:13:44.120" class="transcript_line"> And we don&#039;t come from story houses, you know, with washing machine and all.</div><div id="00:13:50.120" class="transcript_line"> I showed them in the river where people are still washing.</div><div id="00:13:54.120" class="transcript_line"> And people in the house still washing on the stone, you call it?</div><div id="00:13:58.120" class="transcript_line"> You wash your clothes by hands.</div><div id="00:14:02.760" class="transcript_line"> I fell off one and there is the poor one.</div><div id="00:14:04.760" class="transcript_line"> So I showed them how I was growing up.</div><div id="00:14:08.760" class="transcript_line"> What kind of my life was.</div><div id="00:14:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Not luxury, you know, climbing mango trees, running around barefoot, you know.</div><div id="00:14:18.760" class="transcript_line"> So they appreciated them, so they know the culture.</div><div id="00:14:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise they think we all got big houses because it&#039;s not like that.</div><div id="00:14:29.400" class="transcript_line"> Was that obvious as well when you came here in terms of the upbringing of the children and the young people because they didn&#039;t have that?</div><div id="00:14:37.400" class="transcript_line"> Was that obvious?</div><div id="00:14:39.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:41.400" class="transcript_line"> And maybe again, there might be an obvious response to it, but do you feel that that&#039;s what also gave you resilience because you knew exactly where you come from?</div><div id="00:14:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and you never forget.</div><div id="00:14:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Another child, the way you were brought up.</div><div id="00:14:53.400" class="transcript_line"> It was the best time really.</div><div id="00:14:56.040" class="transcript_line"> You can never go back to this type of life again.</div><div id="00:14:58.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the same, it&#039;s moving too fast now.</div><div id="00:15:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Very, very, very fast.</div><div id="00:15:06.040" class="transcript_line"> And even about moving fast, what do you think is important about the next generation or our children to learn and to know?</div><div id="00:15:16.040" class="transcript_line"> How to live modest.</div><div id="00:15:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t forget their roots.</div><div id="00:15:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Always be there.</div><div id="00:15:22.680" class="transcript_line"> If you keep your roots, you won&#039;t go wrong in life.</div><div id="00:15:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t follow the bad way.</div><div id="00:15:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Follow your family way.</div><div id="00:15:28.680" class="transcript_line"> The old-fashioned way is the best, I think.</div><div id="00:15:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Did that also remain strong because you were visiting your families?</div><div id="00:15:32.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And how did you feel about the experience?</div><div id="00:15:36.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:38.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:40.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:42.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:44.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:46.680" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:15:49.320" class="transcript_line"> How was visiting your families?</div><div id="00:15:51.320" class="transcript_line"> I know you said even when you were here...</div><div id="00:15:53.320" class="transcript_line"> If I don&#039;t go there, not everybody can come and see me.</div><div id="00:15:55.320" class="transcript_line"> You see?</div><div id="00:15:57.320" class="transcript_line"> So they look forward to seeing me.</div><div id="00:15:59.320" class="transcript_line"> Some are very old.</div><div id="00:16:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Some are very poor.</div><div id="00:16:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Some have never lived in the house.</div><div id="00:16:05.320" class="transcript_line"> So the only time they see me is when I go and see them.</div><div id="00:16:07.320" class="transcript_line"> See?</div><div id="00:16:09.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I try and make an effort.</div><div id="00:16:11.320" class="transcript_line"> Because every time I&#039;ve gone, somebody has died.</div><div id="00:16:13.320" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t have to be all younger than myself.</div><div id="00:16:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Every year I&#039;ve gone.</div><div id="00:16:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Every year I&#039;ve gone, we&#039;ve lost so many members of the family.</div><div id="00:16:23.960" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel the children are doing that as well now?</div><div id="00:16:25.960" class="transcript_line"> I hope so when I&#039;m not here.</div><div id="00:16:27.960" class="transcript_line"> I hope they keep the tradition.</div><div id="00:16:29.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:31.960" class="transcript_line"> I hope so.</div><div id="00:16:33.960" class="transcript_line"> Because you then get to connect and share stories, especially if it&#039;s how fast-paced things are going now.</div><div id="00:16:39.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, they think it&#039;s a paradise.</div><div id="00:16:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Blue sea and sky. I said, no, you live there first.</div><div id="00:16:43.960" class="transcript_line"> And then you see if it&#039;s a paradise.</div><div id="00:16:47.960" class="transcript_line"> That is hardship, you know?</div><div id="00:16:49.960" class="transcript_line"> What would you say you love most about your culture?</div><div id="00:16:53.960" class="transcript_line"> We were brought up with respect.</div><div id="00:16:57.960" class="transcript_line"> We were taught to respect.</div><div id="00:17:01.960" class="transcript_line"> We were sociable.</div><div id="00:17:03.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, socialising all the time.</div><div id="00:17:07.960" class="transcript_line"> Any time, any occasion.</div><div id="00:17:09.960" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t need an excuse to have a get-together.</div><div id="00:17:14.600" class="transcript_line"> And most of all, you live, what you call it, a right way, like law-abiding.</div><div id="00:17:22.600" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t break any rules.</div><div id="00:17:24.600" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t, you know, go into drugs, into fights and things like this.</div><div id="00:17:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Just live modest and peaceful and happy.</div><div id="00:17:36.600" class="transcript_line"> I agree.</div><div id="00:17:39.240" class="transcript_line"> What elements of your culture have you made an effort to preserve?</div><div id="00:17:45.240" class="transcript_line"> If there&#039;s still the traditions we were just talking about, going to visit others.</div><div id="00:17:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Are there other customs or language of food or even types of celebrations?</div><div id="00:17:55.240" class="transcript_line"> Food is a multicultural country.</div><div id="00:18:01.240" class="transcript_line"> You have every kind of food.</div><div id="00:18:03.240" class="transcript_line"> Every nationality, we all live as one.</div><div id="00:18:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Everybody has different religions.</div><div id="00:18:11.880" class="transcript_line"> But when we&#039;re together, we are as one.</div><div id="00:18:15.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the way it&#039;s been.</div><div id="00:18:19.880" class="transcript_line"> And I hope they keep it that way, don&#039;t divide.</div><div id="00:18:23.880" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s one of the things to preserve, is to carry on the multicultural embracing of that.</div><div id="00:18:29.880" class="transcript_line"> Very true.</div><div id="00:18:32.520" class="transcript_line"> What type of things have you done in order?</div><div id="00:18:34.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you still do to preserve and to carry on the multicultural connections?</div><div id="00:18:40.520" class="transcript_line"> I teach the children, even if they don&#039;t believe in God, sometimes go to church.</div><div id="00:18:46.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice to believe in something, you know, because one day you need him.</div><div id="00:18:52.520" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t have to be really just up to your neck.</div><div id="00:18:56.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not saying that.</div><div id="00:18:59.160" class="transcript_line"> You can take the good in something and follow the right path.</div><div id="00:19:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;s two paths in life.</div><div id="00:19:03.160" class="transcript_line"> You can take the bad one, like I said to them, and you can take the good one.</div><div id="00:19:07.160" class="transcript_line"> That is good friends and that is bad friends.</div><div id="00:19:11.160" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve always teach them just follow the right way.</div><div id="00:19:15.160" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ll go wrong then.</div><div id="00:19:17.160" class="transcript_line"> I agree.</div><div id="00:19:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for sharing that as well.</div><div id="00:19:23.160" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted to speak a little bit about Age Alive, of course.</div><div id="00:19:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe how, from your journey, because while you were here you were working and teaching as you said.</div><div id="00:19:33.800" class="transcript_line"> No, teaching.</div><div id="00:19:35.800" class="transcript_line"> English?</div><div id="00:19:37.800" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:39.800" class="transcript_line"> I never worked when I came here.</div><div id="00:19:41.800" class="transcript_line"> I had the family first.</div><div id="00:19:43.800" class="transcript_line"> And then time was getting a bit hard.</div><div id="00:19:45.800" class="transcript_line"> Landward, my husband was working.</div><div id="00:19:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Every year there&#039;d be a strike.</div><div id="00:19:49.800" class="transcript_line"> So my neighbour said to me one day, they&#039;re asking for people in Grumpton batteries.</div><div id="00:19:56.440" class="transcript_line"> To work, are you interested?</div><div id="00:19:58.440" class="transcript_line"> I said, do you not remember work?</div><div id="00:20:02.440" class="transcript_line"> What do I know about work?</div><div id="00:20:04.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a teenager, I come in this country, I got married, I&#039;ve got a family.</div><div id="00:20:08.440" class="transcript_line"> I only know how to cook and wash.</div><div id="00:20:12.440" class="transcript_line"> He introduced me to the catering.</div><div id="00:20:14.440" class="transcript_line"> Somebody was on the sick and they took me on to cover.</div><div id="00:20:20.440" class="transcript_line"> And they teach me everything from A, who&#039;s a nice old lady there.</div><div id="00:20:25.080" class="transcript_line"> They got to know me and they liked me.</div><div id="00:20:27.080" class="transcript_line"> And I liked my money then.</div><div id="00:20:29.080" class="transcript_line"> So when the lady came back after sick, so I had to leave.</div><div id="00:20:33.080" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit sad then.</div><div id="00:20:35.080" class="transcript_line"> And soon after, because I had no phone those days, one of the Jamaican Mrs. Carnegie,</div><div id="00:20:43.080" class="transcript_line"> she came and knocked on my door and she said, would you come back?</div><div id="00:20:45.080" class="transcript_line"> They all like you.</div><div id="00:20:47.080" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d been there and I worked.</div><div id="00:20:49.080" class="transcript_line"> And I was very happy.</div><div id="00:20:51.720" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d been there and I worked ever since.</div><div id="00:20:55.720" class="transcript_line"> Is that Lorna?</div><div id="00:20:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Carnegie, she&#039;s in the home now.</div><div id="00:20:59.720" class="transcript_line"> Slim, not Lorna.</div><div id="00:21:01.720" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking Robert&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:21:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Robert&#039;s Carnegie&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:21:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Elaine?</div><div id="00:21:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:21:09.720" class="transcript_line"> So I never knew because years ago we called each other Mrs. Carnegie.</div><div id="00:21:13.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I know.</div><div id="00:21:16.360" class="transcript_line"> So when I started working, I worked until I retired then.</div><div id="00:21:18.360" class="transcript_line"> And when I retired, I was lost.</div><div id="00:21:20.360" class="transcript_line"> And of course my husband died in the process.</div><div id="00:21:24.360" class="transcript_line"> So I thought what am I supposed to do now?</div><div id="00:21:26.360" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to work weekend.</div><div id="00:21:28.360" class="transcript_line"> If somebody wanted the time of New Year, I used to cover because the children then was</div><div id="00:21:32.360" class="transcript_line"> old enough to cook.</div><div id="00:21:34.360" class="transcript_line"> If you tell Andrew, I&#039;m going to cook.</div><div id="00:21:36.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to cook.</div><div id="00:21:38.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to cook.</div><div id="00:21:40.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to cook.</div><div id="00:21:42.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to cook.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If you tell Andrew, now he used to have a job to do if you ask him.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He had a job to do when I go to work.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So they all manage.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I could come home and finish off and we have dinner.</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to cover everybody who wanted time off because they had babies.</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So even Christmas and New Year I used to go.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only part time then.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And so when that happened and I retired, I&#039;d seen a friend of mine in PIL.</div><div id="00:22:13.640" class="transcript_line"> And she said to me, what are you doing now?</div><div id="00:22:15.640" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m checking the thing.</div><div id="00:22:17.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she said, come with me.</div><div id="00:22:19.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll show you where I go on Wednesday.</div><div id="00:22:23.640" class="transcript_line"> St. Mary&#039;s Hall.</div><div id="00:22:25.640" class="transcript_line"> And she introduced me to Roy.</div><div id="00:22:27.640" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Hillel was there.</div><div id="00:22:29.640" class="transcript_line"> And she said, do you know who that is?</div><div id="00:22:31.640" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, that&#039;s Andre&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:22:33.640" class="transcript_line"> You see, I can&#039;t go anywhere.</div><div id="00:22:35.640" class="transcript_line"> People don&#039;t see.</div><div id="00:22:37.640" class="transcript_line"> So they were, since then I just, I took to them and they took to me.</div><div id="00:22:42.280" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m still here now.</div><div id="00:22:44.280" class="transcript_line"> And he got me out of the house, take me places I haven&#039;t been.</div><div id="00:22:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Because we never had a chance to go anywhere when the kids were school.</div><div id="00:22:52.280" class="transcript_line"> And places even in England we haven&#039;t seen.</div><div id="00:22:56.280" class="transcript_line"> So now I&#039;ve got the opportunity to go around.</div><div id="00:23:00.280" class="transcript_line"> So what does that mean to you as well then?</div><div id="00:23:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Being able to see these places and now that you&#039;ve come?</div><div id="00:23:08.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very grateful because I didn&#039;t know those places existed.</div><div id="00:23:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Things I didn&#039;t do when I was young.</div><div id="00:23:14.920" class="transcript_line"> You know, coming here at such a young age.</div><div id="00:23:18.920" class="transcript_line"> And now I&#039;ve seen a bit of life, I think.</div><div id="00:23:22.920" class="transcript_line"> A bit of fun as well.</div><div id="00:23:24.920" class="transcript_line"> You know, when you&#039;re scooping a house, a housewife and go to work.</div><div id="00:23:28.920" class="transcript_line"> All you know is housework, feeding and going out as a family.</div><div id="00:23:32.920" class="transcript_line"> But never been out on my own or anything.</div><div id="00:23:34.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a new experience to me.</div><div id="00:23:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Being able to stand on my own feet now, see.</div><div id="00:23:41.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great to hear as well and to see how it factored into the fact that you said you had the household and working all that time.</div><div id="00:23:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t have that opportunity.</div><div id="00:23:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So now as it&#039;s come it&#039;s beautiful to see as well.</div><div id="00:23:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Was there one or two moments or events that stand out in each of your life?</div><div id="00:24:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;ve done Black History, we&#039;ve done, I&#039;ve done a play.</div><div id="00:24:06.200" class="transcript_line"> Roy, we&#039;ve done a couple of plays.</div><div id="00:24:10.200" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I would see one, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:12.200" class="transcript_line"> We love to see the, I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s got a video, we were on stage a couple of times, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:16.200" class="transcript_line"> How was that experience?</div><div id="00:24:18.200" class="transcript_line"> At first I thought I can&#039;t do it, I won&#039;t remember the lines.</div><div id="00:24:22.200" class="transcript_line"> So after we done it, it was okay.</div><div id="00:24:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Did you do it again?</div><div id="00:24:30.200" class="transcript_line"> I said to him, you know, I&#039;m going to see now, I won&#039;t remember everything.</div><div id="00:24:34.840" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve said a little bit actually, well quite a fair amount, but how do you think Age Alive supports Black Asian or other minority or majority of over 50s?</div><div id="00:24:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Age Alive has brought a lot of Caribbean people together and because we&#039;re diverse, any nationality comes in.</div><div id="00:24:57.480" class="transcript_line"> I think they learn a lot from the group, things they didn&#039;t do like me, they didn&#039;t know, they didn&#039;t have the opportunity to go out, like women only.</div><div id="00:25:09.480" class="transcript_line"> So I think it&#039;s done a great advantage for them all, yeah, they&#039;ve opened our eyes really.</div><div id="00:25:17.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s again fantastic to hear and to see these parts of the stories.</div><div id="00:25:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Within
