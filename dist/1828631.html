    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Pauline, would you be kind enough to just tell me where you were born and where you were?</div><div id="00:00:06.400" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Islington, yes, right in the middle of London.</div><div id="00:00:10.480" class="transcript_line"> But we moved fairly soon when I was, well my younger sister was born there, so we must have</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> been there at least four years. That&#039;s okay, so your parents did what? What did they do for a living?</div><div id="00:00:27.840" class="transcript_line"> My mother was from Edinburgh and my father was from London and he joined the RAF, but not</div><div id="00:00:39.520" class="transcript_line"> a young man, he was a cabinetmaker. But he was in the First World War, a sergeant,</div><div id="00:00:53.200" class="transcript_line"> and he was in the British Expeditionary Force that was sent over there before the war was declared.</div><div id="00:01:04.320" class="transcript_line"> And he said strangely enough there were men over there fixing Rolls Royce engines</div><div id="00:01:11.360" class="transcript_line"> to German planes and they were working when war was declared, but they had to finish it in order to</div><div id="00:01:19.920" class="transcript_line"> be paid. So you know, it&#039;s strange isn&#039;t it really? So this is at the beginning of the First World War?</div><div id="00:01:27.920" class="transcript_line"> No, this was the second book because he was on the reserve, and so he was in the British</div><div id="00:01:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Expeditionary Force and he didn&#039;t get back till after Dunkirk, we thought we&#039;d lost him,</div><div id="00:01:41.600" class="transcript_line"> and it turned out that they couldn&#039;t get to the beaches, so they were going south all the way</div><div id="00:01:49.600" class="transcript_line"> and they were traveling at night and hiding in the day in in orchards right through France,</div><div id="00:01:58.480" class="transcript_line"> and he managed to get back in rags. It took some while, I don&#039;t think we know how long it took</div><div id="00:02:07.280" class="transcript_line"> before he got back. I wish I&#039;d asked him, but you didn&#039;t think of it then. You&#039;re young, you&#039;re full</div><div id="00:02:11.920" class="transcript_line"> of your own life, and of course I was in the Air Force, so yes I wish I&#039;d asked him about it.</div><div id="00:02:20.960" class="transcript_line"> Did he remain in the, you know, as a member of the armed forces then throughout the war?</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Right, okay. So what did he do after he&#039;d come back?</div><div id="00:02:35.360" class="transcript_line"> Well he went back, he did a bit of work for different firms, but he had ill health</div><div id="00:02:45.600" class="transcript_line"> and he retired soon afterwards.</div><div id="00:02:54.480" class="transcript_line"> And so you were brought up in Islington?</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> No, I wasn&#039;t brought up before, so we moved to Hyham Road in Tottenham,</div><div id="00:03:05.680" class="transcript_line"> and a neighbor there was an arsenal player, Bob John, and I got friendly with his daughter, Joyce,</div><div id="00:03:15.360" class="transcript_line"> and he was ever such a nice man, Bob John, and we used to go, they lived about two or three</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> doors away from us in the same block of houses, and in those days I don&#039;t think they went and</div><div id="00:03:28.480" class="transcript_line"> trained like they do today. They used to train at home, and he was always skipping, and they had a</div><div id="00:03:33.920" class="transcript_line"> sort of a paved area at the back of the house, and we used to have our skipping ropes, and we all,</div><div id="00:03:41.440" class="transcript_line"> the three of us used to skip together, so, but then there was the recession. My father lost his job,</div><div id="00:03:50.800" class="transcript_line"> and my mother had to sell the house, it was always in her name, had to sell the house,</div><div id="00:03:56.480" class="transcript_line"> and we moved to Southgate, North London, and we lived there, and then the war came.</div><div id="00:04:05.440" class="transcript_line"> We had a landmine that landed at the side of us. We were a little joining road with two houses</div><div id="00:04:13.440" class="transcript_line"> either side of the road. It was a link road, but two long roads, and then</div><div id="00:04:19.600" class="transcript_line"> and then one day this landmine, I was actually on leave. When I used to go home,</div><div id="00:04:26.720" class="transcript_line"> the first thing I&#039;d do was have a hot bath, because it was, there were very difficult</div><div id="00:04:32.400" class="transcript_line"> circumstances there. That was when I would be at Horn Church, I think. You had to walk to the</div><div id="00:04:38.400" class="transcript_line"> bath house, quite a walk from where we were billeted, and you had to take your towel and that,</div><div id="00:04:45.920" class="transcript_line"> of course, there were never any plugs there, but we found that if we wrapped a handkerchief around</div><div id="00:04:50.320" class="transcript_line"> a penny, that worked as a plug, so you could have a bath, and of course nobody ever cleaned them.</div><div id="00:04:57.760" class="transcript_line"> So, but so of course as soon as I got home, I have a hot bath at home, and while I was in the bath,</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> this landmine landed on the link on the road that ran to the side, and a terrible crash, of course,</div><div id="00:05:20.080" class="transcript_line"> and it blew in, it blew in our front door, it smashed the side window, we had a side window</div><div id="00:05:27.200" class="transcript_line"> on the stairs, and my mother called out, and of course, no, we had put, couldn&#039;t put the lights</div><div id="00:05:33.840" class="transcript_line"> on, because the blackout had come down, and she said, be careful you come down, there&#039;s broken</div><div id="00:05:39.920" class="transcript_line"> glass on the stairs, so of course I wrapped the towel around me, and I managed to get down without</div><div id="00:05:46.480" class="transcript_line"> doing much of an injury of anything, and of course it wasn&#039;t till daylight, when we looked out,</div><div id="00:05:53.280" class="transcript_line"> because the front door was blown off, I don&#039;t know if it was blown off or blown in, I think it was just</div><div id="00:05:57.760" class="transcript_line"> blown in, and when we looked out, there were the row of houses at the side there, and it was like</div><div id="00:06:04.960" class="transcript_line"> a gap in a tooth, two of them had gone down, one of them was the men were at war, it was just the</div><div id="00:06:14.080" class="transcript_line"> wife, and I think it was just one child, and they&#039;d taken cover under a thick oak table,</div><div id="00:06:23.040" class="transcript_line"> and they survived, the whole house had collapsed on them, but they survived, but the couple on the</div><div id="00:06:29.200" class="transcript_line"> next house, oh I don&#039;t know how many there were there, they didn&#039;t, so yes that was a bit of a shock.</div><div id="00:06:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but you left school and you became a draft woman, is that correct?</div><div id="00:06:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Well I was working to begin, before the war started, or had it just started,</div><div id="00:06:56.960" class="transcript_line"> at standard telephones and cables, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve heard of the firm, and of course in those</div><div id="00:07:03.840" class="transcript_line"> days you had lots of tracers, it was a building, the whole top floor, at one end there were the</div><div id="00:07:12.800" class="transcript_line"> draftsmen, and at the other end the tracers, there must have been about 20 tracers, and of course</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> the idea of course was that we would trace the drawings and do all the printing, because</div><div id="00:07:28.720" class="transcript_line"> it was almost illegible their printing, so we had to make a really decent job that then could be</div><div id="00:07:34.960" class="transcript_line"> copied and sent to the workshop or whoever was going to make something, and of course we were</div><div id="00:07:41.600" class="transcript_line"> on war work then, it must have been the war it started, and because I know I was working on</div><div id="00:07:50.960" class="transcript_line"> air conditioning for a warship, well of course the draftsmen as I say, although it was a risk</div><div id="00:08:00.800" class="transcript_line"> they could stay, but they were joining up, you know they felt they had to go and do their bit,</div><div id="00:08:06.240" class="transcript_line"> so of course they were losing all their draftsmen, so they chose five or six of us,</div><div id="00:08:13.840" class="transcript_line"> the better tracers as they put it, and we were being taught draftsmanship, well</div><div id="00:08:27.440" class="transcript_line"> I got well into the course, I hadn&#039;t quite finished it, and then my husband who was in the Air Force,</div><div id="00:08:34.400" class="transcript_line"> he came home on leave because he was going abroad, what should they call it,</div><div id="00:08:45.840" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a name for it, but anyway, so he had a fortnight&#039;s embarkation leave, that was it,</div><div id="00:08:57.120" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it, so I asked if I could take my, that was around about February I think, no January,</div><div id="00:09:07.120" class="transcript_line"> I know it was in the middle of winter, so is this 1941 perhaps, or? 1942, beginning of 1942,</div><div id="00:09:17.600" class="transcript_line"> and I asked if I could take my summer leave, you know to spend it with him, and it was refused,</div><div id="00:09:27.520" class="transcript_line"> so I took it anyway, and when I went back I was given the sack, so unbeknown to me,</div><div id="00:09:35.120" class="transcript_line"> the other draftsmen that were there took it up with the Union, I didn&#039;t even know that I could</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> do anything like that, so they took it up with the Union, and I had to go before a panel of elderly</div><div id="00:09:50.880" class="transcript_line"> men, very sympathetic, you know, that my, we&#039;d just got engaged actually, so my fiance,</div><div id="00:09:58.800" class="transcript_line"> all the story you know, and they decided that it was unfair, dismissal, and I could go back,</div><div id="00:10:06.560" class="transcript_line"> but in the meantime I&#039;d got myself a job at COSAS as a draftswoman, they were just grateful to get</div><div id="00:10:14.640" class="transcript_line"> anybody who had any idea, but I wasn&#039;t allowed to take it, because then I was conscripted,</div><div id="00:10:23.760" class="transcript_line"> I was kept waiting I think for five weeks until my conscription came through,</div><div id="00:10:32.800" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s how I went into the Air Force, looking back though, it was such an interesting time,</div><div id="00:10:39.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m glad I did go into the Air Force, because I found it was so interesting, I was very lucky.</div><div id="00:10:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Your fiance at that stage, he was aircrew?</div><div id="00:10:54.240" class="transcript_line"> No, he wasn&#039;t, he volunteered, but he was signals, he used to, he had to learn Morse code,</div><div id="00:11:01.680" class="transcript_line"> and he used to listen out and take down, you know, from the Germans and that sort of thing,</div><div id="00:11:08.400" class="transcript_line"> take down and then of course somebody else.</div><div id="00:11:10.400" class="transcript_line"> So he was a ciphers officer?</div><div id="00:11:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well yeah, and after three and a half years he got leave, he came home for a fortnight,</div><div id="00:11:24.160" class="transcript_line"> we got married, special licence, and then he went back to Egypt, he was in Egypt,</div><div id="00:11:32.160" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d been all over the place, Mold, Thuron, Sicily, anyway.</div><div id="00:11:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:11:40.260" class="transcript_line"> So that was that.</div><div id="00:11:42.800" class="transcript_line"> So you entered the RAF, you presumably were posted somewhere for basic training?</div><div id="00:11:52.800" class="transcript_line"> As a plotter.</div><div id="00:11:54.960" class="transcript_line"> But you were posted for some initial sort of basic training first of all?</div><div id="00:12:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, Innsworth I think it was, where we used to go, it was an enormous, you were</div><div id="00:12:06.800" class="transcript_line"> kitted out with your uniform there, and then you were interviewed to see what sort of work</div><div id="00:12:12.480" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d be suitable for, and they decided I&#039;d be a plotter. So I was doing that for about,</div><div id="00:12:24.160" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, six months, but a while anyway, and that was at Horn Church,</div><div id="00:12:29.760" class="transcript_line"> and we had a draftsman there who had his own office, and he was mad on table tennis,</div><div id="00:12:38.480" class="transcript_line"> and there was a table there for quiet times or rest times, and he just wanted to play table tennis.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He was there, and of course it must have been on my papers that I&#039;d had drawing office training,</div><div id="00:12:56.560" class="transcript_line"> so I was approached and said, would I like to be his assistant in the drawing office?</div><div id="00:13:03.280" class="transcript_line"> So I said, well yes, you know, it sounded interesting because I always enjoyed drawing.</div><div id="00:13:09.200" class="transcript_line"> So I was there for about a week or a fortnight, I can&#039;t be sure now, and he was posted overseas.</div><div id="00:13:17.520" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to get rid of him because he was never there, he was always playing table.</div><div id="00:13:22.480" class="transcript_line"> So of course I had my own little drawing office all to myself.</div><div id="00:13:28.240" class="transcript_line"> So he had a good wall.</div><div id="00:13:29.920" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what happened to him. I really don&#039;t know whether he survived,</div><div id="00:13:35.120" class="transcript_line"> but I suppose he annoyed them because he was never in the office, and of course I did all the work</div><div id="00:13:41.760" class="transcript_line"> that came in that was painting the plaques that used to go around the ops room, hung on a rail</div><div id="00:13:50.640" class="transcript_line"> that went round, and all the different squadrons that came, you had to put the number, you know,</div><div id="00:13:57.040" class="transcript_line"> 321 or whatever it was, and of course they were always changing, so that meant repainting them,</div><div id="00:14:04.400" class="transcript_line"> and then they decided that, because I mean, I did my best, but they varied, they weren&#039;t always the</div><div id="00:14:13.120" class="transcript_line"> same figures, so I had to make templates, draw them out, and then they were sent over to the</div><div id="00:14:20.320" class="transcript_line"> workshop and they made them, so I had them, the stencils, so they all looked identical with the</div><div id="00:14:27.440" class="transcript_line"> figures. That was one thing, and then of course, because when I was at Horn Church,</div><div id="00:14:34.560" class="transcript_line"> they decided they wanted a bigger plotting table because it only covered a smaller area,</div><div id="00:14:40.880" class="transcript_line"> and so I had to make the,</div><div id="00:14:47.920" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve built it at Horn Church, and then there was a coach that used to drive us in, the different</div><div id="00:14:53.840" class="transcript_line"> crews, into Romford, and at the back there, there was a very big building that had belonged</div><div id="00:15:04.720" class="transcript_line"> to, well, it would come to me later on, and so I spent ages making this bigger table, I know it</div><div id="00:15:19.760" class="transcript_line"> it came from the wash down, it just included the Isle of Wight, and it took me ages to do,</div><div id="00:15:29.920" class="transcript_line"> and then almost as soon as I&#039;d finished it, they decided to close Horn Church,</div><div id="00:15:33.920" class="transcript_line"> and we were all moved to North Wales, but of course, I was in the drawing office there,</div><div id="00:15:41.040" class="transcript_line"> we were at Blake Hall, which was a lovely country house, away from the</div><div id="00:15:47.520" class="transcript_line"> airfield for obvious reasons, it looked like a sort of farm, it was a big building,</div><div id="00:15:57.200" class="transcript_line"> and I had one of the front bedrooms as my drawing office, which was very nice, and it had a sink in</div><div id="00:16:07.040" class="transcript_line"> it for washing my instruments and things, so that&#039;s where I stayed until the end of the war, at Blake</div><div id="00:16:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Hall. I mean, when you were at Horn Church, and indeed at North Wales, I mean, those were very</div><div id="00:16:24.960" class="transcript_line"> active fighter stations, both of them, and we had our mess right on the edge of the airfield,</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and we could see the planes going off, and very often we&#039;d stay there, this was when I was a</div><div id="00:16:41.840" class="transcript_line"> plotter, we&#039;d stay there and try and count them as they came back, and you know, so often they</div><div id="00:16:47.760" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t all come back, it was very upsetting, and of course you&#039;ve got to know them, some of the pilots,</div><div id="00:16:59.760" class="transcript_line"> yes, and can you remember the squadrons that were there? I can&#039;t, there were so many of them,</div><div id="00:17:04.880" class="transcript_line"> because they were always changing, we had a Polish one, I know we had a Polish, all Polish,</div><div id="00:17:11.280" class="transcript_line"> now that&#039;s an interesting story, because all the Poles were tall and slender and quite elegant,</div><div id="00:17:18.880" class="transcript_line"> they always liked to press their uniforms a certain way, very particular. Now when I was at</div><div id="00:17:29.920" class="transcript_line"> North Wales, getting towards the end of the war,</div><div id="00:17:34.560" class="transcript_line"> we had, they&#039;d been rescued, there were a lot of Polish girls, and they,</div><div id="00:17:41.760" class="transcript_line"> I feel uncomfortable saying this, but they were the peasant type, nothing like the men, the pilots,</div><div id="00:17:49.120" class="transcript_line"> they were all about five foot tall and about five foot wide, like peas out of a pod, and they had come,</div><div id="00:17:57.680" class="transcript_line"> because they didn&#039;t know any English, and they were in the mess, the dining room,</div><div id="00:18:03.680" class="transcript_line"> and because they didn&#039;t know anything, they didn&#039;t know what to do, and I tried to be helpful,</div><div id="00:18:09.440" class="transcript_line"> I got my schoolgirl French, which wasn&#039;t much use, but at least I was trying to help them,</div><div id="00:18:18.320" class="transcript_line"> and they were so grateful, and sort of almost sign language, would I visit them that evening,</div><div id="00:18:25.200" class="transcript_line"> when we were all off duty, and it was suburb time, I remember, lovely sunny day, and we had,</div><div id="00:18:35.120" class="transcript_line"> we were in these long huts, an entrance, both ends, and we, all ours, were in what was called</div><div id="00:18:46.960" class="transcript_line"> the rookery, because there were trees there, it was all disguised really, because the rocks</div><div id="00:18:54.560" class="transcript_line"> used to nest in the tops of the trees, so where we were, were called the rookery, well I went to</div><div id="00:19:01.440" class="transcript_line"> their huts, and as I say, there was an entrance at both ends, and I was knocking on the door,</div><div id="00:19:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I could hear chatter going inside, so I knew they were all there, and I tried to push the door,</div><div id="00:19:15.680" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t open, and I was bagging away at it, and suddenly one of the girls came out, oh no,</div><div id="00:19:24.160" class="transcript_line"> it took me to the other door, they&#039;ve got a shrine built at the end there, and I was near,</div><div id="00:19:29.040" class="transcript_line"> I almost knocked it down, but you know what, they didn&#039;t wear their shoes inside,</div><div id="00:19:36.720" class="transcript_line"> they were stocking feet, and the lino, it was that thick brown lino, it was like glass,</div><div id="00:19:44.160" class="transcript_line"> it was polished, I&#039;ve never seen nothing like in our huts, and they were so friendly, they were</div><div id="00:19:52.560" class="transcript_line"> lovely girls, but we were trying to sign language in a way, but of course unfortunately,</div><div id="00:20:02.560" class="transcript_line"> all they could do was clean, because they used to clean all the latrines for the Germans,</div><div id="00:20:08.320" class="transcript_line"> when they were prisoners there, so that was all they could do, which I felt so sorry for them.</div><div id="00:20:16.480" class="transcript_line"> Now you also contributed to Air Sea Rescue.</div><div id="00:20:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:20:26.240" class="transcript_line"> So can you tell us about that please?</div><div id="00:20:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Well that started off by the magazine that John Armstrong brought me to read, and then it was an</div><div id="00:20:42.880" class="transcript_line"> article about Air Sea Rescue, and it was primitive, it was in the early days,</div><div id="00:20:49.600" class="transcript_line"> so I, because I had already done my stint, because I had a squadron leader come, I think they,</div><div id="00:20:59.440" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d heard that I&#039;d made the plotting table, so I was used to doing tables, and he came and</div><div id="00:21:09.200" class="transcript_line"> interviewed me, and said the sort of thing that they needed, explain what was wanted,</div><div id="00:21:16.320" class="transcript_line"> and could, I think I could do it. I said well I have a go, and it took me ages, because</div><div id="00:21:23.840" class="transcript_line"> there had to be a table for the North Sea, and another one for the English Channel,</div><div id="00:21:30.320" class="transcript_line"> and you had to, it consisted of, there were several, I can&#039;t remember the names now of these</div><div id="00:21:39.520" class="transcript_line"> stations, dotted around the 11 Group, it was all 11 Group, and they were different colours,</div><div id="00:21:51.440" class="transcript_line"> red, blue, green and black, and I had to calibrate each one,</div><div id="00:22:02.960" class="transcript_line"> the four of them, all round this table, it was a large table, oval, and it had, it was thick rubber,</div><div id="00:22:13.120" class="transcript_line"> and the paint was cellulose, it was actually called salamal at the time, that was the makers of it,</div><div id="00:22:21.760" class="transcript_line"> and it had to be calibrated, all the degrees, all the way round, and of course each one had to be</div><div id="00:22:28.160" class="transcript_line"> calibrated differently, and then if a signal came from a downed pilot, it could be picked up by</div><div id="00:22:40.800" class="transcript_line"> several of these stations inland, and then it was done by triangulation, you know, they all</div><div id="00:22:50.080" class="transcript_line"> came together, or went out together, until you pinpointed where the downed plane was,</div><div id="00:22:56.880" class="transcript_line"> so they were, I had to take them down to Swingate near Dover, and they were positioned in the</div><div id="00:23:04.320" class="transcript_line"> control tower at Swingate, and they were very successful, because after a while I had to go</div><div id="00:23:12.640" class="transcript_line"> back and touch up the paint, the paint was wearing off because of the wear, so they were</div><div id="00:23:18.720" class="transcript_line"> very successful, so it must have saved a lot of lives. Indeed, indeed, yes. So well. You have</div><div id="00:23:28.320" class="transcript_line"> weighted strings as well. Oh yes, yes, that&#039;s right, because there were holes drilled through</div><div id="00:23:34.320" class="transcript_line"> these stations inland, and it was called a mouse for the general shape of it.</div><div id="00:23:45.840" class="transcript_line"> It was lead heavy, so it would drop through, and because there was another thing that held it on</div><div id="00:23:51.040" class="transcript_line"> the top, and then of course that&#039;s when they got the signal through, they&#039;d pull it out,</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and that was where it crossed over the sea, that would pinpoint where the plane had gone down,</div><div id="00:24:04.320" class="transcript_line"> or whatever. Yes, it actually reminded me of Rod. So this would have been about 1944,</div><div id="00:24:12.960" class="transcript_line"> 45, towards the end of the war. It would be 43 possibly. 43, oh gosh, there was a lot of</div><div id="00:24:23.120" class="transcript_line"> activity. It might have been later, you know, and of course you dare not record anything, you know,</div><div id="00:24:30.720" class="transcript_line"> because it was treated with suspicion if you were making notes of anything,</div><div id="00:24:34.880" class="transcript_line"> and it was only a need to know sort of business.</div><div id="00:24:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. Now you mentioned earlier on that you had designs to become a pilot yourself.</div><div id="00:24:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that was towards the end of the war. Right.</div><div id="00:24:53.520" class="transcript_line"> But having passed the medical and the interview, the war was coming to an end, so</div><div id="00:25:01.520" class="transcript_line"> as I said, my son said, what a good job, I didn&#039;t get it because I&#039;ve got no sense of direction.</div><div id="00:25:07.840" class="transcript_line"> All right, wonderful. So when did you finish with the RAF? When were you demobbed?</div><div id="00:25:22.240" class="transcript_line"> When my husband came home, I applied to be demobbed, and we&#039;ve been very happy down here.</div><div id="00:25:37.120" class="transcript_line"> So you moved here, it sounds as if it was about 40 years ago, about 35, 37 years you&#039;ve been here?</div><div id="00:25:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, something like that, for a long time. Yes, on VE Day we were all confined to camp</div><div id="00:25:55.760" class="transcript_line"> because they were concerned that there might be a last attempt for the German, the Luftwaffe,</div><div id="00:26:04.240" class="transcript_line"> to fly over and put all their bombs on, as the last gesture I suppose. So we were confined to camp.</div><div id="00:26:12.400" class="transcript_line"> When I wrote a letter which was printed in the radio times,</div><div id="00:26:19.360" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve still got the letter, I can show it to you, a girl got in touch with me, she was in the</div><div id="00:26:28.720" class="transcript_line"> army, but we had a small contingent of army there, because when our guns were firing they wanted to</div><div id="00:26:36.240" class="transcript_line"> know where we were, where we were firing, so we had a small contingent of army there. And</div><div id="00:26:45.280" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;d read my letter and she wrote, read my article in the radio times, and there was enough</div><div id="00:26:54.480" class="transcript_line"> of my address for her to contact me, she sent me a letter and she said I remember that,</div><div id="00:27:01.280" class="transcript_line"> us being confined to camp, because I mean a lot of people wouldn&#039;t believe it,</div><div id="00:27:06.160" class="transcript_line"> VE Day everybody was out celebrating and we were confined to camp.</div></div></p>
