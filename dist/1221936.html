    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And in July 66, I went on Ulpan to improve my Hebrew in Jerusalem.</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> There I met my wife, Aggy, who was a pupil in the same class as me, a student in the same class.</div><div id="00:00:16.880" class="transcript_line"> So that was 66. That was a five-month intensive Ulpan course.</div><div id="00:00:23.960" class="transcript_line"> And we graduated together in December.</div><div id="00:00:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And I was obliged by Gluckman to study an immigrant village.</div><div id="00:00:35.840" class="transcript_line"> So we put our heads together, Aggy and I, and decided that we would try and find a village.</div><div id="00:00:45.040" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t easy. People didn&#039;t want to accept. You&#039;re poking your nose around.</div><div id="00:00:48.680" class="transcript_line"> And some villages we didn&#039;t want to live in, even if they would accept us.</div><div id="00:00:52.880" class="transcript_line"> But with Aggy&#039;s languages, Hungarian and Romanian, and now Hebrew,</div><div id="00:00:57.840" class="transcript_line"> and I had French and Spanish and Hebrew,</div><div id="00:01:01.880" class="transcript_line"> we decided to look for a village not too far from where her parents lived,</div><div id="00:01:07.400" class="transcript_line"> which was in Ramley, new immigrant housing, very modest housing.</div><div id="00:01:12.240" class="transcript_line"> And we chose a village if they would have us on the border.</div><div id="00:01:18.160" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to see what the impact of living on the border was.</div><div id="00:01:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And if it was possible, a multi-ethnic village with Jews from different countries.</div><div id="00:01:27.400" class="transcript_line"> And we found one.</div><div id="00:01:29.640" class="transcript_line"> And the two dominant languages in this village were Hungarian and Romanian.</div><div id="00:01:36.360" class="transcript_line"> And Aggy&#039;s charm with the village administrator certainly facilitated entry.</div><div id="00:01:44.880" class="transcript_line"> And so in January, 67,</div><div id="00:01:52.480" class="transcript_line"> I entered the village and rented a room from a Romanian landlady</div><div id="00:01:58.520" class="transcript_line"> whose son was a powerful local politician.</div><div id="00:02:03.280" class="transcript_line"> And we got married in April 67,</div><div id="00:02:09.040" class="transcript_line"> which was five days before the outbreak of the Six-Day War.</div><div id="00:02:14.360" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve integrated quite nicely.</div><div id="00:02:18.640" class="transcript_line"> People were beginning to...</div><div id="00:02:19.600" class="transcript_line"> They were suspicious of me as an Englishman,</div><div id="00:02:22.520" class="transcript_line"> and what&#039;s he doing walking around the border, which I did,</div><div id="00:02:25.800" class="transcript_line"> and looking around the terrain.</div><div id="00:02:28.040" class="transcript_line"> They took some time before they accepted.</div><div id="00:02:29.840" class="transcript_line"> But the key factor in our being accepted was the outbreak of the Six-Day War.</div><div id="00:02:37.680" class="transcript_line"> In late May, I received a letter from the British Embassy, which I registered with,</div><div id="00:02:44.880" class="transcript_line"> to say that we can&#039;t guarantee your safety.</div><div id="00:02:47.480" class="transcript_line"> You choose to stay at your own peril.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, all the villagers knew this</div><div id="00:02:52.520" class="transcript_line"> because the post was distributed around a tree in the village.</div><div id="00:02:57.640" class="transcript_line"> And the mobile post office threw a pile of letters onto the ground.</div><div id="00:03:02.240" class="transcript_line"> And they could see, they could read, the British Embassy on the front.</div><div id="00:03:07.280" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, I suppose you&#039;ll be going, won&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:09.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;d survivors of the Holocaust.</div><div id="00:03:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Many of them had tattoos on their arm.</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> First time I&#039;d seen a tattoo on a number on a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust.</div><div id="00:03:21.320" class="transcript_line"> And Aghi and I discussed it.</div><div id="00:03:22.640" class="transcript_line"> We had no children, so it was an easier decision.</div><div id="00:03:26.600" class="transcript_line"> And we said, no, we&#039;re staying.</div><div id="00:03:29.520" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re staying on the border.</div><div id="00:03:33.640" class="transcript_line"> I have written about this in my book on the village and the state.</div><div id="00:03:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t want to go over it all again.</div><div id="00:03:40.720" class="transcript_line"> But we stayed, and I was given a job.</div><div id="00:03:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Of course, the men, the able-bodied men, were mobilized into the reserve army.</div><div id="00:03:48.680" class="transcript_line"> And quite a few of the younger boys in the village with whom I played football</div><div id="00:03:54.600" class="transcript_line"> said, why aren&#039;t you in the army, the Israeli army?</div><div id="00:03:56.800" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, I&#039;m a British citizen.</div><div id="00:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a Jew, but I&#039;m not an Israeli citizen.</div><div id="00:04:01.960" class="transcript_line"> So I was trained to be the village dairyman.</div></div></p>
