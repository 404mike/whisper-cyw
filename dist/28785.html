    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardigan Bay wasn&#039;t always an inland sea. Legend speaks of a rich and fertile land,</div><div id="00:00:10.200" class="transcript_line"> so fertile that one acre there was said to be worth four elsewhere. This land was called</div><div id="00:00:15.960" class="transcript_line"> Micegwydno, the land of Gwydno Garanhir, part of the kingdom of Merionydd. It stretched</div><div id="00:00:22.880" class="transcript_line"> some twenty miles west of the current shoreline. It was also known as Cantrer Gwaelod, the</div><div id="00:00:28.600" class="transcript_line"> lower hundredth, a hundredth being an early measurement of land, and lower referring to</div><div id="00:00:33.960" class="transcript_line"> the fact that it was land that lay beneath the level of the sea. It was protected by</div><div id="00:00:39.600" class="transcript_line"> a great wall that was punctuated at river mouths by sluice gates that would let tides</div><div id="00:00:45.040" class="transcript_line"> in and out of estuaries, but keep the encroaching sea from the fertile arable lands.</div><div id="00:00:52.400" class="transcript_line"> There are a number of versions of the story. It is first mentioned in the thirteenth century</div><div id="00:00:57.100" class="transcript_line"> book known as the Black Book of Cymardin. This is a collection of poems and much older material</div><div id="00:01:02.780" class="transcript_line"> relating to events that had taken place centuries before. Included is a poem called Bothi Micegwydno,</div><div id="00:01:10.220" class="transcript_line"> the drowning of Gwydno&#039;s land. It is one of the finest examples of medieval Welsh poetry.</div><div id="00:01:16.860" class="transcript_line"> Today, the Black Book of Cymardin is kept in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth,</div><div id="00:01:23.700" class="transcript_line"> along with many other ancient Welsh texts and contemporary collections of writing. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:28.580" class="transcript_line"> well worth a visit. There have been many versions of the story down the ages, but the most enduring</div><div id="00:01:35.060" class="transcript_line"> tells of how Saithenyn, the man responsible for maintaining the sea defences, fell in</div><div id="00:01:40.300" class="transcript_line"> love with Gwydnogarán hir&#039;s daughter Mereyrydd. At her wedding to another man, Saithenyn became</div><div id="00:01:47.740" class="transcript_line"> drunk and forgot to close the sea gates. When a storm whipped up, there was nobody</div><div id="00:01:53.380" class="transcript_line"> to raise the alarm. The sixteen villages of Cantergwaelod were swallowed whole by the</div><div id="00:01:58.980" class="transcript_line"> waves. Some say that Gwydnogarán and a few of his men made it to safety. One version</div><div id="00:02:04.820" class="transcript_line"> says that Saithenyn&#039;s seven sons devoted themselves to God in reparation for their</div><div id="00:02:09.820" class="transcript_line"> father&#039;s actions, one of those sons being St Tidner, one of our early Celtic saints.</div><div id="00:02:17.740" class="transcript_line"> The legend has inspired a number of poems and songs, including a well-known 19th century</div><div id="00:02:22.580" class="transcript_line"> air, the Bells of Aberdwyfi, which has become a standard amongst many Welsh choirs. When</div><div id="00:02:29.540" class="transcript_line"> the tide is low, very low, part of the ancient woodlands of Cantergwaelod can still be seen,</div><div id="00:02:37.340" class="transcript_line"> and locals will tell you that when a gale stirs far out in the Irish sea, the bells</div><div id="00:02:43.220" class="transcript_line"> of Cantergwaelod can be heard ringing in the tide, warning those on shore of the coming</div><div id="00:02:50.180" class="transcript_line"> storm.</div></div></p>
