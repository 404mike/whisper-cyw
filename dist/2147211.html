Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:03:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, you got a week&#039;s notice.</div><div id="00:03:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you say you can&#039;t do that. I said, oh, yes, I can.</div><div id="00:03:30.040" class="transcript_line"> He was the only tool maker in the place.</div><div id="00:03:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, when you talk of tools,</div><div id="00:03:34.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m making tools bigger than the television in there and smaller than that cup here.</div><div id="00:03:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Massive.</div><div id="00:03:43.040" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, when I make big tools, the lorry comes for them, take it up to the place.</div><div id="00:03:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And then the next day I drive up there because they actually, I have my own car,</div><div id="00:03:53.040" class="transcript_line"> but they actually bought me a van.</div><div id="00:03:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Company bought me a brand new van and every three years they changed it.</div><div id="00:04:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And I keep that van 24 sevens.</div><div id="00:04:03.040" class="transcript_line"> So I got my car park up on the van.</div><div id="00:04:08.040" class="transcript_line"> And I went in and I said, right, I&#039;m not working for the Simon Eager.</div><div id="00:04:14.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, either you do something or I&#039;m off.</div><div id="00:04:16.040" class="transcript_line"> And he thought I was bluffing.</div><div id="00:04:20.040" class="transcript_line"> So I got week notice that lasts for three months.</div><div id="00:04:23.040" class="transcript_line"> And he thought I would stop there because there was some jobs I have to finish off myself.</div><div id="00:04:29.040" class="transcript_line"> And then after three months, I packed my tools, take them home in the van,</div><div id="00:04:33.040" class="transcript_line"> take everything home and bring the van back the morning and say, ta-da, gone.</div><div id="00:04:39.040" class="transcript_line"> So after a while, I said, my daughter then, my youngest daughter,</div><div id="00:04:45.040" class="transcript_line"> at that time I had three daughters.</div><div id="00:04:49.040" class="transcript_line"> And she had a flat and she was in a little bit of trouble with it.</div><div id="00:04:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So I said, two bedroom flat.</div><div id="00:04:55.040" class="transcript_line"> So I said, I&#039;m moving with you and sort you out and then I&#039;ll go.</div><div id="00:05:00.040" class="transcript_line"> So I done that for about eight months, put her on top.</div><div id="00:05:05.040" class="transcript_line"> So I said, no, you can manage now.</div><div id="00:05:08.040" class="transcript_line"> So you know Jim down there, you still live down there.</div><div id="00:05:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I found him for the two first cousins.</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I said to him, I said, right, I want to come down for a couple of weeks.</div><div id="00:05:18.040" class="transcript_line"> And a couple of weeks, probably about 20 years.</div><div id="00:05:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I found we bought this house, me and Val.</div><div id="00:05:26.040" class="transcript_line"> We live here for 14 years.</div><div id="00:05:29.040" class="transcript_line"> So I live with Jim for about a couple of years.</div><div id="00:05:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Then I live with Bassett for about four years.</div><div id="00:05:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Then we moved and bought this house.</div><div id="00:05:37.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="00:05:39.040" class="transcript_line"> So you know, when I come down here, the first job I went to,</div><div id="00:05:44.040" class="transcript_line"> he said, when can you start?</div><div id="00:05:46.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, have I got a job then?</div><div id="00:05:49.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, skill like yours, we&#039;ve been looking for it.</div><div id="00:05:52.040" class="transcript_line"> So I started and it&#039;s a place in Cumbrian,</div><div id="00:05:55.040" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got airplanes, you know, you can&#039;t tow seatings at the time.</div><div id="00:05:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And then he got me a job.</div><div id="00:06:01.040" class="transcript_line"> I think at the moment, you&#039;ve got Saffron.</div><div id="00:06:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for, ooh.</div><div id="00:06:11.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only place I worked then, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:13.040" class="transcript_line"> So we live here 14 years.</div><div id="00:06:15.040" class="transcript_line"> Bassett, probably about four.</div><div id="00:06:19.040" class="transcript_line"> And I got a job when I lived with Jim, so four and four.</div><div id="00:06:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for about a year.</div><div id="00:06:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I moved to the next place.</div><div id="00:06:27.040" class="transcript_line"> I got a job when I lived with Jim, so four and four.</div><div id="00:06:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for, right up from about, I can&#039;t tell you the year.</div><div id="00:06:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the year when I started there.</div><div id="00:06:41.040" class="transcript_line"> But I worked there for about at least 16, 17 years.</div><div id="00:06:46.040" class="transcript_line"> I worked there.</div><div id="00:06:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And then after I retired, I said, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:06:51.040" class="transcript_line"> I done six months over.</div><div id="00:06:54.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m going to do 12 months.</div><div id="00:06:56.040" class="transcript_line"> And then we went on holiday and come back.</div><div id="00:07:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And there was a letter from my doctor, which is then going around there.</div><div id="00:07:07.040" class="transcript_line"> At least very surgery.</div><div id="00:07:09.040" class="transcript_line"> And he says, I have to come in the office.</div><div id="00:07:11.040" class="transcript_line"> So we were going, he said, oh, we&#039;re calling for a flu job.</div><div id="00:07:15.040" class="transcript_line"> So I said, I never take it in my life.</div><div id="00:07:17.040" class="transcript_line"> So why should I take it now?</div><div id="00:07:19.040" class="transcript_line"> So he said, well, since we got it, might as well take it.</div><div id="00:07:22.040" class="transcript_line"> We want another one.</div><div id="00:07:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, I don&#039;t want it.</div><div id="00:07:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And they actually talked me into it.</div><div id="00:07:27.040" class="transcript_line"> So I took the flu job the Friday and Saturday morning I get up with Gout.</div><div id="00:07:33.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I decided to pack up work there.</div><div id="00:07:36.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, I could move.</div><div id="00:07:40.040" class="transcript_line"> And I never feel pain like that in my life.</div><div id="00:07:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:07:46.040" class="transcript_line"> They just packed up.</div><div id="00:07:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And then a few of the next, I think two girls from the office came down here to see me because I couldn&#039;t move.</div><div id="00:07:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And they said, right, we can give it, you know, see if it works.</div><div id="00:08:06.040" class="transcript_line"> And they said, I don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll be any better to come back to work.</div><div id="00:08:12.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, well, we come down here to give you an option.</div><div id="00:08:16.040" class="transcript_line"> You can have redundants with full paid.</div><div id="00:08:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, that&#039;s fair enough.</div><div id="00:08:22.040" class="transcript_line"> So I took that.</div><div id="00:08:25.040" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, I mean, I still go up there sometimes and see the lads and have a chat with them.</div><div id="00:08:31.040" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that, I meet a lot of people down here, different function and things like that.</div><div id="00:08:38.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I meet your dad, your granddad.</div><div id="00:08:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And we met and then, you know, both of us, we just get it off just like that.</div><div id="00:08:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And they were chatting, talking, saying, if he goes, then he&#039;s going out anyway.</div><div id="00:08:56.040" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes I don&#039;t know if he tells you, but sometimes we phone up each other and say, what are you doing?</div><div id="00:09:02.040" class="transcript_line"> And he said, nothing much.</div><div id="00:09:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, OK, then shall we have tea or lunch or something like that?</div><div id="00:09:08.040" class="transcript_line"> Most of the time we go to Tesco and Cardiff Road.</div><div id="00:09:11.040" class="transcript_line"> We go in there, if I choose, you know, I mean, I drive up there, park in Tesco&#039;s car park.</div><div id="00:09:17.040" class="transcript_line"> And then we go in Tesco and we have lunch and sit there and have a good chat.</div><div id="00:09:22.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I took him home and drive him home.</div><div id="00:09:25.040" class="transcript_line"> So everywhere we go, he said, I&#039;ll take a taxi.</div><div id="00:09:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, I&#039;ll drive you home.</div><div id="00:09:32.040" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember about your childhood in the Caribbean, growing up in the Caribbean?</div><div id="00:09:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fun.</div><div id="00:09:44.040" class="transcript_line"> And lots of it.</div><div id="00:09:46.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to have different seasons where we have different games.</div><div id="00:09:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes, you know, I mean, I can&#039;t tell you what season it is, but I know it&#039;s in the summer.</div><div id="00:09:55.040" class="transcript_line"> You have like kite where you make your own kite and sail it in the air.</div><div id="00:09:59.040" class="transcript_line"> What we used to do as lads, we used to get razor blade and we get like a piece of bamboo, split it,</div><div id="00:10:10.040" class="transcript_line"> and then put the razor blade in to push one side of the razor blade in there and tie the razor blade.</div><div id="00:10:17.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, you know, where the razor blade comes in.</div><div id="00:10:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Tie it around with strings and then put it on your kite string.</div><div id="00:10:23.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, they call it the tie like they call it.</div><div id="00:10:26.040" class="transcript_line"> The tail of the kite, not the string was standing up, the tail of it.</div><div id="00:10:30.040" class="transcript_line"> The tail, so to keep the kite balanced in the air.</div><div id="00:10:34.040" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go kite hunting, you know, go sailing up like I live down, we call down there, Lincoln.</div><div id="00:10:41.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to go take the kite up to Summer Hill to sail with the razor blade and it, you see.</div><div id="00:10:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So when all the kites came out, we put a short list on our kite, a short string on our kite.</div><div id="00:10:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So it wouldn&#039;t go too far and then pull it up against the head and then when the tail comes up,</div><div id="00:10:59.040" class="transcript_line"> the razor blade would slip the cord and we have men over there, boys over there, side.</div><div id="00:11:05.040" class="transcript_line"> We give them back the kite, but we keep the cord.</div><div id="00:11:12.040" class="transcript_line"> At the end of the season, I probably have a bowl, you know, made about that long and about that long.</div><div id="00:11:19.040" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not just us doing it.</div><div id="00:11:22.040" class="transcript_line"> They do it to somebody else, somewhere else.</div><div id="00:11:26.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all over the district, all over the island, all over the parish, you know, different things.</div><div id="00:11:35.040" class="transcript_line"> But we all make a joke of it and then at the end of it, we laugh and say, who&#039;s got the biggest bong?</div><div id="00:11:41.040" class="transcript_line"> We have fun, then we have to have, you know, you&#039;re a world of geek, you&#039;re a world of geek.</div><div id="00:11:53.040" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t buy a geek over there, we make our own.</div><div id="00:11:56.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to make it from cotton tree or guava tree or pimento, which is tough wood.</div><div id="00:12:04.040" class="transcript_line"> So you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:06.040" class="transcript_line"> So you make a gig and you make for yourself, you make a tiny little one.</div><div id="00:12:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;ll make big ones and then you say, right, you know, we used to put the gig there, head up.</div><div id="00:12:20.040" class="transcript_line"> So you got to put the sprite there and then the gig on top there.</div><div id="00:12:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And we used to take spot shot at the gig, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:29.040" class="transcript_line"> You have to really hold them and see how close you can get.</div><div id="00:12:34.040" class="transcript_line"> But the idea is to get it onto the gig and to cause damage.</div><div id="00:12:40.040" class="transcript_line"> And the one that causes the most damage is the winner.</div><div id="00:12:43.040" class="transcript_line"> So when you have a little gig like that, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:46.040" class="transcript_line"> You can cause a lot of damage with it because the big gig, when they come after it, they always miss.</div><div id="00:12:53.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:54.040" class="transcript_line"> Either too close or not close enough.</div><div id="00:12:56.040" class="transcript_line"> They never really get the target.</div><div id="00:12:58.040" class="transcript_line"> But with a small gig, you can hit the target because there&#039;s a big and it&#039;s only small.</div><div id="00:13:05.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s always, you know, we do that.</div><div id="00:13:08.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to have animals as well.</div><div id="00:13:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And I used to have a bull cow.</div><div id="00:13:17.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:13:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Massive he was.</div><div id="00:13:20.040" class="transcript_line"> But I never tied him.</div><div id="00:13:23.040" class="transcript_line"> In the evening, I tied him and I took him out in the morning to feed.</div><div id="00:13:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But when you pick him up in the evening, I come in and just let him there.</div><div id="00:13:35.040" class="transcript_line"> I never tied him.</div><div id="00:13:36.040" class="transcript_line"> He wouldn&#039;t go anywhere.</div><div id="00:13:37.040" class="transcript_line"> He wouldn&#039;t strike.</div><div id="00:13:39.040" class="transcript_line"> He knows where his boundaries.</div><div id="00:13:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:13:44.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to have goats as well.</div><div id="00:13:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I have four goats.</div><div id="00:13:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And same with them.</div><div id="00:13:53.040" class="transcript_line"> They take them out and you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:13:56.040" class="transcript_line"> We got about, I&#039;ll leave with my uncle after my mom come to England before I come here.</div><div id="00:14:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And we are probably about 15 acres of land.</div><div id="00:14:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And then it&#039;s all wired around.</div><div id="00:14:14.040" class="transcript_line"> The land is all wired around.</div><div id="00:14:17.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s back wired.</div><div id="00:14:18.040" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s no need to tie them up.</div><div id="00:14:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Only when you take them out in the morning, you know, you take them out so they can feed in one place.</div><div id="00:14:26.040" class="transcript_line"> You tie them so when you go back in the evening, you know where they are.</div><div id="00:14:30.040" class="transcript_line"> You see they have to run around looking for them.</div><div id="00:14:32.040" class="transcript_line"> You know where they are.</div><div id="00:14:34.040" class="transcript_line"> And my school days, we got good fun out there, man.</div><div id="00:14:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Really good fun.</div><div id="00:14:41.040" class="transcript_line"> The difference what I find when I come to England is the classrooms.</div><div id="00:14:49.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s completely different.</div><div id="00:14:51.040" class="transcript_line"> In Jamaica, you are one teacher teaching probably about 90 kids.</div><div id="00:14:58.040" class="transcript_line"> And you know, they got them in three groups like A, B and C.</div><div id="00:15:04.040" class="transcript_line"> See like, if you&#039;re bright, you in A.</div><div id="00:15:09.040" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re less bright, you in B.</div><div id="00:15:12.040" class="transcript_line"> But if you a bit awkward, you in C.</div><div id="00:15:15.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how they teach you.</div><div id="00:15:17.040" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s one teacher.</div><div id="00:15:19.040" class="transcript_line"> See they&#039;ll move from one class to another.</div><div id="00:15:23.040" class="transcript_line"> You got that one teacher for 12 months.</div><div id="00:15:27.040" class="transcript_line"> See if you don&#039;t pass your exams, you&#039;re there another 12 months.</div><div id="00:15:32.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re there another 12 months.</div><div id="00:15:36.040" class="transcript_line"> With the same teacher.</div><div id="00:15:38.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think the longest I have stayed in one class is probably about nine months.</div><div id="00:15:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Because so far, you know what I mean, I was always a brilliant reader.</div><div id="00:15:49.040" class="transcript_line"> But when it comes to maths and history and things like that, I wasn&#039;t as strong a reader as the rest.</div><div id="00:15:57.040" class="transcript_line"> I take more time to study.</div><div id="00:16:00.040" class="transcript_line"> And I make sure I can, I could study a book and then I could recite it afterwards.</div><div id="00:16:08.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what I, you know what I mean, that&#039;s how I stick to what I do and all my exams.</div><div id="00:16:14.040" class="transcript_line"> I do the same thing.</div><div id="00:16:16.040" class="transcript_line"> I passed to go to high school, but I, you know what I mean, my dad wouldn&#039;t contribute to it too much.</div><div id="00:16:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, leave it.</div><div id="00:16:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I stick with the old school I goes to.</div><div id="00:16:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I about the age of four, coming up to 14, face a person, you know, they kick you out of school at 15 and a half.</div><div id="00:16:36.040" class="transcript_line"> Age of 14, I said I had enough of this.</div><div id="00:16:39.040" class="transcript_line"> So I went and worked with my uncle until I leave there and come to England.</div><div id="00:16:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So I worked as a carpenter.</div><div id="00:16:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I worked as a plasterer.</div><div id="00:16:52.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I said plaster in Jamaica, bricklaying and plaster is the same trade.</div><div id="00:16:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Because you do the bricklaying and then you come back and you do the plastering.</div><div id="00:17:03.040" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t do like bricklaying and somebody else do the plastering.</div><div id="00:17:07.040" class="transcript_line"> You do it yourself.</div><div id="00:17:09.040" class="transcript_line"> You do the whole complete thing.</div><div id="00:17:12.040" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember about the discipline in the households back in Jamaica?</div><div id="00:17:16.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there was discipline, all right.</div><div id="00:17:21.040" class="transcript_line"> You see, what I remember about that, the older one disciplined the younger ones.</div><div id="00:17:32.040" class="transcript_line"> So if you was a dad, like, you know, he was 10 years old, 12 years old, would discipline you.</div><div id="00:17:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And then a 14 year old would discipline him and his stages.</div><div id="00:17:46.040" class="transcript_line"> So the old, as I said, I didn&#039;t live with my dad after my mom&#039;s life.</div><div id="00:17:51.040" class="transcript_line"> But there I live with my uncle.</div><div id="00:17:53.040" class="transcript_line"> But my uncle, he never ever whipped me, not my auntie.</div><div id="00:17:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Never whipped me.</div><div id="00:18:00.040" class="transcript_line"> Never beat me.</div><div id="00:18:02.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t do anything to do with whipping.</div><div id="00:18:06.040" class="transcript_line"> If there was nothing there, you would have a big oven and it was wood fired, so it was dry wood.</div><div id="00:18:16.040" class="transcript_line"> And there was none.</div><div id="00:18:17.040" class="transcript_line"> I just go up the hill because I ain&#039;t got to go far from the hill because the house we built is right underneath a hillside.</div><div id="00:18:26.040" class="transcript_line"> You just climb up there and there&#039;s always dry tree up there.</div><div id="00:18:30.040" class="transcript_line"> You cut down a few and roll it down.</div><div id="00:18:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And you just roll down.</div><div id="00:18:37.040" class="transcript_line"> And then we also have this great big cast iron stove.</div><div id="00:18:41.040" class="transcript_line"> And you put the wood in one side of it and light it and then you have six burners on the top.</div><div id="00:18:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So you can cook six pots at the same time.</div><div id="00:18:54.040" class="transcript_line"> It was fun.</div><div id="00:18:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And I got my own bedroom.</div><div id="00:18:57.040" class="transcript_line"> My bedroom was the only one in there with flooring, wood flooring.</div><div id="00:19:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I wouldn&#039;t let nobody clean my bedroom.</div><div id="00:19:07.040" class="transcript_line"> I have to clean it myself.</div><div id="00:19:09.040" class="transcript_line"> I like to see when it&#039;s clean and shine.</div><div id="00:19:12.040" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, and it&#039;s got wardrobe and a dressing table in there and one chair so I can do my own work.</div><div id="00:19:23.040" class="transcript_line"> It was fun.</div><div id="00:19:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I thought there was about 14 of us living in the house because the house was about 16 apartments, massive house.</div><div id="00:19:37.040" class="transcript_line"> My uncle was a building contractor so he built his own house.</div><div id="00:19:43.040" class="transcript_line"> And he, one of the rooms he built, there was a tank underneath the room and then the room built on top.</div><div id="00:19:51.040" class="transcript_line"> So, like in the drought, that day there was a reserve to go through.</div><div id="00:19:59.040" class="transcript_line"> So we always have water.</div><div id="00:20:03.040" class="transcript_line"> And everybody, you know, all the boys could drive at the age of probably about 10 years, 10, 12 years old.</div><div id="00:20:15.040" class="transcript_line"> And we used to take it in terms.</div><div id="00:20:17.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to have like this big stone crusher just down the bottom.</div><div id="00:20:24.040" class="transcript_line"> My uncle owns half and, well, the Charlie&#039;s, the Chairman Charlie&#039;s is a big man, white man.</div><div id="00:20:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And he had his store in Brownstone.</div><div id="00:20:39.040" class="transcript_line"> And then he owns the other half of the stone crusher.</div><div id="00:20:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So they owned the crusher between us.</div><div id="00:20:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So as boy pitney, we used to rush home and we used to have two vans to pick up a ton and a quarter and a ton and a half.</div><div id="00:20:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s the first one who reached home in charge of that one.</div><div id="00:21:01.040" class="transcript_line"> I was driving since I was 12 years old, I&#039;m young.</div><div id="00:21:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Drawing stone.</div><div id="00:21:07.040" class="transcript_line"> Man, you got more blocks than stones.</div><div id="00:21:12.040" class="transcript_line"> But every trip you make, to we didn&#039;t have no, and you know, you could, you know, it&#039;s a big property.</div><div id="00:21:19.040" class="transcript_line"> People used to gather the stones out, dig stones, and we&#039;d draw it for the, you know, so we&#039;d just write down how many stones, you know, how many loads of stones we&#039;d draw from him.</div><div id="00:21:30.040" class="transcript_line"> So each load of stone the van picked up, they&#039;d get ten shillings.</div><div id="00:21:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And they guarantee all the ten shillings, they&#039;d give me one.</div><div id="00:21:38.040" class="transcript_line"> So anyone being kind to me, I&#039;d bring their stone more.</div><div id="00:21:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, when you get my old man, my old man, I used to see him.</div><div id="00:21:56.040" class="transcript_line"> And he used to give my auntie some money and give me a pound, my pocket money.</div><div id="00:22:02.040" class="transcript_line"> And in them days my friend, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:22:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I never ask if your books know anything because I used to save that money.</div><div id="00:22:10.040" class="transcript_line"> I spent some, but I saved some, and all the books I want I buy.</div><div id="00:22:16.040" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t have to give them away to anybody else.</div><div id="00:22:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Because sometimes, you know, you&#039;re doing lessons, you need them books to fall back on.</div><div id="00:22:24.040" class="transcript_line"> And so if you give them away, you got nothing, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:22:27.040" class="transcript_line"> But you know, in Jamaica it was real nice, man.</div><div id="00:22:32.040" class="transcript_line"> But mango time, orange time, growing over, coconut.</div><div id="00:22:40.040" class="transcript_line"> They had seen the boys at home, my friend.</div><div id="00:22:45.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d gone out to forage for ourselves, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:22:51.040" class="transcript_line"> We carried things home.</div><div id="00:22:54.040" class="transcript_line"> We carried things home, but especially in the school all the day, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:22:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Like, summer we used to get six weeks summer, Christmas four weeks, Easter two weeks.</div><div id="00:23:05.040" class="transcript_line"> And they had days now and again.</div><div id="00:23:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Once the boys do what they&#039;re supposed to do at home, nobody bothers you.</div><div id="00:23:16.040" class="transcript_line"> The time was yours, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:23:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Nobody bothers you.</div><div id="00:23:23.040" class="transcript_line"> But when I come, you know what I mean, then I come to England, 1967.</div><div id="00:23:31.040" class="transcript_line"> I leave the, the September the 21st and I land there the 22nd.</div><div id="00:23:38.040" class="transcript_line"> When I come here, the first thing I seen was all these houses across the, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:23:46.040" class="transcript_line"> And smoke was coming up through the chimney.</div><div id="00:23:50.040" class="transcript_line"> And I remember saying to ma&#039;am, I said, when she picked me up at Eadrow, it wasn&#039;t Gatwick, it was Eadrow.</div><div id="00:24:03.040" class="transcript_line"> She picked me up at Eadrow.</div><div id="00:24:06.040" class="transcript_line"> And he coming up, I said, ma&#039;am, I said, it won&#039;t take long to get a job over here, innit?</div><div id="00:24:11.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, why?</div><div id="00:24:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, all these bakeries they got over here.</div><div id="00:24:15.040" class="transcript_line"> For the only thing we see in Jamaica with a chimney is a bakery.</div><div id="00:24:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Nothing more.</div><div id="00:24:21.040" class="transcript_line"> No, why you see they got chimneys out there?</div><div id="00:24:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Because you don&#039;t need it.</div><div id="00:24:26.040" class="transcript_line"> And she said, son, I wanted, I don&#039;t want to disappoint you too much.</div><div id="00:24:33.040" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s not a bakery, that&#039;s a house.</div><div id="00:24:36.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, you mean to tell me you take me away from where I got to bring me to a bakery?</div><div id="00:24:46.040" class="transcript_line"> And she said, you&#039;ll find out when you go home.</div><div id="00:24:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, we go home.</div><div id="00:24:53.040" class="transcript_line"> And she said, well, that&#039;s your room in there.</div><div id="00:24:57.040" class="transcript_line"> It was a nice room.</div><div id="00:24:58.040" class="transcript_line"> Good-sized room.</div><div id="00:24:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Probably about the size of the third bedroom and the size here.</div><div id="00:25:03.040" class="transcript_line"> But you could get a double bed in there and a wardrobe.</div><div id="00:25:07.040" class="transcript_line"> And she said, ah.</div><div id="00:25:08.040" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know what I mean, that was September.</div><div id="00:25:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I go back to school.</div><div id="00:25:16.040" class="transcript_line"> A week at home and then I was back in school in Nietzsche Secondary.</div><div id="00:25:22.040" class="transcript_line"> And I spent, oh, 12 months.</div><div id="00:25:26.040" class="transcript_line"> And then time to go to work.</div><div id="00:25:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But before all that comes, I think it was September, October, it started to snow.</div><div id="00:25:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;d never seen snow before.</div><div id="00:25:45.040" class="transcript_line"> I read of snow.</div><div id="00:25:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d seen it in a book.</div><div id="00:25:50.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:25:51.040" class="transcript_line"> All the, I was all there looking.</div><div id="00:25:54.040" class="transcript_line"> And these flakes, and I said, son, mama, I said, all you need now is some syrup.</div><div id="00:25:59.040" class="transcript_line"> In Jamaica, what we do, they do the big block of ice and it&#039;s like a shaver.</div><div id="00:26:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, shave the ice.</div><div id="00:26:09.040" class="transcript_line"> And you knock it out.</div><div id="00:26:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s rammed.</div><div id="00:26:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Shave it and knock it and shave it and knock it.</div><div id="00:26:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Then you take it out, slide it out and slide it in a cup and pour syrup all over it.</div><div id="00:26:21.040" class="transcript_line"> And that was the, you know, the trepons, which is half a tanner.</div><div id="00:26:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, all you need now, mama, is some syrup.</div><div id="00:26:30.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, you can&#039;t eat that.</div><div id="00:26:34.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, come out.</div><div id="00:26:35.040" class="transcript_line"> You have a chill blade.</div><div id="00:26:37.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, what&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:26:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, this is fun.</div><div id="00:26:41.040" class="transcript_line"> I even lay down in the rolling in the snow.</div><div id="00:26:45.040" class="transcript_line"> I tell the man, I had a chill blade, my friend.</div><div id="00:26:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I screamed.</div><div id="00:26:50.040" class="transcript_line"> I never feel pain like that in my life.</div><div id="00:26:53.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, I want to go home.</div><div id="00:26:58.040" class="transcript_line"> I want to go home.</div><div id="00:27:02.040" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about your experiences and your story coming into Newport and what was it like?</div><div id="00:27:08.040" class="transcript_line"> What was the culture like?</div><div id="00:27:10.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, before I come to Newport, I was in Birmingham for a good while.</div><div id="00:27:16.040" class="transcript_line"> All my youths, I married and even divorced, and three children in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:27:23.040" class="transcript_line"> And I said, get up one morning and just leave with my daughter.</div><div id="00:27:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And she said, still working.</div><div id="00:27:31.040" class="transcript_line"> And I said, right.</div><div id="00:27:34.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re right now.</div><div id="00:27:35.040" class="transcript_line"> You can manage now, eh?</div><div id="00:27:36.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, yes, dad.</div><div id="00:27:37.040" class="transcript_line"> They take me up the road.</div><div id="00:27:38.040" class="transcript_line"> So you can get yourself and put yourself right.</div><div id="00:27:43.040" class="transcript_line"> But the kids, that was the last one I was living with.</div><div id="00:27:47.040" class="transcript_line"> And then it was Kelly.</div><div id="00:27:49.040" class="transcript_line"> She died now, she died a few years ago.</div><div id="00:27:52.040" class="transcript_line"> And I found Jim and said, oh, I&#039;m coming down for two weeks.</div><div id="00:27:59.040" class="transcript_line"> And that two weeks probably lasted for 18 years, 18, 19 years.</div><div id="00:28:06.040" class="transcript_line"> So I come down and I didn&#039;t have the urge to go back, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:28:12.040" class="transcript_line"> I visited Birmingham because I got friends up there.</div><div id="00:28:16.040" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t have the urge to go back.</div><div id="00:28:19.040" class="transcript_line"> I started working there.</div><div id="00:28:20.040" class="transcript_line"> And I was having good money.</div><div id="00:28:23.040" class="transcript_line"> So I was not as good as I was in Birmingham, but not far off.</div><div id="00:28:28.040" class="transcript_line"> If with overtime, a lot more.</div><div id="00:28:32.040" class="transcript_line"> And I could do as much overtime as I wanted, but I limit myself so far.</div><div id="00:28:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I work Saturday and Sunday.</div><div id="00:28:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Because I get double time for Sunday and time and a half for Saturday.</div><div id="00:28:44.040" class="transcript_line"> So I work them.</div><div id="00:28:46.040" class="transcript_line"> And I do about two hours a night, sometimes in a week.</div><div id="00:28:51.040" class="transcript_line"> But mostly hour and a half I done.</div><div id="00:28:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Going over early and then staying another half an hour and then come home.</div><div id="00:28:59.040" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it helped us to pay off this house.</div><div id="00:29:03.040" class="transcript_line"> So ten years we paid this house off.</div><div id="00:29:07.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean.</div><div id="00:29:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Hard savings to do it.</div><div id="00:29:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Really, really hard savings and sacrifice.</div><div id="00:29:16.040" class="transcript_line"> But we did it.</div><div id="00:29:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Talking about money.</div><div id="00:29:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:21.040" class="transcript_line"> How much did it cost you to come to the UK from Jamaica?</div><div id="00:29:27.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:29:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Mmm.</div><div id="00:29:33.040" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t cost me cost Mum.</div><div id="00:29:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:29:42.040" class="transcript_line"> It was less than £100.</div><div id="00:29:47.040" class="transcript_line"> If I&#039;m not mistaken.</div><div id="00:29:51.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about £60, £68.</div><div id="00:29:56.040" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the direct figure.</div><div id="00:29:59.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think it&#039;s somewhere in that region.</div><div id="00:30:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And you flew over.</div><div id="00:30:05.040" class="transcript_line"> What was the journey like?</div><div id="00:30:06.040" class="transcript_line"> What was the journey like flying over?</div><div id="00:30:10.040" class="transcript_line"> It was quite comfortable actually.</div><div id="00:30:15.040" class="transcript_line"> We stopped off in New York.</div><div id="00:30:18.040" class="transcript_line"> For 12 hours.</div><div id="00:30:22.040" class="transcript_line"> And you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:30:24.040" class="transcript_line"> Being a young lad.</div><div id="00:30:26.040" class="transcript_line"> You know you&#039;ve got like a tutor with you.</div><div id="00:30:28.040" class="transcript_line"> So you know you wouldn&#039;t get lost or anything.</div><div id="00:30:31.040" class="transcript_line"> But when I stopped in New York, I quite liked it in there.</div><div id="00:30:37.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh this is fun.</div><div id="00:30:39.040" class="transcript_line"> But it was just coming up to the winter.</div><div id="00:30:42.040" class="transcript_line"> This is fun I said.</div><div id="00:30:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Quite nice.</div><div id="00:30:46.040" class="transcript_line"> And then we boarded the plane again and it took off in England.</div><div id="00:30:49.040" class="transcript_line"> I was going to, I paid to come to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:30:54.040" class="transcript_line"> So I was waiting for the next plane to take me in from each road to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:31:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And Mum come to each road and meet me.</div><div id="00:31:06.040" class="transcript_line"> So I lose the third flight.</div><div id="00:31:13.040" class="transcript_line"> But I went to school in two weeks.</div><div id="00:31:17.040" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have any problems.</div><div id="00:31:19.040" class="transcript_line"> People have problems but I didn&#039;t have any.</div><div id="00:31:25.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean.</div><div id="00:31:27.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like I just fit in.</div><div id="00:31:31.040" class="transcript_line"> Even the headmaster said, even when I leave in school, the headmaster said,</div><div id="00:31:35.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never seen anyone like that.</div><div id="00:31:37.040" class="transcript_line"> I just fit in.</div><div id="00:31:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t have arguments with nobody or anything.</div><div id="00:31:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Just fit in.</div><div id="00:31:44.040" class="transcript_line"> And what was the education system like in the UK compared to your time in school in Jamaica?</div><div id="00:31:51.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, I must admit, the education in Jamaica was good.</div><div id="00:31:59.040" class="transcript_line"> But UK was, I would say, slightly better.</div><div id="00:32:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to give you the reason why.</div><div id="00:32:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Because in Jamaica, you know what I mean, in your class,</div><div id="00:32:13.040" class="transcript_line"> English, maths, any other subject you go through, history, geography, science,</div><div id="00:32:22.040" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s only one teacher.</div><div id="00:32:24.040" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t leave from one class and go to another class and go to another class.</div><div id="00:32:29.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got the same teacher that teaches you everything.</div><div id="00:32:34.040" class="transcript_line"> So it took me a while to work it out.</div><div id="00:32:39.040" class="transcript_line"> So when you start moving up to another class,</div><div id="00:32:45.040" class="transcript_line"> the same teacher does everything.</div><div id="00:32:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And everything the teachers do, some of them have different ways of bringing it out to you.</div><div id="00:32:58.040" class="transcript_line"> So it makes you, you know what I mean, you can be confused at times, if I speak the truth.</div><div id="00:33:05.040" class="transcript_line"> It makes you confused at times because you don&#039;t know what&#039;s what from what&#039;s not.</div><div id="00:33:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Because every one of them have a different way of teaching it.</div><div id="00:33:16.040" class="transcript_line"> But when I come over and go back to school, it&#039;s not like that.</div><div id="00:33:21.040" class="transcript_line"> To me, the way they do it in England wasn&#039;t proper. Why?</div><div id="00:33:25.040" class="transcript_line"> This man is like maths, this one is like English, science, history, and things like that.</div><div id="00:33:34.040" class="transcript_line"> So everybody teaches one subject, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:33:40.040" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s specializing in that one subject, not specializing in about ten others.</div><div id="00:33:46.040" class="transcript_line"> One subject. So he can more or less recite that subject all the way through.</div><div id="00:33:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And I find that&#039;s a better idea of teaching.</div><div id="00:33:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Even when I go back to Jamaica on holiday, I go back to school,</div><div id="00:34:02.040" class="transcript_line"> and I actually go and see some of the class teachers and I told them, I said,</div><div id="00:34:09.040" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s all wrong what you&#039;re doing, one teacher shouldn&#039;t be doing that.</div><div id="00:34:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Because one teacher don&#039;t know everything.</div><div id="00:34:16.040" class="transcript_line"> If you specialize in English, that&#039;s what you should be teaching.</div><div id="00:34:21.040" class="transcript_line"> If you specialize in maths, that&#039;s what you should be teaching.</div><div id="00:34:24.040" class="transcript_line"> If you specialize in geometry, that&#039;s what you should be teaching.</div><div id="00:34:27.040" class="transcript_line"> And not one teacher doing all that, you see.</div><div id="00:34:30.040" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I think now at the moment things are slightly different now in Jamaica with the teaching.</div><div id="00:34:38.040" class="transcript_line"> But as I said, I enjoy it, you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:34:42.040" class="transcript_line"> I never had a police record.</div><div id="00:34:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Passed my test first time.</div><div id="00:34:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And matter of fact, I passed my test a week before I was 17.</div><div id="00:35:06.040" class="transcript_line"> What do you recall about the food coming into the UK compared to Jamaica?</div><div id="00:35:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, no, no, no, no, no good bars in there. No good bars in the door.</div><div id="00:35:17.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, from where it&#039;s coming from and how long it takes, it&#039;s not too bad.</div><div id="00:35:28.040" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not no comparison to the one you eat.</div><div id="00:35:33.040" class="transcript_line"> You go to Jamaica, you know, you first take a piece of yam, yellow yam or any yam you want.</div><div id="00:35:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And that yam is fit and you cooked it or you roast it.</div><div id="00:35:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So sometimes you roast it.</div><div id="00:35:49.040" class="transcript_line"> You roast it and you get like a knife and you push it there.</div><div id="00:35:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And if it comes up and it&#039;s red, it&#039;s not bad.</div><div id="00:35:58.040" class="transcript_line"> So you leave it, you pull the fire out and then eat it and let it soak, let the steam soak it.</div><div id="00:36:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And when you&#039;re done again and it dries all the way, it&#039;s roast.</div><div id="00:36:07.040" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t peel it then, you scrape it.</div><div id="00:36:11.040" class="transcript_line"> So you got like a hard skin, like a bacon skin, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:36:16.040" class="transcript_line"> You know like the pig skin, you know, when you fry it and that crispy part of it, that tough crispy, you got like that.</div><div id="00:36:26.040" class="transcript_line"> So you split it in two, scrape the middle out, let it be a middle out and put butter in it and then close it back.</div><div id="00:36:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Then leave it on top of the fire.</div><div id="00:36:36.040" class="transcript_line"> Let it simmer then the butter goes all the way through.</div><div id="00:36:39.040" class="transcript_line"> And when you eat that man, sometimes the butter runs down there.</div><div id="00:36:42.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh man, I went back home and I said to them, you know, the first time I went back home, I said to them,</div><div id="00:36:48.040" class="transcript_line"> do you know what I want?</div><div id="00:36:50.040" class="transcript_line"> They said what?</div><div id="00:36:51.040" class="transcript_line"> A piece of roast yam.</div><div id="00:36:53.040" class="transcript_line"> What I want is you roast it and I scrape it and I put it and then put the butter in.</div><div id="00:36:59.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:37:00.040" class="transcript_line"> Just the taste of it.</div><div id="00:37:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I tried it over here, don&#039;t taste the same.</div><div id="00:37:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t taste the same.</div><div id="00:37:09.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just the taste of it man.</div><div id="00:37:12.040" class="transcript_line"> And you know, somebody did the food over there my friend.</div><div id="00:37:16.040" class="transcript_line"> They got some yams over there and you cut it and it looks like you cut it in a dumpling.</div><div id="00:37:22.040" class="transcript_line"> You know, you cut it and the knife going through slowly.</div><div id="00:37:26.040" class="transcript_line"> You take a piece and you chew it, my friend.</div><div id="00:37:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Chew it, my friend, it&#039;s grimy so you have to, it can choke you.</div><div id="00:37:33.040" class="transcript_line"> So you got to be very careful how you eat it, my friend.</div><div id="00:37:36.040" class="transcript_line"> And the one they call the yellow yam, you rid of it, ain&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:37:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Back home, my friend, when you got a really good piece of yellow yam,</div><div id="00:37:46.040" class="transcript_line"> this is the plait with the food in and this is the jug of water.</div><div id="00:37:51.040" class="transcript_line"> Because you need that to eat that.</div><div id="00:37:54.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that dry, if it slipped on the wrong choke, my friend, you want water.</div><div id="00:38:05.040" class="transcript_line"> You want water, my friend.</div><div id="00:38:08.040" class="transcript_line"> So you just have some good time, man.</div><div id="00:38:11.040" class="transcript_line"> Go to the beach.</div><div id="00:38:14.040" class="transcript_line"> So as I said, my uncle was a building contractor.</div><div id="00:38:18.040" class="transcript_line"> So he used to build houses all over the place.</div><div id="00:38:20.040" class="transcript_line"> So he built sometimes at the seaside so he goes there.</div><div id="00:38:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not a strong swimmer, but I could help myself.</div><div id="00:38:28.040" class="transcript_line"> You go there, the man, you look out and nobody there.</div><div id="00:38:32.040" class="transcript_line"> All clothes are dipping.</div><div id="00:38:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Noddy.</div><div id="00:38:36.040" class="transcript_line"> Nobody takes it, you know what I&#039;m saying.</div><div id="00:38:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Especially the houses away from the road.</div><div id="00:38:42.040" class="transcript_line"> Nobody look for your spy on you, man.</div><div id="00:38:45.040" class="transcript_line"> You just jump in there, noddy.</div><div id="00:38:48.040" class="transcript_line"> You look around, dry yourself, pull your clothes out and you&#039;re gone.</div><div id="00:38:56.040" class="transcript_line"> As I said, when you come down the season, orange season,</div><div id="00:39:01.040" class="transcript_line"> Stangerine, you got some cold mangerine as well.</div><div id="00:39:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Similar to Stangerine, you peel them the same way,</div><div id="00:39:08.040" class="transcript_line"> but they&#039;re probably twice as big as Stangerine.</div><div id="00:39:12.040" class="transcript_line"> You got star apple.</div><div id="00:39:14.040" class="transcript_line"> You got apple, you got plums.</div><div id="00:39:19.040" class="transcript_line"> And each of them don&#039;t come in like in the same time.</div><div id="00:39:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Weeks apart they come in.</div><div id="00:39:28.040" class="transcript_line"> So you have plenty of time to go around.</div><div id="00:39:30.040" class="transcript_line"> And if you eat this one of the soy, you wipe it off the list.</div><div id="00:39:34.040" class="transcript_line"> The one that lives in the birds.</div><div id="00:39:37.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got to be sweet, man.</div><div id="00:39:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Sugar cane time, you go out and you have some cane back home.</div><div id="00:39:46.040" class="transcript_line"> They call it the governor cane.</div><div id="00:39:50.040" class="transcript_line"> And the most people&#039;s, each house you go to, each home you go to,</div><div id="00:39:55.040" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll have like one or two roots in there.</div><div id="00:39:58.040" class="transcript_line"> You just have to plant one sucker in.</div><div id="00:40:01.040" class="transcript_line"> And then in about 12 months, my friend, you have about a massive,</div><div id="00:40:07.040" class="transcript_line"> the way it grows, massive, so you can go in there</div><div id="00:40:10.040" class="transcript_line"> and break a cane out and nobody misses it.</div><div id="00:40:13.040" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s just the top half and the bottom.</div><div id="00:40:16.040" class="transcript_line"> You plant it back somewhere else and then that bears up again.</div><div id="00:40:20.040" class="transcript_line"> And peel them as you go.</div><div id="00:40:22.040" class="transcript_line"> We have all these at home, which we got access to 24-7s.</div><div id="00:40:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But we don&#039;t trust them.</div><div id="00:40:32.040" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not interested.</div><div id="00:40:33.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to raid other people&#039;s.</div><div id="00:40:38.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more fun to raid them.</div><div id="00:40:40.040" class="transcript_line"> So we raid them and they raid us.</div><div id="00:40:43.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what the kids act.</div><div id="00:40:46.040" class="transcript_line"> Peer time, they have a call up here.</div><div id="00:40:49.040" class="transcript_line"> You go down a tree and it&#039;s good side, but it&#039;s like watery.</div><div id="00:40:55.040" class="transcript_line"> No, no, we don&#039;t want that.</div><div id="00:40:57.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a few pigs.</div><div id="00:41:00.040" class="transcript_line"> But anytime we come to a tree and it&#039;s dry, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:41:04.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, my friend, that mark.</div><div id="00:41:07.040" class="transcript_line"> And we make sure to time it.</div><div id="00:41:10.040" class="transcript_line"> You always have a good climber in the lot.</div><div id="00:41:13.040" class="transcript_line"> The bloke who owns it, he said,</div><div id="00:41:15.040" class="transcript_line"> well, climb it up and pick some so I can have some as well to eat.</div><div id="00:41:20.040" class="transcript_line"> He goes up and...</div><div id="00:41:23.040" class="transcript_line"> The boy you know you have a bag of pear coming home with.</div><div id="00:41:27.040" class="transcript_line"> Orange is the same thing.</div><div id="00:41:30.040" class="transcript_line"> Coconut is the same thing.</div><div id="00:41:32.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to steal the next door coconut, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:41:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Mars Ralf, he got about six or seven coconuts.</div><div id="00:41:40.040" class="transcript_line"> Mars Ralf, can we have a coconut now?</div><div id="00:41:42.040" class="transcript_line"> But you can buy one.</div><div id="00:41:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So I said, OK Mars Ralf, we buy them.</div><div id="00:41:47.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, OK, then go and pick them.</div><div id="00:41:49.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, we pick them later.</div><div id="00:41:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So later on, somebody...</div><div id="00:41:55.040" class="transcript_line"> I was a hopeless climber.</div><div id="00:41:57.040" class="transcript_line"> Somebody climbed it and then the old bunch of us, we just kick it off.</div><div id="00:42:01.040" class="transcript_line"> The old bunch of us, we only buy a few ones.</div><div id="00:42:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes he called us and he said,</div><div id="00:42:08.040" class="transcript_line"> oh, you can, while you&#039;re up there, you can bring me some down.</div><div id="00:42:11.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, oh yeah, jelly coconut.</div><div id="00:42:14.040" class="transcript_line"> You ever drink jelly coconut?</div><div id="00:42:17.040" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing, son.</div><div id="00:42:19.040" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing.</div><div id="00:42:23.040" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re living...</div><div id="00:42:24.040" class="transcript_line"> When you get a good jelly coconut, you ask your granddad,</div><div id="00:42:28.040" class="transcript_line"> you cut it and you put it in the fridge and let it cool.</div><div id="00:42:33.040" class="transcript_line"> And then you drink that, my friend, oh man, you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing.</div><div id="00:42:38.040" class="transcript_line"> So you throw the water out and then you split the husks,</div><div id="00:42:44.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, they are jelly coconut in too because it doesn&#039;t get hard.</div><div id="00:42:48.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still soft.</div><div id="00:42:50.040" class="transcript_line"> And you get your cut platter, you chip a little piece of the same outside skin</div><div id="00:42:55.040" class="transcript_line"> and you scoop it out and you eat that.</div><div id="00:42:58.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:42:59.040" class="transcript_line"> We call that jelly.</div><div id="00:43:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Man, that&#039;s...</div><div id="00:43:04.040" class="transcript_line"> Every time I think of it, I think that I want to go home.</div><div id="00:43:12.040" class="transcript_line"> Orange is the same thing.</div><div id="00:43:14.040" class="transcript_line"> And if the orange tree is sour, we mark it.</div><div id="00:43:16.040" class="transcript_line"> Leave that for the birds. We don&#039;t want that.</div><div id="00:43:19.040" class="transcript_line"> You got some orange, they call it, label orange.</div><div id="00:43:22.040" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re that size and bigger.</div><div id="00:43:25.040" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t finish one.</div><div id="00:43:28.040" class="transcript_line"> And some of them sweet.</div><div id="00:43:30.040" class="transcript_line"> That sweet is cladding.</div><div id="00:43:32.040" class="transcript_line"> So you eat two or three pegs and you don&#039;t want no more.</div><div id="00:43:36.040" class="transcript_line"> You know what I mean?</div><div id="00:43:38.040" class="transcript_line"> You dish it out and give all the rest.</div><div id="00:43:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Too sweet cladding.</div><div id="00:43:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t eat it.</div><div id="00:43:44.040" class="transcript_line"> And some of them are that big.</div><div id="00:43:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So you think you peel it and you peg it.</div><div id="00:43:51.040" class="transcript_line"> So you peg and some of the pegs are about that long.</div><div id="00:43:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And they like, throw up all the way down.</div><div id="00:43:57.040" class="transcript_line"> You eat two, you don&#039;t want no

food?</div><div id="00:44:09.040" class="transcript_line"> When I come here first, fish and chips, I like it.</div><div id="00:44:15.040" class="transcript_line"> Pie and chips I wasn&#039;t too clever about.</div><div id="00:44:20.040" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:44:22.040" class="transcript_line"> But the fish in the batter, that tastes good to me.</div><div id="00:44:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I like it.</div><div id="00:44:30.040" class="transcript_line"> And when I go to school, I used to have school dinners.</div><div id="00:44:34.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to like some of the puddings over there.</div><div id="00:44:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Sponge pudding and things like that with custard.</div><div id="00:44:39.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to like that.</div><div id="00:44:41.040" class="transcript_line"> But most of the dinners, I mean,</div><div id="00:44:44.040" class="transcript_line"> I would eat a little bit.</div><div id="00:44:47.040" class="transcript_line"> But I wouldn&#039;t finish it because some of them you have to add salt to it.</div><div id="00:44:55.040" class="transcript_line"> I said no, I said you&#039;re supposed to cook with salt.</div><div id="00:44:59.040" class="transcript_line"> When you cook with salt, everything goes in it.</div><div id="00:45:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Only salt goes in the food because you put the salt in the water.</div><div id="00:45:06.040" class="transcript_line"> So the water cooks the food, so everything goes in there.</div><div id="00:45:09.040" class="transcript_line"> But you have to add salt to it.</div><div id="00:45:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see the sense in that.</div><div id="00:45:17.040" class="transcript_line"> I just didn&#039;t see the sense in that.</div><div id="00:45:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Was it easy to keep in touch with friends and family back home?</div><div id="00:45:26.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes and no.</div><div id="00:45:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Because not many people have a telephone.</div><div id="00:45:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Only the wealthy do have telephones.</div><div id="00:45:42.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d have to go to the town and then you could use a phone in the town.</div><div id="00:45:53.040" class="transcript_line"> If I want to talk to my mom, I&#039;d write her and give her a number.</div><div id="00:45:59.040" class="transcript_line"> She can phone me at that special time.</div><div id="00:46:02.040" class="transcript_line"> And then she could phone and then I&#039;ll be there.</div><div id="00:46:06.040" class="transcript_line"> And then whoever owns the phone will talk to her and then hand it to me.</div><div id="00:46:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And then you probably say, oh well, you have to pay such and such for the car.</div><div id="00:46:16.040" class="transcript_line"> So I just do.</div><div id="00:46:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Mom has to pay over here, but it&#039;s still cost a bit over there, so you have to pay for it.</div><div id="00:46:23.040" class="transcript_line"> But you could still talk to people.</div><div id="00:46:26.040" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;re back home and talking.</div><div id="00:46:29.040" class="transcript_line"> But mostly you&#039;re talking, you do two letters.</div><div id="00:46:33.040" class="transcript_line"> You write a letter and send it through the post and she&#039;ll get it.</div><div id="00:46:37.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how she used to send me money, through the post.</div><div id="00:46:41.040" class="transcript_line"> And do you keep in touch with people in Jamaica now?</div><div id="00:46:46.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I do.</div><div id="00:46:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I do.</div><div id="00:46:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Not as often as I should do, but I still keep in touch with them.</div><div id="00:46:54.040" class="transcript_line"> Now and again, I found them over there.</div><div id="00:46:57.040" class="transcript_line"> And if anything goes wrong, they&#039;ll phone me.</div><div id="00:47:01.040" class="transcript_line"> I try and help them if I can.</div><div id="00:47:07.040" class="transcript_line"> What would you say the biggest tradition or custom that you miss from Jamaica is?</div><div id="00:47:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Fresh fruit.</div><div id="00:47:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Fresh fruit, man.</div><div id="00:47:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Fresh fruit.</div><div id="00:47:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever eat sugar cane?</div><div id="00:47:26.040" class="transcript_line"> Do you eat sugar cane?</div><div id="00:47:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;ve got some, they call it the governor cane.</div><div id="00:47:33.040" class="transcript_line"> Which is, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:47:36.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about that big.</div><div id="00:47:38.040" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s big.</div><div id="00:47:40.040" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s not that big.</div><div id="00:47:41.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about that big.</div><div id="00:47:43.040" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s big.</div><div id="00:47:45.040" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s soft.</div><div id="00:47:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So a joint would be about that long.</div><div id="00:47:50.040" class="transcript_line"> From one joint to the next joint, it&#039;s about that long.</div><div id="00:47:53.040" class="transcript_line"> And you only need that.</div><div id="00:47:55.040" class="transcript_line"> If you eat any more, my friend, that wood junkie.</div><div id="00:48:03.040" class="transcript_line"> Especially if it&#039;s an extra hot day, that wood junkie will be walking up there.</div><div id="00:48:08.040" class="transcript_line"> And you don&#039;t know where he is.</div><div id="00:48:11.040" class="transcript_line"> That wood junkie.</div><div id="00:48:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Especially if you cut it and put it down for about a week, it starts to ferment.</div><div id="00:48:21.040" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got a brown stripe all the way through.</div><div id="00:48:26.040" class="transcript_line"> And you eat too much of that, my friend, and you&#039;re not going to last long.</div><div id="00:48:32.040" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t last long.</div><div id="00:48:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Trust me, you don&#039;t last long.</div><div id="00:48:37.040" class="transcript_line"> You be drunk.</div><div id="00:48:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t care how strong you are, my friend, you would be drunk.</div><div id="00:48:42.040" class="transcript_line"> But that thing will knock you off your feet just like that.</div><div id="00:48:48.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice, but when you start eating it, my friend, you don&#039;t know when to stop.</div><div id="00:48:54.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the worst part about it.</div><div id="00:48:59.040" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about music traditions and things you kept in the UK when you were young.</div><div id="00:49:06.040" class="transcript_line"> What did you keep in the UK when you came?</div><div id="00:49:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, the music, when I came to the UK, I was playing music, my friend.</div><div id="00:49:17.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not music.</div><div id="00:49:21.040" class="transcript_line"> I said that&#039;s only one beat. The beat goes ching ching ching ching ching ching.</div><div id="00:49:27.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember when I was going to school, in secondary, having a party.</div><div id="00:49:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, bring your records in.</div><div id="00:49:35.040" class="transcript_line"> I bring a few records in, and a few types, and I&#039;m playing it.</div><div id="00:49:42.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, where you get these records from?</div><div id="00:49:45.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, those are my country music.</div><div id="00:49:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they&#039;re good.</div><div id="00:49:52.040" class="transcript_line"> Do you like our music? I said, not really.</div><div id="00:49:56.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, your music is all chingy ling ling ling like a one string.</div><div id="00:50:00.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, you have to put, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:50:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, there&#039;s no bass in it.</div><div id="00:50:05.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, now you listen to this one, now you can hear the bass coming through, all the different instruments coming through.</div><div id="00:50:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, yours is all chingy ling ling ling, every single one on the same, sound the same, especially the beakers.</div><div id="00:50:21.040" class="transcript_line"> Which you know, killing yourself.</div><div id="00:50:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ll tell you the other truth, I can&#039;t see the beauty about beakers.</div><div id="00:50:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, to me, they&#039;re rubbish.</div><div id="00:50:34.040" class="transcript_line"> They said, oh well, every man to his own culture.</div><div id="00:50:38.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, there you are.</div><div id="00:50:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, I couldn&#039;t put it better myself.</div><div id="00:50:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Every man to his own culture.</div><div id="00:50:45.040" class="transcript_line"> What traditions have you given up or had to change?</div><div id="00:50:58.040" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot really.</div><div id="00:51:09.040" class="transcript_line"> I still eat my western dish food.</div><div id="00:51:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I like fish and chips, but curry, something like that.</div><div id="00:51:18.040" class="transcript_line"> No, I prefer the western dish curry.</div><div id="00:51:22.040" class="transcript_line"> I tried the British curry, I said, no, you&#039;re saying to me.</div><div id="00:51:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Western dish curry, you can taste it.</div><div id="00:51:31.040" class="transcript_line"> The spice in it and the pepper in it.</div><div id="00:51:35.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re eating that and you&#039;re drinking water at the same time.</div><div id="00:51:40.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re drinking water at the same time.</div><div id="00:51:43.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, I said no.</div><div id="00:51:48.040" class="transcript_line"> Is there any family heirlooms or any photographs or ornaments or anything of particular tradition from Jamaica that you kept?</div><div id="00:51:58.040" class="transcript_line"> I used to.</div><div id="00:52:01.040" class="transcript_line"> Where they are now, I used to keep them.</div><div id="00:52:04.040" class="transcript_line"> And then when the kids grow up, I distribute them to the kids.</div><div id="00:52:07.040" class="transcript_line"> So the kids would have them.</div><div id="00:52:10.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, not me, the kids would have them.</div><div id="00:52:13.040" class="transcript_line"> The last one, the last daughter, Kelly, the one that died, I took her to Jamaica.</div><div id="00:52:19.040" class="transcript_line"> She spent what?</div><div id="00:52:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Three months.</div><div id="00:52:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she didn&#039;t want to come back.</div><div id="00:52:26.040" class="transcript_line"> She cried a lot.</div><div id="00:52:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I took her back to the Antigua Bay airport.</div><div id="00:52:32.040" class="transcript_line"> She cried. She didn&#039;t want to come back.</div><div id="00:52:34.040" class="transcript_line"> She said, I don&#039;t want to see why I should leave this to go back to where I&#039;m going back to.</div><div id="00:52:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes I regret it.</div><div id="00:52:43.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, probably if I&#039;d leave her there, she probably would still be alive.</div><div id="00:52:49.040" class="transcript_line"> But you never know, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:52:52.040" class="transcript_line"> This is where things are.</div><div id="00:52:53.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the way things are sometimes, my friend.</div><div id="00:52:59.040" class="transcript_line"> You have to take the good with the bad and the bad with the good.</div><div id="00:53:05.040" class="transcript_line"> Just finally, you said your time coming to the UK, you fit straight in.</div><div id="00:53:15.040" class="transcript_line"> You fit right in.</div><div id="00:53:17.040" class="transcript_line"> I did. I just fit in.</div><div id="00:53:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Even when I go to work, I remember I start working on the 8th of April, 1968.</div><div id="00:53:30.040" class="transcript_line"> 8th of April, 1968.</div><div id="00:53:32.040" class="transcript_line"> Printing tool maker.</div><div id="00:53:34.040" class="transcript_line"> We used to have a block, Mr. King.</div><div id="00:53:39.040" class="transcript_line"> He was a youth employment agency.</div><div id="00:53:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And he comes to, I used to go to school, Nietzsche Secondary.</div><div id="00:53:47.040" class="transcript_line"> He comes there.</div><div id="00:53:49.040" class="transcript_line"> And he says, right, you leave enough to go to work?</div><div id="00:53:53.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, I haven&#039;t find anything yet.</div><div id="00:53:56.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, oh, you will find.</div><div id="00:53:58.040" class="transcript_line"> With my maths, I&#039;m really hoping maths.</div><div id="00:54:01.040" class="transcript_line"> Really that.</div><div id="00:54:03.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, I said, what you want to do?</div><div id="00:54:06.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, carpentry.</div><div id="00:54:08.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, you can do better than that.</div><div id="00:54:10.040" class="transcript_line"> A lot better than that.</div><div id="00:54:12.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, you don&#039;t want to go there and it&#039;s cold and snow and stand up in that.</div><div id="00:54:17.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, no.</div><div id="00:54:19.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I go into engineering.</div><div id="00:54:21.040" class="transcript_line"> I was a tool maker engineer.</div><div id="00:54:23.040" class="transcript_line"> I started off with forging tools.</div><div id="00:54:28.040" class="transcript_line"> You know forging tools.</div><div id="00:54:30.040" class="transcript_line"> I started off forging tools on the head of press tools.</div><div id="00:54:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Some press tools I built couldn&#039;t go through them double doors.</div><div id="00:54:39.040" class="transcript_line"> And meow.</div><div id="00:54:41.040" class="transcript_line"> From start to finish.</div><div id="00:54:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Some of them take me up to nine months.</div><div id="00:54:46.040" class="transcript_line"> Massive.</div><div id="00:54:48.040" class="transcript_line"> And some of them are that big.</div><div id="00:54:51.040" class="transcript_line"> So I enjoy.</div><div id="00:54:54.040" class="transcript_line"> But when I come down to Wales, I didn&#039;t do press tools.</div><div id="00:54:59.040" class="transcript_line"> You know me, I probably do a couple.</div><div id="00:55:01.040" class="transcript_line"> But not much.</div><div id="00:55:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I was more into CNC machines.</div><div id="00:55:04.040" class="transcript_line"> You know me, I watched the blogs and working it and programming it.</div><div id="00:55:08.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, if you can do that, my friend, I can do that.</div><div id="00:55:11.040" class="transcript_line"> They got no training.</div><div id="00:55:13.040" class="transcript_line"> They just watched them.</div><div id="00:55:15.040" class="transcript_line"> See what they was doing.</div><div id="00:55:17.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I met another chap named Gref.</div><div id="00:55:21.040" class="transcript_line"> He was much better than I am.</div><div id="00:55:23.040" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes he showed me if I&#039;m doing it.</div><div id="00:55:26.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re doing it the hard way, man.</div><div id="00:55:28.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, you cycle.</div><div id="00:55:30.040" class="transcript_line"> You cycle.</div><div id="00:55:31.040" class="transcript_line"> And he showed me how to do that.</div><div id="00:55:33.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, that&#039;s all right, man.</div><div id="00:55:35.040" class="transcript_line"> I said, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:55:37.040" class="transcript_line"> So I put the cycle.</div><div id="00:55:39.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re going to write it again.</div><div id="00:55:42.040" class="transcript_line"> All you do is call back the cycle.</div><div id="00:55:45.040" class="transcript_line"> And he comes back and he does all over again the same thing.</div><div id="00:55:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And it goes to the next cycle.</div><div id="00:55:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So I was doing it.</div><div id="00:55:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And I said, I&#039;m going to write it again.</div><div id="00:55:57.040" class="transcript_line"> And he said, you&#039;re going to write it again.</div><div id="00:55:58.040" class="transcript_line"> And he goes to the next cycle.</div><div id="00:56:00.040" class="transcript_line"> So I was doing a program.</div><div id="00:56:02.040" class="transcript_line"> I could make a program to do probably that clock there.</div><div id="00:56:09.040" class="transcript_line"> And I used 50 lines.</div><div id="00:56:13.040" class="transcript_line"> And when he finished, you would see the same shape of the clock there.</div><div id="00:56:18.040" class="transcript_line"> You see everything at the front there.</div><div id="00:56:20.040" class="transcript_line"> You see it.</div><div id="00:56:22.040" class="transcript_line"> 50 lines.</div><div id="00:56:24.040" class="transcript_line"> All cycles.</div><div id="00:56:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I used cycles.</div><div id="00:56:28.040" class="transcript_line"> So I enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:56:32.040" class="transcript_line"> And if there was anything that you could pass on, any messages or anything to future generations, what would you say?</div><div id="00:56:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Listen.</div><div id="00:56:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Use this.</div><div id="00:56:45.040" class="transcript_line"> Drugs and smoking weed and things like that, my friend, they&#039;re all good for you.</div><div id="00:56:52.040" class="transcript_line"> It kills you.</div><div id="00:56:53.040" class="transcript_line"> It kills you.</div><div id="00:56:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And don&#039;t care what anyone say, my friend.</div><div id="00:56:57.040" class="transcript_line"> You smell smoking weed, my friend.</div><div id="00:57:00.040" class="transcript_line"> And the more you, if you smoke a joint today, I because I never tried, I never smoke in my life.</div><div id="00:57:06.040" class="transcript_line"> But I got friends and cousins who smoke.</div><div id="00:57:10.040" class="transcript_line"> And they said, when they smoke, you said you have to know how to do it, my friend.</div><div id="00:57:15.040" class="transcript_line"> You have to learn how to control that.</div><div id="00:57:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Because it will tell you.</div><div id="00:57:23.040" class="transcript_line"> It will give you that, that like, that demand.</div><div id="00:57:28.040" class="transcript_line"> If you smoke a joint today, to feel the same way tomorrow, you have to smoke a joint and a half.</div><div id="00:57:35.040" class="transcript_line"> And they said, if you, if you&#039;re going to do that, my friend, you are in big trouble.</div><div id="00:57:40.040" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t, you can&#039;t angle it.</div><div id="00:57:42.040" class="transcript_line"> So if you can&#039;t angle a thing, stay away from it.</div><div id="00:57:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I do.</div><div id="00:57:47.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t smoke and I stay away from it.</div><div id="00:57:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t get me wrong.</div><div id="00:57:50.040" class="transcript_line"> They say marijuana, I&#039;ll get some and I&#039;ll buckle it and throw white rum on top of it.</div><div id="00:57:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Leave it there.</div><div id="00:57:58.040" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you, after about three or four months, it turns green.</div><div id="00:58:05.040" class="transcript_line"> And if you have an upset stomach, my friend, you only need a tablespoon.</div><div id="00:58:10.040" class="transcript_line"> And you drink that, my friend.</div><div id="00:58:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Throw in about twice as much water as you throw out.</div><div id="00:58:17.040" class="transcript_line"> And you drink that.</div><div id="00:58:18.040" class="transcript_line"> And I tell you this much, my friend, in about an hour&#039;s time, anything down there shifted.</div><div id="00:58:24.040" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll be ending up in the toilet.</div><div id="00:58:26.040" class="transcript_line"> And after that, my friend, everything just go.</div><div id="00:58:30.040" class="transcript_line"> You feel a bit weak, but everything just go.</div><div id="00:58:34.040" class="transcript_line"> And you feel, in about a couple of hours, you&#039;ll feel 100% again.</div><div id="00:58:38.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a medicine, but you don&#039;t feed and you don&#039;t smoke it.</div><div id="00:58:42.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:58:45.040" class="transcript_line"> You buckle it, put it in the buckle, rub it in there, then pour the white rum on it.</div><div id="00:58:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And you turn it green.</div><div id="00:58:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And you leave it there for a few months, my friend.</div><div id="00:58:58.040" class="transcript_line"> And you have to use the tap there.</div><div id="00:59:01.040" class="transcript_line"> If you use just the English cork in the bathroom, you&#039;ll get a lot of smoke.</div><div id="00:59:09.040" class="transcript_line"> In the night, you probably hear the buckle going, boom, boom.</div><div id="00:59:15.040" class="transcript_line"> When you straight hit them, they blow it up.</div><div id="00:59:18.040" class="transcript_line"> So you have to use the screw to hold it there.</div><div id="00:59:22.040" class="transcript_line"> But, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:59:25.040" class="transcript_line"> If you, you know, if you couple catch you in Jamaica with it, they&#039;ll arrest you when I was there.</div><div id="00:59:33.040" class="transcript_line"> But if you have a little bit, if you plant some of it on purpose and they come and see it, it won&#039;t be a problem.</div><div id="00:59:40.040" class="transcript_line"> But if they see a big bung, they know you&#039;re doing it, it&#039;s a business, they&#039;ll arrest you because it&#039;s not legal.</div><div id="00:59:47.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s legal.</div><div id="00:59:50.040" class="transcript_line"> I know probably they make it legal now, which is to me one of the worst things they&#039;ve ever done.</div><div id="00:59:56.040" class="transcript_line"> Because people out there know, my friend, who smoke it, you can&#039;t trust them.</div><div id="01:00:00.040" class="transcript_line"> One minute they arrest you, the next minute they can just turn and all that.</div><div id="01:00:05.040" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ll kill you.</div><div id="01:00:08.040" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t trust them.</div><div id="01:00:11.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good thing, but it&#039;s a bad thing.</div><div id="01:00:16.040" class="transcript_line"> If you use it the wrong way, it&#039;s bad.</div><div id="01:00:20.040" class="transcript_line"> So you have to know what you&#039;re doing.</div><div id="01:00:23.040" class="transcript_line"> As I said, I don&#039;t smoke.</div><div id="01:00:26.040" class="transcript_line"> I tried a cigarette once, and I remember taking the second puff, and that was it.</div><div id="01:00:40.040" class="transcript_line"> When I woke up it was 12 hours later.</div><div id="01:00:43.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not happy about that. 12 hours later I said, no, this is not for me, my friend. Not for me. Cut it out. Not for me.</div><div id="01:01:00.040" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything final that you would like to add?</div><div id="01:01:03.040" class="transcript_line"> In England, since I&#039;ve been over here, if I&#039;m going to tell anybody I haven&#039;t seen pretty, I&#039;m lying.</div><div id="01:01:16.040" class="transcript_line"> You see how?</div><div id="01:01:20.040" class="transcript_line"> But it never been used on me, if you know what I mean.</div><div id="01:01:25.040" class="transcript_line"> I always get down with people.</div><div id="01:01:30.040" class="transcript_line"> The department I work in, when I work in Cumberland, visiting, I was the only black person in there.</div><div id="01:01:41.040" class="transcript_line"> You go in the canteen, and 90% of you are the only black in the canteen.</div><div id="01:01:50.040" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m fit in.</div><div id="01:01:53.040" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t go in and tell people, oh well, I&#039;m black and I&#039;m the one who&#039;s mixed with you.</div><div id="01:01:59.040" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather always says, when you go to another country, it&#039;s not yours, so you&#039;re fit in.</div><div id="01:02:06.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not your country.</div><div id="01:02:09.040" class="transcript_line"> Even in Jamaica, it&#039;s your own country, so you&#039;re fit in.</div><div id="01:02:13.040" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t say, oh well, I&#039;m a Jamaican, so I can&#039;t do anything.</div><div id="01:02:16.040" class="transcript_line"> He said, no you can&#039;t.</div><div id="01:02:19.040" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s law and orders anywhere you go in this world, so you have to learn how to fit in.</div><div id="01:02:25.040" class="transcript_line"> And I said to you, I never come with no running with polythene, I have to put on and cover my hands.</div><div id="01:02:31.040" class="transcript_line"> Never in my life.</div><div id="01:02:34.040" class="transcript_line"> And now I&#039;m 71, I don&#039;t intend to, to go that far.</div><div id="01:02:39.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, if I tell anybody I haven&#039;t been stopped for speeding, I&#039;ll be lying.</div><div id="01:02:45.040" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve never been booked for speeding.</div><div id="01:02:49.040" class="transcript_line"> I stopped, showed my license, they said, okay, that&#039;s it, don&#039;t do it again.</div><div id="01:02:55.040" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s it.</div><div id="01:02:57.040" class="transcript_line"> But they book you and then give you points on your license for speeding?
