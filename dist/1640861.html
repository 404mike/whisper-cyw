    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Brecon in South Wales, September 42,</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> attended local primary school,</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and then attended Crass College boarding school as a day boy,</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> which is where I learned to play rugby,</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> which was quite important a few years later.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to the Cubs and Scouts in Brecon,</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and climbed Penny Man many times with the Scouts,</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> so I was active.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> As I say, it&#039;s a joke to everybody over here,</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re born in Brecon, you&#039;re born with a pair of boots on.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then September 54 to July 58, I was at Crass College,</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> a memorable day, 16th of October 1959,</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I caught the stream train from Brecon to Hereford,</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> went out onto the yard,</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and climbed into a bed for three tonne, REF-wise,</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and that was where I started my REF life.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, my entrance at REF Hereford in the supply trade.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That went down for 18 months.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, sport was one of the things we took part in,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> excuse me, so rugby came into it again.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And also, there was another lad who had joined up from Ponticammer,</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was rugby, I was a hooker, whereas he was on the wing.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve remained in contact ever since.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, we spoke to each other on Christmas Day this year.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s 61 years ago now, 62 years ago.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So 18 months at Hereford, passed out on the 24th of March 1961,</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> which is when you&#039;re in the force, you remember your service number,</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and you remember mostly dates as well, the postage.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But on leaving Hereford, they sent me to 16 maintenance unit at Stafford,</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> which was not an operational unit.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a massive big storehouse with warehouses</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> over all different areas around Stafford.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in the equipment, the office where all the requests for stock</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> came in to us initially, reprogrammed them and said,</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> right, we&#039;ve got so much of this, so much of that,</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;ll be sent out to you, something such.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t work, we worked day shift basically,</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> but one had to sleep in the office at night in case any urgent priority demands came in.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where my life started on shift, working night shifts in a way.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> While I was at the area of Stafford, the people decided,</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, John Evans, you can go on a movements course to Arliff, Lindsay,</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Curtindinje, Lincolnshire.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was there for six weeks learning how to unload, unload aircraft, et cetera,</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> do all the manifest for the ship, build some lading for ships,</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and a great group convoy, policewives, et cetera,</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> checked if they could go under low bridges and the like.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So August 1963, having been at Stafford just over two years,</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> they sent me to 86th movement unit at DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany,</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> which was again a little unit with 10 RAF lads on a big army base.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> We were there on the Rhine, they put the doctoral on the Rhine there,</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and we know what freight was coming over on the ferry from Harwich or whatever to Rotterdam.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> It would get transship then onto the barges and brought down the Rhine.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d have no in advance, as I say, so when the bulky stuff was coming in,</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> we had to advise whichever unit would be requested the items to be on the dock side</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> with their wagons, pick it up.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So as it came off the barge, it went straight onto the lorry and back to base.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the dockers there, a German lad named Henry,</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;d been in prison at war with Stockinghall Street, Glasgow,</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and he always wore a bowler hat, all the time, a bowler hat.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first thing they went overboard when the lads went into the hold on the crane was a crate of beer.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t work until they&#039;d had a beer each, first thing.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And while I was there, again, I played rugby there.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was while on the dock once that a smallish item fell off the crane and caught my left knee and broke my ankle.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to go to hospital, and it was a German hospital being looked after by nuns.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there for about three days, and then they said, right, you&#039;re fitting up to move.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So I then went to a military hospital in Bedford for another week,</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and then back to the unit because our unit had tussled off.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The corridor we actually hadn&#039;t slept in, the combination,</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> the next corridor was the actual offices, so I didn&#039;t have to go outside either.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all inside.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I still carried on working there.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There for two and a half years.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> While I was there, I bought a brand new Simca car, 450 Dodge Mars as it was there.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I came back after two and a half years in Dusseldorf, they posted me to Lyne, which, oh good,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> this is a fully operational station with aircraft flying, transport command, not fighters, transport command,</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Beverly Tigers, Britannias, Comet 2s and 4s, and then VC10s eventually.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And they put me in there as a trim clerk doing the weight and balance trim.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The lads would load the aircraft, and each aircraft was divided into compartments.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d tell me how much weight had gone into each compartment,</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and the air quarter master would submit the blank trim sheet initially</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> with the weight of the aircraft itself, the weight of the fuel that was going to be put on board,</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and I put in the weight of the freight in the compartments.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Then they worked a graph out for the pilot to know how to take off, what angle, et cetera,</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and how to keep a level on flight.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there for two and a half years, and then I got posted to Bahrain.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I was due to Bahrain, I sold the car for Â£450,</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> because I didn&#039;t have to pay any tax when I brought it into the country,</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> unless you keep it for two years.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was over two years having it there, so I didn&#039;t pay tax when I sold it,</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> but it sold for Â£450.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t lose a thing on that deal, because I suppose I must have got a cheap rate in the civil world.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I was posted from Lyon to Bahrain, I was there for 13 months.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a staging post for all the aircraft that left Lyon.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d go to Cyprus, Bahrain, Gange, Singapore and Hong Kong,</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> all go out to Cyprus and back to Bahrain and back.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We were a staging point for all the transport command.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I arrived and walked down the gang plank for the first time,</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> the local lads said, oh, you&#039;re cutting the moonies?</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, we were all white, weren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas they&#039;d been there for a few months, and they were quite tanned by then.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So it took me a while, but I soon got a tan.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> On days off, we&#039;d clip clothes on and shorts,</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and walk up the edge of the runway when we knew there was no aircraft coming in,</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> in the 40-plus degrees heat by the time we had climatised.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We were working out in the pans anyway, in all the heat.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The 13 months there, while there we used to go out on fishing trips</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> on the local down with a couple of Arabs.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not a fisherman, but I used to go out there.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to swim as well in the water.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely clear water, nicely warm, etc.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That was great, that was for 13 months.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The only lady on the camp was the woman&#039;s voluntary service lady</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> who ran the local cafe, information place, etc.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But when we went off camp, we had to put long trousers on and long-sleeved shirts.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t allowed off camp in shorts and T-shirts,</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> to agree with the local religious things.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> See, that was 13 months.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I was then posted back to 16MU Stafford,</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh no, not back there again, that&#039;s a boring job.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Surprisingly, on my arrival at the guardhouse at Stafford to book in,</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> the Snowdrop, or the Arab Police is the correct title,</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> said, oh, you&#039;ve got to report to the station commander,</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> because what have we done wrong now?</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to the station wardrobes at first, which you will do,</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said, oh yes, the station commander wants to see you,</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> from Cork, yes, come upstairs,</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and he shook me hand and said, congratulations, SSC Ems,</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> you are now Corkle Ems, I got promoted.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So two takes on my arm.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all computerised by them in stores at Stafford,</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and they put me on the emergency call-out team who go out at night</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> to different units to get the stuff and get it well organised in a way.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But having been in movements for six, seven years,</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I had no idea how to work a computer, stores-wise,</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> so the lads carried me, I must admit, they showed me what to do,</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and said if I could do it, they did it.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> There were a good group of lads there.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But in the meantime, in the station weekly bulletin came an advert,</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Corkle Storemen wanted a Sax of Aude.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The Sax of Aude, of course, is the most northerly island</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> of the Shetland group.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t go any further north until you go to Norway virtually.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So I applied, I was in three months, I was up at Aberdeen,</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> catching the overnight ferry to Lerwick,</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> which is on the mainland, the main town of Shetlands,</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> arrived there, I would say overnight, arrived in the morning,</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> bus into Lerwick town, bus from Lerwick to the north of the main island,</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> and then a little ferry, if you want to use the word correctly,</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> it was a rowing boat with an outboard boat at the back,</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> which should bus six people,</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> ten minute trip across to the middle island, the L,</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and then you had a bus journey from that point there,</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> halfway across the island, changed buses, and joined the next trip.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The reason being why you had to change was two brothers</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> ran the bus services, but they&#039;d fallen out.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So one had the southern area of the island,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> one had the northern island section.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got up to the northern end of Yale,</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and then another ferry, onboard motor on a sort of six-seater rowing boat,</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> arrived at GutsjÃ¤rg, G-U-T-C-H, which is the ferry point on the Udst,</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> U-N-S-T, which is where we were stationed,</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and again a three-channel met me,</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and took me up to Saxon Board,</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> introduced me to the sergeants in stores,</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and were actually realized that I&#039;d been on boots for seven years,</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and said, oh no, not another one.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously somebody else had been there as well,</div><div id="00:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> who hadn&#039;t been on stores for quite a while.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So they introduced me again to their system of doing things.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d 18 months up there, I used to go walking on days off,</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on the domestic side, where the radar side,</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> which was their prime reason for being there,</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> watching for the Russian Red Bears,</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> which were flying over into the UK airspace.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I get a lift up to the radar side,</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and then walk across the island, the turf, etc.,</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> to the most northern point of the UK,</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and look over Muckle Plugger Lighthouse,</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> M-U-C-K-L-E-F-L-U-G-G-A, Muckle Plugger Lighthouse.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But you had to be careful during breeding season,</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> because they had what they called skewers,</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> which are seagulls, but rather large seagulls,</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and they dive on you, and without a hat on,</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> they would literally put their clothes into your head.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the during breeding season.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I also had to be aware, because they laid their nests on the ground,</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> not in trees, because Zunst didn&#039;t have any trees,</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> as most of the Sheffield doesn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so windy up there.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go across there quite often.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But one thing I remember, which didn&#039;t really affect me,</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> up on the radar side, there were three scanners up there,</div><div id="00:13:03.000" class="transcript_line"> but this other bit, between each building,</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> there were posts, they&#039;d exit into the ground,</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and there were ropes going from one post to another.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And when it was really windy,</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> you literally had to hang onto the ropes</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> to go from one building to another.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You went on the edge of the cliff, or such,</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> but you could get blown over and blown around.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had to put two parkas on.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It was that cold at times when you were outside up there.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had 18 months of it.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Other times, I used to go walking, talk to the Sheffield Cumbies.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to dance back across from me.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Not that I could understand them.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had 18 months up there, posted back to UK,</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> to Arleigh of Thornay Island, which is on the Chastis Hancho border.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> A little island just off Willis.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Not an island, that&#039;s Chastis.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> A stream of divides, Thornay Island from the mainland.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That was in 1971.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I read it in D-Bomb in 1972.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But while I was there, I got warned,</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;re going to Belfast Airport, Aldergrove,</div><div id="00:14:10.000" class="transcript_line"> but posted temporary.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I arrived there the day after Bloody Sunday.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Monday, the day after Bloody Sunday.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Back to Movers, of course, not stores by now.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> A few hair-raising occasions,</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> because I was on the camp all the time.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But every fourth night, two of us, myself and an SCC,</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> would go around with the Android Corporal on security control</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> around the perimeter every fourth night to support them.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have a pistol in my holster,</div><div id="00:14:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and the SCC would have a rifle.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a Lee entry 303 still in those days.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Not these modern guns that they have.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did my time up there, then back to Thornay Island.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the National Games, and D-Bomb&#039;s in September 1972.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my life in the RAF.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then talking about sport,</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> one of the retired English cricket 15, Brian Statham,</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> did his national service at Stafford,</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> but this was before I ever got there.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And again, playing rugby,</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> one of the wings who was on his national service at the time,</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember his name, but I think he was Sullivan,</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> but his uncle or father, not sure which again,</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> was a rugby league professional player playing for St Helens.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not sure if this lad, Don D-Bomb,</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> went into sport professionally or somebody else.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Changing the subject now slightly,</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I was stationed at Lionand.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was the trim clerk for all the aircraft.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of my jobs apart from doing the trim clerk,</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> every aircraft they left had what they called the station seat onboard,</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> which anybody working on the station could use to go anywhere</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> that that aircraft was going.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to book myself a seat on the aircraft out to Cyprus,</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because one of the lads I joined up with,</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> who I&#039;m now still in contact with,</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> the party come in, Coline,</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> was married by then, stationed out there in Madden Quarters at Limassol.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to go out for long weekends,</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> every three or four months,</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> on the botanical, whatever was going out.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The only risk you had, you wouldn&#039;t definitely get a seat back.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You had to be careful because you couldn&#039;t book a seat back</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> in case it was taken up by some emergency.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But lucky enough, I managed to get back every time,</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> step off the aircraft, quick shower, uniform, and straight to work.</div></div></p>
