    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Black men in court, that&#039;s Afro-Caribbean, Arab mainly and African.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> This is part two of the Cardiff riots.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Black men found guilty in Swansea court as a result of their role in the Cardiff riots.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well despite 15 men being taken to court, some with very obvious injuries,</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> the court acted in a reasonable and fair way towards them.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The press may have placed all the blame on the black people of Butetown and Grangetown,</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> but the court did not.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The offences punished were largely unavoidable in terms of punishment.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They were mainly gun related in relation to violence towards the police</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and shooting directly into the crowd.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Black men found guilty were Mohammed Ali, Ali Abdul, Ivor Gabriel Lenzman</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and Mohammed Qaid, also known as Ahmed Khalad.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So only four men were found guilty.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Others found not guilty or no evidence presented were Ismail Mohammed, Cham Ali,</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Sali Abdullah, Sayed Ben Sayed, Farah Mohammed, Mohammed Hassan, John Tucker,</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Mohammed Sharif, Issa Mohammed, Mohammed Abderi and John Abdullah.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So the four black men who found guilty were sentenced to prison in Swansea court.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The four men were, as I say, Ali Abdul, who was age 26, a fireman on the merchant ships.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He was given four days imprisonment for assaulting Frederick Gregory, a police constable.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I should add he&#039;d already been in prison for nearly seven weeks.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Sub-waiting trial.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Ivor Gabriel Lenzman was age 21, a ship&#039;s cook,</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was given a three year prison sentence for shooting at Sydney Jones, William Clark and James Coombs.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Ahmed Khalad, known also as Mohammed Qaid, age 25, a ship&#039;s donkeyman,</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> was given 15 months hard labour for shooting at John Porter, a police constable.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Mohammed Ali, age 27, was given three months hard labour for shooting at Henry Brotherton and Ernest May.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Except for John Abdullah, who is listed as a shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner,</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> all of the black men were in the merchant navy at the time of the riots,</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and therefore it&#039;s extremely likely that they were also involved in World War I.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum, we know that a number of people were compensated</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> for loss of goods and damage during the riots, the bulk of those being in Butetown.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of these were among the men that appeared in court.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> The figures I&#039;m going to quote show the actual amount received and the modern equivalent in 2017,</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> according to the National Archives in London.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Mohammed Ali, now he was found guilty in court and was sentenced to three months hard labour.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Nonetheless, he received £67.10 compensation, a modern equivalent of £1,961.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we can understand that in a real context, what we&#039;re also going to do is quote,</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman, that&#039;s the high level of salary.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So that would have been 204 days wages for a skilled tradesman at that time.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> John Tucker received £30, that&#039;s the equivalent in 2017 of £886.26, 92 days wages.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Mohammed Sharif received £14, £421.34 in 2017 money and 43 days wages at the time.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, John Abdullah, who owned a shop and boarding house, which was the centre of a lot of the damage,</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> received £175. Now that&#039;s the equivalent of just over £5,000.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was 531 days wages. Issam Mohammed received £12, £348 equivalent, which is the equivalent of 36 days wages.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Ismail Mohammed received £7, £203.14 in 2017 and 21 days wages.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Saeed bin Saeed received £4, £116.23 equivalent and 12 days wages.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Fahra Mohammed received £5, £145.29 equivalent and 15 days wages.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Sali Abdullah received £6, the equivalent of £174.35, 18 days wages.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mohammed Hassan received £5, the equivalent of £145.29 and 15 days wages.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So although the events were savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant seaman,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> the treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not start the riot.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Also the compensation amounts were significant at that time.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So despite the press consistently, for most of June, placing the blame for the Cardiff riots on black people living in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> that was not the conclusion reached by the court. And they received compensation for loss of belongings and damage to property.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years before the start of World War II.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And despite racist attacks, brutality by white mobs and overt threat to their families,</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> these black people returned to the sea in World War II to assist Britain.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> In World War II, at least 645 Arab merchant seamen serving on the British merchant navy died.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Of the 479 men who listed their last known address, 242 sailed out of Wales.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> 30 from Barrie, 12 from Swansea, 10 from Newport, 189 from Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Our research shows that 330 men born in the Caribbean died serving on the UK merchant navy in World War II.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> 56 of those listed their last known address as Wales.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> 3 from Newport, 11 from Barrie and 42 from Cardiff.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> These men left at least 35 wives behind in Wales.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Also there were sisters, daughters, brothers and mothers listed in next of kin.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Now this shows that the riots, racism, attacks, failure of government, unions and others to support men,</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> none of this changed their commitment to settling in Wales and becoming black citizens in an often unfriendly environment.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> This is really important because for those of us who are black but of mixed race,</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> third generation nowadays and fourth and fifth generation,</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> the statement of intent made by those people during and after the 1919 race riots,</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> after having been involved in World War I and after a tremendous loss of life in World War I within their community,</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> that statement is why we are citizens of Wales today.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Now in chapters 17 to 20 we&#039;ll show the brutality of the environment in the United States,</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> an environment that also had race riots in 1919, an environment ruled by Britain&#039;s closest allies.</div></div></p>
