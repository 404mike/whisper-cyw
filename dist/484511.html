Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Dan Green.</div><div id="00:00:10.100" class="transcript_line"> The location is the Swicker office</div><div id="00:00:11.840" class="transcript_line"> and today&#039;s date is the 9th of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Before we start Dan, would you very kindly,</div><div id="00:00:18.540" class="transcript_line"> for the record, spell your name in four?</div><div id="00:00:21.160" class="transcript_line"> No worries.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, D-A-N, Dan, and then Green, G-R-E-E-N.</div><div id="00:00:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:00:27.400" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember your first point of contact</div><div id="00:00:29.720" class="transcript_line"> with the Cardiff Carnival, which I would imagine</div><div id="00:00:32.160" class="transcript_line"> at that point was known as the Cardiff Mask Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was.</div><div id="00:00:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so for me it would be the early 90s.</div><div id="00:00:39.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t specify exactly when,</div><div id="00:00:40.920" class="transcript_line"> but it would be the early 90s.</div><div id="00:00:41.760" class="transcript_line"> I was around about 13 or 14</div><div id="00:00:44.840" class="transcript_line"> and my father was involved with it.</div><div id="00:00:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I think he led it.</div><div id="00:00:48.760" class="transcript_line"> My father, Frank Rosalind Green,</div><div id="00:00:51.200" class="transcript_line"> he was, past tense,</div><div id="00:00:53.560" class="transcript_line"> he was an actor performer.</div><div id="00:00:56.060" class="transcript_line"> I would still say he&#039;s a performer now.</div><div id="00:00:58.720" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s definitely on that side of the camera search</div><div id="00:01:01.760" class="transcript_line"> and definitely an outward sort of dancer as well, performer.</div><div id="00:01:05.960" class="transcript_line"> He led it as his clown name, Franco Pissetti,</div><div id="00:01:09.680" class="transcript_line"> white-faced clown.</div><div id="00:01:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember he had a, I think I&#039;m right in saying,</div><div id="00:01:13.040" class="transcript_line"> he had a red star, so he was leading it</div><div id="00:01:15.320" class="transcript_line"> like sort of an old Orleans sort of funeral,</div><div id="00:01:19.320" class="transcript_line"> it felt like.</div><div id="00:01:20.160" class="transcript_line"> And so he was at the very, very front as a young man</div><div id="00:01:22.760" class="transcript_line"> or young boy watching that.</div><div id="00:01:25.640" class="transcript_line"> That stuck in my mind.</div><div id="00:01:26.960" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and I think I followed him.</div><div id="00:01:29.640" class="transcript_line"> As the clown, I would actually step away from him,</div><div id="00:01:32.800" class="transcript_line"> but follow him and watch him interact.</div><div id="00:01:35.080" class="transcript_line"> And he was fantastic doing that.</div><div id="00:01:36.920" class="transcript_line"> But also the century overload of all the colors,</div><div id="00:01:41.280" class="transcript_line"> all the nations, all the sort of flamboyancy</div><div id="00:01:44.120" class="transcript_line"> and celebration of these different people,</div><div id="00:01:47.320" class="transcript_line"> that stuck in my memory.</div><div id="00:01:48.480" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, I was quite a young guy</div><div id="00:01:50.960" class="transcript_line"> and I remember, yeah, he was going down Butte Street</div><div id="00:01:53.480" class="transcript_line"> and then going into the Hays, I think.</div><div id="00:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I went through the Hays in the center of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:00.320" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, that was my very first recollection of it.</div><div id="00:02:03.760" class="transcript_line"> And then it wasn&#039;t two years later.</div><div id="00:02:06.440" class="transcript_line"> I remember going down quite often just to watch it.</div><div id="00:02:10.040" class="transcript_line"> And then I developed, I got into photography</div><div id="00:02:12.920" class="transcript_line"> when I was about 15, 16.</div><div id="00:02:15.440" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s sort of the end of school time</div><div id="00:02:17.720" class="transcript_line"> and I did a few courses.</div><div id="00:02:20.600" class="transcript_line"> It was just a prime target really.</div><div id="00:02:24.040" class="transcript_line"> This happens every year in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> It was a fantastic opportunity to take photographs</div><div id="00:02:28.960" class="transcript_line"> in black and white, but more so in color.</div><div id="00:02:33.160" class="transcript_line"> So I got into it around about the millennium,</div><div id="00:02:37.880" class="transcript_line"> around about 2004, 2005.</div><div id="00:02:40.280" class="transcript_line"> I then started taking photographs of the carnival.</div><div id="00:02:43.240" class="transcript_line"> I remember the blue devils,</div><div id="00:02:45.320" class="transcript_line"> loads of kids dressed up as blue devils.</div><div id="00:02:48.320" class="transcript_line"> And being allowed by the Swicker crew</div><div id="00:02:51.360" class="transcript_line"> to go beyond the barrier, which is quite nice.</div><div id="00:02:55.320" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t want to wear a yellow fluorescent jacket,</div><div id="00:02:58.400" class="transcript_line"> but they allowed me to go in there and interact as well.</div><div id="00:03:02.560" class="transcript_line"> So that was really key to have that license</div><div id="00:03:05.520" class="transcript_line"> to take these intimate photographs</div><div id="00:03:08.400" class="transcript_line"> as they were performing, et cetera, or doing the procession,</div><div id="00:03:11.400" class="transcript_line"> but also going there early enough to get the people</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> setting up and all those months and weeks of preparation</div><div id="00:03:20.120" class="transcript_line"> to get to that point.</div><div id="00:03:21.960" class="transcript_line"> Going there early as a photographer was fantastic</div><div id="00:03:24.160" class="transcript_line"> to get that anticipation, that excitement, that buzz,</div><div id="00:03:29.160" class="transcript_line"> but also catch them preparing themselves</div><div id="00:03:31.360" class="transcript_line"> for the long day ahead.</div><div id="00:03:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that was extra special.</div><div id="00:03:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And then from there, I would say, wow.</div><div id="00:03:39.280" class="transcript_line"> I would say from about 2007 onwards,</div><div id="00:03:42.680" class="transcript_line"> every year I photographed it,</div><div id="00:03:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t photograph it one year,</div><div id="00:03:47.480" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t remember exactly which one, maybe 2012,</div><div id="00:03:49.720" class="transcript_line"> because I twisted my ankle and I was devastated.</div><div id="00:03:52.120" class="transcript_line"> So, and now I&#039;m a photographer and project organizer,</div><div id="00:03:57.240" class="transcript_line"> arts project organizer.</div><div id="00:03:59.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been working with Swicker for, god, for quite a while.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, for a long time.</div><div id="00:04:05.320" class="transcript_line"> And some of the best shots that we have,</div><div id="00:04:08.800" class="transcript_line"> and of course these will be seen on our online archive</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> when it&#039;s launched, the People&#039;s Collection Wales.</div><div id="00:04:15.040" class="transcript_line"> You were very interested in portraiture, weren&#039;t you,</div><div id="00:04:16.960" class="transcript_line"> at one point, and the human face.</div><div id="00:04:19.200" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite nice because you were catching</div><div id="00:04:22.360" class="transcript_line"> the carnival faces, which are often covered in sequins,</div><div id="00:04:25.760" class="transcript_line"> or just transformed.</div><div id="00:04:27.960" class="transcript_line"> But also then I noticed that you started then</div><div id="00:04:31.240" class="transcript_line"> capturing those same faces after the parade,</div><div id="00:04:34.880" class="transcript_line"> when they&#039;d been through the blood, sweat, and tears.</div><div id="00:04:38.400" class="transcript_line"> And that flamboyant,</div><div id="00:04:44.040" class="transcript_line"> mirror had cracked to some degree</div><div id="00:04:45.720" class="transcript_line"> and the humanity was shining through even more so.</div><div id="00:04:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and not only that, when it was raining,</div><div id="00:04:51.920" class="transcript_line"> so their makeup was really sinister,</div><div id="00:04:56.440" class="transcript_line"> but they were smiling,</div><div id="00:04:57.280" class="transcript_line"> so that sometimes made it look even more sinister.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was great.</div><div id="00:05:01.840" class="transcript_line"> And I had that style of getting in close.</div><div id="00:05:05.040" class="transcript_line"> So my criticism as a photographer</div><div id="00:05:07.080" class="transcript_line"> was to step back and look around you.</div><div id="00:05:09.320" class="transcript_line"> So I started to do that a bit more,</div><div id="00:05:10.720" class="transcript_line"> but I would really want to get in close.</div><div id="00:05:14.280" class="transcript_line"> So it was more about filling the frame</div><div id="00:05:15.960" class="transcript_line"> and seeing the exuberance through the eyes, really.</div><div id="00:05:20.480" class="transcript_line"> So I was into that a lot, and eventually I did back off.</div><div id="00:05:23.400" class="transcript_line"> But like I said, it was going there early enough</div><div id="00:05:27.280" class="transcript_line"> to get the preparation and to have that license</div><div id="00:05:30.640" class="transcript_line"> to take these intimate shots.</div><div id="00:05:33.080" class="transcript_line"> But also the person&#039;s confidence in me</div><div id="00:05:37.800" class="transcript_line"> to take that photograph and recognize who I was.</div><div id="00:05:40.640" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t as if you would go in, do the job, go out.</div><div id="00:05:43.680" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t think photography is too much like that, really.</div><div id="00:05:47.160" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got two hours of window opportunity,</div><div id="00:05:49.200" class="transcript_line"> you come in, out you go.</div><div id="00:05:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes that makes perfect sense, fine.</div><div id="00:05:53.040" class="transcript_line"> But for the carnival, it would be wake up early,</div><div id="00:05:56.240" class="transcript_line"> get loads of food inside you, take cereal bars with you,</div><div id="00:05:59.120" class="transcript_line"> and you know it&#039;s gonna be a seven, eight hour job.</div><div id="00:06:03.760" class="transcript_line"> And same for the people in it,</div><div id="00:06:04.600" class="transcript_line"> because they had to be full of energy,</div><div id="00:06:07.200" class="transcript_line"> they had to keep going.</div><div id="00:06:08.880" class="transcript_line"> And obviously you&#039;ve got people around you</div><div id="00:06:10.880" class="transcript_line"> inspiring you to keep going</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> and the motivation to keep going.</div><div id="00:06:13.640" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;d have pigs and troughs who&#039;d dip in energy.</div><div id="00:06:17.120" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, there was surges.</div><div id="00:06:19.800" class="transcript_line"> And as we talked about, I would sometimes sit down</div><div id="00:06:22.640" class="transcript_line"> and then just take it in five minutes,</div><div id="00:06:24.440" class="transcript_line"> then stand back up and go back into it.</div><div id="00:06:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you would run up and down,</div><div id="00:06:28.440" class="transcript_line"> well I would anyway, run up and down with the carnival</div><div id="00:06:31.320" class="transcript_line"> and trying to get certain shots that you wanna,</div><div id="00:06:34.400" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t plan out, but there&#039;s certain iconic shots</div><div id="00:06:37.440" class="transcript_line"> you wanted to get with a certain background</div><div id="00:06:39.840" class="transcript_line"> that was noticed firebly is in Cardiff and what have you.</div><div id="00:06:43.480" class="transcript_line"> But also just to be in the right place at the right time.</div><div id="00:06:47.400" class="transcript_line"> And also you had to, within that, relax</div><div id="00:06:50.120" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s a lot going on</div><div id="00:06:53.360" class="transcript_line"> and you can&#039;t capture everything.</div><div id="00:06:55.360" class="transcript_line"> And as I developed it as a photographer,</div><div id="00:06:57.920" class="transcript_line"> and more photographers were involved in Swicker,</div><div id="00:06:59.920" class="transcript_line"> it was nice seeing what they were doing,</div><div id="00:07:02.160" class="transcript_line"> what I was doing and then trying to,</div><div id="00:07:06.440" class="transcript_line"> so for the archives, trying to do something different.</div><div id="00:07:09.040" class="transcript_line"> So there was a collection at the end</div><div id="00:07:11.280" class="transcript_line"> of the carnival of the whole picture.</div><div id="00:07:14.360" class="transcript_line"> So it was nice to not work with,</div><div id="00:07:17.040" class="transcript_line"> but to see what other photographers were doing</div><div id="00:07:19.360" class="transcript_line"> to then capture the full story, like I said.</div><div id="00:07:22.080" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it&#039;s a photographer&#039;s dream.</div><div id="00:07:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely, absolutely.</div><div id="00:07:28.440" class="transcript_line"> An absolute photographer&#039;s dream.</div><div id="00:07:30.400" class="transcript_line"> And big smiley faces and amazing,</div><div id="00:07:34.280" class="transcript_line"> amazing elaborate costumes.</div><div id="00:07:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And the fact that every nation was there.</div><div id="00:07:41.960" class="transcript_line"> It was a, Cardiff and Britain is a melting pot</div><div id="00:07:46.080" class="transcript_line"> and it showed off that and showcased that</div><div id="00:07:49.120" class="transcript_line"> and it was a beautiful thing.</div><div id="00:07:53.240" class="transcript_line"> Of course, for our Cardiff Carnival</div><div id="00:07:56.720" class="transcript_line"> 25th anniversary exhibition of the Cardiff story,</div><div id="00:08:00.080" class="transcript_line"> you brought a new element of your,</div><div id="00:08:01.720" class="transcript_line"> because it seems to me that,</div><div id="00:08:03.520" class="transcript_line"> well, I imagine all photographers are creative,</div><div id="00:08:06.480" class="transcript_line"> but you seem to be at the forefront of many things</div><div id="00:08:08.880" class="transcript_line"> in terms of the use of the image.</div><div id="00:08:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Would you care to tell us a bit about</div><div id="00:08:15.080" class="transcript_line"> what you did for the exhibition</div><div id="00:08:16.440" class="transcript_line"> and indeed what you&#039;ve been doing recently in Uganda,</div><div id="00:08:18.800" class="transcript_line"> which I just, yeah, there we go.</div><div id="00:08:21.200" class="transcript_line"> You can explain them.</div><div id="00:08:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely, so it was nice to go back to the Cardiff story</div><div id="00:08:26.840" class="transcript_line"> in 2011, did an exhibition there called Big Little City,</div><div id="00:08:30.160" class="transcript_line"> which was a celebration of Cardiff&#039;s creative talents</div><div id="00:08:32.520" class="transcript_line"> and Swicker was involved in that</div><div id="00:08:34.480" class="transcript_line"> and that was a milestone for the sort of creative work</div><div id="00:08:37.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve done, I think.</div><div id="00:08:39.360" class="transcript_line"> But then again, it was nice to return there in 2014,</div><div id="00:08:43.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah, 2014, to work with Swicker.</div><div id="00:08:47.520" class="transcript_line"> And we had, I was assigned three,</div><div id="00:08:54.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll repeat that now.</div><div id="00:08:55.920" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:08:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:08:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Good old coffee.</div><div id="00:09:00.840" class="transcript_line"> And Steve&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:09:04.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll carry on.</div><div id="00:09:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Carry on.</div><div id="00:09:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so yeah, in 2000,</div><div id="00:09:08.920" class="transcript_line"> so it was nice to return to the Cardiff story in 2014</div><div id="00:09:11.640" class="transcript_line"> after that exhibition I did in 2011.</div><div id="00:09:14.280" class="transcript_line"> And I was asked to do a big mural</div><div id="00:09:17.360" class="transcript_line"> of the different work I&#039;ve done</div><div id="00:09:19.040" class="transcript_line"> and photographs I&#039;ve done for Swicker.</div><div id="00:09:21.400" class="transcript_line"> And I worked with Mark Heatley, who&#039;s a designer,</div><div id="00:09:24.200" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s a good friend and designer,</div><div id="00:09:25.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve worked with many, many times, myself.</div><div id="00:09:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And we came up with a really, really, really large</div><div id="00:09:31.520" class="transcript_line"> paste-up of this, it&#039;s almost Sergeant Pepper-esque</div><div id="00:09:37.840" class="transcript_line"> mishmash cutouts all jumbled together,</div><div id="00:09:41.640" class="transcript_line"> collage of the different kind of photographs</div><div id="00:09:45.200" class="transcript_line"> from round about 2005, 2006 onwards.</div><div id="00:09:50.360" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted to include lots of other photographers,</div><div id="00:09:57.600" class="transcript_line"> but it was just finding the high-resolution images</div><div id="00:10:02.800" class="transcript_line"> all in one place,</div><div id="00:10:03.640" class="transcript_line"> because it was printing really, really large,</div><div id="00:10:05.120" class="transcript_line"> so therefore the quality had to be.</div><div id="00:10:06.280" class="transcript_line"> In terms of scale, how big was that?</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was, if I&#039;m right in saying it was two,</div><div id="00:10:10.600" class="transcript_line"> I remember, that&#039;s weird,</div><div id="00:10:12.240" class="transcript_line"> it was 280 high, but then 15 meters wide.</div><div id="00:10:15.640" class="transcript_line"> So it wrapped around half of the wall space upstairs</div><div id="00:10:21.360" class="transcript_line"> in the Calle Astoria, in the old ivy building.</div><div id="00:10:24.480" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, 15 meters long, about three meters high.</div><div id="00:10:28.080" class="transcript_line"> That is big.</div><div id="00:10:28.920" class="transcript_line"> It was massive.</div><div id="00:10:29.760" class="transcript_line"> It was a huge statement, lovely.</div><div id="00:10:30.920" class="transcript_line"> It was, and it was a nice backdrop to what was a really,</div><div id="00:10:36.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not just saying this, because I was involved in it,</div><div id="00:10:38.080" class="transcript_line"> but it was a really coherent, clear, welcoming,</div><div id="00:10:41.480" class="transcript_line"> friendly celebration of Swicker&#039;s 25-year anniversary.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Really sort of resummed it up perfectly as well.</div><div id="00:10:51.160" class="transcript_line"> And I think it was a nice addition</div><div id="00:10:53.400" class="transcript_line"> to the quite cleanly sort of situated and placed artifacts</div><div id="00:10:59.560" class="transcript_line"> and history of Swicker.</div><div id="00:11:01.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s gotta be the liveliest imagery</div><div id="00:11:04.160" class="transcript_line"> and scale of artwork I&#039;ve ever seen.</div><div id="00:11:06.400" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m smiling all over my face just thinking about that.</div><div id="00:11:09.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And of course, you&#039;ve recently returned from Uganda,</div><div id="00:11:14.720" class="transcript_line"> where I think you&#039;ve been using some of the same processes</div><div id="00:11:18.040" class="transcript_line"> with the SAFE Foundation.</div><div id="00:11:19.880" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you can say a little bit more</div><div id="00:11:21.200" class="transcript_line"> about your current practice.</div><div id="00:11:22.440" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:11:23.280" class="transcript_line"> SAFE Foundation are a local NGO,</div><div id="00:11:25.240" class="transcript_line"> so they&#039;re based in Bari and Cardiff,</div><div id="00:11:26.840" class="transcript_line"> and they do projects all over the world,</div><div id="00:11:29.680" class="transcript_line"> mainly with small communities that need the help.</div><div id="00:11:32.280" class="transcript_line"> So a lot of health, a lot of education, et cetera, et cetera.</div><div id="00:11:35.720" class="transcript_line"> You can see more type in the SAFE Foundation.</div><div id="00:11:37.880" class="transcript_line"> You can find out more.</div><div id="00:11:38.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve basically been a photographer since 2010.</div><div id="00:11:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Been lucky enough to go to different countries</div><div id="00:11:43.680" class="transcript_line"> and document the projects they do.</div><div id="00:11:46.160" class="transcript_line"> But just come back from Uganda,</div><div id="00:11:49.160" class="transcript_line"> it was the last, oh God, three weeks ago,</div><div id="00:11:51.920" class="transcript_line"> two and a half weeks ago,</div><div id="00:11:53.920" class="transcript_line"> where we were there to build clay ovens</div><div id="00:11:57.840" class="transcript_line"> in a small community in Tororo in Uganda.</div><div id="00:12:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Clay ovens which they can bake bread</div><div id="00:12:07.160" class="transcript_line"> and cook food within it.</div><div id="00:12:10.040" class="transcript_line"> So we constructed them.</div><div id="00:12:11.160" class="transcript_line"> What was really nice that we went there</div><div id="00:12:12.600" class="transcript_line"> and it was a completed job,</div><div id="00:12:14.680" class="transcript_line"> as opposed to going in making something happen,</div><div id="00:12:17.600" class="transcript_line"> but it never quite, it came to the end</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> and never quite finished the project or what have you.</div><div id="00:12:24.160" class="transcript_line"> This was completely done,</div><div id="00:12:26.520" class="transcript_line"> and the onus is on the builders who watched us</div><div id="00:12:29.840" class="transcript_line"> and were taught how to make it to make more.</div><div id="00:12:32.080" class="transcript_line"> And also the onus is on the community to actually use them.</div><div id="00:12:35.440" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a handover and it&#039;s a job well done all around.</div><div id="00:12:40.160" class="transcript_line"> So it was a pat on the back for everyone really.</div><div id="00:12:41.720" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s, like I say,</div><div id="00:12:43.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been on different community projects</div><div id="00:12:45.160" class="transcript_line"> where you go over there and it wasn&#039;t quite complete</div><div id="00:12:47.360" class="transcript_line"> and then you leave it</div><div id="00:12:48.200" class="transcript_line"> and then you come back in the same as you left it.</div><div id="00:12:51.240" class="transcript_line"> So that was nice.</div><div id="00:12:52.080" class="transcript_line"> And on top of that,</div><div id="00:12:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I went round photographing as well,</div><div id="00:12:55.080" class="transcript_line"> different communities, different people.</div><div id="00:12:56.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my main thing, photographing people.</div><div id="00:12:59.640" class="transcript_line"> And then found a printer in the capital, Kampala,</div><div id="00:13:04.040" class="transcript_line"> would send the images over there, send them back,</div><div id="00:13:06.840" class="transcript_line"> print them up in large scale,</div><div id="00:13:09.080" class="transcript_line"> and then glue and paste them onto the walls</div><div id="00:13:11.320" class="transcript_line"> where they were taken originally.</div><div id="00:13:12.920" class="transcript_line"> So you gave photography back to the communities</div><div id="00:13:16.560" class="transcript_line"> as opposed to taking the images and taking it back with you.</div><div id="00:13:19.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not gonna sell the image.</div><div id="00:13:21.280" class="transcript_line"> The images were then are gonna be put</div><div id="00:13:23.680" class="transcript_line"> on the Safe for Nation website</div><div id="00:13:25.880" class="transcript_line"> to create more of a, promote what they do</div><div id="00:13:28.840" class="transcript_line"> and to get more people involved</div><div id="00:13:29.960" class="transcript_line"> and to get more money for the community.</div><div id="00:13:31.640" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s no actual commercial gain</div><div id="00:13:33.280" class="transcript_line"> as a photographer doing that.</div><div id="00:13:34.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was a lovely way to put work back on the wall</div><div id="00:13:38.680" class="transcript_line"> and celebrate them there and there.</div><div id="00:13:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s been, yeah, that&#039;s what I&#039;m into at the moment</div><div id="00:13:45.680" class="transcript_line"> is to go to different places, photograph,</div><div id="00:13:47.840" class="transcript_line"> but then leave the image behind for them</div><div id="00:13:50.600" class="transcript_line"> and make them the celebrity,</div><div id="00:13:52.120" class="transcript_line"> make them the ones that should be celebrated.</div><div id="00:13:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:55.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve seen a number of these images</div><div id="00:13:57.400" class="transcript_line"> on social media.</div><div id="00:13:58.240" class="transcript_line"> The one that sticks in my mind,</div><div id="00:13:59.960" class="transcript_line"> and they gladden the heart,</div><div id="00:14:01.920" class="transcript_line"> the one outstanding image for me</div><div id="00:14:03.520" class="transcript_line"> is the elderly lady, the grandmother,</div><div id="00:14:05.800" class="transcript_line"> who is then photographed next to her giant size image</div><div id="00:14:10.280" class="transcript_line"> and the look on her face, ripped big.</div><div id="00:14:12.920" class="transcript_line"> And I was thinking like, wow, that is just,</div><div id="00:14:16.720" class="transcript_line"> all human life is there.</div><div id="00:14:17.840" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people have commented on that.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And coincidentally, the people I was staying with,</div><div id="00:14:23.280" class="transcript_line"> that was her sister, I had no idea.</div><div id="00:14:25.520" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a 94 year old woman.</div><div id="00:14:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I was putting it up</div><div id="00:14:29.880" class="transcript_line"> and she arrived with a walking stick.</div><div id="00:14:32.120" class="transcript_line"> It was a perfect moment.</div><div id="00:14:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Wish I had it on film,</div><div id="00:14:34.640" class="transcript_line"> but I was too busy gluing it on the wall.</div><div id="00:14:37.280" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was special, is special.</div><div id="00:14:40.640" class="transcript_line"> This is all influenced by a French artist called JR.</div><div id="00:14:44.080" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t take this sole credit for this.</div><div id="00:14:46.040" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s this sort of wave of doing that sort of work,</div><div id="00:14:49.560" class="transcript_line"> but not having any sponsorship on there</div><div id="00:14:51.320" class="transcript_line"> and just having a photograph of the person.</div><div id="00:14:54.960" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m also now working with different artists.</div><div id="00:14:56.840" class="transcript_line"> So therefore we can create things.</div><div id="00:14:59.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not just a photograph,</div><div id="00:15:00.880" class="transcript_line"> it could be a painted background mural, what have you.</div><div id="00:15:04.240" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re working on that.</div><div id="00:15:05.800" class="transcript_line"> And the next thing I&#039;m doing in Cardiff on Lauda Road</div><div id="00:15:10.360" class="transcript_line"> is a celebration of the work I did in Uganda</div><div id="00:15:13.920" class="transcript_line"> and then photographing that, sending it back to Uganda.</div><div id="00:15:16.880" class="transcript_line"> And in the Tororo region in Uganda,</div><div id="00:15:19.280" class="transcript_line"> they want me to come back and do more work,</div><div id="00:15:22.520" class="transcript_line"> which was lovely.</div><div id="00:15:23.360" class="transcript_line"> And not just that, headmasters and nurses, doctors,</div><div id="00:15:28.920" class="transcript_line"> peers of the community are writing letters for me</div><div id="00:15:32.040" class="transcript_line"> of support to come back.</div><div id="00:15:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m trying to work out a way of raising money here,</div><div id="00:15:36.960" class="transcript_line"> taking some artists over there</div><div id="00:15:38.720" class="transcript_line"> and doing the same sort of work, but on a larger scale.</div><div id="00:15:42.440" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where I&#039;m heading, hopefully.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But by initially going over there and doing it,</div><div id="00:15:51.320" class="transcript_line"> the response was fantastic.</div><div id="00:15:53.440" class="transcript_line"> They fully embraced it.</div><div id="00:15:54.720" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t quite sure how they were gonna take it,</div><div id="00:15:57.120" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s all gone the right way.</div><div id="00:15:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Well done, Dan. Thank you.</div><div id="00:16:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Talking of things that perhaps</div><div id="00:16:02.920" class="transcript_line"> haven&#039;t quite gone the right way recently.</div><div id="00:16:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Here we go.</div><div id="00:16:06.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, go on, I&#039;m ready.</div><div id="00:16:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay, just over two weeks ago,</div><div id="00:16:11.160" class="transcript_line"> the sole funder of Swickr Carnival,</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the Arts Council of Wales,</div><div id="00:16:17.800" class="transcript_line"> announced the results of its investment review</div><div id="00:16:21.280" class="transcript_line"> and decided that Swickr would not be receiving</div><div id="00:16:26.520" class="transcript_line"> any public investment to keep going</div><div id="00:16:30.440" class="transcript_line"> from April 2006 onwards at the latest.</div><div id="00:16:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, a massive disappointment</div><div id="00:16:38.360" class="transcript_line"> from all those involved and yet to be involved.</div><div id="00:16:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Excuse me.</div><div id="00:16:43.640" class="transcript_line"> Dan, what was your reaction when I told you</div><div id="00:16:45.560" class="transcript_line"> and explained the situation this morning?</div><div id="00:16:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Coincidentally, I was in Uganda when I saw it.</div><div id="00:16:49.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, right.</div><div id="00:16:50.600" class="transcript_line"> And someone sent me the link on social media</div><div id="00:16:53.360" class="transcript_line"> when I finally got a bit of internet.</div><div id="00:16:55.360" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:16:56.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a travesty.</div><div id="00:16:57.720" class="transcript_line"> It really, really is.</div><div id="00:16:59.240" class="transcript_line"> I know I&#039;m emotionally connected to this</div><div id="00:17:01.360" class="transcript_line"> and it is a sort of family, the Swickr group.</div><div id="00:17:05.240" class="transcript_line"> And so I&#039;m gonna be highly biased,</div><div id="00:17:07.560" class="transcript_line"> but even away from that and stepping aside from that,</div><div id="00:17:11.080" class="transcript_line"> if I remember being going,</div><div id="00:17:12.840" class="transcript_line"> harking back to the beginning of this interview</div><div id="00:17:14.400" class="transcript_line"> when I first saw the carnival,</div><div id="00:17:16.360" class="transcript_line"> yes, I was emotionally involved as well</div><div id="00:17:17.800" class="transcript_line"> because my father was part of it,</div><div id="00:17:19.160" class="transcript_line"> but seeing the carnival, being part of it,</div><div id="00:17:21.640" class="transcript_line"> being a onlooker, not being sort of</div><div id="00:17:27.080" class="transcript_line"> on the other side of the barrier, watching the audience,</div><div id="00:17:30.160" class="transcript_line"> it is a travesty for the community.</div><div id="00:17:34.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s part of what Cardiff is to me, to be honest,</div><div id="00:17:39.760" class="transcript_line"> right from young age, really, throughout the 80s as well.</div><div id="00:17:43.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just, it is a crime, to be honest.</div><div id="00:17:47.680" class="transcript_line"> It really is.</div><div id="00:17:48.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not here to have a go at the Arts Council,</div><div id="00:17:51.640" class="transcript_line"> not here to have a go at the governing bodies.</div><div id="00:17:55.560" class="transcript_line"> I just think it&#039;s so worthwhile to keep going.</div><div id="00:17:59.240" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t imagine the first weekend of August</div><div id="00:18:03.360" class="transcript_line"> in not being here, and that sounds really selfish,</div><div id="00:18:06.200" class="transcript_line"> but I think the whole city would really miss it.</div><div id="00:18:10.400" class="transcript_line"> But not only that, beyond that,</div><div id="00:18:12.280" class="transcript_line"> I used to love what happened in Swansea.</div><div id="00:18:15.360" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was a great carnival, and that stopped.</div><div id="00:18:19.880" class="transcript_line"> And then at Festival Number Six in recent years,</div><div id="00:18:22.360" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s been fantastic, and imagine that not happening.</div><div id="00:18:25.280" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a real, it&#039;s a weird emotion, really,</div><div id="00:18:30.440" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s part of the parcel,</div><div id="00:18:33.120" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the makeup of the city.</div><div id="00:18:36.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like taking away the castle.</div><div id="00:18:38.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really weird.</div><div id="00:18:41.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s part of the human landscape</div><div id="00:18:43.960" class="transcript_line"> of Cardiff is the carnival, for me.</div><div id="00:18:46.880" class="transcript_line"> Not just for me, I&#039;m sure for lots and lots of people.</div><div id="00:18:49.080" class="transcript_line"> So to see it not here anymore, I can&#039;t imagine it.</div><div id="00:18:52.880" class="transcript_line"> And imagine not a whole carnival not existing.</div><div id="00:18:57.640" class="transcript_line"> Imagine St. Paul&#039;s Carnival not existing.</div><div id="00:19:00.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just, you can&#039;t really imagine it.</div><div id="00:19:02.320" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s, yeah, it&#039;s a really bizarre one.</div><div id="00:19:08.520" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, we will see what happens.</div><div id="00:19:14.160" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s bizarre.</div><div id="00:19:16.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m in the office right now, and I&#039;m surrounded by,</div><div id="00:19:19.040" class="transcript_line"> you know, it&#039;s sort of like a graveyard to the carnival.</div><div id="00:19:23.080" class="transcript_line"> It shouldn&#039;t be.</div><div id="00:19:23.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s got to be.</div><div id="00:19:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Funny enough, yesterday, because it was distressing me,</div><div id="00:19:28.240" class="transcript_line"> I took down all the photographs.</div><div id="00:19:29.640" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t bear to see any human face.</div><div id="00:19:30.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there are no photographs.</div><div id="00:19:32.320" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t bear it.</div><div id="00:19:33.160" class="transcript_line"> Yesterday, I suddenly realized what was,</div><div id="00:19:35.400" class="transcript_line"> I look at a huge emotional blockage to me.</div><div id="00:19:37.640" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t bear to see any human faces in here anymore.</div><div id="00:19:40.760" class="transcript_line"> So that was me yesterday.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:19:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, but that&#039;s not the story.</div><div id="00:19:43.840" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re right.</div><div id="00:19:44.680" class="transcript_line"> This is the human element.</div><div id="00:19:45.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s, you know, it&#039;s evolved.</div><div id="00:19:49.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s evolved with the times.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s incorporated all the different communities</div><div id="00:19:55.760" class="transcript_line"> within Cardiff.</div><div id="00:19:59.520" class="transcript_line">
