    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think one of my feelings, certainly I was very welcomed to the village from the word go, but that was nice.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of people reached out to me.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think reaching out when you go into new communities is a two way traffic.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Often people come in and say, oh, they&#039;re not very friendly, not very strange, you know, they don&#039;t bother me or whatever.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s a two way traffic. You have to be kind to people and they will generally speak and respond very well.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was certainly a feature that I felt and was very quickly made, made friends in the village who you felt that you&#039;d known all your life and always been part of.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was that sort of community feeling which was extended to people coming into the village.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Everybody is welcome. And it&#039;s a great pity that in the current context, of course, we cannot do the social events.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re missing out on things like the carol service, which always attracts all the people going round the village carol singing, children&#039;s Christmas party, harvests, just lunch in the hall or whatever.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s a whole lot of things where people had the opportunity to come together.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we probably all miss that.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a great frequenter of the union, but that&#039;s another social part of the village, which cannot function at the moment.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we do all miss that.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a lot of contacts with the people, of course, through the church.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I do quite a few things for the churches in this neck of the woods.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But again, you can&#039;t be doing that much at the moment either.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So I got to know a lot of people in this part, not only in the village here, but around Radnyshire within quite a radius of this because I was fortunate to frequently got asked to go to talk to them about various things.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And meet people through that.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We are low density of population and tend to feel that you know people from miles around, I think quite quickly get to know lots of people because there aren&#039;t actually lots of people to get to know.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s much easier than in a town situation.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody speaks and everybody is friendly.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That is one of the things that weighs against some of the disadvantages of living here.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Six miles from the nearest main roads.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody ingested to me while ago, have you got your bus pass yet, which I can take both ways.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no point in six miles to the nearest bus stop.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And so these are disadvantages.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But the advantages in the community are great.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, in the situation with the COVID, we are lucky we can walk miles, not see anybody.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We almost but not quite live in isolation anyway.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, we&#039;ve got a lot to be thankful for.</div></div></p>
