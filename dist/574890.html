    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Recollections of Arthur Davies. Home life was very American. My dad spoke Welsh and my mother some Welsh, but we spoke English at home.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My father had a magnificent tenor voice and I remember that I would wake up in the morning and he would be out gardening.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can still hear those marvelous songs he was singing, some of them Welsh, some of them English.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a great time while at the Welsh Church. It was an exciting place for music. People sang their hearts out. You couldn&#039;t stop them.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> To me it was thrilling. The volume, sincerity and the love of music. I have never heard anything like it anywhere.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that the Welsh people are the only ones I know of that sing like a choir.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d get together with the basses, the tenors, sopranos. Rather than listening to a choir, it became a choir.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We sang everywhere. Alki Beach, Woodland Park at the picnics. People would gather round just to listen. It was natural. No song sheets. It wasn&#039;t anything contrived.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh people formed a very close-knit group and it was really a community unto itself.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You can be sure that everybody went to Mrs. Williams&#039; delicatessen before they go anywhere else.</div></div></p>
