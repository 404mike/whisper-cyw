We never learned to translate it, we just learned to read it.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I found it relatively easy because it&#039;s quite akin to Welsh.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I did shorthand as well, and that was handy, you know, because with shorthand you leave vowels out and whatever.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So that came in handy really. So I took to it quite well.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ve been to college over here.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do at college?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I did a secretarial course. So I studied law, English, shorthand, typing, and that was it.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you a Welsh speaker when you were younger?</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So was college the first time you did Welsh?</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> No, Welsh was in grammar school. I took Welsh for GCSEs.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Or O-Levels they were called, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I had a smattering of Welsh, I had a background, I could read it.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I opened it up here, I could read it. I probably wouldn&#039;t be able to understand it, but I could read it.</div></div></p>
