    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Last of the Flock by William Wordsworth</div><div id="00:00:05.740" class="transcript_line"> Read by Tim McMullen for the BBC</div><div id="00:00:10.320" class="transcript_line"> In distant countries I have been,</div><div id="00:00:13.200" class="transcript_line"> And yet I have not often seen a healthy man,</div><div id="00:00:15.980" class="transcript_line"> A man full grown, weep in the public roads alone.</div><div id="00:00:22.360" class="transcript_line"> But such a one, on English ground,</div><div id="00:00:24.820" class="transcript_line"> And in the broad highway I met,</div><div id="00:00:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Along the broad highway he came,</div><div id="00:00:30.040" class="transcript_line"> His cheeks with tears were wet,</div><div id="00:00:33.400" class="transcript_line"> Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad,</div><div id="00:00:36.400" class="transcript_line"> And in his arms a lamb he had.</div><div id="00:00:40.840" class="transcript_line"> He saw me and he turned aside,</div><div id="00:00:42.520" class="transcript_line"> As if he wished himself to hide,</div><div id="00:00:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Then with his coat he made a say,</div><div id="00:00:46.680" class="transcript_line"> To wipe those briny tears away.</div><div id="00:00:49.440" class="transcript_line"> I followed him and said,</div><div id="00:00:51.080" class="transcript_line"> My friend, what ails you?</div><div id="00:00:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Wherefore weep you so?</div><div id="00:00:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Shame on me, sir, this lusty lamb,</div><div id="00:01:01.920" class="transcript_line"> He makes my tears to flow.</div><div id="00:01:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Today I fetched him from the rock,</div><div id="00:01:07.440" class="transcript_line"> He is the last of all my flock.</div><div id="00:01:11.840" class="transcript_line"> When I was young, a single man,</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> And after youthful follies ran,</div><div id="00:01:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Though little given to care and thought,</div><div id="00:01:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Yet so it was, a yew I bought,</div><div id="00:01:24.400" class="transcript_line"> And other sheep from her I raised,</div><div id="00:01:26.920" class="transcript_line"> As healthy sheep as yew might see.</div><div id="00:01:29.480" class="transcript_line"> And then I married, and was rich as I could wish to be.</div><div id="00:01:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Of sheep I numbered a full score,</div><div id="00:01:36.400" class="transcript_line"> And every year increased my store,</div><div id="00:01:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Year after year my stock it grew,</div><div id="00:01:42.200" class="transcript_line"> And from this one, this single yew,</div><div id="00:01:45.360" class="transcript_line"> Full fifty comely sheep I raised,</div><div id="00:01:48.360" class="transcript_line"> As sweet a flock as ever grazed,</div><div id="00:01:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Upon the mountain they did feed,</div><div id="00:01:53.400" class="transcript_line"> They throve, and we at home did thrive,</div><div id="00:01:56.560" class="transcript_line"> This lusty lamb of all my store,</div><div id="00:01:59.960" class="transcript_line"> Is all that is alive.</div><div id="00:02:02.600" class="transcript_line"> And now I care not if we die,</div><div id="00:02:04.800" class="transcript_line"> And perish all of poverty.</div><div id="00:02:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Ten children, sir, had I to feed,</div><div id="00:02:10.360" class="transcript_line"> Hard labor in a time of need,</div><div id="00:02:13.280" class="transcript_line"> My pride was tamed,</div><div id="00:02:15.880" class="transcript_line"> And in our grief I of the perish asked relief.</div><div id="00:02:20.920" class="transcript_line"> They said I was a wealthy man,</div><div id="00:02:23.200" class="transcript_line"> My sheep upon the mountain fed,</div><div id="00:02:25.720" class="transcript_line"> And it was fit that thence I took</div><div id="00:02:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Whereof to buy us bread.</div><div id="00:02:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Do this, how can we give to you, they cried,</div><div id="00:02:34.640" class="transcript_line"> What to the poor is due.</div><div id="00:02:37.840" class="transcript_line"> I sold a sheep, as they had said,</div><div id="00:02:40.400" class="transcript_line"> And bought my little children bread,</div><div id="00:02:42.920" class="transcript_line"> And they were healthy with their food.</div><div id="00:02:45.480" class="transcript_line"> For me, it never did me good,</div><div id="00:02:49.040" class="transcript_line"> A woeful time it was for me</div><div id="00:02:50.760" class="transcript_line"> To see the end of all my gains,</div><div id="00:02:53.240" class="transcript_line"> The pretty flock which I had reared</div><div id="00:02:55.080" class="transcript_line"> With all my care and pains,</div><div id="00:02:57.400" class="transcript_line"> To see it melt like snow away.</div><div id="00:03:01.040" class="transcript_line"> For me, it was a woeful day.</div><div id="00:03:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Another still, and still another,</div><div id="00:03:07.720" class="transcript_line"> A little lamb, and then its mother,</div><div id="00:03:10.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a vein that never stopped,</div><div id="00:03:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Like blood drops from my heart they dropped,</div><div id="00:03:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Till thirty were not left alive.</div><div id="00:03:19.320" class="transcript_line"> They dwindled, dwindled one by one,</div><div id="00:03:23.080" class="transcript_line"> And I may say that many a time</div><div id="00:03:25.120" class="transcript_line"> I wished they all were gone.</div><div id="00:03:27.560" class="transcript_line"> They dwindled one by one away.</div><div id="00:03:30.800" class="transcript_line"> For me, it was a woeful day.</div><div id="00:03:35.800" class="transcript_line"> To wicked deeds I was inclined,</div><div id="00:03:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And wicked fancies crossed my mind,</div><div id="00:03:40.080" class="transcript_line"> And every man I chanced to see,</div><div id="00:03:42.080" class="transcript_line"> I thought he knew some ill of me.</div><div id="00:03:45.240" class="transcript_line"> No peace, no comfort could I find,</div><div id="00:03:47.800" class="transcript_line"> No ease, with indoors or without.</div><div id="00:03:52.360" class="transcript_line"> And crazily and wearily I went my work about,</div><div id="00:03:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Of times I thought to run away.</div><div id="00:03:59.440" class="transcript_line"> For me, it was a woeful day.</div><div id="00:04:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Sir, it was a precious flock to me,</div><div id="00:04:07.440" class="transcript_line"> As dear as my own children be,</div><div id="00:04:10.080" class="transcript_line"> For daily with my growing store</div><div id="00:04:12.160" class="transcript_line"> I loved my children more and more.</div><div id="00:04:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Alas, it was an evil time.</div><div id="00:04:18.080" class="transcript_line"> God cursed me in my sore distress.</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> I prayed, yet every day I thought</div><div id="00:04:24.160" class="transcript_line"> I loved my children less,</div><div id="00:04:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And every week and every day my flock,</div><div id="00:04:29.440" class="transcript_line"> It seemed to melt away.</div><div id="00:04:32.960" class="transcript_line"> They dwindled, sir, sad sight to see,</div><div id="00:04:36.160" class="transcript_line"> From ten to five, from five to three,</div><div id="00:04:41.600" class="transcript_line"> A lamb, a weather, and a yew,</div><div id="00:04:44.160" class="transcript_line"> And then at last from three to two.</div><div id="00:04:47.800" class="transcript_line"> And of my fifty yesterday I had but only one,</div><div id="00:04:52.960" class="transcript_line"> And here it lies upon my arm.</div><div id="00:04:56.880" class="transcript_line"> Alas, and I have none.</div><div id="00:05:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Today I fetched it from the rock.</div><div id="00:05:04.320" class="transcript_line"> It is the last of all my flock.</div></div></p>
