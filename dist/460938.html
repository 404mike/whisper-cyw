    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> What has had the greatest impact on you?</div><div id="00:00:07.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean on screams, it would have been probably around the time of the coronation, it would have</div><div id="00:00:13.520" class="transcript_line"> been the pictures of Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing climbing Everest. Because my mother</div><div id="00:00:23.840" class="transcript_line"> reckons anyway that as soon as I could crawl I started to climb. But that gave it a kind of</div><div id="00:00:32.320" class="transcript_line"> focus. It seemed a proper thing to do, the kind of thing that men did. And as a very, very young</div><div id="00:00:43.600" class="transcript_line"> boy, I mean I was six when Everest was first climbed. You know, mountain climbing was always</div><div id="00:00:50.960" class="transcript_line"> something I wanted to do then. So that was very important. I think the news has always been very</div><div id="00:01:00.160" class="transcript_line"> important to me, that&#039;s what I forgot to tell you. I&#039;m a terrible news junkie, not as bad as I used</div><div id="00:01:06.480" class="transcript_line"> to be, nothing like as bad as I used to be. And I don&#039;t like 24-hour rolling news, I hate it.</div><div id="00:01:13.920" class="transcript_line"> Because I think it distorts what we do, I think it has a huge effect on our behaviour.</div><div id="00:01:19.280" class="transcript_line"> But there are a lot of things that I&#039;ve watched on the news that have had a big impact on me.</div><div id="00:01:26.800" class="transcript_line"> The reports from Vietnam, you know, really the first live reports</div><div id="00:01:33.600" class="transcript_line"> streamed from battlefields, they had a big effect on me. And in a way, news was always an extension,</div><div id="00:01:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Path√© news that I used to watch in Aberdare. I mean Aberdare was a town that had a lot of cinemas,</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and I used to go to the cinema a lot. I can remember the very first film that my mother took us to see,</div><div id="00:02:00.560" class="transcript_line"> my mother loved the cinema, and she took us to see, I think she was probably quite unhappy in</div><div id="00:02:07.520" class="transcript_line"> Aberdare for quite a long time, because she was a my stage girl. And the first film I can</div><div id="00:02:17.120" class="transcript_line"> never remember going to see was Samson and Delilah with Victor Matheur and Hedy Lamarr.</div><div id="00:02:28.640" class="transcript_line"> Who was stunning, by the way, she really was amazing. Victor Matheur wasn&#039;t much of an actor,</div><div id="00:02:33.680" class="transcript_line"> but he had great pectoral muscles. A lot of me said that.</div></div></p>
