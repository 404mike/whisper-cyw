Black America after 1919. How are you going to keep them down on the farm after they&#039;ve seen Paris?</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> For African Americans, World War I highlighted the widening gap between US rhetoric regarding the war to make the world safe for democracy</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and the reality of disenfranchised and exploited black farmers in the South or the poor and alienated residents of the Northern Slums.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Black soldiers fought valiantly in World War I. The main example that&#039;s often quoted are the Harlem Hellfighters.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The 369th Infantry Regiment formerly known as the 15th New York National Guard Regiment and commonly referred to as the Harlem Hellfighters</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> was an infantry regiment of the New York Army National Guard during World War I and World War II.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> The regiment consisted mainly of African Americans, though it also included several Puerto Rican Americans during World War II.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> With the 370th Infantry Regiment, it was known for being one of the first African American regiments to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Before the 15th National Guard Regiment was formed, any African American who wanted to fight in the war had to enlist in the French or Canadian armies.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The regiment was nicknamed originally the Black Rattlers. The nickname Men of Bronze was given to the regiment by the French,</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> but Hellfighters was given to them by the Germans during World War I.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> The 369th spent 191 days in frontline trenches, more than any other American unit.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> They also suffered the most losses of any American regiment with 1500 casualties.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> The Hellfighters returned to New York and they were some of the many soldiers who returned across, black soldiers who returned across America.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> In particular, those who returned to Northern cities only to face continuing racism.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And the 1919 Race Riots. But these soldiers were changed by the freedoms they experienced, especially in France and Britain.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> This was a time of working class, black people recognizing if they did not seek change, there would be none.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> After the initial excitement and awards associated with returning heroic black soldiers and the cordial welcome they first received,</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> even though it was brief, things quickly turned into the Red Summer with over 37 Race Riots.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And by Race Riots I mean white mobs attacking black people. And there were more than three dozen Race Riots across American cities.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> As African Americans realized that President Wilson&#039;s notion of democracy did not extend to them.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And they then evolved a collective will to fight back against mob violence rather than turn the other cheek.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> With the end of the First World War and the rise of the Harlem Renaissance, the term New Negro was widely publicized</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> as a synonym for African Americans who would radically defend their interest against violence and inequality.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> An article in the Messenger Journal published in August 1920 entitled The New Negro, What Is He? by the editors,</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> provides a clear picture of the term in which they describe that the New Negro will be radical and self-defending</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to pursue the right to political and social equality, unlike the gentleness of the Old Negro who is satisfied with the status quo.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But the American government made its position clear. The FBI reported that leftist views were winning converts in the black community</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and that the NAACP was urging the color people to insist upon equality with white people and resort to force if necessary.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> J. Edgar Hoover, then a medium-level officer in the FBI, said that the FBI would not be able to do anything about the issue.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> The high-level officer in the FBI analyzed the riots for the Attorney General, blaming the Washington, D.C. riots on numerous assaults committed by Negroes upon white women.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> For the October events in Arkansas, he blamed certain legal agitation in a Negro lodge.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> A more general cause, he cited, was propaganda of a radical nature. He charged that socialists were feeding propaganda to black-owned magazines, such as the Messenger.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> At least 13 Army veterans, black Army veterans, were lynched across the United States after the war, many of them still in uniform,</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> which, when worn in public, many white people saw as an affront to America&#039;s racial caste system.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the opposite of the reception many black soldiers believed they would receive when turning home.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Their choice to serve in the worst war spurred on by intellectuals like Dubois, who believed it would be a path to equality.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Simon Balto, Professor, University of Iowa, says, World War I was very much a broken promise for basically all African Americans.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But the people who felt the brokenness of that promise most acutely were the veterans who had gone and risked their lives for this supposed war to make the world safe for democracy.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then came home to find that the country was still going to deny African Americans the privilege of democracy.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The words of Jamaican poet Claude Mackay summed up the change.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> If we must die, let it not be like hogs, hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, while around us bark the mad and hungry dogs, making their mock at our accursed lot.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If we must die, oh, let us nobly die, so that our precious blood may not be shed in vain.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Then even the monsters we defy shall be constrained to honor us, though dead.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, kinsmen, we must meet the common foe, though far outnumbered, let us show brave, and for their thousand blows deal one death blow.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What, though before us lies the open grave.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Like men who will face the murderous cowardly pack pressed to the wall, dying but fighting back.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Claude Mackay, 1919, published in the Liberator.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The racism and violence experienced by black people led veterans in northern cities to create defense groups and even to place snipers on rooftops.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> After this there was no turning back to the days of sullen acceptance and violence that was never likely to lead to court action, let alone sentence for racists.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> 1919 saw a resurgence of the Kukat&#039;s clan and those like it, but it also led to an undercurrent that it could be argued led to the Black Panther movement.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> World War I, 1919, the reception the soldiers received and the riots was a turning point in America that still continues.</div></div></p>
