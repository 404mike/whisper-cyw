    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Farzana and I was born in Pakistan, in Faisalabad.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Now in English as well. My name is Farzana and I was born in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Where in Pakistan were you born?</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Punjab, in a small town, Tomatek Singh.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> My father, when he finished his job, he came to Faisalabad.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He lived there, he bought the shop before he was in the army.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When he finished in the army, he bought the shop and stayed near Faisalabad, near Tomatek Singh.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born there, and my brothers were born there. We lived our whole life over there, in Tomatek Singh.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a sixth brother, only sister. I was very, very spoiled.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I always played with the boys. I do play with the girls as well, but more with the boys, because in the house it&#039;s all boys.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the middle. I was four older and two younger brothers. I was in the middle, so I just always played with the boys.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a very happy childhood. I have an education in Tomatek Singh as well.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in our house, education is more important than anything else.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> What type of games did you play?</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No girly games. I don&#039;t know the name or anything, but whatever the boys were playing, I just went and joined them and played with them.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They always called me Tom Boy. My eyes were always watering. I&#039;m not a crime or anything.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I did education up to GCSE in Pakistan. As soon as I finished my education, I got married. Even the result came after I got married.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband and I went from here to Pakistan. It was an arranged marriage.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We got married and he came over and I didn&#039;t come with him because I didn&#039;t have a visa.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> They always give us 18 months to apply and then they give us a visa. After 18 months, he went back and I came here.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you say is your favourite memory about childhood and also school?</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> School. I had a very good time in school.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt built the school. She didn&#039;t have any children. She built the school and all the first children were us.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousins were very nice because my nephews and nieces all lived in one area and we stuck at the school.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> After that, we were still there.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousins were older. I don&#039;t know how to explain it. It was very easy in school. I&#039;m not very good with English.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> English is terrible.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that experience like being married and waiting for your results?</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t even know what marriage was. I was living with my father in a different area.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> My parents were living in Tobadak. It was quite distant.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They found us. He came to our house and they found us. Someone told us that they were young girls.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> They arranged it. I didn&#039;t even know what marriage was because nobody told me.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I have an older brother and none of them got married at that age.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> When I got married, I knew a little bit what marriage was like.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a different experience but my husband is very nice and gentle. He&#039;s a very good man.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a very big guy. He&#039;s of a different age. He said, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll look after you.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So here I am.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that the time you came to the UK? When did you come to the UK?</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I came to the UK in 1976. When I came here, he didn&#039;t have any homes.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He was living with his uncle.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> After two or three weeks, he said, let&#039;s go to Scotland for a holiday.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> My sister and I went there. He said, I&#039;ll just go for a holiday.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We went there and she said, stay here, don&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was living alone in this big island by myself. It&#039;s an Oasis.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, who said this? Because we didn&#039;t have any homes, he said, stay with me.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed with her for about three months.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> After that, they had a small house. Nobody used it.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We just got up. It&#039;s one bedroom, like a small place.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved in, in that house. After that, we just stayed there.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Life is very different when I moved up there.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the people didn&#039;t have bathroom facilities.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They used a portable toilet.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t even have a carpet or anything.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> They used sand.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> They cleaned it every six months.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Like sand, take off.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> On Sundays, you can&#039;t go out.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They just go to the church, worship.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But no housework, you can&#039;t put the washing out or anything.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They use a peat for burning.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> They buy a lot in the summertime and they cut it into blocks.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They rent the land for six months and cut the peat.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They can bake blocks and dry it and use it for the winter time.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We did that as well.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Once or twice a week, the barn came for the grocery.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no shop, nothing.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Fresh milk is alright because the people keep the animals.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> For the milk, eggs and potatoes, these things are alright.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But the rest of the stuff, the barn came down and we moved by grocery.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Then my first child born over there.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We got the house.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He started working on the building side.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> For a few months, I think, he didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he started doing the business door to door, selling stuff.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my brother-in-law, he&#039;s doing the door to door business.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Take the stuff and go door to door and sell the stuff.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He started doing that.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed about six years over there.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> My children were born on that island.</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a different experience as well.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But if you have to go to the hospital, you have to go to the bail land.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in Glasgow.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to catch the flight or the ship.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No other transport.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> No train, no bus, nothing.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> On the weekends, nothing.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t go out.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> If you want to go to the bail land, just five days.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a different experience for me.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed there about six years after my youngest son was born.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> He was alright before when he was born.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> After six or eight months, then we noticed that he&#039;s not all there.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But we still stayed there about three years.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They said if he starts school, we have to send him to the bail land.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t send him to the bail land because in the hostel or whatever they sent him.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So I asked my son, let&#039;s go back to Newport.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So one summer we just came down here.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t bring our stuff.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We just came down to see his brother lives here.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We just came down to see them.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed with them for about three months and applied for the house.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Then after he brought the stuff, the council gave us the house.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved in and we were together.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like the idea of sending the youngest one to the hostel or whatever they want to send him.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So then they take him to the school every day.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I know I&#039;m sending him to school and he comes home in the night.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I was with him all the time.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s alright then.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t like the idea because wherever he&#039;s going, I have to be there.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you say was the most important thing that you had to leave behind?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel about it?</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So leave behind one in Pakistan and also in Scotland.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Pakistan is a family.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> All the family, my brother, everyone.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Good memories.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> In Scotland, it&#039;s a different experience.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Which I haven&#039;t seen in Pakistan either because we have all the facilities in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came down here, the first time I saw the sea as well.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The sea is over there as well, but I haven&#039;t seen it.</div><div id="00:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s different.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came to Newport, that&#039;s another different story.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> What year then did you come to Newport?</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We came down here in 1983.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Since then, we just sit in Newport now.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved three also.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved around in Newport, but still in Newport.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not going anywhere.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> My daughter lives in London.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, come down here because only three of us are living here.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband&#039;s passed away.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, come down here.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll be all together.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, I&#039;m happy here in Newport.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a nice, cozy place.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t want to leave by all these friends.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m like age-alive.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Other groups I go.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Every day I go out and enjoy myself, see my friends, have a good time.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Seeing them and talking to them is nice to me.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s different like staying home and all that.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to work all my life.</div><div id="00:14:35.000" class="transcript_line"> They always call me Lady Leisure.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, okay, yes.</div><div id="00:14:42.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember or recall about the first few days or few months that you were in Newport?</div><div id="00:14:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very different.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came here, I think it was April or May.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> What I don&#039;t remember is March.</div><div id="00:14:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s snowing.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> One week after, it&#039;s snowing.</div><div id="00:15:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s so different.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s cold.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I was young.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t feel cold.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I feel cold.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But everything is different.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The way the people live.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> How do I explain it?</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And no family here.</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very isolated as well.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like staying in.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Only one or two people I know.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I can go and see them.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, not many people.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If the people are there, but I don&#039;t know them.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Only one or two people I know.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Just go and see them.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Just busy with the children.</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I spend most of the time with my children.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Give more time to them.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> When they&#039;re not there, they&#039;re in school.</div><div id="00:16:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I go out and see my friends.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, no.</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Since they&#039;re gone, educated and doing their work.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so depressed.</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my children, my daughters, my boys, they&#039;re like friends to me as well.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> When they&#039;re gone, I was so depressed.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I joined one group like Asiana.</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> A long time ago.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> 15 years ago, I think.</div><div id="00:16:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I joined that group.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> From there, I see more and more people.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I know them and make friends with them.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Then start going out.</div><div id="00:17:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I join lots of groups now.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t stay home now.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so bad.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> How has that been?</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Growing more friends and connections in Newport?</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very, very shy before.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was in Pakistan, I was different.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came there, I was quiet.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t say much.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Since I&#039;m coming to this age-line group,</div><div id="00:17:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I see this friend.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I go out more and talk more.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I think more socializing now.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Meeting all different backdrop people as well.</div><div id="00:18:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s fascinating.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like asking them where you&#039;re from.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of different stories.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoy them.</div><div id="00:18:11.000"

me what you want and I help you.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I do anything for anybody.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I always ahead of them to do something like helping, not gaining anything, just to help them.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think Age Alive, actually more so,</div><div id="00:24:23.000"

He said, come on, you can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> First time I did the play in a pill some way.</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I was so scared after the play.</div><div id="00:25:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I always feel so happy I did that.</div><div id="00:25:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And sometime when we did quite a few times singing as well, that&#039;s how I enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think Age Alive supports black, Asian or other ethnic groups?</div><div id="00:25:46.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think Age Alive supports black or Asian or other ethnic groups?</div><div id="00:25:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s helped me.
