    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, for the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:05.640" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going to speak to Beryl Evans and she&#039;s going to talk about her father during</div><div id="00:00:11.400" class="transcript_line"> the war.</div><div id="00:00:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Beryl.</div><div id="00:00:13.400" class="transcript_line"> So, have you got lots of stories about your father?</div><div id="00:00:15.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, just one major story.</div><div id="00:00:17.720" class="transcript_line"> My father was in the regular army in the 30s, came out in 1938, then was recalled for the</div><div id="00:00:24.360" class="transcript_line"> war.</div><div id="00:00:25.720" class="transcript_line"> So the actual D-Day training was, I believe, down in Aldershot.</div><div id="00:00:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Also my mother&#039;s sister, my uncle, was with him.</div><div id="00:00:35.280" class="transcript_line"> So they were given a day&#039;s notice, 24 hours leave, to do what they want before they finally</div><div id="00:00:40.760" class="transcript_line"> went across to France.</div><div id="00:00:43.120" class="transcript_line"> So what they did was they got up to London, spoke to the train driver.</div><div id="00:00:48.200" class="transcript_line"> The train driver said, hop in the guards van, I&#039;ll drop you.</div><div id="00:00:51.680" class="transcript_line"> He was on the London to Chester or whatever, Liverpool train.</div><div id="00:00:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Jump in the guards van, I will drop you off at the nearest halt station near O&#039;Haben.</div><div id="00:01:04.580" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what they did.</div><div id="00:01:05.700" class="transcript_line"> They were dropped off roughly, say, 11 to 11.30 that evening near Rosamedri somewhere</div><div id="00:01:12.040" class="transcript_line"> at a small halt.</div><div id="00:01:13.600" class="transcript_line"> He said, I will be returning in the morning and I will pick you up here.</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> So what I actually remember is I wake up roughly 11 o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:01:23.120" class="transcript_line"> This is what my mother&#039;s always told me, and I remember the time we heard knocking at the</div><div id="00:01:28.080" class="transcript_line"> window.</div><div id="00:01:29.080" class="transcript_line"> We were in a detached house in Acrobatie because my mother had moved back to the family home</div><div id="00:01:33.840" class="transcript_line"> for the war.</div><div id="00:01:35.480" class="transcript_line"> So what it was, it was my father and my uncle having walked from the nearest station, throwing</div><div id="00:01:41.160" class="transcript_line"> pebbles at the window to wake us up.</div><div id="00:01:44.480" class="transcript_line"> So my mother had the last few hours with my father.</div><div id="00:01:47.520" class="transcript_line"> And then the next day they went back to Aldershot.</div><div id="00:01:50.520" class="transcript_line"> And the train stopped for them?</div><div id="00:01:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it slowed up at the small halt somewhere near Rosamedri.</div><div id="00:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> They jumped in the guards van and they returned back to London.</div><div id="00:01:58.560" class="transcript_line"> That was a very dangerous escapade, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:01.520" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:02:02.520" class="transcript_line"> Because they went AWOL, presumably.</div><div id="00:02:03.520" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they were in uniform and that&#039;s why the guardsman understood.</div><div id="00:02:08.120" class="transcript_line"> And the train driver.</div><div id="00:02:09.480" class="transcript_line"> So they both went across to Caen, it was, on Caen beach.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was badly wounded, badly shell-shocked.</div><div id="00:02:18.120" class="transcript_line"> My uncle didn&#039;t make it.</div><div id="00:02:20.120" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:02:21.120" class="transcript_line"> And then I do remember my mum and my auntie being in mourning going for my uncle&#039;s funeral.</div><div id="00:02:28.800" class="transcript_line"> But my father was badly shell-shocked, came back.</div><div id="00:02:32.040" class="transcript_line"> He went into a Red Cross hospital in a hall in Warwickshire.</div><div id="00:02:36.660" class="transcript_line"> The hall is still there, Shugbury Hall.</div><div id="00:02:38.640" class="transcript_line"> It was the 14th baronet now.</div><div id="00:02:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So when he fully recovered, he was given a job and a house down in Warwickshire.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s my story.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t go back to war then?</div><div id="00:02:50.480" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:02:51.480" class="transcript_line"> He was too badly injured.</div><div id="00:02:53.120" class="transcript_line"> So he was injured on the beach?</div><div id="00:02:56.040" class="transcript_line"> In the beaches in Caen, yes.</div><div id="00:02:58.720" class="transcript_line"> How was he shot?</div><div id="00:02:59.720" class="transcript_line"> He was shot, yes.</div><div id="00:03:00.720" class="transcript_line"> He had a wound on his right side.</div><div id="00:03:02.800" class="transcript_line"> And so after the war, did that problem bother him?</div><div id="00:03:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Badly shell-shocked.</div><div id="00:03:08.920" class="transcript_line"> It took him a few years and my mother said he never really recovered.</div><div id="00:03:12.280" class="transcript_line"> And then eventually...</div><div id="00:03:13.280" class="transcript_line"> And of course, it was his brother who died?</div><div id="00:03:15.600" class="transcript_line"> His brother-in-law.</div><div id="00:03:16.600" class="transcript_line"> His brother-in-law died?</div><div id="00:03:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Were they on the same beach together?</div><div id="00:03:19.600" class="transcript_line"> They were, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:21.600" class="transcript_line"> How very sad for him.</div><div id="00:03:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my father, my uncle was in the musical side of the army, so he was, I forget what</div><div id="00:03:32.240" class="transcript_line"> the term is now.</div><div id="00:03:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Bandsman.</div><div id="00:03:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and their duty was during the war to collect the bodies off the beach.</div><div id="00:03:38.320" class="transcript_line"> With stretchers, yes.</div><div id="00:03:39.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, bare stretchers, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:42.080" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what my uncle was doing and he got shot.</div><div id="00:03:44.040" class="transcript_line"> And he got shot and killed.</div><div id="00:03:45.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:46.040" class="transcript_line"> How very sad.</div><div id="00:03:47.040" class="transcript_line"> He never came back.</div><div id="00:03:48.040" class="transcript_line"> So I do remember that because I was actually born in 1940, so I was four when all this</div><div id="00:03:51.760" class="transcript_line"> was going on.</div><div id="00:03:52.760" class="transcript_line"> So yes, that must have impacted on you at form, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Great sadness.</div><div id="00:03:57.760" class="transcript_line"> But what an extraordinary journey that they did.</div><div id="00:03:59.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:04:00.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they would have been absent without leave, wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:03.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, they were given 24 hours.</div><div id="00:04:04.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were given 24 hours.</div><div id="00:04:05.640" class="transcript_line"> But that was only really for the vicinity around.</div><div id="00:04:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Just to go have a drink in the local pub.</div><div id="00:04:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but no, they thought, you know.</div><div id="00:04:11.640" class="transcript_line"> How prescient of your uncle to come and, you know, maybe he perhaps knew that he was going</div><div id="00:04:19.600" class="transcript_line"> to die.</div><div id="00:04:20.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s extraordinary.</div><div id="00:04:21.600" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t know what was going through their minds, do you?</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> They probably did think that.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if we don&#039;t come back, we&#039;ll try and make it home one last time.</div><div id="00:04:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:28.720" class="transcript_line"> And what a journey.</div><div id="00:04:29.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:04:30.720" class="transcript_line"> That is the most amazing story.</div><div id="00:04:31.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for sharing it.</div><div id="00:04:34.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s so kind.</div></div></p>
