    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So today is the 26th of September 2019. This is Dr. Adiola Dowis. Can you say your full</div><div id="00:00:08.400" class="transcript_line"> name?</div><div id="00:00:09.200" class="transcript_line"> My full name is Carlton Peets.</div><div id="00:00:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Carlton Peets. And where were you born?</div><div id="00:00:14.200" class="transcript_line"> St. Kitts, the best island in the Caribbean.</div><div id="00:00:19.200" class="transcript_line"> And what is your birth date?</div><div id="00:00:22.200" class="transcript_line"> What were your parents&#039; names?</div><div id="00:00:24.200" class="transcript_line"> My parents was married to make a street. My mother was Vivian Peets. My father was Izzy</div><div id="00:00:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Gale Sutton, which is also my middle name.</div><div id="00:00:38.800" class="transcript_line"> Izzy?</div><div id="00:00:39.800" class="transcript_line"> E-Z-K-I-E-L.</div><div id="00:00:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Ezekiel.</div><div id="00:00:41.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, just like in the Bible.</div><div id="00:00:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay. And what did they do for a living?</div><div id="00:00:47.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the time there wasn&#039;t much job for their kind of education. My mother used to</div><div id="00:00:53.400" class="transcript_line"> be a king and my father cut them.</div><div id="00:00:56.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, okay. And did you have brothers and sisters?</div><div id="00:01:00.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Four sisters and one brother.</div><div id="00:01:05.400" class="transcript_line"> And where are you in the...</div><div id="00:01:07.400" class="transcript_line"> In the middle. I&#039;m the fourth out of the six.</div><div id="00:01:11.400" class="transcript_line"> Okay. And what was growing up in St. Kitts like? What do you remember?</div><div id="00:01:14.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, growing up in St. Kitts, I was very, very happy. We have everything, sports, all</div><div id="00:01:22.400" class="transcript_line"> the... I mean, go to the mountain and do everything boys do.</div><div id="00:01:29.400" class="transcript_line"> What was school like? Did you like school?</div><div id="00:01:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Not at first. But first, when I started, I used to like going down to see water. And</div><div id="00:01:40.400" class="transcript_line"> once my sister came to look for me, that I didn&#039;t feel like going to school. And she</div><div id="00:01:51.400" class="transcript_line"> got a joy cane because we had a lot of sugar canes in St. Kitts. But one field was there</div><div id="00:02:01.400" class="transcript_line"> barren. And she took up one of those and every time she walked and she catch up to me, it&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:07.400" class="transcript_line"> a good thing. And unfortunately, my classroom was outside the school. I was in what they</div><div id="00:02:16.400" class="transcript_line"> call outside class, put it away. And when I turned around the corner, I saw my class</div><div id="00:02:26.400" class="transcript_line"> outside and I started drawing my eyes because I didn&#039;t want them to know that I got licks</div><div id="00:02:32.400" class="transcript_line"> to go to school. And then went in school, my sister knew the teacher and she said,</div><div id="00:02:41.400" class="transcript_line"> I could tell you her name now, Clarice. She named Clarice Canes. And my sister said, Clarice,</div><div id="00:02:46.400" class="transcript_line"> could you mark him present for me? She said, oh yes, I will. And then with this time, just</div><div id="00:02:54.400" class="transcript_line"> everybody else moving out, she called me back and she said, your sister didn&#039;t send you</div><div id="00:03:02.400" class="transcript_line"> her name. I said, who tell you so? And she said, and she put her hand across my forehead</div><div id="00:03:11.560" class="transcript_line"> and she wiped off the salt so that when you wipe off the salt, you know you was down the</div><div id="00:03:16.560" class="transcript_line"> sea. Because he left his mark. And then she told me, I won&#039;t mention the words she told</div><div id="00:03:23.560" class="transcript_line"> me as a teacher, but she said, next time you run away from school again without any</div><div id="00:03:32.640" class="transcript_line"> permission, I&#039;ll startle myself. I mean that was nice, soft words she told me, but it didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:39.040" class="transcript_line"> like that she told me. But you did enjoy school. Oh yes, after that morning, first man in school</div><div id="00:03:46.040" class="transcript_line"> is me. First person in school from that episode was me. And Taylor reached seventh standard.</div><div id="00:04:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Then I had a little, well I used to do what they call gardening and go to school. So my</div><div id="00:04:08.680" class="transcript_line"> boss was a white man, he named me Mr. Ball. This is after you left school? No, before,</div><div id="00:04:17.680" class="transcript_line"> while I&#039;m going to school, go to work in the morning, well there&#039;s a little garden, just</div><div id="00:04:24.120" class="transcript_line"> water the plants and pick out any little weeds. Because if you pick out the weeds every day,</div><div id="00:04:31.400" class="transcript_line"> you won&#039;t have much to do. So you water the garden and go to school in the morning and</div><div id="00:04:36.240" class="transcript_line"> after school you go back in the afternoon. Then the boss and the mistress fall in love</div><div id="00:04:43.800" class="transcript_line"> with me, so they give me everything. They used to treat me like their own son or children</div><div id="00:04:49.520" class="transcript_line"> because they had three children. So I was one of the Balls. Black Ball. Yeah, so. Okay,</div><div id="00:05:00.680" class="transcript_line"> so what kinds of things did you want to be when you grew up at that age? Did you have</div><div id="00:05:04.880" class="transcript_line"> any dreams? I didn&#039;t have much dream, but I know for a fact I wasn&#039;t going in the cane</div><div id="00:05:12.400" class="transcript_line"> field to work. That&#039;s for a fact. Because I always say if my mother weed them and my</div><div id="00:05:19.560" class="transcript_line"> father cut them, there&#039;s no place there for me. So. Did you see it as a very hard job?</div><div id="00:05:27.240" class="transcript_line"> Cutting the cane? Oh yes. Oh yes. And they were, they wasn&#039;t paid the right rate and</div><div id="00:05:37.760" class="transcript_line"> everything through politics and so on. And I&#039;ll tell you what, the man who was in charge</div><div id="00:05:45.760" class="transcript_line"> was a blacker man than me. All the days only black and black, but he was really black.</div><div id="00:05:51.480" class="transcript_line"> And he was in charge of everything. Negotiation with the Prime Minister Robert Llewellyn Bratcher.</div><div id="00:06:03.400" class="transcript_line"> Was Sunkist at that time very segregated? Yes, I will say yes because I mean you never</div><div id="00:06:11.200" class="transcript_line"> used to see black people working in a bank and so on. And if you want a high job, let&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:19.160" class="transcript_line"> say working down for government, you have to go to grammar school which was the high</div><div id="00:06:23.720" class="transcript_line"> school in the land at the moment. So unless you go to grammar school you know you can&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:29.760" class="transcript_line"> get a good job. So you just have to take the menial jobs what left. Was it easy for black</div><div id="00:06:36.760" class="transcript_line"> children to go to grammar school? No. No because I mean you have the, what&#039;s the name? The</div><div id="00:06:48.200" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s it called? I can&#039;t remember exactly what you call it. But then if you&#039;re bright</div><div id="00:06:55.200" class="transcript_line"> enough and you could pass the entrance fee, the entrance fee is that your parents will</div><div id="00:07:00.320" class="transcript_line"> have to pay for you. Like me, I could have passed the entrance fee but my head teacher</div><div id="00:07:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Williams went and asked my father which he could afford to because his cousin was</div><div id="00:07:15.400" class="transcript_line"> paying for one of his sons to go to the same school. And he said no. Why did he say no?</div><div id="00:07:23.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, just like most West Indian fathers, they forget their children just grew up. And</div><div id="00:07:32.360" class="transcript_line"> he said no. And he told Mrs. Williams straight, he&#039;s only my mother, but at that time you</div><div id="00:07:39.400" class="transcript_line"> know we used to talk like we were speaking. He said we&#039;re only my mother you know and</div><div id="00:07:44.160" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t do it. And she was a bit gutted. And like a friend of mine who was in the same</div><div id="00:07:53.920" class="transcript_line"> class, he went to grammar school because he passed the, oh god I can&#039;t remember what</div><div id="00:08:01.160" class="transcript_line"> it is now. And a friend, the other friend of mine who was, he went to Convent School</div><div id="00:08:08.160" class="transcript_line"> and that one, one end up as an engineer and the other one was the chief accountant in</div><div id="00:08:14.040" class="transcript_line"> one of the banks in St. Kitts. And me, just left behind. So that&#039;s why as I said to you</div><div id="00:08:21.640" class="transcript_line"> early on, after I got that job and the man told me to go and sell myself, I said to myself,</div><div id="00:08:28.640" class="transcript_line"> no way, I&#039;m not looking for more work, I&#039;m not filling out nothing.</div><div id="00:08:39.040" class="transcript_line"> What job is this? You mean the gardening?</div><div id="00:08:41.080" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it was just caretaker of the arms, caretaker supervisor, you know and then was</div><div id="00:08:50.280" class="transcript_line"> in charge of the cleaners and so on. But there again there was a lot of prejudice in that</div><div id="00:08:57.640" class="transcript_line"> as well too.</div><div id="00:09:00.840" class="transcript_line"> So after you left school you got that job as an accountant?</div><div id="00:09:04.800" class="transcript_line"> No, well just before I came from St. Kitts to here, I used to work in the batter, batter</div><div id="00:09:12.600" class="transcript_line"> shoe store.</div><div id="00:09:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:09:14.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, as the, what&#039;s it called it now, the, of course, as a young man, I was a young</div><div id="00:09:27.280" class="transcript_line"> man. I used to make sure, go to pass the warrants and so on to get the shoes out, the</div><div id="00:09:32.280" class="transcript_line"> customs and things like that. And then I had somebody else, another friend of mine who</div><div id="00:09:39.360" class="transcript_line"> used to clean out the store. His name was Vernon Twelves, you know.</div><div id="00:09:46.240" class="transcript_line"> So what was the decision to come to the UK?</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was a tough decision. First that if it was left to my mother, I want to be</div><div id="00:09:57.960" class="transcript_line"> but through my sister was here, my oldest sister, I had a choice. She was going to send</div><div id="00:10:06.880" class="transcript_line"> for me and I could get a job down the health center as, what do you call him now, sanitary</div><div id="00:10:17.440" class="transcript_line"> inspector. I would have got that job because it was already earmarked for me. Yeah, because</div><div id="00:10:25.440" class="transcript_line"> through friends and so on and through us, I&#039;m not, I was a nice boy growing up. My people,</div><div id="00:10:35.440" class="transcript_line"> well, some, I won&#039;t say friends, but elderly people who know the man, they tell him and</div><div id="00:10:45.080" class="transcript_line"> so on and a good word, very good word. So it was like this, which I would come first</div><div id="00:10:52.080" class="transcript_line"> at the end of the month. If the money come first, which I explained to the man in here,</div><div id="00:10:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Buchanan, he was in charge. Said, Mr. Buchanan, if the money come first before the</div><div id="00:11:05.400" class="transcript_line"> ending of the month, I&#039;ll be going to England. If you don&#039;t, I won&#039;t be going to England,</div><div id="00:11:11.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll take the job. And unfortunately or fortunately, the money came first. And then as I said,</div><div id="00:11:19.560" class="transcript_line"> it came to my sister. What were you expecting? What did you think of England before you knew</div><div id="00:11:27.160" class="transcript_line"> about it, before you came here? Well, be honest with you, you always say England, do this</div><div id="00:11:34.160" class="transcript_line"> England, is that an England? The East African women were saying England pay with gold and</div><div id="00:11:39.320" class="transcript_line"> streets pay with gold and all them sort of nonsense. But then when you look at the, some</div><div id="00:11:46.320" class="transcript_line"> of the West Indian readers, what they used to send for us. You see cows going up pushing,</div><div id="00:11:54.040" class="transcript_line"> pushing cow up the ladder instead of going up on the roof to cut the grass. Well, I mean,</div><div id="00:11:59.520" class="transcript_line"> as Barber said, there was fooling us. And then they get some other West Indian book,</div><div id="00:12:08.520" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s visual English books and that was a different scenario to the old West Indian</div><div id="00:12:16.080" class="transcript_line"> books. So in school they were actually teaching you propaganda? Well, that was the English</div><div id="00:12:23.760" class="transcript_line"> teaching. And you were still a colony, Sunkets were still a colony? Yes. So when you came</div><div id="00:12:29.800" class="transcript_line"> over, you were on a British passport? That&#039;s right. So you were British? British, yes.</div><div id="00:12:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, I still put down British up to now. And how did you travel? Did you come by boat</div><div id="00:12:42.800" class="transcript_line"> or by boat? Both. I flew from Sunkets to Antigua, from Antigua to Trinidad. And then</div><div id="00:12:54.560" class="transcript_line"> we caught the boat in Trinidad. It was about a good 20 of us from Sunkets that day. A woman,</div><div id="00:13:02.080" class="transcript_line"> she had about six children with her and me and my friends and so on. Do you remember</div><div id="00:13:07.160" class="transcript_line"> the boat? No, I can&#039;t remember it. I tried to look for it at Scania or something like</div><div id="00:13:12.920" class="transcript_line"> that, but I can&#039;t remember it rightly so I won&#039;t tell you. Do you remember the journey?</div><div id="00:13:20.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, the most I can remember is when we were in Trinidad. We had a good time in Trinidad.</div><div id="00:13:28.280" class="transcript_line"> As boys, you know, we went up and down the place. And because there was a few more boys</div><div id="00:13:35.960" class="transcript_line"> joined from Dominica, they were from Dominica with us in Trinidad. So, you know, boys will</div><div id="00:13:44.520" class="transcript_line"> be discussing as usual. And you used to have some good times. This woman on the boat, she</div><div id="00:13:53.840" class="transcript_line"> could speak Spanish. So everything we want, we ask her. Well, she knew me as well and</div><div id="00:14:01.240" class="transcript_line"> she knew my parents. So you only ask her to feel like chicken today, feel like fish today</div><div id="00:14:08.240" class="transcript_line"> and she will order whatever you ask her to. So the boat, the crew was Spanish speaking?</div><div id="00:14:15.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but they could speak English as well. Okay. And do you remember anything else about</div><div id="00:14:22.240" class="transcript_line"> the journey? Was it a happy journey? Well, as I said, it was happy because some of us</div><div id="00:14:27.640" class="transcript_line"> were, especially this fellow from Dominica, I mean, we were supposed to be, let&#039;s say,</div><div id="00:14:33.440" class="transcript_line"> on the lower deck. He carried me all up on the top deck and everything and foolish me</div><div id="00:14:39.080" class="transcript_line"> for him. Even though we were wrong or not supposed to be, we were still going. So before</div><div id="00:14:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I came up here, you know, I was discussing it. How long were you? How long were you?</div><div id="00:14:53.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t even remember. I think around that. Around 20 years old? Yeah. And when did you</div><div id="00:15:03.360" class="transcript_line"> come? So what was it like when you arrived? Well, we went to Madrid. We landed in Madrid</div><div id="00:15:11.400" class="transcript_line"> in Spain. And my friend is leaning over the railing for the ship because I leave from</div><div id="00:15:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Spain to come to Cardiff by train. But leaning over the railing, you see people. Oh no, for</div><div id="00:15:29.320" class="transcript_line"> now from Spain, we leave from Spain to Southampton. And then you see some people, when the Spanish</div><div id="00:15:35.800" class="transcript_line"> women, well, I mean, they were more or less dressed in black as well. And when you see</div><div id="00:15:43.440" class="transcript_line"> them speaking, you see steam coming out of their mouth. So when I tell my friend, look</div><div id="00:15:51.920" class="transcript_line"> at them, steam coming out of their mouth, he says, you too. I said, you too. So you</div><div id="00:15:58.920" class="transcript_line"> came in winter perhaps? Yes, it was in February I came here. What were you wearing, do you</div><div id="00:16:05.920" class="transcript_line"> remember? Were you ready for the weather? No. Funny enough, I had a cardigan that I</div><div id="00:16:11.200" class="transcript_line"> brought from home because that was only for style, really, because in the West End you</div><div id="00:16:16.400" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t need them. So luckily I wore it. What color was the cardigan? I think roughly was</div><div id="00:16:29.400" class="transcript_line"> red and black. Red, white and black. Yeah, white was up here, red up here, white in the</div><div id="00:16:37.400" class="transcript_line"> middle and black down here. Could always remember that. So what was your first impression of</div><div id="00:16:45.400" class="transcript_line"> Britain? So you saw the coal coming out of the mouth and when you step out, what was</div><div id="00:16:50.400" class="transcript_line"> it like for you? Well, we stay on the ship and then we came to Southampton and then we</div><div id="00:16:57.400" class="transcript_line"> land in Southampton. Well, me, all on my own. I don&#039;t know nobody. So I asked a man, look,</div><div id="00:17:06.400" class="transcript_line"> he was very polite and kind and he said, oh, I&#039;ll go up the rail and drop you up the</div><div id="00:17:13.400" class="transcript_line"> road. Well, on hindsight now, I think I was taking a chance because I don&#039;t know the people,</div><div id="00:17:20.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know the place, so he couldn&#039;t go anywhere with me or whatever because he was</div><div id="00:17:25.640" class="transcript_line"> a man, he was a boy. So, you know, took the chance but I mean everything worked out to</div><div id="00:17:32.200" class="transcript_line"> the end and he said, if you don&#039;t know what to do, ask any one of them people, they in</div><div id="00:17:39.200" class="transcript_line"> black, like the porters on the railway. And then? Then come to Cardiff. How come you came</div><div id="00:17:48.200" class="transcript_line"> to Cardiff? Is that where your sister was? Yes. And why did she come to Cardiff? Why</div><div id="00:17:52.200" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff? Well, I thought, my home father is one half pay for her, so when they say half,</div><div id="00:18:00.200" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t like to elaborate too much on that part of it. But let&#039;s say for convenience</div><div id="00:18:07.200" class="transcript_line"> sake, my father sent four. Okay, and he was here already? Yes. Okay, so you already had</div><div id="00:18:15.200" class="transcript_line"> a crew waiting for you? No, nobody was waiting for me. I had to find my way from the train</div><div id="00:18:22.200" class="transcript_line"> station to South Church Street. You know where South Church Street is? What was that like?</div><div id="00:18:34.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, then on my way almost out of the train station, my brother and brother-in-law turned</div><div id="00:18:43.200" class="transcript_line"> up. So they helped me. We walked down the back canal, you know, and then come down the</div><div id="00:18:52.200" class="transcript_line"> back. And then the first person I met was a friend, a fellow. He was much older than</div><div id="00:19:03.760" class="transcript_line"> me. And he used to, when we were in the grammar school, we played sports and so on. And Sunday</div><div id="00:19:13.840" class="transcript_line"> school time coming up, and we don&#039;t go. He&#039;d call us. Come on, you had to go Sunday school,</div><div id="00:19:21.480" class="transcript_line"> because Sunday school. But then when I look, the man had a big long cigarette in his mouth.</div><div id="00:19:29.480" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, cook, you don&#039;t do names like that. As a Christian, he said, boy, it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:19:35.480" class="transcript_line"> different story over here, you know. Was he from St. Kitts as well? Yes, yeah. Well, and</div><div id="00:19:43.480" class="transcript_line"> he was a good cook eater too. And then more or less, you could say I learned from him.</div><div id="00:19:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you find the transition easy? So you came to Butown? Yes. Did you find the transition</div><div id="00:20:03.960" class="transcript_line"> easy from, besides the weather, from St. Kitts to Butown? Yes, because I mean, almost not</div><div id="00:20:10.960" class="transcript_line"> good. It was okay for me, because nobody really used to bother me or something like</div><div id="00:20:18.600" class="transcript_line"> that. And I had a friend. His brother was here as well. Well, you might know him, what</div><div id="00:20:25.600" class="transcript_line"> we call Dexter. Well, many grew up from the same village. And so I had a, you could say</div><div id="00:20:33.360" class="transcript_line"> a friend, so we could correspond with each other.</div><div id="00:20:40.760" class="transcript_line"> What was Butown like at that time? So you didn&#039;t have to go to school at that age? No.</div><div id="00:20:44.760" class="transcript_line"> What did you do? I had to work. Soon as I came, I had to get the first job. But as I</div><div id="00:20:51.760" class="transcript_line"> said, I won&#039;t go into the details, because it might be embarrassing for somebody else.</div><div id="00:20:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So roughly, was it easy to get a job? At the time, no. The most jobs you&#039;ll get</div><div id="00:21:05.760" class="transcript_line"> are factory jobs, because my brother-in-law was working down the post office. I applied</div><div id="00:21:14.920" class="transcript_line"> for a job down there, and they told me they&#039;ll let me know. I&#039;m still waiting for them to</div><div id="00:21:21.120" class="transcript_line"> let me know. About a year or so ago, I found a letter, but in vexation, I ripped it up,</div><div id="00:21:29.120" class="transcript_line"> I think. The guy said, look, they&#039;re supposed to let me know, and they&#039;re supposed to be</div><div id="00:21:36.120" class="transcript_line"> this and that. So. Was it like that? Was that a common thing? Going for different jobs and</div><div id="00:21:44.120" class="transcript_line"> them saying they&#039;ll get back to you and not getting back to you? Well, as I said, I didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:47.640" class="transcript_line"> have too many jobs, but those that I really went for, I got. So, I mean, first job I refused.</div><div id="00:21:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Was a place named John Williams over East Mores, and the place they wanted me to work</div><div id="00:22:04.320" class="transcript_line"> where they had vacancy is a place they call Knockout, the Knockout. The Knockout is like</div><div id="00:22:10.720" class="transcript_line"> a furnace. I just come from the West Indies, I&#039;m hot already. I mean, let&#039;s say up there</div><div id="00:22:19.200" class="transcript_line"> in the center, the furnace down here, and I&#039;m sweating. I said, no, thanks. And then</div><div id="00:22:26.800" class="transcript_line"> when I went to a place named Super Oil Seals, got a job there. Then after about 11, 12 years</div><div id="00:22:38.560" class="transcript_line"> or so, I pack up Super Oil Seals and went to the skill center. We learned welding. And</div><div id="00:22:45.560" class="transcript_line"> after about a year or so, place over there, my sense, they used to make radiators and</div><div id="00:22:57.800" class="transcript_line"> they fold up. So then I was working for nearly three years. And then, as I said, I used to</div><div id="00:23:04.800" class="transcript_line"> come to the center often, and the aviator named John Winslet, this morning, he sent</div><div id="00:23:17.600" class="transcript_line"> an application in the Western Mail, and he got one for me. And he called me and he told</div><div id="00:23:24.600" class="transcript_line"> me, here, as I said to you before, here you are now, go and sell yourself, fill out the</div><div id="00:23:31.920" class="transcript_line"> form. And after filling out the form, I said, Mr. Winslet, could you look at it for me and</div><div id="00:23:38.080" class="transcript_line"> see? He said, why, no. Because if you make a mistake, you&#039;re going to say it&#039;s true me,</div><div id="00:23:43.080" class="transcript_line"> but you ain&#039;t get the job. And as I said to you, the only form, I mean, internally in</div><div id="00:23:50.280" class="transcript_line"> this council, because of the housing department, I did apply for different jobs. And I passed</div><div id="00:23:58.280" class="transcript_line"> them, but especially the last one was to be like the, what&#039;s it called, over Nelson House</div><div id="00:24:14.280" class="transcript_line"> here. And after the lot, well, you might know some university people did apply as well too,</div><div id="00:24:21.280" class="transcript_line"> but some of them was too qualified. So I got the job, because of the rest who left,</div><div id="00:24:29.640" class="transcript_line"> I had the best specification of the rest. But what you think happened? My boss, she</div><div id="00:24:37.720" class="transcript_line"> named Blondwin Lloyd, she gave it to one of her friends. And she said, I&#039;m going to</div><div id="00:24:51.440" class="transcript_line"> picks me up from Bethesda health hospital, checked there〜now. Not only I connected to</div><div id="00:24:58.380" class="transcript_line"> a computer, it was my wszystko, I was busy. And I got up, it was minutes before the weekend,</div><div id="00:25:09.520" class="transcript_line"> 10 or 11 o&#039;clock, in the morning, three hours before the route came up, I had a call from</div><div id="00:25:16.520" class="transcript_line"> said, oh, you got a watertight case. That&#039;s no problem. Come back and I told my wife.</div><div id="00:25:22.960" class="transcript_line"> And she started crying. And she said, oh, we might have repercussions and all these</div><div id="00:25:32.720" class="transcript_line"> other things. And then what&#039;s going to happen to us and this and that. So I said, all right,</div><div id="00:25:37.920" class="transcript_line"> no problem. I just continued to work. I forgot about it. Then the person who got the job,</div><div id="00:25:47.200" class="transcript_line"> you might know her. She lives in Hodges Square, Washington, you know,</div><div id="00:25:53.520" class="transcript_line"> in Clay&#039;s Moose. Anyway, she got the job. And the woman, Kooni, said spell</div><div id="00:25:59.760" class="transcript_line"> con sage. And she asked me. And she was supposed to get my job. So this is other.</div><div id="00:26:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And then I had to play the same housing, same manager, Blowing Light, to do the cashier.</div><div id="00:26:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, you pick up rent and so on. And she turned me down. She gave it to another</div><div id="00:26:27.760" class="transcript_line"> fellow, which is white. And that white person turned around, teased him when he run. And then</div><div id="00:26:39.680" class="transcript_line"> she got another student. And student went to university. And when the student is</div><div id="00:26:52.360" class="transcript_line"> absent, if she don&#039;t come in there, she&#039;ll ask me to go to cashier desk until one day.</div><div id="00:27:03.040" class="transcript_line"> I decide enough is enough. And when she asks me, I won&#039;t tell you what I tell her. I could tell</div><div id="00:27:10.680" class="transcript_line"> you privately, but I won&#039;t tell you now. So working was always a bit of a challenge</div><div id="00:27:17.880" class="transcript_line"> in terms of finding the rights. You said you got married. You used your wife from Sinkitz as well?</div><div id="00:27:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, you could say, yes, Sinkitz Nevis. Well, she born in Nevis, but she went to Sinkitz to live</div><div id="00:27:36.280" class="transcript_line"> with her father. But I didn&#039;t know until I come here. So there was a big Caribbean community here at the time?</div><div id="00:27:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Yes. A lot. Well, what they told me that is the council move them out, put them all,</div><div id="00:27:51.280" class="transcript_line"> when they start developing the docks, they put them all different estates and so on. Like a lot went</div><div id="00:28:00.520" class="transcript_line"> to Ely, some went to Land Army, some went to Trowbridge and so on. Because that side developed</div><div id="00:28:07.800" class="transcript_line"> before the docks area. I think you might know some of that already.</div><div id="00:28:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Okay. All right. So in terms of the challenges you faced being here so far, so you had the ones with</div><div id="00:28:23.160" class="transcript_line"> work, you know, were there any other main challenges that you experienced being here to where you are now?</div><div id="00:28:30.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how to explain that. But I know, well, I was lucky in a sense because we form a cricket</div><div id="00:28:41.520" class="transcript_line"> team because when they came here first, they had a Bajoran cricket team they called Spartans. And at</div><div id="00:28:48.840" class="transcript_line"> the time, well, you could see in my photograph, I was skinny. And when they were playing some,</div><div id="00:28:58.320" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s say a side, I mean the team or the club had picked two sides. And this fellow left them</div><div id="00:29:07.840" class="transcript_line"> and went to play for somebody else. But he was a Bajoran. And the fellow looked around and he</div><div id="00:29:15.920" class="transcript_line"> said, I look the smallest. He said, I&#039;m serious. Now he tell me go off the field. And then me and</div><div id="00:29:23.280" class="transcript_line"> my brother-in-law came up. And as I said, we live in South Church Street. And, you know, it was right</div><div id="00:29:32.960" class="transcript_line"> by the church. This club named Spartan, not Spartan, Combine was having a meeting because they were just</div><div id="00:29:40.320" class="transcript_line"> farming as well. And went in there and they invited me with open arms and I went and we joined</div><div id="00:29:50.160" class="transcript_line"> that. And I played for Combine and we got a few more kitties and so on because it was</div><div id="00:29:57.760" class="transcript_line"> more or less kitties who were farming. And then we get a good side, put it away. And we used to</div><div id="00:30:07.840" class="transcript_line"> beat everybody. And then we didn&#039;t have much more challenges. So some of us broke away. And then we</div><div id="00:30:17.280" class="transcript_line"> had a better team then, a better club. We called it Progressive. And Progressive was a team we know</div><div id="00:30:30.320" class="transcript_line"> from St. Kitts. That&#039;s why we gave it that name. And some of the Bajorans who was in</div><div id="00:30:38.240" class="transcript_line"> the club, the Spartans and so on, came and joined us. And well, I was the club secretary,</div><div id="00:30:50.480" class="transcript_line"> treasurer secretary. And I was lucky enough. I met another, I think she born here,</div><div id="00:31:01.200" class="transcript_line"> she come from St. Kitts Little. Sure you might know, Donna Lyburn. No, she&#039;s in London now.</div><div id="00:31:09.760" class="transcript_line"> She used to work, well funny enough she and my wife used to work in David Morgan&#039;s.</div><div id="00:31:17.360" class="transcript_line"> And then she went and she started working for the Bay, Cardiff Bay, you know that. And</div><div id="00:31:24.640" class="transcript_line"> every year used to get grants for the cricket club and so on. So we was, you could say successful.</div><div id="00:31:35.680" class="transcript_line"> And then I was the first black man that got to say please get a cricket pitch</div><div id="00:31:45.600" class="transcript_line"> for our club. It overfits Allen.</div><div id="00:31:49.920" class="transcript_line"> The head of Cardiff Bay at the time was a man named Mr. Inking. And Mr. Inking did like cricket</div><div id="00:32:01.920" class="transcript_line"> so he used to go down there and we talk and talk and talk and you know he get his people</div><div id="00:32:09.600" class="transcript_line"> who used to work in Victoria Park. You know they do gardening and so on. And they fix up the pitch</div><div id="00:32:18.000" class="transcript_line"> first and then some people you know at the parts of the club think they know it all.</div><div id="00:32:30.400" class="transcript_line"> And when they start saying they know it all, I leave it all to them and I pull away.</div><div id="00:32:38.320" class="transcript_line"> But as I said you could say from the trophy when we when we joined the cricket club we joined</div><div id="00:32:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Midweek League Division 4. And every year we promote from four, three, two,</div><div id="00:32:54.240" class="transcript_line"> till we become the champions. Even before we become champions we was beating the champions.</div><div id="00:33:02.080" class="transcript_line"> And then we joined the Morgana Cricket League and they put us Division 5.</div><div id="00:33:08.480" class="transcript_line"> And we work ourselves right up to champions as well. So we had a good good successful local</div><div id="00:33:20.160" class="transcript_line"> cricket team. And he said we used to have two and three trophies every year.</div><div id="00:33:27.520" class="transcript_line"> You played cricket in St. Kitts before you came here?</div><div id="00:33:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Well not at this not on that scale.</div><div id="00:33:36.080" class="transcript_line"> You know I mean we mostly used to play with tennis balls and then rubber balls.</div><div id="00:33:44.960" class="transcript_line"> So and then a little bit of this kind of cricket but not on a high scale.</div><div id="00:33:52.880" class="transcript_line"> How important is it do you think or how important was it to have something</div><div id="00:33:57.760" class="transcript_line"> like a community that you did something with and excelled in? How important was that for you?</div><div id="00:34:04.160" class="transcript_line"> Very important. I feel very nice. But up to now with the centre we had a lot of lot of problems.</div><div id="00:34:14.400" class="transcript_line"> Because well as you know we used to play home and away. And people used to get jealous because we</div><div id="00:34:25.280" class="transcript_line"> get jealous because we used to bring at one time I had about seven or eight coaches come here.</div><div id="00:34:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Right and they used to say it&#039;s a West Indian centre.</div><div id="00:34:39.920" class="transcript_line"> So we had problem with the local. It&#039;s a really the local</div><div id="00:34:46.240" class="transcript_line"> councillor at that time and the local people.</div><div id="00:34:50.880" class="transcript_line"> So we had a lot a lot of problems and from cricket you could say to dominos we&#039;re still having</div><div id="00:34:59.040" class="transcript_line"> problems. Because if you notice a lot of the people and I mean I don&#039;t have to spell it out for you</div><div id="00:35:04.960" class="transcript_line"> you know that they&#039;re really thinking what domino domino gets and that&#039;s fair. But we are the ones</div><div id="00:35:13.840" class="transcript_line"> who are supporting the place all the time. I mean if you go out there now you&#039;ll see more</div><div id="00:35:19.200" class="transcript_line"> domino people out there using the place. I&#039;m not saying we spend all the a lot a lot of cash but</div><div id="00:35:27.440" class="transcript_line"> at least we&#039;re always here. And sometimes we spend more cash than he said for a hundred and I&#039;m coming.</div><div id="00:35:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Than he said for a hundred and I&#039;m coming.</div><div id="00:35:42.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Oh it&#039;s ongoing. I remember they had um one fellow who used to play for us his name</div><div id="00:35:53.120" class="transcript_line"> Ghulam. He was from South Africa. He was a nice player and he was a nice nice fellow educated fellow.</div><div id="00:36:01.360" class="transcript_line"> And they form because black people was getting so much problems they find a black alliance.</div><div id="00:36:10.480" class="transcript_line"> And they had that on the youth center used to be just across you there by the paddle</div><div id="00:36:17.520" class="transcript_line"> in the grounds of the two the highways flats there. It was right down to the end</div><div id="00:36:25.360" class="transcript_line"> because they were my welcome after that. And they had a meeting in there. Right.</div><div id="00:36:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And they called the counselor and the counselor tell them or tell this one fellow to go back</div><div id="00:36:43.120" class="transcript_line"> from where he come. The counselor said that. Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:48.640" class="transcript_line"> Well I don&#039;t know I&#039;m not sure if she was the counselor at that time but she became the counselor.</div><div id="00:37:00.240" class="transcript_line"> So do you feel even though you had lived here for such a long time since you were 20</div><div id="00:37:06.160" class="transcript_line"> that you were still always an outsider. Yes. Do you still feel like an outsider. Yes because I mean</div><div id="00:37:13.040" class="transcript_line"> because of being people I&#039;ll tell you something. I mean a few years when I was running the bar</div><div id="00:37:21.520" class="transcript_line"> this fellow came in. He lived he used to live in Angelina Street and he was a big thing.</div><div id="00:37:30.960" class="transcript_line"> He came here a bit tipsy and when you tipsy as a barman you&#039;re not supposed to sell people more</div><div id="00:37:36.880" class="transcript_line"> alcohol. And he called me. I won&#039;t put it on there but an outsider.</div><div id="00:37:46.880" class="transcript_line"> And I must go back where I come from too.</div><div id="00:37:51.600" class="transcript_line"> And one night the same man he fell down out in the car park. That time we had a little car park out</div><div id="00:37:58.080" class="transcript_line"> there. Don&#039;t know if you remember the center before it broke down. He was a little boy. He was a</div><div id="00:38:03.360" class="transcript_line"> little car park out there. Don&#039;t know if you remember the center before it broke down.</div><div id="00:38:07.600" class="transcript_line"> But anyway there was a car park there and who had to pick him up.</div><div id="00:38:13.520" class="transcript_line"> You know so these are the other things.</div><div id="00:38:18.640" class="transcript_line"> What I didn&#039;t want to tell you yet when Chalky White was running the</div><div id="00:38:24.800" class="transcript_line"> youth center. Yes of course when I got married</div><div id="00:38:28.160" class="transcript_line"> he helped me to arrange everything like what I call it</div><div id="00:38:39.440" class="transcript_line"> wedding lunch or whatever you want to call it. So it was the reception.</div><div id="00:38:48.640" class="transcript_line"> And he do everything for me and so on. I just get the goods and everything. And</div><div id="00:38:55.360" class="transcript_line"> like how we used to work here then the brewery gave me a keg of beer.</div><div id="00:39:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And I had a lot a lot of about at least 12 cases of beer from the ship from the West Indies because</div><div id="00:39:14.000" class="transcript_line"> some of them we used to go down barry and pick them up and some rum and so on. So we had a very very</div><div id="00:39:23.520" class="transcript_line"> we had a very very good thing. We had so much and a friend of mine cooked the curry</div><div id="00:39:32.240" class="transcript_line"> and everybody coming back for more curry and he called me I said I ain&#039;t got no more.</div><div id="00:39:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Right he named Wilmot and we had so much booze that we went back the next day the Sunday</div><div id="00:39:47.280" class="transcript_line"> and we were still drinking.</div><div id="00:39:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Chalky White was from Jamaica? Yes.</div><div id="00:39:57.280" class="transcript_line"> So basically the West Indians that came you know after the World War II</div><div id="00:40:03.280" class="transcript_line"> really kind of did significant stuff in the space. Yes well nearly all as far as they understand it</div><div id="00:40:12.800" class="transcript_line"> nearly all West Indians who come to Cardiff branch off from in the Bay.</div><div id="00:40:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Nearly all as far as I know I mean the oldest one might come and go different here is if let&#039;s say</div><div id="00:40:26.560" class="transcript_line"> for instance me and my children come to me now that I&#039;m living we are living now. That&#039;s why</div><div id="00:40:34.480" class="transcript_line"> they won&#039;t have so much connection with the Bay. But nearly everybody had connection from the Bay.</div><div id="00:40:42.080" class="transcript_line"> Do they all live in one area?
