    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> When you were a kid and your parents, how was growing up and what were your parents like?</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I had a bit of a saddish growing up because when I was about, I&#039;d say, eight, eight years old, something like that,</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> my mother had a nervous breakdown and remained in hospital for a good few years. So it was my father that was bringing me and my brother up.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That must have been hard.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was hard for my father. As a matter of fact, my father was my brother&#039;s stepfather because my mother had been married to her first husband and had my brother.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And then later on she had me, but in them days after we&#039;d so long for a divorce. And when my mother did get divorced, she married my father.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But she&#039;d already had me then. So there was a serious difference between me and my brother.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when, you know, we did live here in the bay, me going to St Mary&#039;s School and my brother.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, I more or less grew up with my father, the two of us up. So later on, I did go down with my aunt and uncle to live with me and my brother.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Where was that then?</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, I had a happy childhood, you know, going to St. Louis School. I went to live with my aunt and uncle at the age I was just getting on for 12.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was 12 years old in February. But until then, because my father had been called to see when 1939, the war broke out.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was taken away and was left with a good friend of ours that was living in the house.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And which my father left me in charge, you know, the lady who took care of me, because my brother was working then.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And that had happened. My father, I don&#039;t think he was out to sleep for long when he was taught pedo twice.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father ended up as prisoner of war.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, people forget merchants seeming were prisoners of war.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, well then, my brother, I&#039;ll tell you about, he lost his life. My brother Freddie, on his first trip to sea during the war,</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> he was so intent on getting on a ship, which he joined with my cousins, the brother, the son of my aunt and uncle I was living with.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The two of them joined the ship with my cousin, which was my aunt&#039;s son, even my brother.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There was only a day&#039;s difference between their birthdays. 17 years old, and my brother was so intent on going to sea.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousin, who was with him, he&#039;d already done, I think, a trip or two.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But when they joined the ship, put the docks here, my cousin asked my brother to come off the ship, because it was like an old boat, he said.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, this was like the war was raging then.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And my cousin came off and my brother stayed on the ship and it was torpedoed. My brother was lost at sea.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It was only that they hadn&#039;t even been out. I got all the details of the ship, where it was sunk, the German submarine that torpedoed them.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I have three megalos for my brother. So he was lost, because he&#039;d already left what we call a denudation allotment for my aunt, for somebody to take care of me.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But we never even drew the first allotment. I remember the telegram came in my name to my aunt&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was 15 then, or 14. And the telegram came to me, because I was his next of kin, to say that they were missing at sea, presumed dead.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got all the particulars here about the sinking of my brother&#039;s ship.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was also a boy that was in my class. He was only 14, because he was in my class and my brother was three years older than me.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he went down on the ship with my brother. And another boy, a good friend of my brother&#039;s, they were both learning to play the guitar.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a picture here of them, it said going on the Woodson Street. And that friend of his, he was on the ship as well.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So there were three, you know, from my school that went down on that ship. I think it&#039;s our hill.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s the thing, people don&#039;t get it. Yes, people went to war in the army, but you could be 14 and die on the merchant. You couldn&#039;t be 14 and join the army.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ve got a list of all the people that went down on that ship, on the SS Whitestone.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Also, I&#039;ve been to Tower Hill and seen the plaques. And yeah, it&#039;s sad that most of the men were from Cardiff that went down on that ship.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Got all their names, names of them, their mothers, you know.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And it would all have been Cardiff families.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So when a ship went down that went off at Cardiff, and I mean, as you say, with the torpedoes, a load of ships was sunk near the Bristol Channel. They didn&#039;t even go in there.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah. I think they were heading. I&#039;m not sure if it was New Zealand or somewhere like that.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> But I got all the details here, you know, from the journey they were taking.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But they sailed, well, I&#039;d say they&#039;d been out to Cardiff for two weeks or whatever when they were atop the coast. Yeah, so that was my brother I lost.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was the surname then? What was your brother&#039;s surname?</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother&#039;s surname was Frederick William Johnson.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Johnson. So because that was that a family name or that was his first dad&#039;s name?</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That was his. My mum was married to his father. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I think his father&#039;s name was William Johnson. Right.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I got birthed into the kids, you know, my mother&#039;s marriage lines and that.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was your first, what was your original name then Laura?</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I was always known as Laura Savage. Right. My mother married my father.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, when a divorce came through, she married my father.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve always been known as Laura Savage. But at one time when I went to get a birth certificate,</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and my mother wasn&#039;t married to my father at the time she had me.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Originally, I should have been known as Laura Johnson. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I remember I went to when I was working and we used to have not an original birth certificate.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You could always get a birth certificate if you were working in a factory or something like that.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And the factory I was working in, I went to the registry office for a birth certificate and gave them my name.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And they searched and searched for this birth certificate for Savage, my name, Laura Savage.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I was named after my mother. And I remember the lady came down.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, you know, she couldn&#039;t find my name, my name. What was my mother&#039;s maiden name?</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when they found out. And I always remember I tell a few of my friends now.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She came back and she said, you know what? She said, your name is Laura Johnson.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> She said, because when my mother had me and registered me, I had to be registered in my mother&#039;s name, you see,</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> because she wasn&#039;t married to my father at the time. Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember, I remember the day my mother got married in Loughnose Square Methodist Church.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had come from, I was going to some early school then in the primaries.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember coming home from school and where is my mother and my father and the lady,</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was always you had two rooms, you know, one room down then two rooms up and whatever.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And wherever you lived in Canal Peray, the lady of the house, I think someone was left there,</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> because they were having a bit of a reception. I didn&#039;t know at the time.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I came home, you know, looking for my mum and dad, the lady said to me, your mum got married this morning.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can see it now. I tell all my friends. And I thought, so I left the house because I know my mother</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> was a very good-natured and very nice and very nice member of the West Alley,</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> of the Square, the Sisterhood and everything. And I went now looking and here was my mum and my father</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> coming from the church, almost reaching the house where we lived. And they were coming back, I mean,</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> after being married, I think I was six years old then. But I can remember that day like it was yesterday.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I was going to Samaritan School then, a primary. Well then a few years after that,</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> my mum, what we would call today a nervous breakdown, because my nan always told us a story.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When my mother was young, it was a fairground they had in Wood Street when my mother was like a teenager.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And she had a fall out of a swinging boat. And it must have fallen. She was injured.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And my nan always said, they told her the size, that my mother, something would happen with her.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But if she was all right, she&#039;d be saved at 21. See if she was okay by then.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But it must have came on her, you know, a few years later. And today it would be called a nervous breakdown.</div><div id="00:11:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And get some treatment for it. But my mother at that time, you know, you went to hospital stay.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother used to come out occasionally, but then go back. But my dad took a good rough name of bringing us up.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Until we went to my aunt and uncle to live. And then my father was taken to his reward.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it, when you went to live with your aunt and uncle, was that far or was it local or?</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, it was just, at the time that I was living, when my father left me and my brother, where we were,</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> because my father was the tenant of the house, and when he left to go to sea,</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> he signed it over to this family that we knew that had taken rooms in the house with us.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So my father signed over the tenancy to the lady, Mrs. Jason, you see.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So then when I went down to live with my aunt and uncle, I was just going out for 12.</div><div id="00:12:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And my brother was 15 then. He was working, my brother. He had a job working in, he&#039;d also, before that, he had joined the Air Force cadets.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a picture of him in his Air Force uniform, cadet uniform.</div><div id="00:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, back in the third, civil to three, he packed everything up.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The cadet, on his job, he was working in a place in here in Canal Parade.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a ladder firm called Farnall. And my cousin, the two of them, of course we were in the house together,</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> my aunt and uncle&#039;s son, and that was my cousin, Joey.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Joey and Freddie, they both were from Farnall. Another place.</div><div id="00:13:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He had a job, so of course, getting the urge to go to this, let&#039;s see, and went and never returned.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So my father was taken. In the meantime, that&#039;s why we had to go down with my aunt and uncle to live,</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> because no money was coming in. Like the allotment my father had left to the lady for me at Seast.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, he was taken prisoner of war, so there was no money coming for me.</div><div id="00:13:58.000" class="transcript_line"> After my aunt and uncle said, you know, that lady can&#039;t be taken care of, one of them, you know, Freddie was working,</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> because she had children of her own. So my aunt and uncle, who we were very close to, you know, because my mother&#039;s sister,</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said, you know, then children got to come down with us.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So where did your aunt and uncle live?</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Down in Stewart Street.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right, so still in the bay.</div><div id="00:14:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, only ten minutes away from where we were, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it would have been so much worse if you had to move completely.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, and plus I had aunts all around, you know, because my mother was in Grains Town, and my nana&#039;s house was in Grains Town.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> My nana had passed away then, but of course that is a family house. My aunt lived there until she died.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had a few aunts, you know, scattered around.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Big family then?</div><div id="00:15:00.000" class="transcript_line"> No, my mother had four sisters, and before Donald, you know, my mother had three sisters and two brothers.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, so how was school then? How was school?</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh school, I was in St Mary&#039;s in the primary.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think I left St Mary&#039;s when I was about seven, something like that.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we did have a time, at that time you moved from one house to another, me and my father and my brother.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And at one time we did move, my aunt and uncle, this was before they moved to Stewart Street, they lived in Homesdale Street.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember we went down there to live, me and my brother and my father, we went to the same house, my aunt and uncle.</div><div id="00:16:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And then eventually we came back up and we were living in Albert Square.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, most of my life was spent in that period when I went down to Grange Town, because I was in Grange Council.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it must have only been for about a year or something like that.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, like when I came back, I went to South Jersey School.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to South Jersey School from the time I was, oh, I think it was about, I think it was about ten when I started in South Jersey School.</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like the children change now, at age 11 they go to another school.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was about, it comes from Grange Town then, I went to South Jersey School.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> From the time I was about 10 or 11 until I left at the age of 14.</div><div id="00:17:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I still got my leaving school card, I found here a few years ago.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I should ask you, when your dad was a prisoner of war, what was it like when he came back?</div><div id="00:17:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, my dad wasn&#039;t a prisoner of war in Germany.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> The only proof I&#039;ve got is, of course, my father was West African, you see.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he was a prisoner of war, the only proof I&#039;ve got is prisoner of war in French New Guinea.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> See, he wasn&#039;t a prisoner of war in Germany, French New Guinea.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a letter here, the only proof I have got, and of course, me being young at the time,</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ve still got these letters, still, you know, I&#039;ve kept them, you know, whatever.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The only proof I&#039;ve got is a letter that my father had sent, addressed to me,</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> must have gone to the house when I was living with my aunt, that&#039;s when my father was imprisoned.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That somebody had wrote for, because, you know, my father used to sign the cross, you know.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was a letter someone had written, and it was to me, you know, it was my father&#039;s statement.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> This person had written the letter for my father, and asking that, I think,</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> it was like my brother to take care of me, something to that effect.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got the address, you know, the top of the letter.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> The person had written, and my father had got his cross at the bottom.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the only proof I&#039;ve got that my father was in this prison of war camp, you know.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s better, that&#039;s better.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I would tell him to write down.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re okay now, I can hear you again.</div><div id="00:19:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You were saying about your father, the guy wrote the letter for him.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this is like my dad&#039;s words to him, you know, he must have been saying, you know,</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> he must have asked the chap, you know, send this to my daughter, you know.</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> To tell me we&#039;re all right and whatever.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And if we could, to send something out of that, I don&#039;t know if it was, you know,</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> like clothes or food stuff, anything like that.</div><div id="00:19:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I could show anyone what I&#039;ve got here.</div><div id="00:19:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Did your father come home?</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, he came home.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a funny thing because he was a sick man before he left.</div><div id="00:19:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course they were taking anyone, you know.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d been home from sea for years, you know, looking after us children.</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, he came home and he was home for about, he came home,</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he was home for about two years when he died.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> He did do, when he came home, he went back to sea because he died at sea, my father.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:20:17.000" class="transcript_line"> On I think about the second trip on a ship he was on and he died at sea.</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ve got my father&#039;s certificates, you know, from when,</div><div id="00:20:29.000" class="transcript_line"> because he left me a little bit of money.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Because before he joined the ship that he died on, I was 15 at the time, a teenager.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But we used to, we had a club in Glutony there where we used to go dancing, you know,</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> as a teenager.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he knew you always find me there, you know, after like the evening time.</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And before he joined the ship the day before, he came to find me because I was still living down with my aunt and uncle.</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came to see me before he went because his last words was, he told me, he said,</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> if he didn&#039;t come back, I can remember saying to him, oh, don&#039;t say that, Dad.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, if I don&#039;t come back, he told me what to do.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He left a message.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to go to these solicitors.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that, he didn&#039;t come back.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after getting in touch with the solicitor, who was my co-in-law at the time in Working Street,</div><div id="00:21:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and my dad had left me some money.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course I had some assets.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> As a matter of fact, my mother had passed away at the time.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was from this money that my father left me that I paid for my mother&#039;s funeral.</div><div id="00:21:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So, is that all?</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Not an easy upbringing at all, was it?</div><div id="00:21:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s be fair, Laura.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not saying, I mean, it wasn&#039;t easy, but...</div><div id="00:22:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="00:22:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard for everybody, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard for everybody.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve caught up with the mum and dad.</div><div id="00:22:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember all the times with my mother.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she was great, my mother.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s not many who remember my mother, but there was one person, she always just said to me,</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember your mother, Laura, she was such a docile woman.</div><div id="00:22:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, your mother is a quiet woman.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can remember.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my mum used to take us to the house.</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I always went to Sunday school.</div><div id="00:22:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And on a Sunday evening, I&#039;d be in the Square Methodist for them, the evening service, every Sunday with my mum.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So, let&#039;s jump a bit.</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you go on the school trips?</div><div id="00:22:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Not on school trips, no, but on the Woodson Street.</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the Woodson Street. Yeah, the church trips, yeah.</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The Woodson Street from Lowes Square.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I got a picture here of the lorries taking them.</div><div id="00:23:08.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother is on it, and one or two boys from school.</div><div id="00:23:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, this was more or less like most of the boys that went to South Jersey school.</div><div id="00:23:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And from Lowes Square Methodist, most of us in the Gales and Boys Life Brigade.</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve got a picture of them on the truck, you know, just outside leaving to go on the Woodson Street.</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used to think it was so nice.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be stuck in a field maybe, I think at other times, I think there was landlion or something like that.</div><div id="00:23:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we thought it was such a posh place, you know.</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d be stuck in a field with all cows in the next field, and whatever.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And oh yeah, every year we&#039;d have the Woodson Street and have our races and everything.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> That was from Lowes Square. Of course, a lot of the kids went to the mission in Angelina Street, you know.</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> That was their Sunday school.</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you had Samaritan&#039;s Church, you know, that was all three churches at the time, the Bay Area.</div><div id="00:24:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Samaritan&#039;s is still going strong.</div><div id="00:24:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Lowes Square was knocked down, and now it&#039;s just a small place, St Paul&#039;s Church.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> People say about how actually elegant the houses were in Lowes Square.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Lowes Square Church, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve got any pictures of it.</div><div id="00:24:44.000" class="transcript_line"> There were no pictures around. Oh, that was a big church, yes.</div><div id="00:24:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember going there when we&#039;d put the Magic Lansons, but we used to pay a penny to go to.</div><div id="00:24:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the first time we ever seen, honestly, Magic Lansons.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Those houses were big old houses as well, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, them houses they reckon, you know, were owned by doctors and people at those ship-holding.</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, they were elegant houses.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> There were two sides there, they had basements, you know.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there were three sides that had basements, because we had our park.</div><div id="00:25:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We had our park right in the middle of Lowes Square.</div><div id="00:25:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That park that we had, it had a fountain in the middle, and that fountain was very deep.</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was it rained all around, but it was very deep that fountain.</div><div id="00:25:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You saw to it went up a bit of a hill, and you climbed, so you got to the railing.</div><div id="00:25:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, there&#039;s no way you could get there unless you wanted to jump in and drown yourself.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a beautiful park.</div><div id="00:26:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then later on in the years, they put some, we did have a stream,</div><div id="00:26:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and then later on they put more rides for us there, you know.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when we used to come from school, and about, say, about five o&#039;clock, or about five,</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> the boys, now and again, they&#039;d have a boxing match, and a ring would be put up.</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember a few of the boys, and they&#039;d have a boxing match, you know, with two of the boys,</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> or, you know, a few volunteering to fight each other.</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we had some lovely school days there, mind, told in the day.</div><div id="00:26:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, so many people were related, and families going back as friends for years.</div><div id="00:26:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, but regardless whether you was related or not, I mean, everyone&#039;s door was open,</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> and everyone was auntie, your aunt, your uncle.</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> As soon as next door to someone, they were always auntie, and as they sent you to the shop,</div><div id="00:27:13.000" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t want to go, you would have to go, you know.</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no way you could say no, you&#039;re not going, or whatever like that.</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And then people were so generous, you know, we&#039;d have a butter,</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d hate me to go into the shop, or whatever.</div><div id="00:27:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But, oh yeah, it was a community, it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:27:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, someone described it to me as the village in Cardiff, you know, and it was more like a village than...</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, it was cosmopolitan, I&#039;d say, you know, all nationalities.</div><div id="00:27:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had all nationalities there.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> We had, well, from what you call almost fellies down to a pierhead,</div><div id="00:28:00.000" class="transcript_line"> but they reckon that&#039;s all, from Customs Street is a mile, I think they call that, the Rock One Mile.</div><div id="00:28:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And from that one mile, my good with me, down the bottom of George Street,</div><div id="00:28:15.000" class="transcript_line"> you had the Spanish, you had the Maltese, more or less inside the bay,</div><div id="00:28:24.000" class="transcript_line"> you had the Africans and the Similes, it was mostly there.</div><div id="00:28:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But we had Maltese, and then we also had a Norwegian...</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s the name on each street there?</div><div id="00:28:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Norwegian Church, you know, and then that moved.</div><div id="00:28:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not Church, that was a Norwegian home.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That was bombed.</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I was stood outside at the night, because during the war, time didn&#039;t mean anything.</div><div id="00:28:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It must have been like two or three in the morning, after the rage,</div><div id="00:29:00.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d all be out looking and finding out what was bombed.</div><div id="00:29:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the night that was bombed, the Norwegian home.</div><div id="00:29:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember looking at it, seeing the bomb had long fallen and killed people there.</div><div id="00:29:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember being outside, just looking at that crate that&#039;s moving,</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> where the bomber dropped and killed the people, a lot of Arabs, the Norwegian club,</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> and an Arab boarding house and cats, where people, even a little girl,</div><div id="00:29:32.000" class="transcript_line"> knew the bloke in Sapphire Street here.</div><div id="00:29:38.000" class="transcript_line"> She was at one of the houses when the asylum went, and couldn&#039;t get back home to her old house.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And as a matter of fact, she was killed that night, I can picture her now, little William.</div><div id="00:29:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was just one child that was killed, whether trying to make her way home,</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> for some reason, I don&#039;t know if it was because that house just missed the bomb.</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she was killed that night, little William.</div><div id="00:30:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had air raid shelters all along huge street.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You could still see the marks in the wall, that wall on the left side of huge street,</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> where the shelters were.</div><div id="00:30:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We had shelters, we had all numbers drawn, shelter number 8, number 9, number 7.</div><div id="00:30:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there were times when we got to more or less sleep all night in the shelters.</div><div id="00:30:44.000" class="transcript_line"> When I went down the docks to live in my aunt&#039;s house, we had an Anderson shelter up at the back,</div><div id="00:30:49.000" class="transcript_line"> one of the corrugated ones.</div><div id="00:30:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where we tried to go there, went there.</div><div id="00:30:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s either under the table or in the cupboard under the stairs, when the sirens went.</div><div id="00:31:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But well, I was a teenager then, and we used to go to an instant even, school there, on a Friday.</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d have a dance and a speedy.</div><div id="00:31:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember when we were caught one night when a siren went to me and my cousin.</div><div id="00:31:22.000" class="transcript_line"> My cousin was Joey, I had another cousin, like my mother.</div><div id="00:31:27.000" class="transcript_line"> My aunt had a boy, Joey and Iris.</div><div id="00:31:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And my cousin Iris was about maybe 18 months older than me.</div><div id="00:31:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course we used to knock it out together.</div><div id="00:31:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And coming home one night when the siren had gone, the Germans were bombing us.</div><div id="00:31:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to make our way back down to Stewart Street, not a hand in front of you, you know, on the black house.</div><div id="00:31:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a light could be shone.</div><div id="00:31:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to make our way back down because we were going from shelter to shelter, trying to get our way home.</div><div id="00:32:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, for all that, it was when you think about it, it wasn&#039;t thrilling because the army was stationed at the city hall.</div><div id="00:32:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course we used a drone of the German bombers.</div><div id="00:32:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a bit exciting because you&#039;ve got the searchlights searching in the sky, you know, to get the planes.</div><div id="00:32:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you hear the attack guns going.</div><div id="00:32:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah. It was dangerous. It was rough.</div></div></p>
