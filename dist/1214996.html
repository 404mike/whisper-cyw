    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re listening to Joe talking about love and sex.</div><div id="00:00:03.360" class="transcript_line"> I have been in love before or I think I felt what it is to be in love, not very often.</div><div id="00:00:10.640" class="transcript_line"> But I see a couple of times I&#039;ve had that real feeling of love.</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> Now I don&#039;t know whether this is an autism thing or what or a Joe thing but</div><div id="00:00:19.760" class="transcript_line"> when I fall in love with somebody I wouldn&#039;t want them to know that and I&#039;m happy just to</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> feel the love and then not be involved. And what I find difficult is the fact that people can be</div><div id="00:00:28.720" class="transcript_line"> in love and have sex and intimacy. I don&#039;t understand that. I can feel lust towards somebody</div><div id="00:00:33.920" class="transcript_line"> of the opposite sex but I can&#039;t love a person I feel lustful about and I find it difficult</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> to feel sexual about the person that I feel in love with. Because if you&#039;re in love with</div><div id="00:00:45.840" class="transcript_line"> somebody it&#039;s a different thing. It&#039;s pure love but if you have sex with somebody or you feel</div><div id="00:00:51.680" class="transcript_line"> a sexual feeling towards somebody then that is a pure physical need issue. And what I find really</div><div id="00:00:59.440" class="transcript_line"> difficult to understand is how people bring both together and how sex is seen as an expression of</div><div id="00:01:06.720" class="transcript_line"> that love. I thought how can that be? And what&#039;s confusing is some people for instance will go out</div><div id="00:01:14.320" class="transcript_line"> to go for stripper, watch strippers or will go for prostitution just for that physical need.</div><div id="00:01:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And that makes me think well if they&#039;re going for that physical need then how can I be connected</div><div id="00:01:24.320" class="transcript_line"> to love? And I my brain can&#039;t do it. My brain does not compute that. So it&#039;s only twice I think I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:01:31.040" class="transcript_line"> really fell in love to the point where I can&#039;t forget that person even now. I feel brokenhearted</div><div id="00:01:38.080" class="transcript_line"> in some ways about it.</div></div></p>
