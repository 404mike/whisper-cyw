    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival 25th anniversary project.</div><div id="00:00:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:09.940" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Holly Jo Smith.</div><div id="00:00:12.240" class="transcript_line"> The location is the Swiffer office and the date today is the 17th of October 2015.</div><div id="00:00:18.640" class="transcript_line"> Holly, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for us for the record please?</div><div id="00:00:23.400" class="transcript_line"> I can.</div><div id="00:00:24.400" class="transcript_line"> H-O-L-L-Y-J-O-S-M-I-T-H.</div><div id="00:00:25.400" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic, thank you very much.</div><div id="00:00:31.800" class="transcript_line"> At what point did you first come across the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:39.560" class="transcript_line"> So my first time I ever did the carnival I was three months old, I was in my mum&#039;s arms,</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> I had a little costume on and I had little bits of face paint on and I was tiny.</div><div id="00:00:51.040" class="transcript_line"> I can honestly say that in all the interviews we&#039;ve done, that&#039;s the youngest participant</div><div id="00:00:58.880" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;ve recorded so far.</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> So you get some kind of prize just by starting, you know, it&#039;s like, you know, carnival baby.</div><div id="00:01:04.880" class="transcript_line"> And it must have only been in its second or third year.</div><div id="00:01:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very early.</div><div id="00:01:08.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 22 now.</div><div id="00:01:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Yep.</div><div id="00:01:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s extraordinary.</div><div id="00:01:11.760" class="transcript_line"> So directly or indirectly, Cardiff Carnival and Swicker have been there either at the</div><div id="00:01:16.800" class="transcript_line"> forefront or the background of your life.</div><div id="00:01:18.800" class="transcript_line"> It has.</div><div id="00:01:19.800" class="transcript_line"> Since the onset.</div><div id="00:01:21.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s incredible.</div><div id="00:01:22.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a lot to answer for obviously.</div><div id="00:01:25.720" class="transcript_line"> So in terms of obviously your mum, you know, fabulous visual artist, educator and carnival</div><div id="00:01:32.760" class="transcript_line"> artist and you know, she introduced to the world carnival very early.</div><div id="00:01:38.960" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the memories do you have of as a child playing, playing mass, being in carnival here</div><div id="00:01:45.440" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff?</div><div id="00:01:46.440" class="transcript_line"> I just remember it always seeming to be carnival.</div><div id="00:01:50.080" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just what it was about.</div><div id="00:01:53.080" class="transcript_line"> So we started, my mum didn&#039;t work for them then.</div><div id="00:01:56.080" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d just go along and make stuff.</div><div id="00:01:59.080" class="transcript_line"> It was, it was pretty constant.</div><div id="00:02:00.080" class="transcript_line"> It was, is it some holidays?</div><div id="00:02:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:02:03.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:04.080" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d go down there quite a lot and just help out with all the things.</div><div id="00:02:07.680" class="transcript_line"> And there was always people drumming and there&#039;s always like bits of dance workshops going</div><div id="00:02:11.360" class="transcript_line"> on.</div><div id="00:02:12.360" class="transcript_line"> I just remember being able to just run around.</div><div id="00:02:13.360" class="transcript_line"> Some space.</div><div id="00:02:14.360" class="transcript_line"> Freedom.</div><div id="00:02:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Just be able to do whatever we wanted.</div><div id="00:02:17.280" class="transcript_line"> And it was, there was like the park really close by and we just, it was, it was just</div><div id="00:02:23.160" class="transcript_line"> a lot of freedom just surrounded by really nice people.</div><div id="00:02:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Lots of pretty colours.</div><div id="00:02:27.160" class="transcript_line"> Colours are always good.</div><div id="00:02:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any costumes from your childhood that you were particularly fond of or perhaps</div><div id="00:02:35.160" class="transcript_line"> ones you ultimately...</div><div id="00:02:36.160" class="transcript_line"> I remember one I hated.</div><div id="00:02:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Did you hate, did you love the Alps back to us?</div><div id="00:02:38.160" class="transcript_line"> Or in fact, are there costumes where you thought like, oh my God.</div><div id="00:02:39.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s one in particular that I remember.</div><div id="00:02:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Excellent, this is a good memory.</div><div id="00:02:41.160" class="transcript_line"> I think I was probably in the middle of the night.</div><div id="00:02:42.160" class="transcript_line"> I was probably in the middle of the night.</div><div id="00:02:43.960" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t know what I was getting when I was going down there.</div><div id="00:02:48.960" class="transcript_line"> My mum said I was going to be an aeroplane and I thought, oh, could be quite cool.</div><div id="00:02:55.960" class="transcript_line"> But I ended up with this big white aeroplane that had bananas on it and it just wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:01.080" class="transcript_line"> cool at the time.</div><div id="00:03:02.080" class="transcript_line"> No, no, this was, I think it was a fair trade type problem, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:05.080" class="transcript_line"> It was, yeah, it was.</div><div id="00:03:06.080" class="transcript_line"> And then...</div><div id="00:03:07.080" class="transcript_line"> That was one of the best carnivals, I think, in full.</div><div id="00:03:09.080" class="transcript_line"> But I just happened to have a costume I didn&#039;t want.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t crash the plane on purpose or anything, did you?</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think I walked grumpily for a little bit and then got into a way the end of it.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I hear about protests, you know.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh God, I can&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> There were definitely some amazing costumes.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The one that I probably liked the most, I had like a rainbow skirt, really, really long,</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> stripes went vertically.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just like, just swirling it round.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I just loved it.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> That was probably a couple of years before that.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was probably only about eight or something.</div><div id="00:03:40.920" class="transcript_line"> I can see it in my mind&#039;s eye.</div><div id="00:03:42.920" class="transcript_line"> You had a fairly large yellow hat on as well.</div><div id="00:03:46.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:47.920" class="transcript_line"> You had pink tops and it was like a candy stripe skirt.</div><div id="00:03:50.920" class="transcript_line"> Look, how good am I?</div><div id="00:03:51.920" class="transcript_line"> I can remember.</div><div id="00:03:52.920" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very good.</div><div id="00:03:53.920" class="transcript_line"> No, no, absolutely.</div><div id="00:03:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Because in fact, my daughter, Non, was in that group as well and your mum led it.</div><div id="00:03:58.920" class="transcript_line"> And they were bright yellow hats, I think.</div><div id="00:04:01.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, really yellow.</div><div id="00:04:02.920" class="transcript_line"> And really, yeah, I was a great group.</div><div id="00:04:04.920" class="transcript_line"> I can remember.</div><div id="00:04:05.920" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what the makeup was like?</div><div id="00:04:06.920" class="transcript_line"> I think it was white faces.</div><div id="00:04:08.840" class="transcript_line"> I think you had white faces with a bit of, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And I can see you at the end at the oval basin, dancing like dervishes.</div><div id="00:04:14.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you know, top quality carnival.</div><div id="00:04:17.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:04:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So, costumes.</div><div id="00:04:25.840" class="transcript_line"> So we have your favourite, the candy stripe skirt.</div><div id="00:04:27.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll make sure that we actually get some of those pictures into the</div><div id="00:04:30.840" class="transcript_line"> accompanying documentation.</div><div id="00:04:36.760" class="transcript_line"> And then we have also a very important part or a youthful member,</div><div id="00:04:39.760" class="transcript_line"> you still are youthful, of the Carnival crew,</div><div id="00:04:42.760" class="transcript_line"> which went on to sort of break out beyond Carnival and attempt to do</div><div id="00:04:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Carnival theatre.</div><div id="00:04:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a bit about that?</div><div id="00:04:51.760" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember about those experiences?</div><div id="00:04:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Dragon in particular.</div><div id="00:04:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:56.760" class="transcript_line"> So what was that like for you being in it?</div><div id="00:04:58.760" class="transcript_line"> It was great.</div><div id="00:04:59.760" class="transcript_line"> I loved it.</div><div id="00:05:00.760" class="transcript_line"> It was like the social part of it as well, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:02.760" class="transcript_line"> It was like it was weekly.</div><div id="00:05:05.680" class="transcript_line"> It was just people from all different strokes of the world.</div><div id="00:05:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:05:09.680" class="transcript_line"> From Cardiff, I guess.</div><div id="00:05:10.680" class="transcript_line"> And just it was just it was just lush.</div><div id="00:05:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And I loved the costumes.</div><div id="00:05:14.680" class="transcript_line"> And the costumes were really big, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:05:16.680" class="transcript_line"> We were always a white dragon.</div><div id="00:05:17.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pretty sure I was always a white dragon.</div><div id="00:05:19.680" class="transcript_line"> Because those are the pictures we&#039;ve got of you online to accompany the interview.</div><div id="00:05:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally, did we do a phase of blue?</div><div id="00:05:25.680" class="transcript_line"> I know we were mostly red and white.</div><div id="00:05:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Mostly red and white.</div><div id="00:05:29.680" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s some blue dragons in other projects, but.</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Because I remember being blue for something.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I tried to think.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe that was something else.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, absolutely.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to discuss about the Blue Devils.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I know I think I might have done Blue Devils once.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was another favourite to watch.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum was amazing.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And Andiola.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I just yeah, that was such a good.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved it.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The red mouth and the blue and the horns.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Blood capsules, the whole shebang.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was extraordinary.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It really was.</div><div id="00:06:03.320" class="transcript_line"> So I remember.</div><div id="00:06:04.320" class="transcript_line"> So where would you have gone with the Carnival crew on the Dragon Carnival Theatre Tour?</div><div id="00:06:09.320" class="transcript_line"> I know that there&#039;s some lovely pictures of you.</div><div id="00:06:12.320" class="transcript_line"> You appear to be levitating in one of them, which is quite a clever trick.</div><div id="00:06:15.320" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t mind me saying so.</div><div id="00:06:16.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s at a castle.</div><div id="00:06:18.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a daytime gig, which is quite interesting.</div><div id="00:06:21.320" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;re there and your wings and the whole the whole the white dragon tribe is coming out.</div><div id="00:06:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Everyone else is walking along and you appear to be about a foot in the air.</div><div id="00:06:30.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just like, hang on.</div><div id="00:06:32.640" class="transcript_line"> The wings are real.</div><div id="00:06:33.640" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:06:34.640" class="transcript_line"> It makes you wonder how the hell she doing that?</div><div id="00:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> But there we are.</div><div id="00:06:37.640" class="transcript_line"> The force is strong in this one.</div><div id="00:06:39.640" class="transcript_line"> So you obviously did that.</div><div id="00:06:41.640" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s when I think about it, it&#039;s is it called a castle or somewhere like that?</div><div id="00:06:48.640" class="transcript_line"> Rings a bell.</div><div id="00:06:49.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:50.640" class="transcript_line"> But would you have done what other gigs would you have done with the Carnival crew?</div><div id="00:06:54.640" class="transcript_line"> I did it for at least a year.</div><div id="00:06:55.640" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:06:56.640" class="transcript_line"> If not two.</div><div id="00:06:57.960" class="transcript_line"> Would you have done one of the early shows down the bay when we were opening for a big</div><div id="00:07:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Spanish thing and we had Wonder Brass performing and the rest of it?</div><div id="00:07:06.240" class="transcript_line"> What was it like?</div><div id="00:07:07.240" class="transcript_line"> It was so busy.</div><div id="00:07:08.240" class="transcript_line"> It was, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:09.240" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of people.</div><div id="00:07:10.240" class="transcript_line"> It was kind of when I was just coming out of high school, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:13.240" class="transcript_line"> So I kept seeing loads of people from my high school and being like, it&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:07:17.240" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t recognise you in all the body paint.</div><div id="00:07:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god, it&#039;s Holly.</div><div id="00:07:24.240" class="transcript_line"> Holly.</div><div id="00:07:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Holly who?</div><div id="00:07:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:28.840" class="transcript_line"> The whole disguise of it and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:07:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Quite incredible.</div><div id="00:07:32.840" class="transcript_line"> So Carnival costumes.</div><div id="00:07:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:36.840" class="transcript_line"> And of course, one year you were a trainee as well, which is fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:41.840" class="transcript_line"> What was that like as an experience?</div><div id="00:07:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I loved it.</div><div id="00:07:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely loved it.</div><div id="00:07:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:47.840" class="transcript_line"> It was just like learning new things.</div><div id="00:07:48.840" class="transcript_line"> It was making the big backpacks that I liked the best because you can really make an impact</div><div id="00:07:52.840" class="transcript_line"> with those.</div><div id="00:07:53.840" class="transcript_line"> So the costumes are obviously amazing, but it&#039;s the big backpacks and working alongside</div><div id="00:07:58.440" class="transcript_line"> people.</div><div id="00:07:59.440" class="transcript_line"> Like Kath that year, what did she make?</div><div id="00:08:02.440" class="transcript_line"> Was it a big swan?</div><div id="00:08:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I could well believe that, which was worn by Thelma.</div><div id="00:08:06.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful, beautiful swan.</div><div id="00:08:08.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:09.440" class="transcript_line"> It was amazing.</div><div id="00:08:10.440" class="transcript_line"> I remember I made like a huge owl backpack and I was very proud of it.</div><div id="00:08:13.440" class="transcript_line"> There were definitely images of that going to be on the archives, so I didn&#039;t realise</div><div id="00:08:16.440" class="transcript_line"> that you were behind that.</div><div id="00:08:17.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:18.440" class="transcript_line"> Beautiful, beautiful.</div><div id="00:08:19.440" class="transcript_line"> So come the day, of course, when you&#039;re part of the team, of course, you can&#039;t be in full</div><div id="00:08:27.040" class="transcript_line"> costume, can you?</div><div id="00:08:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we&#039;ve got pictures of you with...</div><div id="00:08:29.040" class="transcript_line"> That was one of my favourite years I did again.</div><div id="00:08:32.040" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve got your tool belt on and you can see all the animators, all the arts workers,</div><div id="00:08:37.040" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not in full costume and they clearly are ready to staple gun anything that moves</div><div id="00:08:44.200" class="transcript_line"> or stitch something or gaffer taping.</div><div id="00:08:46.200" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a cable tie.</div><div id="00:08:47.960" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:08:48.960" class="transcript_line"> You look like warriors.</div><div id="00:08:49.960" class="transcript_line"> We are carnival warriors.</div><div id="00:08:50.960" class="transcript_line"> I remember it was like the day before, I think we were like, what are we going to wear if</div><div id="00:08:54.960" class="transcript_line"> we just had these boiler suits and we just covered them and sprayed them?</div><div id="00:08:57.960" class="transcript_line"> It looks excellent.</div><div id="00:08:58.960" class="transcript_line"> This is what we&#039;re wearing.</div><div id="00:08:59.960" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I think it was great.</div><div id="00:09:00.960" class="transcript_line"> It was like you were off the carnival, but you clearly weren&#039;t in a full costume, but</div><div id="00:09:04.960" class="transcript_line"> you were there like technicians you looked like on the road.</div><div id="00:09:07.960" class="transcript_line"> So like, can we fix it?</div><div id="00:09:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I think that was probably my favourite year I ever did.</div><div id="00:09:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:09:12.960" class="transcript_line"> It was just such a buzz, getting to go up to all the different bands, having a dance</div><div id="00:09:16.720" class="transcript_line"> with everyone, all the different groups.</div><div id="00:09:17.720" class="transcript_line"> And because obviously you&#039;re working on making the costumes, you get to know a lot of people</div><div id="00:09:21.720" class="transcript_line"> who are in the carnival as well.</div><div id="00:09:22.720" class="transcript_line"> So you get to see a lot of the faces.</div><div id="00:09:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So to actually see it on the road.</div><div id="00:09:24.720" class="transcript_line"> And then the crowd as well and people are asking you questions and I felt very well</div><div id="00:09:29.720" class="transcript_line"> equipped to answer them.</div><div id="00:09:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, you really are a carnival trans, aren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:09:33.720" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re born up with it around you.</div><div id="00:09:38.720" class="transcript_line"> That said, there&#039;s sad news we discussed earlier, which is due to withdrawal of funding from</div><div id="00:09:44.120" class="transcript_line"> the Arts Council of Wales.</div><div id="00:09:45.280" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re going to have a lot of fun, but it&#039;s a bit of a long story.</div><div id="00:09:48.280" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m just going to go ahead and start by asking you a question.</div><div id="00:09:51.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to start by asking you a question.</div><div id="00:09:54.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to start by asking you a question.</div><div id="00:09:57.280" class="transcript_line"> What is your, yes, I know, not a quite sad moment in our history.</div><div id="00:10:00.280" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve managed to stagger through 26 years in various costumes and thousands of people</div><div id="00:10:05.280" class="transcript_line"> have taken part and hundreds of thousands have seen different things over the years.</div><div id="00:10:10.280" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:10:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:12.280" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s it meant to you?</div><div id="00:10:13.440" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s it meant to you?</div><div id="00:10:14.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, you really have grown up in it.</div><div id="00:10:15.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been part of your life.</div><div id="00:10:16.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really sad.</div><div id="00:10:17.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like, you know, not every year I&#039;ve been really involved in it or not every year</div><div id="00:10:24.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve even gone to see it, but I&#039;ve always known it&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:10:27.440" class="transcript_line"> And it is just something that I&#039;ve always done my whole life and it&#039;s not going to be</div><div id="00:10:32.440" class="transcript_line"> there anymore.</div><div id="00:10:33.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s part of the fabric of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:10:34.440" class="transcript_line"> So, well, we&#039;re not going to finish on a low note.</div><div id="00:10:39.600" class="transcript_line"> Before we go any further and to end with, I&#039;d like to award you the fictional and entirely</div><div id="00:10:44.600" class="transcript_line"> non-pecuniary title of Holly.</div><div id="00:10:47.600" class="transcript_line"> You are in fact a carnival hero and you&#039;ll go down as such.</div><div id="00:10:52.600" class="transcript_line"> And thank you very much indeed for sharing your memories with us.</div><div id="00:10:56.600" class="transcript_line"> No worries.</div><div id="00:10:57.600" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for having me.</div></div></p>
