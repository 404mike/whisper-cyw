juniors rate.</div><div id="00:22:04.060" class="transcript_line"> I think I was only considered to be a junior,</div><div id="00:22:06.060" class="transcript_line"> although when I look back on it now, it was a fairly responsible job to get it right.</div><div id="00:22:14.060" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do with your money?</div><div id="00:22:17.060" class="transcript_line"> I lived at home.</div><div id="00:22:19.060" class="transcript_line"> My mother used to put my money aside for me so that I could get the train</div><div id="00:22:26.060" class="transcript_line"> towards my training and things.</div><div id="00:22:29.060" class="transcript_line"> As I say, when I went to the games, there was a great list of things to buy.</div><div id="00:22:33.060" class="transcript_line"> It was an expensive business.</div><div id="00:22:36.060" class="transcript_line"> If you had to get there on your own, it was your train fare.</div><div id="00:22:43.060" class="transcript_line"> My mum would never let me go if I needed a new coat until I had a new coat,</div><div id="00:22:47.060" class="transcript_line"> that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:22:49.060" class="transcript_line"> Then there was always a gift for the lady you&#039;d be staying with,</div><div id="00:22:51.060" class="transcript_line"> because someone would put you up there.</div><div id="00:22:53.060" class="transcript_line"> My mother would cry because she had to part with her tea coupon</div><div id="00:22:56.060" class="transcript_line"> and I didn&#039;t drink tea.</div><div id="00:22:58.060" class="transcript_line"> But as far as the money was concerned, it sort of went in this pot.</div><div id="00:23:06.060" class="transcript_line"> My parents didn&#039;t have any of it.</div><div id="00:23:11.060" class="transcript_line"> They just used it as part of the support that I needed,</div><div id="00:23:15.060" class="transcript_line"> and it was only a small part of the support I needed.</div><div id="00:23:18.060" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask, were there any unions in the factory?</div><div id="00:23:26.060" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of anything?</div><div id="00:23:28.060" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t aware of it.</div><div id="00:23:30.060" class="transcript_line"> There must have been for the men, I would think,</div><div id="00:23:32.060" class="transcript_line"> because they had several professions there.</div><div id="00:23:36.060" class="transcript_line"> So they must have been for the men.</div><div id="00:23:38.060" class="transcript_line"> But I was certainly not asked to join a union.</div><div id="00:23:41.060" class="transcript_line"> So you weren&#039;t in a union?</div><div id="00:23:43.060" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t in a union.</div><div id="00:23:44.060" class="transcript_line"> And you weren&#039;t aware of an office union, were you?</div><div id="00:23:46.060" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:23:48.060" class="transcript_line"> Did you feel that you were fairly treated?</div><div id="00:23:51.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was quite happy there.</div><div id="00:23:54.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that everybody was fairly treated?</div><div id="00:23:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the ones that I knew.</div><div id="00:23:59.060" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t hear no one complain.</div><div id="00:24:01.060" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t see much about the men in the factory,</div><div id="00:24:03.060" class="transcript_line"> because I really wouldn&#039;t know anything about them.</div><div id="00:24:05.060" class="transcript_line"> But in our office, everyone seemed to be okay.</div><div id="00:24:09.060" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of any disputes, though?</div><div id="00:24:11.060" class="transcript_line"> No, never.</div><div id="00:24:13.060" class="transcript_line"> I was there until I was 19.</div><div id="00:24:21.060" class="transcript_line"> During that time, I wasn&#039;t aware of any.</div><div id="00:24:23.060" class="transcript_line"> I did have a good deal of help on one occasion,</div><div id="00:24:26.060" class="transcript_line"> because I used to ride a bike to work,</div><div id="00:24:28.060" class="transcript_line"> and we had a terrible snowstorm.</div><div id="00:24:31.060" class="transcript_line"> When I was in school, I never missed a half-day school,</div><div id="00:24:36.060" class="transcript_line"> all my education.</div><div id="00:24:38.060" class="transcript_line"> My parents, my mother, would say,</div><div id="00:24:40.060" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll feel better by the time you get there.</div><div id="00:24:42.060" class="transcript_line"> I never even lost a half-day in the whole of my schooling.</div><div id="00:24:45.060" class="transcript_line"> I think that stayed with me.</div><div id="00:24:47.060" class="transcript_line"> It helped me with my gymnastics and with the rest of my future.</div><div id="00:24:51.060" class="transcript_line"> It taught me commitment.</div><div id="00:24:53.060" class="transcript_line"> So the snow came pouring down, and I got on my bike to go.</div><div id="00:24:58.060" class="transcript_line"> As I turned a corner, I lived in Grangetown.</div><div id="00:25:01.060" class="transcript_line"> It was a Grange garden, it says to cycle past.</div><div id="00:25:04.060" class="transcript_line"> As I turned the corner, so this great lot of snow flew in my face.</div><div id="00:25:08.060" class="transcript_line"> I put my head down and went into the back of a tractor on my bike.</div><div id="00:25:11.060" class="transcript_line"> I was clean over the top and knocked myself out.</div><div id="00:25:15.060" class="transcript_line"> So the parkkeeper took me into his hut.</div><div id="00:25:19.060" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he wouldn&#039;t dare do it today, would they?</div><div id="00:25:22.060" class="transcript_line"> But the parkkeeper took me into his hut</div><div id="00:25:24.060" class="transcript_line"> until he felt I was well enough to get up,</div><div id="00:25:26.060" class="transcript_line"> and he wanted me to go home.</div><div id="00:25:29.060" class="transcript_line"> But he said, no, I must go to work. I&#039;m on my way to work.</div><div id="00:25:32.060" class="transcript_line"> So I pushed my Brent bike to work.</div><div id="00:25:34.060" class="transcript_line"> When I got there, they were so concerned about me,</div><div id="00:25:37.060" class="transcript_line"> they wanted me to go up to the hospital,</div><div id="00:25:39.060" class="transcript_line"> which in those days was St David&#039;s Hospital.</div><div id="00:25:42.060" class="transcript_line"> So the boss had a Rolls and a chauffeur,</div><div id="00:25:47.060" class="transcript_line"> so I had my first ride in a Rolls-Royce,</div><div id="00:25:51.060" class="transcript_line"> going to the hospital with my concussion.</div><div id="00:25:54.060" class="transcript_line"> And did you have concussion?</div><div id="00:25:56.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I had concussion.</div><div id="00:25:57.060" class="transcript_line"> And this was before the games, was it?</div><div id="00:25:59.060" class="transcript_line"> No, that was after.</div><div id="00:26:01.060" class="transcript_line"> That was after.</div><div id="00:26:03.060" class="transcript_line"> You talked a bit, I&#039;ll just ask you about this,</div><div id="00:26:07.060" class="transcript_line"> because you talked a bit about this man</div><div id="00:26:10.060" class="transcript_line"> who had a dreadful injury and well disappeared.</div><div id="00:26:14.060" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of any other injuries on the factory floor?</div><div id="00:26:19.060" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think I was.</div><div id="00:26:22.060" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they had a nurse on site,</div><div id="00:26:25.060" class="transcript_line"> and there used to be, I think,</div><div id="00:26:27.060" class="transcript_line"> there was a man who once got his hands caught in a machine,</div><div id="00:26:30.060" class="transcript_line"> because they used to be after a bit dangerously,</div><div id="00:26:34.060" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes worked without a guard down</div><div id="00:26:36.060" class="transcript_line"> because the guard made the job difficult.</div><div id="00:26:38.060" class="transcript_line"> And there was one man who caught his hands in there.</div><div id="00:26:41.060" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that dreadful one where the man disappeared,</div><div id="00:26:44.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t recall any more.</div><div id="00:26:47.060" class="transcript_line"> There must have been, but there would have been</div><div id="00:26:49.060" class="transcript_line"> small and insignificant injuries, I would think.</div><div id="00:26:52.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you think the work was dangerous?</div><div id="00:26:55.060" class="transcript_line"> It must have been in some instances,</div><div id="00:26:57.060" class="transcript_line"> if the man could catch his hand</div><div id="00:26:59.060" class="transcript_line"> and if somebody could fall in there.</div><div id="00:27:02.060" class="transcript_line"> But my job wasn&#039;t dangerous.</div><div id="00:27:05.060" class="transcript_line"> So let&#039;s go on to the hours and the holidays.</div><div id="00:27:15.060" class="transcript_line"> So how many days did you work a week?</div><div id="00:27:18.060" class="transcript_line"> Five. And it was nine till five.</div><div id="00:27:22.060" class="transcript_line"> Clock in and clock out.</div><div id="00:27:25.060" class="transcript_line"> You had to clock in, did you? Yes.</div><div id="00:27:27.060" class="transcript_line"> And were there any shifts worked?</div><div id="00:27:30.060" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of that?</div><div id="00:27:32.060" class="transcript_line"> No. I don&#039;t think even the factory workers worked shifts.</div><div id="00:27:36.060" class="transcript_line"> I think there were set hours there.</div><div id="00:27:38.060" class="transcript_line"> I would imagine if they had an emergency</div><div id="00:27:41.060" class="transcript_line"> or a big order that had to be met,</div><div id="00:27:43.060" class="transcript_line"> people would have turned to.</div><div id="00:27:45.060" class="transcript_line"> But I think as a general rule it stuck to.</div><div id="00:27:47.060" class="transcript_line"> But the men had longer hours.</div><div id="00:27:49.060" class="transcript_line"> They started at eight, I think, in the morning,</div><div id="00:27:51.060" class="transcript_line"> and we started at nine.</div><div id="00:27:53.060" class="transcript_line"> And I think they finished about the same time as us.</div><div id="00:27:56.060" class="transcript_line"> So if they did have, I presume they&#039;d work a bit of overtime</div><div id="00:27:59.060" class="transcript_line"> if they had an order,</div><div id="00:28:01.060" class="transcript_line"> would you ever be asked to work out?</div><div id="00:28:03.060" class="transcript_line"> No. Because I just have to make sure that the material</div><div id="00:28:06.060" class="transcript_line"> that they needed after hours was available to them.</div><div id="00:28:09.060" class="transcript_line"> There. Right.</div><div id="00:28:11.060" class="transcript_line"> And did you have any breaks to review working day?</div><div id="00:28:15.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes. We had a tea break.</div><div id="00:28:18.060" class="transcript_line"> We had a canteen,</div><div id="00:28:20.060" class="transcript_line"> but we used to get a tea or coffee and bring it to the office.</div><div id="00:28:24.060" class="transcript_line"> And then of course there was a lunch break</div><div id="00:28:26.060" class="transcript_line"> and there was a canteen there.</div><div id="00:28:28.060" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:28:30.060" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have my bike.</div><div id="00:28:32.060" class="transcript_line"> It was the top end of Grangetown near town</div><div id="00:28:34.060" class="transcript_line"> and I lived in Clive Street, which was not so far away.</div><div id="00:28:36.060" class="transcript_line"> So I used to go home on my bike and come back.</div><div id="00:28:38.060" class="transcript_line"> How long would it take you on the bike?</div><div id="00:28:40.060" class="transcript_line"> About a quarter of an hour each way.</div><div id="00:28:42.060" class="transcript_line"> And we had an hour for lunch, so it was enough.</div><div id="00:28:44.060" class="transcript_line"> And you always went home, did you?</div><div id="00:28:46.060" class="transcript_line"> Usually, yes. Sometimes I went into town,</div><div id="00:28:48.060" class="transcript_line"> I did a bit of shopping because it wasn&#039;t far.</div><div id="00:28:50.060" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t much of a shopaholic then.</div><div id="00:28:53.060" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t do much of that.</div><div id="00:28:56.060" class="transcript_line"> You had your mind on greater things.</div><div id="00:28:58.060" class="transcript_line"> So you never used the canteen then, did you?</div><div id="00:29:02.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did occasionally, but mostly just for coffee.</div><div id="00:29:05.060" class="transcript_line"> And I had to get the boss&#039; teas and coffees every day.</div><div id="00:29:10.060" class="transcript_line"> And he hated it if I brought him back biscuits with currants in</div><div id="00:29:13.060" class="transcript_line"> because he said they could be dead flies.</div><div id="00:29:15.060" class="transcript_line"> So were you aware of what kind of food the canteen provided?</div><div id="00:29:22.060" class="transcript_line"> Was it like a full kind of cooked?</div><div id="00:29:24.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there was a lot of selection, but it was cooked.</div><div id="00:29:27.060" class="transcript_line"> I think there were probably two selections,</div><div id="00:29:29.060" class="transcript_line"> and there certainly wasn&#039;t a cold counter.</div><div id="00:29:32.060" class="transcript_line"> But those were not long after the war years.</div><div id="00:29:36.060" class="transcript_line"> So what about afternoon break? Did you have an afternoon?</div><div id="00:29:39.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had an afternoon break.</div><div id="00:29:41.060" class="transcript_line"> But we usually just carried on with our work</div><div id="00:29:43.060" class="transcript_line"> and had a cup of tea or coffee at our desk.</div><div id="00:29:46.060" class="transcript_line"> Whereas we&#039;d stop for ten minutes or so in the morning.</div><div id="00:29:50.060" class="transcript_line"> And then we had an hour for lunch.</div><div id="00:29:52.060" class="transcript_line"> So did you have an annual holiday allowance with pay then?</div><div id="00:29:58.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a fortnight was all.</div><div id="00:30:01.060" class="transcript_line"> And you could book it in, your own time you could apply.</div><div id="00:30:07.060" class="transcript_line"> You put in your holiday hours and I don&#039;t think I was ever refused.</div><div id="00:30:11.060" class="transcript_line"> Right. Did you ever take more than that?</div><div id="00:30:14.060" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:30:16.060" class="transcript_line"> Was that insufficient?</div><div id="00:30:18.060" class="transcript_line"> Probably when we went to the Games I probably did.</div><div id="00:30:23.060" class="transcript_line"> I must have done then, because we were there a bit longer.</div><div id="00:30:26.060" class="transcript_line"> I should remember that, but I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:30:29.060" class="transcript_line"> You said you were paid for your holidays.</div><div id="00:30:31.060" class="transcript_line"> Was that just that fortnight?</div><div id="00:30:35.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well I continued to pay me even though I had my holidays as well as that time for the Games.</div><div id="00:30:43.060" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have to take my holiday quota to go to the Games.</div><div id="00:30:48.060" class="transcript_line"> They gave me my holidays as well.</div><div id="00:30:51.060" class="transcript_line"> And they paid you?</div><div id="00:30:52.060" class="transcript_line"> They paid me. They paid me while I was away.</div><div id="00:30:55.060" class="transcript_line"> They were a very good company to work for I think.</div><div id="00:30:58.060" class="transcript_line"> Because I did have on one occasion a problem with a man I&#039;d met on a train and spoken to</div><div id="00:31:03.060" class="transcript_line"> and who found out where I worked and he got to be pestering and an awful nuisance.</div><div id="00:31:09.060" class="transcript_line"> Our manager and our managing director got him the sack from his company.</div><div id="00:31:13.060" class="transcript_line"> He was quite high up in the business.</div><div id="00:31:16.060" class="transcript_line"> So they did care about their staff.</div><div id="00:31:19.060" class="transcript_line"> This had happened out of working hours.</div><div id="00:31:21.060" class="transcript_line"> It was when I was on one of my train journeys for training and a gentleman just got talking.</div><div id="00:31:26.060" class="transcript_line"> The carriages were over the corridor and he&#039;d be sat with people.</div><div id="00:31:31.060" class="transcript_line"> It was a long way. I was going right up to changing trains at Manchester and going on in up to Yorkshire.</div><div id="00:31:37.060" class="transcript_line"> This man just befriended me I thought and carried my case when I went to change trains.</div><div id="00:31:44.060" class="transcript_line"> But in this conversation I told him where I worked and he contacted me and made a nuisance of himself.</div><div id="00:31:52.060" class="transcript_line"> But my boss sorted it out.</div><div id="00:31:55.060" class="transcript_line"> The director of the company sorted it out, not my immediate boss.</div><div id="00:32:00.060" class="transcript_line"> So they did look after their girls.</div><div id="00:32:04.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you think you were a kind of feather in their cap then?</div><div id="00:32:07.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:32:08.060" class="transcript_line"> Do you think you were special?</div><div id="00:32:10.060" class="transcript_line"> Or would they have done that for you?</div><div id="00:32:12.060" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;d have done it for anyone.</div><div id="00:32:14.060" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t say. When I was in my home environment and when I was in my local environment,</div><div id="00:32:20.060" class="transcript_line"> I was a star because I was going to be an Olympian.</div><div id="00:32:24.060" class="transcript_line"> But when I was in work I was really just one of the girls.</div><div id="00:32:27.060" class="transcript_line"> So I think the treatment I received everyone would have had.</div><div id="00:32:31.060" class="transcript_line"> They were very good employees.</div><div id="00:32:32.060" class="transcript_line"> Except for the holidays.</div><div id="00:32:33.060" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. And they took me in when they weren&#039;t looking for someone to do anything.</div><div id="00:32:41.060" class="transcript_line"> They took me in because I had a need.</div><div id="00:32:43.060" class="transcript_line"> So they were a good company.</div><div id="00:32:44.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether BSA still exists.

That&#039;s another story.</div><div id="00:47:13.060" class="transcript_line"> When I got there, I sent my mother the telegram and it said, arrive safely, see Pathy News.</div><div id="00:47:23.060" class="transcript_line"> She must be on Pathy News.</div><div id="00:47:26.060" class="transcript_line"> We went to the Capitol Cinema, she and my father.</div><div id="00:47:28.060" class="transcript_line"> They used to have two films then and lots of bits going on.</div><div id="00:47:32.060" class="transcript_line"> My mother&#039;s backside was making bed because it was not coming on.</div><div id="00:47:36.060" class="transcript_line"> Eventually, there was cock-a-doodle-doo and this thing.</div><div id="00:47:42.060" class="transcript_line"> Going over to the Olympics today, there we were going up the steps.</div><div id="00:47:47.060" class="transcript_line"> My mother shot up in the middle of the cinema waving at me and saying, there&#039;s Al Gwyn.</div><div id="00:47:53.060" class="transcript_line"> My father was saying, sit down woman, sit down.</div><div id="00:47:57.060" class="transcript_line"> She embarrassed him no end.</div><div id="00:47:59.060" class="transcript_line"> She was so overcome by it, she had to wave back and stand up and shout out to do it.</div><div id="00:48:03.060" class="transcript_line"> It was funny.</div><div id="00:48:05.060" class="transcript_line"> When we got over there, I&#039;m surprised we did any work at all because we&#039;d had a lot of rationing over here.</div><div id="00:48:10.060" class="transcript_line"> There, I can remember sending my mother a card saying, we&#039;re allowed two eggs.</div><div id="00:48:17.060" class="transcript_line"> That was then heard of. You could actually have two eggs on your plate.</div><div id="00:48:21.060" class="transcript_line"> There was no rationing and we ate ourselves silly.</div><div id="00:48:24.060" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m surprised we managed to do any gymnastics because the food was fabulous.</div><div id="00:48:29.060" class="transcript_line"> We had a good time over there.</div><div id="00:48:32.060" class="transcript_line"> When we got there, we found out that all the work we&#039;d been doing, which had been translated from the French, was incorrect translation.</div><div id="00:48:41.060" class="transcript_line"> They used to do set work and voluntary work in those days.</div><div id="00:48:44.060" class="transcript_line"> All the set work was wrong.</div><div id="00:48:46.060" class="transcript_line"> We had to spend our time getting it right.</div><div id="00:48:48.060" class="transcript_line"> How were you selected?</div><div id="00:48:50.060" class="transcript_line"> We had trials.</div><div id="00:48:52.060" class="transcript_line"> They also had, in those days, the last of the games where the women did a team drill.</div><div id="00:48:58.060" class="transcript_line"> They watched to do that as well.</div><div id="00:49:01.060" class="transcript_line"> Different ones would take different places and so on.</div><div id="00:49:04.060" class="transcript_line"> I was very good at dance.</div><div id="00:49:10.060" class="transcript_line"> I think that helped me get into the team as well, was the fact that I was rather good at the team drill.</div><div id="00:49:17.060" class="transcript_line"> Some of the girls were a bit on the stiff side, moving.</div><div id="00:49:21.060" class="transcript_line"> I top scored for the team.</div><div id="00:49:23.060" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t the youngest in the team.</div><div id="00:49:25.060" class="transcript_line"> Valerie Mullins was the youngest.</div><div id="00:49:27.060" class="transcript_line"> She was three days younger than me and she was from Swansea.</div><div id="00:49:30.060" class="transcript_line"> I top scored in the games for our team, but we didn&#039;t come anywhere.</div><div id="00:49:36.060" class="transcript_line"> How many of you from Wales went?</div><div id="00:49:39.060" class="transcript_line"> In that games, we were the majority.</div><div id="00:49:42.060" class="transcript_line"> There were three from Swansea.</div><div id="00:49:45.060" class="transcript_line"> Susie Davies, Valarie Marians and Margo Morgan.</div><div id="00:49:49.060" class="transcript_line"> The first reserve was from Swansea too, but she didn&#039;t go.</div><div id="00:49:53.060" class="transcript_line"> Then there was myself and Margo Thomas.</div><div id="00:49:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Five of us and it was a team of eight.</div><div id="00:49:59.060" class="transcript_line"> We were two from Cardiff and three from Swansea in the women&#039;s team.</div><div id="00:50:03.060" class="transcript_line"> We were five of the eight.</div><div id="00:50:05.060" class="transcript_line"> We did really well.</div><div id="00:50:07.060" class="transcript_line"> That was a spectacular result then, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:50:10.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was indeed.</div><div id="00:50:12.060" class="transcript_line"> How did the team do?</div><div id="00:50:14.060" class="transcript_line"> Badly.</div><div id="00:50:20.060" class="transcript_line"> It was mostly because when you did sets on voluntary,</div><div id="00:50:24.060" class="transcript_line"> the set work had been wrongly translated.</div><div id="00:50:27.060" class="transcript_line"> Some of them really struggled to do the bar set the new way.</div><div id="00:50:31.060" class="transcript_line"> I was very strong and I did quite well on it.</div><div id="00:50:35.060" class="transcript_line"> As a team, we sent down.</div><div id="00:50:38.060" class="transcript_line"> When we got there, we found that the vault,</div><div id="00:50:41.060" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d been used to a springboard, not like they have today,</div><div id="00:50:44.060" class="transcript_line"> but it had a thing across and it had some spring.</div><div id="00:50:47.060" class="transcript_line"> When we got there, it was what we would have called a beat board,</div><div id="00:50:50.060" class="transcript_line"> which was just a board and then planks going down and it was solid.</div><div id="00:50:53.060" class="transcript_line"> You could jump on it, but there was absolutely no spring at all.</div><div id="00:50:56.060" class="transcript_line"> Nobody could get over on this hand spring vault.</div><div id="00:50:59.060" class="transcript_line"> You had to get to full handstand and spring off it.</div><div id="00:51:02.060" class="transcript_line"> That was the set vault because we had more complicated voluntary vaults on that.</div><div id="00:51:05.060" class="transcript_line"> Most of the girls couldn&#039;t get up.</div><div id="00:51:07.060" class="transcript_line"> In those days, they used to vault with the board in quite close.</div><div id="00:51:10.060" class="transcript_line"> I thought, if we moved the board back and ran a bit further,</div><div id="00:51:13.060" class="transcript_line"> perhaps we could dive and get up there.</div><div id="00:51:16.060" class="transcript_line"> Myself and another girl from our team managed to get up and do it.</div><div id="00:51:20.060" class="transcript_line"> They used to train in gyms then.</div><div id="00:51:24.060" class="transcript_line"> A country would have an hour or two hours, I can&#039;t remember the amount of time,</div><div id="00:51:29.060" class="transcript_line"> followed by another and another.</div><div id="00:51:31.060" class="transcript_line"> Following us on one occasion was the Russian team.</div><div id="00:51:34.060" class="transcript_line"> They had a glass door.</div><div id="00:51:36.060" class="transcript_line"> They were waiting outside, looking through the glass door.</div><div id="00:51:39.060" class="transcript_line"> He came in and asked whether he could film me doing this vault.</div><div id="00:51:43.060" class="transcript_line"> They had this sort of cine camera.</div><div id="00:51:45.060" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve still got one upstairs.</div><div id="00:51:47.060" class="transcript_line"> He had that sort of cine camera.</div><div id="00:51:49.060" class="transcript_line"> He took films of me doing it.</div><div id="00:51:52.060" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, we didn&#039;t see them working all the time.</div><div id="00:51:56.060" class="transcript_line"> When it came to the finals day, they had the final stop on each apparatus.</div><div id="00:52:00.060" class="transcript_line"> We got there early so we could get a front seat.</div><div id="00:52:03.060" class="transcript_line"> The front seat was right on the floor, not as it would be now.</div><div id="00:52:08.060" class="transcript_line"> One of the Russian girls won and her vault was very poor.</div><div id="00:52:13.060" class="transcript_line"> She got the medal.</div><div id="00:52:15.060" class="transcript_line"> He brought her over to me, seeing me sitting in the front.</div><div id="00:52:18.060" class="transcript_line"> He took the medal off her and hung it around my neck.</div><div id="00:52:21.060" class="transcript_line"> He shook his head and took it back and put it on her and went.</div><div id="00:52:25.060" class="transcript_line"> He knew she shouldn&#039;t have won it.</div><div id="00:52:28.060" class="transcript_line"> What they did in those days, if they didn&#039;t want you to win,</div><div id="00:52:35.060" class="transcript_line"> they wouldn&#039;t knock you off a bit.</div><div id="00:52:37.060" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d knock you off a lot and claim that it must have been a dreadful mistake in there.</div><div id="00:52:42.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I was even topscorer for vault 14.</div><div id="00:52:46.060" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:52:49.060" class="transcript_line"> But still an amazing experience.</div><div id="00:52:51.060" class="transcript_line"> Amazing. Amazing people from all countries.</div><div id="00:52:54.060" class="transcript_line"> We watched the men&#039;s as well.</div><div id="00:52:57.060" class="transcript_line"> The Indian men took their turbans off and their hair was up in the top,</div><div id="00:53:01.060" class="transcript_line"> all tied with a great floppy white bow.</div><div id="00:53:04.060" class="transcript_line"> As they were working, it would be coming and done by the yard.</div><div id="00:53:07.060" class="transcript_line"> So little things like that.</div><div id="00:53:09.060" class="transcript_line"> The Japanese men, they marched past because we always got there early and sat in the front.</div><div id="00:53:14.060" class="transcript_line"> As they marched on, they left a waft of perfume behind.</div><div id="00:53:18.060" class="transcript_line"> In those days, men didn&#039;t wear aftershave in the things, but the Japs did.</div><div id="00:53:23.060" class="transcript_line"> We used to watch them go, oh, they smelt lovely, but we thought it was a bit sissy.</div><div id="00:53:28.060" class="transcript_line"> There were lots of things like that.</div><div id="00:53:32.060" class="transcript_line"> Quite a different world to anything we&#039;ve lived in.</div><div id="00:53:38.060" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted to ask you about any other games.</div><div id="00:53:42.060" class="transcript_line"> Olympics and Commonwealth and whatever.</div><div id="00:53:45.060" class="transcript_line"> Commonwealth games.</div><div id="00:53:47.060" class="transcript_line"> Gymnastics only came into the Commonwealth Games after I retired.</div><div id="00:53:51.060" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really? So no gymnastics in Cardiff in 1958?</div><div id="00:53:55.060" class="transcript_line"> No, my husband was in it, but he was in it as a highboard diver.</div><div id="00:53:59.060" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t any.</div><div id="00:54:02.060" class="transcript_line"> For the Olympics, they didn&#039;t send a women&#039;s team to Australia in 1956.</div><div id="00:54:09.060" class="transcript_line"> They had three trials. I won all three trials.</div><div id="00:54:13.060" class="transcript_line"> But it was decided that because I was at that time a mother,</div><div id="00:54:17.060" class="transcript_line"> it was not right for me to be taken away from my child, so I was denied the chance to go.</div><div id="00:54:21.060" class="transcript_line"> They decided that?</div><div id="00:54:23.060" class="transcript_line"> They decided that.</div><div id="00:54:25.060" class="transcript_line"> We still lived in a big house, in part of a big house that my mother was in,</div><div id="00:54:28.060" class="transcript_line"> and my children had two mothers. They wouldn&#039;t have missed me.</div><div id="00:54:32.060" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, we didn&#039;t go. That was one child there.</div><div id="00:54:36.060" class="transcript_line"> Then in 1960, I captained a team that went to Rome and topscored there for Britain,</div><div id="00:54:42.060" class="transcript_line"> but we didn&#039;t come anywhere.</div><div id="00:54:45.060" class="transcript_line"> So I did go again, but I&#039;ve done loads since,</div><div id="00:54:50.060" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;ve travelled a lot with British teams to world championships,</div><div id="00:54:55.060" class="transcript_line"> not to Olympics, but to world championships, European championships and internationals.</div><div id="00:55:00.060" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s not a country in Europe I haven&#039;t been to, so I&#039;ve had some wonderful experiences.</div><div id="00:55:05.060" class="transcript_line"> The sport&#039;s been very good to me. Very good.</div><div id="00:55:08.060" class="transcript_line"> Will you be going to the Commonwealth Games this year?</div><div id="00:55:11.060" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s in Glasgow, but I won&#039;t be going.</div><div id="00:55:13.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t work high level anymore. I&#039;m interested to watch it, you know.</div><div id="00:55:17.060" class="transcript_line"> At the gym club I&#039;m running now, we used to have the main hall in the Pier Pavilion,</div><div id="00:55:25.060" class="transcript_line"> and when money was raised to do up the building, which was desperately needed,</div><div id="00:55:30.060" class="transcript_line"> we were promised by the council that we could have a church on the top of the hill, which was derelict,</div><div id="00:55:35.060" class="transcript_line"> and there was money given to them by a building company to do it up for us,</div><div id="00:55:39.060" class="transcript_line"> but they reneged on that. They&#039;re now going to sell it off for flats, which is typical of our council, I&#039;m afraid.</div><div id="00:55:45.060" class="transcript_line"> So we now rent a factory unit just on the outskirts of Bury, although we&#039;re pin-hauled the gymnastics club,</div><div id="00:55:51.060" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve got lots of members there, and as long as we can pay the rent, which is £25,000 a year,</div><div id="00:55:58.060" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll keep going.</div><div id="00:56:01.060" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re the only ones that deal with special needs in the area, so the youngsters come to us, you know.</div><div id="00:56:07.060" class="transcript_line"> So tell me, when did you retire as a gymnast?</div><div id="00:56:12.060" class="transcript_line"> In 1961.</div><div id="00:56:14.060" class="transcript_line"> Right, and when did you become a coach?</div><div id="00:56:18.060" class="transcript_line"> I was already coaching before I retired, but I didn&#039;t qualify as a coach until later,</div><div id="00:56:24.060" class="transcript_line"> and I eventually got to an international coaching standard.</div><div id="00:56:28.060" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:56:29.060" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it sort of goes to the system club, club, area, national, and so on, when I got to international standard.</div><div id="00:56:35.060" class="transcript_line"> So I travelled a lot with British teams.</div><div id="00:56:37.060" class="transcript_line"> Right, and you were coaching at the top level then?</div><div id="00:56:40.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:56:41.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:56:42.060" class="transcript_line"> So I had a girl that was in the Olympics.</div><div id="00:56:44.060" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:56:45.060" class="transcript_line"> Pamela Hopkins she was, Pamela Hardwick she is now, and two girls that have been in the Commonwealth Games in the past.</div><div id="00:56:51.060" class="transcript_line"> But to be honest, I don&#039;t aim for the dizzy heights anymore because I don&#039;t approve of the training programmes for small children that there are.</div><div id="00:57:02.060" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t approve them losing school to train, and I see too many young children retire with overuse injuries.</div><div id="00:57:11.060" class="transcript_line"> Children, not adults, children.</div><div id="00:57:14.060" class="transcript_line"> And so to get to the standard that you have to get to, you&#039;ve got to give up a lot and take a lot of risk.</div><div id="00:57:21.060" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not prepared for my children to, I call on my children to do that.</div><div id="00:57:26.060" class="transcript_line"> If they&#039;ve got the talent and want that, I&#039;m quite happy to help them move on to someone who will, but I won&#039;t be part of it.</div><div id="00:57:34.060" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m an old fashioned biddy, and I don&#039;t like the way it goes.</div><div id="00:57:40.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;ve seen that with some people in the Olympics, and tennis and things.</div><div id="00:57:46.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:57:47.060" class="transcript_line"> Now haven&#039;t we, in the last 20 years.</div><div id="00:57:50.060" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we&#039;ve got children now.</div><div id="00:57:52.060" class="transcript_line"> When I started gymnastics, my coach didn&#039;t take anyone until they were 12, and I wasn&#039;t even 12.</div><div id="00:57:58.060" class="transcript_line"> But now they&#039;re retiring at nine.</div><div id="00:58:02.060" class="transcript_line"> I mean, this is appalling.</div><div id="00:58:04.060" class="transcript_line"> I shouldn&#039;t say this about my own sport, but it is my hobby.</div><div id="00:58:08.060" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one thing I feel very strongly about, very, very strongly.</div><div id="00:58:12.060" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about your work now with disabled people.</div><div id="00:58:16.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, I designed a programme of work for children with, for school children with disabilities, for schools to take part in.</div><div id="00:58:22.060" class="transcript_line"> And I managed to get some sponsorship from Rotary, who fund most of it.</div><div id="00:58:27.060" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still going now, although I haven&#039;t been involved with it myself now for four years.</div><div id="00:58:31.060" class="transcript_line"> I ran it since, oh, I said 30 odd years I did it, on my kitchen table, until I got to 800 taking part in a year.</div><div id="00:58:40.060" class="transcript_line"> So it goes on through schools all throughout Wales.</div><div id="00:58:45.060" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a gradual programme, a progressive programme of work, so that the vault, for instance,</div><div id="00:58:55.060" class="transcript_line"> stand on a very small thing and jump off, and that&#039;s the vault, until the higher levels actually go over a low box.</div><div id="00:59:02.060" class="transcript_line"> So it goes through four ranges of work.</div><div id="00:59:06.060" class="transcript_line"> And that still continues.</div><div id="00:59:09.060" class="transcript_line"> I was offered a marvellous job in Germany working there.</div><div id="00:59:14.060" class="transcript_line"> They offered me a fabulous wage and a flat on it, and a Mercedes, and I didn&#039;t want to go to Germany.</div><div id="00:59:20.060" class="transcript_line"> And Saudi Arabia used it, because they saw a display of some of this work and asked me to make a copy of the programme,</div><div id="00:59:28.060" class="transcript_line"> and I understand they&#039;re using it in their schools.</div><div id="00:59:30.060" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m quite proud of that.</div><div id="00:59:32.060" class="transcript_line"> My latest reason to feel proud is that three of my gymnasts,</div><div id="00:59:39.060" class="transcript_line"> two with Down syndrome and one autistic, severely autistic, have just gained their coaching awards.</div><div id="00:59:47.060" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re qualified as assistant coaches.</div><div id="00:59:49.060" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll never be class responsible, but they&#039;ve got the dignity of being one.</div><div id="00:59:53.060" class="transcript_line"> And they take, on a Thursday we have a beginner&#039;s special needs class, and then the advanced ones after,</div><div id="00:59:59.060" class="transcript_line"> or the older, sometimes they&#039;re not so advanced, they&#039;re just getting a bit older.</div><div id="01:00:03.060" class="transcript_line"> And they conduct the whole of that class.</div><div id="01:00:05.060" class="transcript_line"> They run it under supervision, of course.</div><div id="01:00:08.060" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re always there, myself and a couple of others.</div><div id="01:00:10.060" class="transcript_line"> But we can just sit and chat, because they just do it brilliantly.</div><div id="01:00:13.060" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ve got their coaching awards, so I&#039;m really proud of that.</div><div id="01:00:16.060" class="transcript_line"> We already had one Down syndrome boy that had got a coaching award, but he was sort of exceptional.</div><div id="01:00:25.060" class="transcript_line"> He still coaches with us now, and he&#039;s 38.</div><div id="01:00:29.060" class="transcript_line"> He coaches mainstream.</div><div id="01:00:31.060" class="transcript_line"> The other three now coach disabled themselves.</div><div id="01:00:34.060" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s nice.</div><div id="01:00:36.060" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve always got someone in the British Special Olympics team, wherever it is.</div><div id="01:00:42.060" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve always got someone and they always win. They do really well.</div><div id="01:00:46.060" class="transcript_line"> I think, I feel that the people think this is wonderful things for the special people with disabilities.</div><div id="01:00:54.060" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got physical and learning disabilities.</div><div id="01:00:57.060" class="transcript_line"> But to me, the ones who benefit the most are the mainstream children, because they train together.</div><div id="01:01:02.060" class="transcript_line"> And they get so used to them being there that they&#039;re never going to stop in the street,</div><div id="01:01:07.060" class="transcript_line"> and their children will never stop in the street and stare at someone who doesn&#039;t look quite the same.</div><div id="01:01:11.060" class="transcript_line"> And all our social events are together.</div><div id="01:01:13.060" class="transcript_line"> We have Christmas parties, we have discos, we have outings, and they&#039;re all together.</div><div id="01:01:18.060" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not unusual for somebody about six years old to come up and say,</div><div id="01:01:23.060" class="transcript_line"> Gareth&#039;s round the corner and he&#039;s crying, and Gareth&#039;s 32.</div><div id="01:01:28.060" class="transcript_line"> So they never get told anything. They just accept what there is.</div><div id="01:01:32.060" class="transcript_line"> They accept them for what they are.</div><div id="01:01:34.060" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t give lessons in how to deal with them.</div><div id="01:01:36.060" class="transcript_line"> They just treat them as part of the class, and they get to work it out for themselves.</div><div id="01:01:40.060" class="transcript_line"> And I think, for all the work we&#039;ve done in getting some of the special needs to quite high level of performance,</div><div id="01:01:47.060" class="transcript_line"> I think the greatest achievement we have is the acceptance of the mainstreamers with them.</div><div id="01:01:52.060" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m proud of that.</div><div id="01:01:54.060" class="transcript_line"> Can I just ask you one more thing?</div><div id="01:01:57.060" class="transcript_line"> Why did you get interested in disability school?</div><div id="01:02:01.060" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was not a choice.</div><div id="01:02:03.060" class="transcript_line"> We had a running gym club. We used to work in Stanwell School at the time,</div><div id="01:02:06.060" class="transcript_line"> when they had a big funding grant to modernise it, it threw us out.</div><div id="01:02:11.060" class="transcript_line"> But when we were there, I was asked to go to the YMCA in Cardiff,</div><div id="01:02:19.060" class="transcript_line"> which was in the parade, to see some of the gymnasts working.</div><div id="01:02:24.060" class="transcript_line"> I was quite impressed, although I felt they were treating them like disabled</div><div id="01:02:28.060" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d like to be treated like proper people, you know.</div><div id="01:02:30.060" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, that&#039;s just a personal thing.</div><div id="01:02:32.060" class="transcript_line"> But then the girl, it was a man and a husband and wife, and the girl got pregnant.</div><div id="01:02:37.060" class="transcript_line"> So they asked us whether we would take them over, take their class over,</div><div id="01:02:42.060" class="transcript_line"> for a little while, until after she&#039;d had the baby.</div><div id="01:02:46.060" class="transcript_line"> So I said, would I take it over? And I said, no, I can&#039;t.</div><div id="01:02:50.060" class="transcript_line"> Because I lived in Grangetown and I was training in Penarth, coaching in Penarth,</div><div id="01:02:55.060" class="transcript_line"> and they wanted me, and I said, if they can come over to us, we&#039;ll put on a special,</div><div id="01:03:00.060" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ll move a class back and bring them in in front, and they can come over if they&#039;ll be happy with that.</div><div id="01:03:05.060" class="transcript_line"> So that was fine. So over they came, and the biggest problem we had was behavioural.</div><div id="01:03:11.060" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, I&#039;m not putting up with this.</div><div id="01:03:14.060" class="transcript_line"> So we got them to tow the party line in no time at all,</div><div id="01:03:18.060" class="transcript_line"> and once they did, they had a much better time. They enjoyed it more.</div><div id="01:03:21.060" class="transcript_line"> And we had about, I said to the parents, we&#039;ll take them for a month,</div><div id="01:03:25.060" class="transcript_line"> then we&#039;ll have a little discussion about whether you want us to keep them until Angela&#039;s had this baby.</div><div id="01:03:30.060" class="transcript_line"> And so the parents came in and they said, and I overstepped the mark actually,</div><div id="01:03:35.060" class="transcript_line"> because I said, well, one thing we can do is we can make them all socially acceptable.</div><div id="01:03:40.060" class="transcript_line"> What I&#039;d received was not socially acceptable, and there was no reason why some of these should behave the way they are,</div><div id="01:03:46.060" class="transcript_line"> and they were always going to be, I felt, outcasts.</div><div id="01:03:49.060" class="transcript_line"> So some of the parents were a bit shocked at me saying that, but I really felt that that&#039;s what we had to offer.</div><div id="01:03:54.060" class="transcript_line"> And anyway, they said, yes, they&#039;d like them to stay.</div><div id="01:03:58.060" class="transcript_line"> But Angela and her husband never came back, so we just carried on having them,</div><div id="01:04:03.060" class="transcript_line"> and we got so involved with them, we shouldn&#039;t be without having them like that.</div><div id="01:04:07.060" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t a deliberate thing, it was quite an accident that we took them apart.</div><div id="01:04:13.060" class="transcript_line"> Just to ask you one more thing about the factory.</div><div id="01:04:17.060" class="transcript_line"> Looking back now, how do you feel about the time you spent working in the factory?</div><div id="01:04:22.060" class="transcript_line"> I loved it. Yes, they made me very welcome when I first got there.</div><div id="01:04:27.060" class="transcript_line"> I was a very young teenager, I think we were younger in those days,</div><div id="01:04:33.060" class="transcript_line"> and they were all adults that I was working with,</div><div id="01:04:36.060" class="transcript_line"> so I did feel a bit strange when I first went there, because where there was a lot of girls, they weren&#039;t there.</div><div id="01:04:42.060" class="transcript_line"> But they were happy days, they were very kind to me, they were appreciative of the work I did.</div><div id="01:04:51.060" class="transcript_line"> I felt that the men in the factory treated me nicely, it was good, I enjoyed it.</div><div id="01:04:58.060" class="transcript_line"> I only left because I had a baby, and in those days, at least I was of the opinion that if you had a baby you became a man.</div><div id="01:05:07.060" class="transcript_line"> That was your first priority.</div><div id="01:05:09.060" class="transcript_line"> Can I just ask you about Grangetown as well?</div><div id="01:05:12.060" class="transcript_line"> Was there an athletic club?</div><div id="01:05:15.060" class="transcript_line"> No, it was an ARP hut.</div><div id="01:05:19.060" class="transcript_line"> There was one by Ninian Park School, and there was one down on what they called the Marl, which was down Ferry Road.</div><div id="01:05:28.060" class="transcript_line"> Wasn&#039;t there something called the Grange Ladies?</div><div id="01:05:31.060" class="transcript_line"> Grange Ladies Gymnastic Club was what I was part of. That&#039;s what I belonged to.</div><div id="01:05:36.060" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I wanted to ask you about. When did that start?</div><div id="01:05:42.060" class="transcript_line"> That was the display that I saw in the park.</div><div id="01:05:46.060" class="transcript_line"> They were Grange Ladies. They also ran a boys&#039; team as well.</div><div id="01:05:52.060" class="transcript_line"> They had more girls than boys, but the boys mostly did the football.</div><div id="01:05:56.060" class="transcript_line"> That was how I came to join because I&#039;d seen them in the park.</div><div id="01:06:00.060" class="transcript_line"> This will be the school again.</div></div></p>
