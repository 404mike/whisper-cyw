class="transcript_line"> No, they&#039;re all friends.</div><div id="00:00:57.760" class="transcript_line"> A couple of years ago, we had Gateway&#039;s Got Talent,</div><div id="00:01:01.120" class="transcript_line"> where we used to tell jokes, mainly me.</div><div id="00:01:09.400" class="transcript_line"> People singing.</div><div id="00:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> I was living back in Cwmrydol anyway.</div><div id="00:01:15.440" class="transcript_line"> So did you go back because of the pandemic then?</div><div id="00:01:18.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Ah, you went to be with your family.</div><div id="00:01:20.560" class="transcript_line"> My family, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:21.720" class="transcript_line"> For me, it&#039;s fine going to parents</div><div id="00:01:26.040" class="transcript_line"> for a couple of weeks or something,</div><div id="00:01:29.280" class="transcript_line"> but I couldn&#039;t really talk with it for that long.</div><div id="00:01:32.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was hard, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:34.520" class="transcript_line"> The whole COVID time was a Mencap quiz,</div><div id="00:01:40.840" class="transcript_line"> but I didn&#039;t get involved in that much.</div><div id="00:01:44.240" class="transcript_line"> What was it then?</div><div id="00:01:45.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not really, it was on Zoom or something.</div><div id="00:01:50.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hopeless on Zoom, we&#039;ll be honest.</div><div id="00:01:55.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and do they not use computers?</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:01:58.840" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:01:59.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:02:00.520" class="transcript_line"> Got by strange, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:02.240" class="transcript_line"> It was strange at first to come back,</div><div id="00:02:04.680" class="transcript_line"> but it was good.</div><div id="00:02:10.200" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a guy called Colin Hunt.</div><div id="00:02:13.960" class="transcript_line"> I was the Gateway boss, I guess, at the time,</div><div id="00:02:19.160" class="transcript_line"> but he&#039;s retired now.</div><div id="00:02:21.680" class="transcript_line"> The only trip we&#039;ve been to since is</div><div id="00:02:26.280" class="transcript_line"> Wiltshire Safari Park.</div><div id="00:02:28.440" class="transcript_line"> But when Colin was with us,</div><div id="00:02:32.840" class="transcript_line"> we used to go to what&#039;s the state,</div><div id="00:02:36.080" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s Crow in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:39.320" class="transcript_line"> We used to go a few years.</div><div id="00:02:42.160" class="transcript_line"> We went on loads of trips,</div><div id="00:02:45.360" class="transcript_line"> group of us all together.</div><div id="00:02:47.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m an occasional radio presenter as well,</div><div id="00:02:53.200" class="transcript_line"> with radio broadcasts.</div><div id="00:02:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the moment, it&#039;s just once a week,</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s just on a Saturday at the moment.</div><div id="00:03:02.520" class="transcript_line"> For that, I used to do stuff for the Radio,</div><div id="00:03:07.480" class="transcript_line"> I answered the phones for Radio Carradighian as well.</div><div id="00:03:11.080" class="transcript_line"> We used to do a program called Isn&#039;t Life Fun?</div><div id="00:03:15.760" class="transcript_line"> And which was interviews and music</div><div id="00:03:23.640" class="transcript_line"> and well, me doing sport really.</div><div id="00:03:28.120" class="transcript_line"> But I think that was stopped because of the,</div><div id="00:03:30.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it was because of the pandemic.</div><div id="00:03:35.080" class="transcript_line"> We haven&#039;t gone back to it since.</div><div id="00:03:39.400" class="transcript_line"> Now I do help out in the presenting stuff.</div><div id="00:03:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Done actually,</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> interviewing as well.</div><div id="00:03:50.680" class="transcript_line"> To be honest, I never did when I was in Radio Carradighian.</div><div id="00:03:53.440" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s, it was a different thing for me that, but.</div><div id="00:03:59.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, very little, really.</div><div id="00:04:03.840" class="transcript_line"> So they made it accessible, did they?</div><div id="00:04:05.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:06.520" class="transcript_line"> And you opened it?</div><div id="00:04:07.360" class="transcript_line"> I opened it.</div><div id="00:04:08.800" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:04:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was amazing.</div><div id="00:04:11.640" class="transcript_line"> That was good, yeah, actually.</div><div id="00:04:12.960" class="transcript_line"> It was amazing.</div><div id="00:04:15.600" class="transcript_line"> What would you want people to understand about your life?</div><div id="00:04:20.280" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the difficulty,</div><div id="00:04:24.720" class="transcript_line"> because it sometimes is, of a disabled person.</div><div id="00:04:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Is Aberystwyth quite accessible or not?</div><div id="00:04:35.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not great, no, but yeah,</div><div id="00:04:37.400" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s pavements, it&#039;s not great, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:43.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s getting better, don&#039;t get me wrong, but yeah,</div><div id="00:04:46.320" class="transcript_line"> still a few challenges, I guess.</div><div id="00:04:50.840" class="transcript_line"> I love being in my cap.</div><div id="00:04:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we do loads of activities and stuff, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:00.240" class="transcript_line"> And do you speak Welsh?</div><div id="00:05:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, first language.</div><div id="00:05:03.120" class="transcript_line"> And do any of the staff speak Welsh here?</div><div id="00:05:06.520" class="transcript_line"> Not at the moment, no.</div><div id="00:05:08.480" class="transcript_line"> And what about in the gateway?</div><div id="00:05:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Most speak English, well, pretty much,</div><div id="00:05:14.080" class="transcript_line"> they all do speak English.</div><div id="00:05:16.200" class="transcript_line"> And in the day centre, do the staff speak Welsh at all?</div><div id="00:05:20.400" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:05:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you have many friends who speak Welsh?</div><div id="00:05:26.600" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:28.080" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a couple here in Aber,</div><div id="00:05:31.440" class="transcript_line"> but Jan&#039;s first language as well.</div><div id="00:05:35.760" class="transcript_line"> So you speak Welsh to her?</div><div id="00:05:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:38.320" class="transcript_line"> As I say, I&#039;m okay with Welsh or English, I don&#039;t mind.</div></div></p>
