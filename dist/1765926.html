Where do you live?</div><div id="00:00:39.640" class="transcript_line"> I live in Myford.</div><div id="00:00:41.200" class="transcript_line"> Myford, yeah. And I think that you&#039;ve got some stories to tell about your voluntary</div><div id="00:00:50.760" class="transcript_line"> work, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:00:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:53.560" class="transcript_line"> So what volunteering work have you done?</div><div id="00:00:58.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve volunteered in a cattery. I&#039;ve volunteered in Hope House. I&#039;ve volunteered as well at</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Paris Animal Welfare and that&#039;s it. And also I&#039;ve been doing, I used to go to Paris Castle.</div><div id="00:01:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Alright, so you&#039;ve actually done some really interesting jobs haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:38.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:39.080" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about the Paris, is it wildlife or animal?</div><div id="00:01:45.080" class="transcript_line"> Animal welfare.</div><div id="00:01:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a little bit about that?</div><div id="00:01:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Well the thing is like you volunteer, you do all the clothes, you iron them and put them</div><div id="00:01:57.640" class="transcript_line"> on the stall and then there&#039;s pictures of cats that need to be rehomed and all the money</div><div id="00:02:05.480" class="transcript_line"> goes to the animal charities and people just, loads of people come, like we&#039;ve got the books</div><div id="00:02:15.080" class="transcript_line"> that you can get, different clothes, jewellery, everything you can think of in there. But</div><div id="00:02:23.440" class="transcript_line"> also we sort the stuff out and we do, infect all the toys and all the stuff.</div><div id="00:02:32.160" class="transcript_line"> So did you get stuff donated?</div><div id="00:02:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:35.320" class="transcript_line"> And it was like a shop?</div><div id="00:02:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:38.320" class="transcript_line"> So did you have any, so you didn&#039;t have any animals there?</div><div id="00:02:42.640" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:02:44.200" class="transcript_line"> So the money went to the various charities. That&#039;s brilliant, that&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:02:51.200" class="transcript_line"> And so tell me a little bit about how you came to volunteer at Paris Castle.</div><div id="00:02:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Well since I was a little girl, I loved, I&#039;ve been there a couple of times and growing up</div><div id="00:03:06.200" class="transcript_line"> I actually loved the castle. I thought there was something special about it but I couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> get my head around what it was. And I remember one day my nan taking me round and something</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> just clicked. And now I&#039;m like, I&#039;m getting older and once I moved to my food and then</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> some do-you-work that asked me if I&#039;d like to go and volunteer there and if someone asked</div><div id="00:03:39.080" class="transcript_line"> me a question like that about any castle you wouldn&#039;t turn it down would you? So I went</div><div id="00:03:46.080" class="transcript_line"> and oh, it was just a dream come true. I remember just having a bit of tears in my eyes. I couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:53.080" class="transcript_line"> believe that I was there. I never thought I was able to go to a place like that. And</div><div id="00:04:00.080" class="transcript_line"> sadly my nan&#039;s not around anymore and it was really hard for me not able to tell her. But</div><div id="00:04:07.160" class="transcript_line"> oh, I just loved the place. So what did you like? What really did you like about it? The</div><div id="00:04:14.160" class="transcript_line"> atmosphere of looking when people come around. Their faces. It&#039;s interesting to watch the</div><div id="00:04:22.520" class="transcript_line"> go to certain things they&#039;re not allowed to touch and there was one day where it was really</div><div id="00:04:28.520" class="transcript_line"> busy. I stepped in one room where it was like one room there, one room there and you have</div><div id="00:04:33.520" class="transcript_line"> to be in the middle and this woman was touching this and I said you mustn&#039;t touch that and</div><div id="00:04:40.520" class="transcript_line"> she just looked at me and I just didn&#039;t know what to do. So she was trying to tell everybody</div><div id="00:04:47.520" class="transcript_line"> else. So I went and ran over to somebody else to say I need help here. Oh was that, you</div><div id="00:04:52.520" class="transcript_line"> went and asked, who did you go and ask? One of the other volunteers because it was getting</div><div id="00:04:57.520" class="transcript_line"> a bit too much telling these people not to. And there was one time when you&#039;re not allowed</div><div id="00:05:03.520" class="transcript_line"> to take photos there and one of the people there said that everyone comes from walk of</div><div id="00:05:11.520" class="transcript_line"> life, different countries, different people come and this one person took a photo of me,</div><div id="00:05:19.520" class="transcript_line"> not like a phone, took a photo right in my face. How did that make you feel? Well I&#039;m</div><div id="00:05:26.520" class="transcript_line"> not sure if I&#039;m right or if I wanted to punch them but I was smiling, I was smiling, I was</div><div id="00:05:33.520" class="transcript_line"> smiling because my heat level was going up, up, up. And I said could you please not do</div><div id="00:05:41.520" class="transcript_line"> that please. Would you like to explain for people that are listening that openly you</div><div id="00:05:49.520" class="transcript_line"> have autism? Autism and Williams syndrome too. So to actually do what you did for volunteering</div><div id="00:05:59.520" class="transcript_line"> and being in contact with the public you must have found that really stressful at times.</div><div id="00:06:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything that helped with your stress levels? Well I would just tell them about</div><div id="00:06:20.520" class="transcript_line"> it, forget what, it doesn&#039;t matter what, just forget about it and just concentrate on what</div><div id="00:06:26.520" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re doing with the people. Because if you don&#039;t do that and they ask you, it&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:34.520" class="transcript_line"> just, you know, you just lose it. So you&#039;ve just got to try and, something like forget</div><div id="00:06:41.520" class="transcript_line"> about it and just concentrate on little things in the castle to explain to them. So did you</div><div id="00:06:49.520" class="transcript_line"> actually then, you were showing people around and explaining a little bit of the history,</div><div id="00:06:55.520" class="transcript_line"> some of the stories. Can you remember any of the stories? Because I haven&#039;t been to</div><div id="00:07:01.520" class="transcript_line"> the ice castles looking so hard. Well there&#039;s an interesting, very interesting story that</div><div id="00:07:06.520" class="transcript_line"> sends my shivers up my spine. That there&#039;s some ghost in one of the rooms and I think</div><div id="00:07:17.520" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the one on the top of the stairs as you go up, up and ramble around there. I was with</div><div id="00:07:25.520" class="transcript_line"> one of the volunteers and she was looking at me and I was looking at her and I was like,</div><div id="00:07:36.520" class="transcript_line"> hi, what are you doing there? You&#039;re not supposed to be there. And at that point it didn&#039;t register</div><div id="00:07:44.520" class="transcript_line"> in my mind that there was a ghost there. So she looked at me and she said, Samak, would</div><div id="00:07:52.520" class="transcript_line"> you like to go to another room? And I was like, well why is that person there when they&#039;re</div><div id="00:07:58.520" class="transcript_line"> not supposed to? I couldn&#039;t get my head around it. And then I went into another room and</div><div id="00:08:08.520" class="transcript_line"> like before the people even came and there was one bit where I was down the stairs. It</div><div id="00:08:15.520" class="transcript_line"> was called the ballroom room or it&#039;s lush with all the stuff, all the gold stuff. Everything</div><div id="00:08:21.520" class="transcript_line"> is just beautiful, the artwork, everything of it. And that was just stunning. It was</div><div id="00:08:28.520" class="transcript_line"> like a piece out of a movie it is right down there. And I don&#039;t know, I just stood there</div><div id="00:08:36.520" class="transcript_line"> and it was so quiet. And then I heard, and I thought I could hear people around but there</div><div id="00:08:42.520" class="transcript_line"> was nobody around. I thought that was strange. And then once we had a break she kindly, well</div><div id="00:08:50.520" class="transcript_line"> bravely explained to me that there was a ghost up the stairs. And you&#039;d seen her? I&#039;d seen</div><div id="00:08:57.520" class="transcript_line"> this man. And what can you describe him to me? He looked really, he had interesting a</div><div id="00:09:05.520" class="transcript_line"> gown on and like a little cap, like a little cap like them big ones but then was this interesting</div><div id="00:09:15.520" class="transcript_line"> thing. I thought, well that man was not supposed to be there. And it was like clear as day</div><div id="00:09:22.520" class="transcript_line"> he was right in front of me. I said, excuse me what are you doing here? And he totally</div><div id="00:09:28.520" class="transcript_line"> ignored me and I thought have I said something wrong? Am I being rude? Or is he being rude</div><div id="00:09:38.520" class="transcript_line"> because he&#039;s not speaking to me. I was like what the hell. That&#039;s a brilliant story. It</div><div id="00:09:47.520" class="transcript_line"> was just incredible. So you were a tour guide for the rooms for all the tourists coming</div><div id="00:09:54.520" class="transcript_line"> in. Yes. So did you do any other jobs at the castle? I didn&#039;t for a while because sadly</div><div id="00:10:07.020" class="transcript_line"> the volunteer&#039;s husband died so I didn&#039;t go back to the castle for a while. And then as</div><div id="00:10:15.520" class="transcript_line"> well a couple of months later I met Kat. Oh yeah Kat was there. Mum told me about it</div><div id="00:10:23.520" class="transcript_line"> so I thought, oh I said I couldn&#039;t get to stand again because I was so excited if I</div><div id="00:10:28.520" class="transcript_line"> was able to go back on it or what was happening. Anyway people don&#039;t tell me these days anymore.</div><div id="00:10:35.520" class="transcript_line"> And then when I went up there I spoke to Kat and she explained to me what I was doing about</div><div id="00:10:42.520" class="transcript_line"> the garden. Doing a bit of everything again going, it&#039;s like restarting everything. And</div><div id="00:10:53.520" class="transcript_line"> doing the garden was absolutely fun. I love looking around the garden. What&#039;s your favourite</div><div id="00:11:00.520" class="transcript_line"> bit of the garden? I would say all the different trees and the flowers because apparently they&#039;re</div><div id="00:11:09.520" class="transcript_line"> really hard to keep that remembered. I think it&#039;s the most important thing. I think it&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:16.520" class="transcript_line"> the trees and the flowers because apparently they&#039;re really hard to keep that momentum</div><div id="00:11:22.520" class="transcript_line"> what kind of structure they are because they&#039;re very old. It&#039;s a lot of work isn&#039;t it? It&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:27.520" class="transcript_line"> a lot of work to do because you&#039;ve got to do exactly the same thing or they won&#039;t be</div><div id="00:11:35.520" class="transcript_line"> very happy. No. So you carried on doing, when you went back the second time, you carried</div><div id="00:11:43.520" class="transcript_line"> on doing the tour guide stuff did you? Yes. That came quite easily I would imagine because</div><div id="00:11:52.520" class="transcript_line"> you could remember some things. Yes. And did you work in the ticket office? Yes. What was</div><div id="00:11:59.520" class="transcript_line"> that like? I didn&#039;t enjoy that at all. Why not? Because people were a bit, I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:12:06.520" class="transcript_line"> but not snotty but I don&#039;t know, impatient. These were the guests coming in I suppose</div><div id="00:12:15.520" class="transcript_line"> I think. They were a little bit cocky if I must say that. A little bit arrogant. Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:27.520" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s like excuse me I&#039;m talking. They&#039;d be rude. This woman wasn&#039;t very pleasant</div><div id="00:12:34.520" class="transcript_line"> and just smiled again. It&#039;s very difficult isn&#039;t it to keep your cool? So demanding.</div><div id="00:12:42.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like I&#039;m not very good on mine. I am good at patience but sometimes starting to</div><div id="00:12:49.520" class="transcript_line"> get the layers of my temperament I explode. I don&#039;t mean to but I do. So you had to try</div><div id="00:12:59.520" class="transcript_line"> and keep yourself under control was that difficult? Yes because my face was hurting. With the</div><div id="00:13:06.520" class="transcript_line"> smiling? Yes. I wanted to do something and I was like no come on be professional. So</div><div id="00:13:13.520" class="transcript_line"> how did you get to, how did you travel? How did you travel to Paris Castle for my part?</div><div id="00:13:20.520" class="transcript_line"> I was very lucky because my mum picked me up and brought me back. Oh that was handy.</div><div id="00:13:25.520" class="transcript_line"> And also the other volunteer did the same thing as well so it was really nice. So do</div><div id="00:13:32.520" class="transcript_line"> you keep in contact with anybody from Trust Buddies or from the volunteering programme</div><div id="00:13:39.520" class="transcript_line"> from before? Yes I only one Christine because she lives in my village. Oh right. Yeah sadly</div><div id="00:13:47.520" class="transcript_line"> she lost her husband last night. He was really, he was funny. He did the same thing. And did</div><div id="00:13:52.520" class="transcript_line"> he? Yeah it was funny. He used to make me laugh. He told this one guy off before taking</div><div id="00:14:03.520" class="transcript_line"> photographs and for him it must be hard as well because he was really older and he knew</div><div id="00:14:12.520" class="transcript_line"> the business. He knows everything inside out. And there was one time when I was in my volunteer</div><div id="00:14:19.520" class="transcript_line"> and I was going into the bottom where the kitchen is and you&#039;ve got this room, the pool</div><div id="00:14:26.520" class="transcript_line"> room I think it&#039;s called with them grotesque birds. Oh right. Is that near the staff room?</div><div id="00:14:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah it&#039;s not far from there. And there was a guy that wasn&#039;t supposed to be, because</div><div id="00:14:40.520" class="transcript_line"> he was trying to tell us about the grotesque in the thing and he didn&#039;t want to leave.</div><div id="00:14:49.520" class="transcript_line"> And for me that was really frightening and my anxiety levels went. So I, because someone</div><div id="00:14:59.520" class="transcript_line"> came down because I was having a bit of a panic attack at that time because I thought</div><div id="00:15:04.520" class="transcript_line"> something bad, suddenly things were evaluating in my head that something bad was going to</div><div id="00:15:11.520" class="transcript_line"> happen. Yeah. And I didn&#039;t know what to do. I didn&#039;t know whether to, I don&#039;t have a twin</div><div id="00:15:17.520" class="transcript_line"> or anything so I couldn&#039;t just. Yeah. So the staff took me over the room and calmed me</div><div id="00:15:23.520" class="transcript_line"> down. And he left there to, just what he&#039;s never been back since because he got told</div><div id="00:15:29.520" class="transcript_line"> off once. Did he? Yeah. Good job too. Because I thought he was going to hurt somebody.</div><div id="00:15:36.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not a nice feeling to feel threatened is it and frightened when you&#039;re at work.</div><div id="00:15:41.520" class="transcript_line"> Because somebody told him to leave and you just wouldn&#039;t have it. No. So when you left</div><div id="00:15:49.520" class="transcript_line"> Trust Buddies, so how long were you working there before you left? The first time, how</div><div id="00:15:56.520" class="transcript_line"> long, well the first time you did your volunteering, that was for how long? A few months? Yeah,</div><div id="00:16:05.520" class="transcript_line"> a few months and then a few years on and off. On and off. Yeah. And how was the, how did</div><div id="00:16:14.520" class="transcript_line"> you find the training? Was it, did you find it difficult, easy? Did you find some bits</div><div id="00:16:21.520" class="transcript_line"> of it, you could learn better than others? Yeah there were some bits because some of</div><div id="00:16:28.520" class="transcript_line"> the words that you have to explain go over, that was a bit challenging but I was getting</div><div id="00:16:34.520" class="transcript_line"> excited because I thought oh this is going to be fun yet again. It must have been absolutely</div><div id="00:16:42.520" class="transcript_line"> brilliant for thinking from when you were a little girl and enjoying the castle because</div><div id="00:16:49.520" class="transcript_line"> I know you like history as well so it must have ticked so many bells. Oh it was just,</div><div id="00:16:55.520" class="transcript_line"> it was one of those moments in my life that I just cried a few tears because I said my</div><div id="00:17:00.520" class="transcript_line"> nan I&#039;m going to polish all those antiques I remember telling her. Yeah my nan just laughed</div><div id="00:17:07.520" class="transcript_line"> and laughed because she knows how much I used to love going up, they went there all the time,</div><div id="00:17:12.520" class="transcript_line"> we had picnics, we had cakes, everything there, it was great fun and I thought one day I&#039;m</div><div id="00:17:17.520" class="transcript_line"> going to be there and I did it, I thought wow. I had like shivers down my spine. So</div><div id="00:17:23.520" class="transcript_line"> did you do the same job with Trust Buddies when you were volunteering the last time?</div><div id="00:17:27.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes. It was just doing the tour guides was it? And also the gardener, and the ticket</div><div id="00:17:35.520" class="transcript_line"> office as well. Oh right, because they&#039;ve got a coffee shop there didn&#039;t you? Yeah I</div><div id="00:17:40.520" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t do any of that. You didn&#039;t, that wasn&#039;t your cup of tea, excuse the pun. I didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:46.520" class="transcript_line"> think I could handle rude people. So what was your most favourite job there then? Oh</div><div id="00:17:53.520" class="transcript_line"> Jesus. Oh I can&#039;t choose, I like both. You like, yeah. But I didn&#039;t like the ticket office.</div><div id="00:18:03.520" class="transcript_line"> So you loved the gardens, working the gardens and helping people get the gardens ready.</div><div id="00:18:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Because some people were lost in there, like I said, because I was in the garden,</div><div id="00:18:16.520" class="transcript_line"> I said go over there, go over there, da da da, and you&#039;ll be fine. Oh people getting</div><div id="00:18:22.520" class="transcript_line"> lost in the gardens and not knowing where they were. Yeah. Well Sam, I think that was</div><div id="00:18:30.520" class="transcript_line"> really interesting and thank you very much.</div></div></p>
