    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello there, my name is Graham Verbeer, a member of Newport based hip hop comedy group</div><div id="00:00:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Goldie Looking Chain.</div><div id="00:00:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I have been a DJ around Newport for years and I do some shifts in Diverse with my friends</div><div id="00:00:24.440" class="transcript_line"> Paul and Matt.</div><div id="00:00:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Gigs, gigs, how long have I been going to gigs?</div><div id="00:00:27.920" class="transcript_line"> I think my first ever gig was The Levelers at Newport Centre with Credit to the Nation</div><div id="00:00:34.640" class="transcript_line"> and Chumbawumba.</div><div id="00:00:35.640" class="transcript_line"> Right, and I was about 14.</div><div id="00:00:38.480" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t allowed to go to see therapy in TJs because my mum was scared of TJs at that point</div><div id="00:00:45.440" class="transcript_line"> because I was quite young, so I was only about 13.</div><div id="00:00:48.840" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was a trade off, I couldn&#039;t go and see therapy, they had just done an</div><div id="00:00:53.400" class="transcript_line"> album called Pleasure Death which also terrified my mother.</div><div id="00:00:57.800" class="transcript_line"> So she said, you can go see The Levelers, they look like nice chaps.</div><div id="00:01:02.520" class="transcript_line"> And I went to see The Levelers and the Credits to the Nation were amazing.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was my first gig in the Newport Centre.</div><div id="00:01:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, but it&#039;s not really actually, come on, that&#039;s the first gig I go to on my own.</div><div id="00:01:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Can I just also say though, I did go to a lot of gigs with my parents in the Newport</div><div id="00:01:17.800" class="transcript_line"> Centre including Tim Machine with lead singer David Bowie, my hero.</div><div id="00:01:23.600" class="transcript_line"> So I have seen David Bowie in the Newport Centre.</div><div id="00:01:26.040" class="transcript_line"> That was amazing.</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> But my parents thought he was going to do Space Oddity and Rebel Rebel and he didn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:01:30.720" class="transcript_line"> he did a lot of thrash metal sort of stuff and they hated it and they said they were</div><div id="00:01:35.800" class="transcript_line"> never taking me to another gig again.</div><div id="00:01:37.480" class="transcript_line"> Hence, the next gig I went to was The Levelers on my own with my friends.</div><div id="00:01:42.200" class="transcript_line"> So most memorable gig, I&#039;m going to have to be a bit narcissistic and include a gig I</div><div id="00:01:47.640" class="transcript_line"> did because it was a great day and it would be the TJs in the Square, which was in John</div><div id="00:01:52.140" class="transcript_line"> Frost Square.</div><div id="00:01:53.140" class="transcript_line"> It was in tribute to John Sokolo who ran and TJs and owned TJs for many years and we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:02:00.480" class="transcript_line"> all done our time in TJs as indie boys, you know, and indie girls.</div><div id="00:02:04.880" class="transcript_line"> We all had a great time in TJs back in the 90s, 80s, 90s.</div><div id="00:02:07.720" class="transcript_line"> It was a great place to go.</div><div id="00:02:09.340" class="transcript_line"> So it was a great day of Newport bands and we were headlining but I managed to sort of</div><div id="00:02:14.640" class="transcript_line"> hang out with all the bands I used to follow around Newport, you know, and my favourite</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> were Nova Kane.</div><div id="00:02:20.080" class="transcript_line"> I sort of hung out with Steve, the singer, and I was a bit fanboy-y and he was all chuffed.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He was like, oh my God, you guys are great.</div><div id="00:02:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I love you guys.</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m like, no, no, no, you are great.</div><div id="00:02:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Because I used to go and see, I saw Elastica, I saw all sorts of gigs where Nova Kane would</div><div id="00:02:36.920" class="transcript_line"> be usually third on the bill, 60 foot dolls then and then the band who were coming into</div><div id="00:02:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Newport.</div><div id="00:02:42.320" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d always go to see Nova Kane.</div><div id="00:02:44.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d follow Nova Kane around and they were my favourite.</div><div id="00:02:47.400" class="transcript_line"> But it was cool just to play with them, see them get back on stage.</div><div id="00:02:50.640" class="transcript_line"> That was 2010, 2010.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> There was all sorts.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Disco, my pal Ed, Casey in Disco and Sam from La Pub.</div><div id="00:02:59.160" class="transcript_line"> They reformed for a day.</div><div id="00:03:01.280" class="transcript_line"> We had John Robb down here from the Membranes.</div><div id="00:03:03.840" class="transcript_line"> John Robb and he was big mates with John, Ticolo and Goldblade, yeah.</div><div id="00:03:08.800" class="transcript_line"> Which I&#039;m not sure what they played as that day.</div><div id="00:03:11.360" class="transcript_line"> It might have been Goldblade.</div><div id="00:03:13.400" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, but he&#039;s in the Membranes as well.</div><div id="00:03:15.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure what Darling Buds were on.</div><div id="00:03:17.720" class="transcript_line"> They had some good hits with our mates in that as well, Matt and all.</div><div id="00:03:20.880" class="transcript_line"> And who else was on that day?</div><div id="00:03:23.200" class="transcript_line"> It was a great day of all sorts.</div><div id="00:03:27.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think, who else?</div><div id="00:03:29.440" class="transcript_line"> Us.</div><div id="00:03:30.160" class="transcript_line"> It was a great day and everyone was sort of jumping around John Frost Square.</div><div id="00:03:33.680" class="transcript_line"> By the time we got on, it was quite late and everyone jumping up and down John Frost Square.</div><div id="00:03:37.920" class="transcript_line"> And I just thought, why have we not done this before?</div><div id="00:03:40.440" class="transcript_line"> And then John Frost Square didn&#039;t exist anymore and you couldn&#039;t really do it</div><div id="00:03:43.480" class="transcript_line"> because it didn&#039;t have that sort of space.</div><div id="00:03:45.080" class="transcript_line"> But it looked, from the stage, it looked amazing.</div><div id="00:03:48.240" class="transcript_line"> Us being Newport Boys, we just played all sorts of festivals and things.</div><div id="00:03:52.480" class="transcript_line"> But that, to me, was just wonderful.</div><div id="00:03:54.920" class="transcript_line"> Seeing all my people jumping up and down in the middle of John Frost Square.</div><div id="00:03:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I used to DJ on a night called Drop Your Pants.</div><div id="00:04:03.480" class="transcript_line"> And it was a big indie night, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:05.920" class="transcript_line"> For years before I started doing it as well with John and Malc and all.</div><div id="00:04:10.080" class="transcript_line"> It was a massive night.</div><div id="00:04:10.960" class="transcript_line"> So all these generations that went through that night, or you go to TJs,</div><div id="00:04:14.760" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;d be the same sort of crowd and bits and pieces.</div><div id="00:04:16.840" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;d have maybe a rock, a harder rock crowd in TJs some nights.</div><div id="00:04:20.640" class="transcript_line"> And of course, there was the pop crowd who would just go out</div><div id="00:04:23.920" class="transcript_line"> and go to the pubs and the Meringer crowd.</div><div id="00:04:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And all of those type of people from all those different years did turn up for that.</div><div id="00:04:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because, you know, it basically, of course,</div><div id="00:04:33.440" class="transcript_line"> TJs did have a bit of maybe sort of other type of nights, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:37.600" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t just rock.</div><div id="00:04:38.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a fascinating place to be, TJs, back in the 80s, 90s.</div><div id="00:04:42.080" class="transcript_line"> People tell me that the 80s were better.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I miss them.</div><div id="00:04:45.200" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, TJs was great, didn&#039;t they, 90s?</div><div id="00:04:48.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but it was just nice to see all sorts of people turn out</div><div id="00:04:51.280" class="transcript_line"> from all the different ages and then just come together for John and TJs,</div><div id="00:04:55.640" class="transcript_line"> but also for Newport Music.</div><div id="00:04:57.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve always had that.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We were the New Seattle, you know, remember that?</div><div id="00:05:02.040" class="transcript_line"> But we were the New Seattle and, you know, we had great bands</div><div id="00:05:05.840" class="transcript_line"> like Dean and the Cowboy Killers,</div><div id="00:05:09.280" class="transcript_line"> Tea Rooms of Babylon, remember them?</div><div id="00:05:11.200" class="transcript_line"> They were a good band.</div><div id="00:05:12.120" class="transcript_line"> And as they say, Novocaine and Flyscreen, Rollercoaster.</div><div id="00:05:16.200" class="transcript_line"> Rollercoaster.</div><div id="00:05:17.280" class="transcript_line"> That was Sticky&#039;s band, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:19.880" class="transcript_line"> That was Sticky&#039;s band.</div><div id="00:05:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Loads of great bands.</div><div id="00:05:23.120" class="transcript_line"> 60 Foot Dolls, obviously, as well.</div><div id="00:05:25.520" class="transcript_line"> All these people were in TJs and suddenly they were in bands,</div><div id="00:05:28.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, where you would go to the Meringer, the Mannix would be in there.</div><div id="00:05:31.240" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and they&#039;d be all bands everywhere.</div><div id="00:05:33.920" class="transcript_line"> And it was a it was a it was great.</div><div id="00:05:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Everyone was in a band and forming like sort of arts, you know,</div><div id="00:05:39.280" class="transcript_line"> not necessarily bands that had an eye on the charts,</div><div id="00:05:41.920" class="transcript_line"> but I just wanted to do some music.</div><div id="00:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a creative place.</div><div id="00:05:45.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always has been.</div><div id="00:05:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s that&#039;s what TJs was great for.</div><div id="00:05:49.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what that was a celebration of TJs in the Square.</div><div id="00:05:52.240" class="transcript_line"> Wonderful. Bring them back.</div></div></p>
