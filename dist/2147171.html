is.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So give as much detail as you would like or give as little detail as you like.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s totally up to you.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Make it sharp and sweet and...</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that first...</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Two points.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> First things first.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I know...</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it a set question you&#039;re going to ask?</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a few set questions but I might flex around them.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you mind if I just go through all these one by one?</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s things like growing up here, moving here, what&#039;s life like being here and just a little bit about age alive.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, coming on then.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So first things first.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Before we always stop and start again.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell me your name and where you were born?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Muriel Watson and I was born in Newtown, Bastia St. Kitts.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Muriel, can you remember what St. Kitts was like?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me, give me as much vivid information.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like?</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was home.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was nice, hot, friendly.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, in 1961 I came to this country so things would be much different now I expect than when I left there.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But everybody was friendly, we were very respectful.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to respect the older people.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Couldn&#039;t answer back like now.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was just right for me.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember maybe any games you played or how did you have fun?</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, we made up our own games then.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d skip, we&#039;d sing, you know.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we&#039;d make our own game, hopscotch, any kind of game.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have any brothers or sisters?</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I had one brother and two sisters, family of four.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember then?</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was the younger one, the last one.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So, well, you could call it like nowadays, the baby of the family.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Very cared for.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, my brother, well, he hoovered around me like over this business.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> My sisters were kind even when they left St. Kitts before I did and they looked after me.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They would always send back letters and whatever they had, gifts.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about when did you arrive in the UK?</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I came, pardon me, I left St. Kitts the 15th of November, 1961.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I got here the 30th of November because I came on the SS Monster Act.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Came to Southampton.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was met by my husband, TB, then.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And we missed the last train to Wales, Newport, so we had to stay overnight in the railway station.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> It was cold, very, very cold.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was glad for the fire.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> For the first time I saw a fire anywhere in the house.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and the sparklers was coming everywhere.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we caught the next train to Newport the early morning.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> They got to Newport on Friday, the 1st of December, 1961.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What was that journey over? What did it feel like? Were you nervous?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The journey over was very, very nervous.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, the five of us in the cabin, we were the same in the same situation.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So we made friends, we would sing.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I was the only one in there from St. Kitts until someone in the bottom deck was being sick all the time.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were allowed to come up and stay with me.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was two of us from St. Kitts in the cabin.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m very, very nervous.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I was scared, actually, of the soldiers.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So we used to make sure the doors were always locked.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, we just survived.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about your first week.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> On the boat or here?</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Here.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> My first week over here.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, to be honest, I came here the Friday.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> The Saturday we stayed in all day.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The Sunday, my husband took me over the transporter bridge to show me, because he was working there.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So to show me where he was working, so I could go there to see if I could get the job.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I went over there on a Monday.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It was raining.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I got the job.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I started on Tuesday.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was only here a couple of days and I started work.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There was nobody but my husband to be.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I realized another lady that lived in the same house, because it was nine rooms in one house,</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> 102 Alexander Road, and the lady down the bottom.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I was up the top, lady on the bottom.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I realized that she worked there as well.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So as I said, I got the job straight away and I started.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I started on Tuesday.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It was cold.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> It was freezing.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t like it at all.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was raining.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t stop raining.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It rained for days.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So different to send kids.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You get heavy showers there.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You get hurricane and all that, but it&#039;s so different.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It was so different.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Adopting was hard.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The only thing was that I knew as the person that I came to, that was my husband to be.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We got married the March.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, at work.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And after a few, it was hard.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to wear gloves.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The material you had on too was hot.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I got used to it because I wanted to work, to occupy my time as well.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I had been staying in the one room all the time.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was able to go.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband to me used to work shift, 6 to 12, to the 10.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So I knew you could see him going through during his break time.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> After a while I got used to the work and I was allowed overtime.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was 6 pounds 18 and 6 vans a week.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be like 6 pounds 70, 75 pence now.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> If you do overtime and you do Saturday morning you&#039;ll get 9 pounds, 9 pounds and a week.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a lot of money then.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course a loaf of bread was only like a shilling, like 25 pence now.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Things were cheap.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and yeah.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember of your childhood?</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like?</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> My childhood, my parents, my mother, she worked as well.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> She worked in a crèche.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s like a preschool nursery like for children.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> My father was a cassandre of, like you call it, welfare person that would go around and make sure people were well being and all.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he worked in the district for a while then he was taken.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> He worked other places.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So sometimes we would have, my father would be home all the time.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d be away for a week and so on.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I said, my parents, my mother worked.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember of any cultural or spiritual practices or any sort of practices that you brought over with yourself?</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We were Moravian.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Went to the Moravian Church then.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Every Sunday we went to church.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to go to Sunday school as children.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go to children&#039;s church.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go to junior choir.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We took part in everything that the church offered.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Always go to church ever since I could remember.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s a Moravian Church?</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> A Moravian Church is like the Methodist.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You heard of the Methodist?</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a sister church to the Methodist.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I came here, there was no Moravian Church in Newport.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to the Methodist Church.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> After a while, the Methodist Church.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> First of all, I went to the church down pale.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were only black people there, so we didn&#039;t go there for long.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we found the Methodist Church.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to the Methodist Church then.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after that, they outgrew the church.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The people were getting older.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And so they had to move.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So then I joined the New Testament Church then.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a faculty church.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me a bit about living in Newport.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like for you?</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was strange, different.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t know anyone, as I said before.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we worked Monday to Friday, and Saturday sometimes.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we go to Cardiff, where there were more people from St. Kitts,</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> from the Eastern Caribbean.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Every Saturday after work, we get the train down to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then there were more people from St. Kitts.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me maybe a fond memory you have of growing up,</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> or your early days in Newport, and then maybe, yeah,</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> maybe an event you went to, or?</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, as I said, we worked, we worked Monday to Friday.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then on Saturdays, Sundays, we&#039;d either go to church or have a lie-in,</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> catch up on whatever work we had to do in the house and washing and all that, yes.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I could remember coming to Newport, I met one lady.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, living in one room, we had to do laundry outside.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I could remember her saying to me, playing,</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what are you doing? She says.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> With the laundry that comes every Monday, just put them in a pillowcase,</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> two pillowcase or three or whatever, and they&#039;d pick it up and they&#039;d bring it to the next day.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was a godsend. Oh, because, you know, it was, then it was so cold, honestly.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s cold now, but, gosh. Well.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, how did you spend your time socializing?</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Socializing, my friends, like, you know, we would meet and we&#039;d play with Calypso music</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d dance, make up our own, you know. We had fun, fun together.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you, so Calypso music, that&#039;s a very unique music to the east of the Caribbean.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not very Jamaican. No. This is Trinidad and beyond.</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Calypso, Calypso, yeah. So tell me about your love of Calypso.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I do because it&#039;s just people that would make up songs on anything, anybody, you know,</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and it would make sense. So when you dance into it, you really dance into what you know, like, you know. Yes.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there special bands that you remember that you like?</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the band that, yes, oh yes. They&#039;re called the steel band music.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re made of the steel band music, not far from where I live.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> My brother and his friends and others, my uncle, you know, do the steel band.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, the steel drum, they call it now, but steel band we call it because they make up these from the old cans.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ll cut it and they&#039;ll shape it and they&#039;ll make the cans to music.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I like that. I like that. Even though sometimes if I hear, oh, that&#039;s steel band, like, you know,</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not in hell and all those places, you know, you don&#039;t play the carnival at one time.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to have the steel drum band on there. You know, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me a bit about, so did you, they have children?</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Five children.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me about them being raised here a bit then?</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my children. I had two children in the West Indies and as I said, I worked and overtime and all.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I, 1966, 1966, I think I brought my two girls over. I went to the airport. I brought my two girls over.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was good. Then I started having children here myself.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I had Vasily was born here and Val and Sean, Sean, you know, Sean Wharton, he was born here.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my son. My two sons and my one girl born here and the other two girls were born back in the West Indies.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank God, all five of them have done really well and I&#039;m grateful.</div><div id="00:13:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much. I will try one for the UK.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re flying through these questions, which is good.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me about when you found Age Alive? How was that like and how has that been for you?</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The reason I found Age Alive is we had a shalom group in our church and we were lacking of funding.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t get funding and someone of the ladies from Age Alive introduced me to the Age Alive group.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And Roy, you know, to get more funding, I expect he joined us with his group.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I came to Age Alive because they got funding for us, the shalom fitness group.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> How&#039;s it been for you?</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Good. Actually, I did when I went there first, Vanessa was there and I knew Vanessa from, you know, we came to the same town.</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s from Trinidad? Where she from?</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, she&#039;s from St. Lucia.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> St. Lucia, that&#039;s all I say.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re from St. Lucia and we&#039;re from St. Peter and of course we had children, we&#039;re having children like, and we get to know each other.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Her children went to the same school as my children, Baineswell.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just, we live not far from each other then.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I came, I was living down Pail, at least we all came to Pail when we first came.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I was down in Alexander Road, top floor.</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And Vanessa was with us with her aunts.</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And we moved to Baineswell when it started.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> After it started having the children, naturally the one room wasn&#039;t enough.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So of course the council gave us accommodation.</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a four bedroom house up in Baineswell and Vanessa had like a three bedroom.</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Not far from Victoria Street, Victoria Avenue I think.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And so then we got to know each other more.</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we used to go, she used to go, we used to go to Cardiff as well on a Saturday.</div><div id="00:15:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes myself, Vanessa, and my other friend that passed, Gloria, we&#039;d get the train and we&#039;d go to Cardiff if our husbands were working.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I, you know, I was happy when I joined AGI Life because I knew someone there.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Apart from my Asian friends that I&#039;ve met and get to know a lot now.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And Vanessa was there. So that was good.</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That was good, I like that.</div><div id="00:16:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And with AGI Life, what made me stay there as well was the motto I liked,</div><div id="00:16:21.000" class="transcript_line"> respect for all. I think it&#039;s just respect now but then it was respect for all.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I like that because you respect me, I respect you, regardless of your religion, creed or colour.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> If you had to try and explain AGI Life to a 49-year-old or something, how would you try and explain it?</div><div id="00:16:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh come, come and join us. First of all you&#039;re free to come and go when you like.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no restrictions, no limits, no boundaries. You join in, you take part and there&#039;s something every week.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean we got mindfulness, we had Tai Chi, we had the singing, we had creative writing, trips,</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> places that I&#039;ve been I don&#039;t think I would have ever gone.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh there&#039;s something all the time, all the time, you know.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes and as I said, if anything, we&#039;re human beings, anything we just say.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I go shallow and I just sit.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean it sounds like you&#039;ve had quite good experience.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, AGI Life is great, it&#039;s a great place to go.</div><div id="00:17:40.000" class="transcript_line"> People will find fault regardless of what you do, you cannot please everybody.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But Roy does his utmost to make sure things are put into place.</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So then my final question really is going to be about the nature of this stuff, it&#039;s archived, it can last for up to 100 years.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to leave a message for anyone or people or society or human beings or maybe the big robots, we don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Be kind, be happy, you know, just love life and join as much group as you can because there are places there that you can go to if you need help.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And to socialize, there&#039;s many, many things you can do, places you can go and you can take part in.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Just be happy, live your life.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the myriad of things.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Be happy and be kind to each other and to yourself of course, number one.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Love yourself.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the philosophy.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, love yourself.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people go through hard times and sometimes I sit back and I said, oh my goodness, I could understand clearly where your thoughts could play tricks on you.</div><div id="00:18:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Anxiety, we draw anxiety.</div><div id="00:19:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got to bring your mind back.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Our mindfulness lady tells us, just bring your thoughts back to the present.</div><div id="00:19:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Be thankful for.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Have a gratitude manual.</div><div id="00:19:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s lovely, lovely, very positive interview.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was wondering, you know, I said, oh, they got it there already.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m not doing it anymore.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, they&#039;ve got it there.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I don&#039;t want to be Donald.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I took that one all day, you know, years ago back a yard.</div><div id="00:19:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And then.</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s happy.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m happy to do it.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I think you did mention it.</div><div id="00:19:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So maybe this will be merged with that one just to extend it and just to give an update maybe.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sure.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, thank you for your time.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you too for having me.</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully you don&#039;t you can still get to Tesco and

id="00:20:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Listen, there&#039;s one more coming at three o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got a little while.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to sort out a camera and my paper.</div><div id="00:20:08.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it is a good.</div><div id="00:20:09.000"
