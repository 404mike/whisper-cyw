Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:07.200" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Jason Laude.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The venue is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:12.640" class="transcript_line"> The date today is Friday the 21st of November 2014.</div><div id="00:00:16.920" class="transcript_line"> Jason, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?</div><div id="00:00:21.560" class="transcript_line"> My name in full Jason Windsor Laude.</div><div id="00:00:24.520" class="transcript_line"> J-A-S-O-N-W-I-N-S-D-O-R-L-A-W-D-A-Y.</div><div id="00:00:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much for that.</div><div id="00:00:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Jason, how did you first get involved in Cardiff Mars Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Well I was used to live in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:37.640" class="transcript_line"> I was working as a graphic designer in those days</div><div id="00:00:39.880" class="transcript_line"> and a friend of mine Babs was involved in the Carnival of 1991.</div><div id="00:00:45.800" class="transcript_line"> Encouraged me to come along.</div><div id="00:00:47.640" class="transcript_line"> So I sort of came along, had a look around</div><div id="00:00:50.360" class="transcript_line"> and started helping out with making the costumes.</div><div id="00:00:52.760" class="transcript_line"> But I was also a musician as well and I got</div><div id="00:00:55.720" class="transcript_line"> sort of roped into one of the bands in the Carnival with Peter Stacey.</div><div id="00:01:00.360" class="transcript_line"> The band he formed then went on to continue after the Carnival.</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> It was called Peep a Drum, Pipe and Drums.</div><div id="00:01:06.120" class="transcript_line"> And there was me and Steve Singh, Kalp and George Whitfield.</div><div id="00:01:10.840" class="transcript_line"> We played in rag costumes in the Carnival but on the actual day.</div><div id="00:01:14.920" class="transcript_line"> So we were practicing that during the day times.</div><div id="00:01:17.800" class="transcript_line"> And also I was helping Amaru Chittawa to do his section of the Carnival.</div><div id="00:01:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So I sort of got involved.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the first sort of day I met up with Amaru.</div><div id="00:01:30.360" class="transcript_line"> And it was like on a Friday and he was showing me to do some stuff</div><div id="00:01:34.600" class="transcript_line"> and he was going to go back to London for the weekend</div><div id="00:01:36.360" class="transcript_line"> and he left me to get on with some stuff over the weekend.</div><div id="00:01:39.320" class="transcript_line"> I just got right into it.</div><div id="00:01:40.200" class="transcript_line"> I was there whole of Saturday, whole of Sunday.</div><div id="00:01:41.720" class="transcript_line"> When he came back on Monday morning I&#039;d done it all and he was quite amazed.</div><div id="00:01:44.440" class="transcript_line"> And from that point on we got on really well.</div><div id="00:01:47.320" class="transcript_line"> And so subsequent years I tended to work more with him</div><div id="00:01:51.640" class="transcript_line"> on his section of the Carnival because we sort of got on really well.</div><div id="00:01:54.760" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, he was quite an inspiring person to work with</div><div id="00:01:58.360" class="transcript_line"> and interesting designs and everything.</div><div id="00:02:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so the first time we went down to Bute Town,</div><div id="00:02:04.040" class="transcript_line"> marching down the streets I remember all the samba bands and the steel pan.</div><div id="00:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Were you playing flute?</div><div id="00:02:10.200" class="transcript_line"> I was playing flute, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:11.320" class="transcript_line"> I was playing flute then but Peter Stacey was playing bagpipes at the time.</div><div id="00:02:15.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never really sat down with anybody playing bagpipes.</div><div id="00:02:17.800" class="transcript_line"> We were playing traditional Welsh tunes but it brought it into a different sort of life,</div><div id="00:02:22.920" class="transcript_line"> playing on the pipes and things and the way we were doing it.</div><div id="00:02:24.920" class="transcript_line"> So that sort of inspired me to get some pipes and I&#039;ve been playing pipes ever since now.</div><div id="00:02:29.800" class="transcript_line"> These are Welsh bagpipes?</div><div id="00:02:30.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Welsh and all sorts.</div><div id="00:02:32.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, reeds of any sort.</div><div id="00:02:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:35.160" class="transcript_line"> Three shape and size.</div><div id="00:02:36.440" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m playing semi-professionally now,</div><div id="00:02:38.360" class="transcript_line"> playing pipes and flute in various bands and I&#039;ve been abroad playing and things.</div><div id="00:02:42.440" class="transcript_line"> That little seed that was planted those years ago has grown into a big part of my life now.</div><div id="00:02:46.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting that you mentioned Piba Drum because of course</div><div id="00:02:50.040" class="transcript_line"> the interculturalism which is in Swicker&#039;s name was there from the onset, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:02:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Steve Singh was playing the massive Punjabi traditional drum, the dohlak.</div><div id="00:03:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very much so.</div><div id="00:03:03.640" class="transcript_line"> Did he have it taped on, there was a point at which he evolved his own approach to it,</div><div id="00:03:07.800" class="transcript_line"> which was rather than playing it two-handed, he sort of taped on withies to one hand and he looked</div><div id="00:03:13.880" class="transcript_line"> like sort of a single-handed Freddy Krueger or something, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:03:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was doing some quite fancy stuff there.</div><div id="00:03:19.080" class="transcript_line"> It was great, the combination of that rhythm with the pipes as well.</div><div id="00:03:23.240" class="transcript_line"> I think it worked really well.</div><div id="00:03:24.200" class="transcript_line"> I can hear it in my head even now.</div><div id="00:03:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and they were just, we did a mixture of Punjabi tunes but also primarily Welsh</div><div id="00:03:31.160" class="transcript_line"> tunes as well and it really sounded great because I was used to, my father was in</div><div id="00:03:37.320" class="transcript_line"> folk musician as well and folk performer and I&#039;d grown up with the Welsh tradition and found it</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> a little bit cheesy and tired and that new fresh approach with a bit of other influences coming in</div><div id="00:03:48.440" class="transcript_line"> sort of brought it into real life, it was great. Yeah, and I kept in touch with Peter and we</div><div id="00:03:56.760" class="transcript_line"> see each other every now and then. We played some music together as well since then.</div><div id="00:04:00.600" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s extraordinary, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:04:03.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh, nice years.</div><div id="00:04:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:08.120" class="transcript_line"> So that was the second ever Cardiff Mars Carnival.</div><div id="00:04:10.520" class="transcript_line"> The second ever, I remember going down to Bute Town and yeah, the big march down to Bute Town</div><div id="00:04:14.520" class="transcript_line"> and then into the Bute Town Carnival and then I remember I&#039;d been going to the Bute Town Carnival</div><div id="00:04:19.160" class="transcript_line"> for quite a few years so they all get a bit blended into one so I can&#039;t remember who was</div><div id="00:04:22.520" class="transcript_line"> playing there. I remember seeing Aswan there and musical youth and people like this and</div><div id="00:04:27.880" class="transcript_line"> at that time down the docks was a bit of a different place to what it is now.</div><div id="00:04:32.920" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, I&#039;ve seen to that, haven&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:04:35.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:37.640" class="transcript_line"> I remember the Bute Town riots and everything.</div><div id="00:04:43.880" class="transcript_line"> You know, great community down there and great fun on the day and, you know,</div><div id="00:04:48.200" class="transcript_line"> good support from everybody along the route and everything.</div><div id="00:04:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very warmly received. And we had good weather, I think.</div><div id="00:04:53.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, really sunny, great, great, great time, you know.</div><div id="00:04:56.680" class="transcript_line"> I think your costumes, which were sort of, as you say, based on rags, were</div><div id="00:05:00.520" class="transcript_line"> a carnival interpretation of a sort of raggedy Welsh tradition from Pembrokeshire.</div><div id="00:05:06.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s rag costumes right through the British Isles, really, and certainly it&#039;s in</div><div id="00:05:11.080" class="transcript_line"> in the Welsh tradition, part of the Morris tradition and stuff like that, you know, so it&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:15.320" class="transcript_line"> coming from there, you know. Yeah, it was great. That was the first year then and the end of that</div><div id="00:05:23.080" class="transcript_line"> year I actually moved away from Cardiff up to the countryside, up into the mountains and I&#039;d had</div><div id="00:05:28.040" class="transcript_line"> enough of the city, you know, and I had enough of working in an office and things and I went up</div><div id="00:05:34.360" class="transcript_line"> and started working, doing conservation work and got a job with the National Trust and,</div><div id="00:05:38.760" class="transcript_line"> you know, my lifestyle changed quite a bit, but I still made the point of coming back to Cardiff</div><div id="00:05:43.080" class="transcript_line"> and getting involved in the carnival because, you know, I really wouldn&#039;t miss it for the world,</div><div id="00:05:46.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, so I&#039;d take time out and come down for a good couple of weeks during the carnival and</div><div id="00:05:52.440" class="transcript_line"> for the subsequent years right up to 95 and getting more and more involved into it.</div><div id="00:05:58.360" class="transcript_line"> Working more closely with Amaru and even also Amaru would come down and visit me and we&#039;d work on</div><div id="00:06:02.920" class="transcript_line"> costume designs and stuff, you know, six months beforehand and so we&#039;d get stuff together and</div><div id="00:06:07.400" class="transcript_line"> we were working quite closely those years, you know. I think he was very impressed from the onset by</div><div id="00:06:11.320" class="transcript_line"> your making skills and you must have built up quite a skill set, I mean, from that. Yeah, I did,</div><div id="00:06:17.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, it was, I&#039;d never used withies before, you know. And you know why they&#039;re called withies?</div><div id="00:06:22.520" class="transcript_line"> No, actually. Because withies we&#039;re going to make something. All right, okay. Sorry, I thought I&#039;d</div><div id="00:06:26.840" class="transcript_line"> just get the company joke on record there. Okay, okay. Thank you for laughing. That&#039;s a good one.</div><div id="00:06:30.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for laughing with me. Yeah, that&#039;s my kind of you. Well, that&#039;s the two main things,</div><div id="00:06:34.280" class="transcript_line"> is withies and gaffer tape. Yes. A few pictures. The DNA of carnival life. Yeah, I think just about</div><div id="00:06:39.240" class="transcript_line"> most of the pictures that are of me, you can see some gaffer tape about me somewhere for emergency</div><div id="00:06:44.840" class="transcript_line"> use, you know, because with each of the carnivals I&#039;d never actually worked on my own costume and I</div><div id="00:06:49.480" class="transcript_line"> just got into whatever was spare at the end, you know, on the day of the carnival. It shows</div><div id="00:06:54.040" class="transcript_line"> the generosity of spirit, you know, facilitating other people rather than, it wasn&#039;t all me, me, me.</div><div id="00:06:59.080" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it&#039;s never about that. I just love being involved in it and all the different characters</div><div id="00:07:02.680" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d meet and the things that you make, you know. Yes. I mean, there&#039;s a massive social side to it,</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t it? I mean, it&#039;s like a mini village of creativity, I would say. Yeah, absolutely. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:07:10.520" class="transcript_line"> really interesting. And you meet people from all walks of life as well, you know. Absolutely, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:14.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, which is fantastic. Yeah, you know, walks of life from Cardiff and beyond, you know,</div><div id="00:07:19.080" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s people from all over Brazil and, you know, the Caribbean and everything. Yes, quite internationalist</div><div id="00:07:22.680" class="transcript_line"> intercultural. You know, great fun. So after the first one in 1991, what was your next carnival</div><div id="00:07:30.760" class="transcript_line"> step? Yeah, I came back for the next one. I kept in touch a bit with Amaru and I said that I&#039;d</div><div id="00:07:38.120" class="transcript_line"> definitely be there. So I came along and it was the following year then we were in, just looking at</div><div id="00:07:43.720" class="transcript_line"> the list now, Ninian Park Primary School. It was a bigger school again and the carnival seemed a bit</div><div id="00:07:49.240" class="transcript_line"> bigger again. There&#039;s more people involved and there was Sam Alexander, José Angela, the Brazilian</div><div id="00:07:54.520" class="transcript_line"> contingent come along and they were doing a bit of capoeira and Brazilian dancing and... Maracatu.</div><div id="00:08:00.760" class="transcript_line"> Maracatu, you know, the, yeah, Adrian and everybody bringing in maracatu drumming.</div><div id="00:08:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Great fun. And there was also Mrs. Douglas with her cooking was there as well. Yes, it was. I think</div><div id="00:08:14.200" class="transcript_line"> the problem about the Mascam was location wise, it wasn&#039;t close to any local shops. So whilst</div><div id="00:08:19.880" class="transcript_line"> people could prepare and bring food, what we decided that year was to involve Ina Douglas,</div><div id="00:08:26.200" class="transcript_line"> who lived in Riverside and actually had a sort of, I think it was called a pop-up cafe now.</div><div id="00:08:31.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But do you remember the dumplings? I was just going to say there&#039;s dumplings the size of that</div><div id="00:08:39.400" class="transcript_line"> and you just go back into the room and you&#039;d be holding a stuff and you just go Mrs. Douglas,</div><div id="00:08:42.920" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Douglas, Mr. Douglas, yeah. Yes. You know, the dumplings. This is Douglas and the dumplings.</div><div id="00:08:47.720" class="transcript_line"> The dumplings, yeah. Oh yeah, fantastic, great, great food, really nice, proper Caribbean food,</div><div id="00:08:52.680" class="transcript_line"> probably the first time I&#039;d ever eaten Caribbean food and, you know. You&#039;re probably still</div><div id="00:08:56.360" class="transcript_line"> digesting it now. Don&#039;t get enough of it, that&#039;s for sure. Not in Fandai though. No, no.</div><div id="00:09:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that year, yeah, there was more of a Brazilian element that year and I was, yeah,</div><div id="00:09:12.840" class="transcript_line"> crashing out down at Adrian&#039;s place. Did you get a bed or were you having to sleep on the floor?</div><div id="00:09:17.960" class="transcript_line"> I was on the sofa. On the sofa, you were on it. Yeah. Right. Yeah, so that was when I got to know</div><div id="00:09:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Adrian pretty well but then, you know, we were sort of more involved in the actual making</div><div id="00:09:29.240" class="transcript_line"> side of things and I remember making a lot of pom-poms that year as well, helping with the</div><div id="00:09:33.960" class="transcript_line"> pom-poms. A lot of people, if anybody was spared, they would just make a pom-pom. Yeah, pom-pom</div><div id="00:09:37.560" class="transcript_line"> factory. Yeah. I forget which of the indigenous people who were doing the trade were pom-pom</div><div id="00:09:41.960" class="transcript_line"> based. I don&#039;t know. I do remember a lot of pom-poms that keep going on, quite frankly.</div><div id="00:09:45.160" class="transcript_line"> And I sort of, you know, yeah, I&#039;d never known how to make them but now I do.</div><div id="00:09:49.640" class="transcript_line"> Do you still wake up screaming? Mountains of pom-poms, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that was that year and then following that we went into Coté&#039;s Community Centre,</div><div id="00:10:01.960" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t it? Yes. And yeah, then it was just getting more intense every year so I spent</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> more time with Mara working beforehand on costume designs and then when it came to the actual</div><div id="00:10:16.600" class="transcript_line"> camp, I&#039;d be staying quite late because what tended to happen was that a lot of people would</div><div id="00:10:21.320" class="transcript_line"> come in the day and you&#039;d be just helping, you&#039;d be going around in circles just helping people</div><div id="00:10:24.680" class="transcript_line"> make stuff. You wouldn&#039;t be working on anything specific yourself, you know, you&#039;d be helping</div><div id="00:10:28.840" class="transcript_line"> other people all day so the only time you get to work on something more complex or something that,</div><div id="00:10:34.120" class="transcript_line"> you know, you needed to work on yourself would be in the evening, later on in the evening. So I tend</div><div id="00:10:39.160" class="transcript_line"> to work late, stay late and actually sleep in the centre. Right. You know, take the sleeping bag and</div><div id="00:10:45.400" class="transcript_line"> just crash out on, there was loads of pads of foam and you could make some comfy beds there.</div><div id="00:10:50.360" class="transcript_line"> You sort of nested, would you? Yeah, yeah, you know, I&#039;d go back to, you know, to whoever&#039;s</div><div id="00:10:55.240" class="transcript_line"> place I was crashing out at the time and every now and then but most of the time it&#039;d be in.</div><div id="00:10:59.080" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s real dedication, it&#039;s fabulous. Yeah, but it was also a magical time, you know, you can imagine</div><div id="00:11:03.720" class="transcript_line"> late at night when it might be only one or two of you in there and you might be trying to get to</div><div id="00:11:07.720" class="transcript_line"> sleep and it&#039;s all, it&#039;s been frenetic through the day and then you&#039;re just sort of lying there and</div><div id="00:11:12.120" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re suddenly aware of all these mad costumes all around you and this strange place. In the half</div><div id="00:11:16.440" class="transcript_line"> night. Yeah, in the half light. Absolutely. Still, strange creakings and rustlings where things are</div><div id="00:11:22.520" class="transcript_line"> settling and with ease of bending and, you know, that was quite magical as well on its own and then,</div><div id="00:11:28.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, come the morning you&#039;d have a little bit of time to get some things together and then</div><div id="00:11:32.520" class="transcript_line"> the next rush would start. Yes, yes. And people would come to you with their own ideas of what</div><div id="00:11:37.320" class="transcript_line"> they wanted to do but not really the technical ability to think it through so you sort of get</div><div id="00:11:41.560" class="transcript_line"> them together and get them to make stuff but I would make up, you know, one-off things for</div><div id="00:11:46.360" class="transcript_line"> people as well, you know, certain, I remember doing like a crow head with somebody with a snapping jaw</div><div id="00:11:51.400" class="transcript_line"> on it which was quite sort of complex so I did that for them myself, you know. Yeah, yeah. And</div><div id="00:11:57.800" class="transcript_line"> there was, you know, there were other sort of daily things going on, there was kids coming in</div><div id="00:12:02.200" class="transcript_line"> that wanted to just mess around and other faces painted and stuff and you, you know, not necessarily</div><div id="00:12:06.360" class="transcript_line"> part of the carnival that day but you sort of help out and entertain them and yeah. It was,</div><div id="00:12:10.680" class="transcript_line"> no, it was very much a libertarian sort of drop-in approach. Yeah. You know, I&#039;ve had other interviews</div><div id="00:12:15.640" class="transcript_line"> saying, the view-ees who&#039;ve gone on to build up a massive skill set and the rest of them saying,</div><div id="00:12:21.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, Kate&#039;s my first joint, the first thing I liked was the fact that, you know, after school</div><div id="00:12:25.960" class="transcript_line"> the mums would turn up with a four-pack of Stella and we&#039;d be smoking our fags whilst working the</div><div id="00:12:30.600" class="transcript_line"> glue guns. Yeah, yeah. Obviously health and safety and things have changed since then. Yeah. It had</div><div id="00:12:35.480" class="transcript_line"> a very, it was coming from a different place in a way. Yeah, absolutely. And you had these different</div><div id="00:12:39.880" class="transcript_line"> sections in the room as well and very different approaches to stuff, you know. Was there a degree</div><div id="00:12:44.360" class="transcript_line"> of internal competition between you? Yeah, there was always an element of that although, you know,</div><div id="00:12:48.120" class="transcript_line"> I always found that, you know, I get on with anybody anyway, you know, there&#039;s probably more</div><div id="00:12:51.320" class="transcript_line"> competition with perhaps the, you know, the bigger personalities in the thing, you know. I just kept</div><div id="00:12:55.320" class="transcript_line"> my head down and got on with the work but it was always good fun to see what other people were</div><div id="00:12:58.600" class="transcript_line"> coming up with and their own sort of vision of, you know, whether it&#039;s going to be more sort of</div><div id="00:13:03.400" class="transcript_line"> futuristic or, you know, or more traditional carnival style or something else altogether.</div><div id="00:13:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Certainly in 94, I remember we, because the route and the way in which the finale</div><div id="00:13:16.280" class="transcript_line"> has been staged has changed over the 25 years of the Cardiff Carnival and of course back then</div><div id="00:13:23.080" class="transcript_line"> we finished the parade and put on a performance which varied in terms of its formality or</div><div id="00:13:29.720" class="transcript_line"> informality on the steps of the National Museum of Wales. Absolutely. With pyrotechnics as well.</div><div id="00:13:34.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, fake blood. Fake blood, oh gosh. Shall we tell the question, do you want to tell a fake blood story or shall I?</div><div id="00:13:41.160" class="transcript_line"> You may know it better than me but it was angels and devils, wasn&#039;t it? Yes, yes it was and I sort</div><div id="00:13:46.040" class="transcript_line"> of remember the dance, you know, because there was dance routines worked out as part of the</div><div id="00:13:49.960" class="transcript_line"> whole thing and yeah they were dying on the steps there and using fake blood and...</div><div id="00:13:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Because we&#039;ve done a test thing we did because the last thing you want to do, I used to sign</div><div id="00:13:59.800" class="transcript_line"> an indemnity with the National Museum of Wales that we wouldn&#039;t do anything to the fabric of</div><div id="00:14:04.440" class="transcript_line"> the building which you know is a national treasure by definition. Unfortunately in that year</div><div id="00:14:12.920" class="transcript_line"> somebody over enthusiastically and deliberately decided to on the day not go with a mix that</div><div id="00:14:20.120" class="transcript_line"> would agree that we knew we could wash out and wouldn&#039;t stain and come the day the the blood that</div><div id="00:14:26.120" class="transcript_line"> was in the pump action water pistols that shotguns, the pump action water shotguns that the devils had</div><div id="00:14:33.720" class="transcript_line"> to drench the white angels was mixed to a double or triple at the strength that we&#039;d agreed upon</div><div id="00:14:42.440" class="transcript_line"> and to my horror the next day when I went back I discovered we had died the steps of the National</div><div id="00:14:47.640" class="transcript_line"> Museum of Wales. I of course was summoned to the director&#039;s office and the indemnity was</div><div id="00:14:53.560" class="transcript_line"> waved in my face. Fortunately it was a gentleman in that who understood how carnival aspires to</div><div id="00:15:02.200" class="transcript_line"> many things and occasionally rules are broken accidentally or even deliberately and gave me</div><div id="00:15:08.760" class="transcript_line"> six months leeway to see whether or not Welsh weather would actually take the stain out and I</div><div id="00:15:15.320" class="transcript_line"> remember going back on a regular basis and about three months in discovering that the red had turned</div><div id="00:15:19.400" class="transcript_line"> to a light purple and at the end of six months it had actually gone and I was so relieved because</div><div id="00:15:27.320" class="transcript_line"> the idea that we could that a small publicly funded arts organisation could somehow make</div><div id="00:15:38.120" class="transcript_line"> good the damage to the steps of the National Museum of Wales was impossible. I mean you know</div><div id="00:15:43.160" class="transcript_line"> we would have had to close as it were so it was a good day when I marched up there and discovered</div><div id="00:15:48.600" class="transcript_line"> that the stains had finally gone thank God. Well you can praise the Welsh weather for that that&#039;s</div><div id="00:15:53.720" class="transcript_line"> for sure. No absolutely I mean I won&#039;t even talk about acid rain.</div><div id="00:16:00.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah so you know and the carnival route would change a bit every year as well even going</div><div id="00:16:04.360" class="transcript_line"> through town and you know and ending up at the castle and everything. So whilst you started it</div><div id="00:16:09.560" class="transcript_line"> as a musician in the first one. That musician well like my friend got me involved just to come and</div><div id="00:16:14.520" class="transcript_line"> help out making stuff and then I found that the band was happening as well and they said oh you</div><div id="00:16:19.640" class="transcript_line"> know if you&#039;re a musician do you want to help you join in with us and so I did you know so</div><div id="00:16:24.680" class="transcript_line"> yeah it was a mixture of making. But then I suppose you very much became a maker.</div><div id="00:16:37.480" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally I&#039;d go to see him and then he&#039;d come down to see me and you know we&#039;d go walking in</div><div id="00:16:40.920" class="transcript_line"> the mountains you know and his kids would come up as well I took them caving and things you know.</div><div id="00:16:44.920" class="transcript_line"> Wow. So yeah we had you know a good relationship worked on some great designs and things</div><div id="00:16:52.680" class="transcript_line"> and you know the sort of the last year I worked there there was a bit of a falling out there</div><div id="00:16:56.440" class="transcript_line"> with Amaru and he sort of pulled out at the last minute and then it was on the day of the launch</div><div id="00:17:00.920" class="transcript_line"> of the carnival. All sort of down to me then you know and well you know not me but you know</div><div id="00:17:06.600" class="transcript_line"> we all had to pull together to keep to pull it off. Yes of course. I&#039;m sure you had to</div><div id="00:17:10.120" class="transcript_line"> your game personally. Yeah absolutely. But you know we were all we&#039;d all been working together</div><div id="00:17:16.040" class="transcript_line"> for years you know anyway and it you know we came together as a team anyway and you know I had all</div><div id="00:17:23.480" class="transcript_line"> the designs and things and Amaru was still supportive in the sort of background you know</div><div id="00:17:27.800" class="transcript_line"> in his encouragement you know he wanted it to go ahead. Yes. You know he was sorry he wasn&#039;t there</div><div id="00:17:32.520" class="transcript_line"> he did turn up on the day. Yes. You know and I saw him there and he was you know really happy</div><div id="00:17:37.240" class="transcript_line"> with the costumes and loved to see it. It was a shame he wasn&#039;t there and it was but it was very</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> intense again. Yes. Pulling all that together you know. Now that did include a rather spectacular</div><div id="00:17:46.840" class="transcript_line"> elephant. Oh yeah it was a big elephant two-man elephant that was one thing I&#039;d be sort of working</div><div id="00:17:51.880" class="transcript_line"> on late at night to try and get that together and I thought you know I didn&#039;t think it was going to</div><div id="00:17:56.360" class="transcript_line"> take as long as it did but it came off okay it was like a sort of bamboo and witty frame</div><div id="00:18:00.840" class="transcript_line"> with a sort of life-size elephant with two-man elephant</div><div id="00:18:06.440" class="transcript_line"> a lovely painted head and you know little eye slits and things.</div><div id="00:18:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Come the evening of the carnival there was two guys came in they looked fairly sort of beefy and</div><div id="00:18:17.800" class="transcript_line"> said right do you want to be in this elephant then oh yeah fine they got in there and they went off</div><div id="00:18:22.040" class="transcript_line"> but they had shorts on and they were just their little legs sticking up and the trainers you know</div><div id="00:18:26.600" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t sort of do elephant legs as well but you know with all the other people around you</div><div id="00:18:31.560" class="transcript_line"> just see the top of the elephant floating through so it was fine but we&#039;ve just looked at a picture</div><div id="00:18:35.880" class="transcript_line"> where in fact you can see that yeah you can see beautiful beautiful very realistic wrinkly skinned</div><div id="00:18:42.280" class="transcript_line"> twinkling eye yeah you know but trunks and beautifully-eared elephant and they&#039;re sticking</div><div id="00:18:47.480" class="transcript_line"> out at the bottom and these two two sets of little human legs with the with trainers on which are</div><div id="00:18:52.520" class="transcript_line"> sweet in a way i have to say the ears were flappable and oh god they were kinetic yeah so it was um the</div><div id="00:18:58.440" class="transcript_line"> frame was lowered down so they could hold it in their arms but we also had straps as well so their</div><div id="00:19:01.320" class="transcript_line"> arms were a bit free and part of the deal was that they had enough beer to keep them going so we</div><div id="00:19:06.200" class="transcript_line"> strapped beer inside the elephant there so excellent outside of the public they could actually</div><div id="00:19:11.960" class="transcript_line"> they did complain a bit of every eventuality yeah because that you know i thought well they&#039;re</div><div id="00:19:15.560" class="transcript_line"> going to be stuck inside that and they were going to miss a lot of things because they couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:19:18.680" class="transcript_line"> really see what was going on they needed hydrating obviously yeah and the artist jack</div><div id="00:19:23.080" class="transcript_line"> and jack armstrong yes jack sullivan sullivan yeah gone i&#039;m thinking of them um jack sullivan</div><div id="00:19:29.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah yeah he um sort of took charge of leading them around yes you know and he was uh he loved</div><div id="00:19:34.520" class="transcript_line"> the elephant and he led them around the whole parade it&#039;s worth mentioning that jack sullivan</div><div id="00:19:38.360" class="transcript_line"> the local artist and painter actually produced a number of artworks um that you know of swicker</div><div id="00:19:46.920" class="transcript_line"> the carnival camp the parades and the rest of it sadly he&#039;s no longer with us but uh</div><div id="00:19:51.560" class="transcript_line"> i hope in the future those those pictures are picked up and yeah you know i&#039;ve got one myself</div><div id="00:19:57.080" class="transcript_line"> you know and i&#039;m sure there&#039;s more around and the sketches you know he was lightning sketches</div><div id="00:20:00.920" class="transcript_line"> oh gosh he was there i always seen with in my mind side with a pad in his hand yeah yeah have</div><div id="00:20:08.440" class="transcript_line"> you still have you got access to them are they around i have made a mental note that i&#039;m going</div><div id="00:20:12.360" class="transcript_line"> to try and do this for the exhibition of the carnival story because again that&#039;s that&#039;s</div><div id="00:20:16.680" class="transcript_line"> i think it would be worth doing yeah yeah absolutely and he did other you know he did</div><div id="00:20:20.680" class="transcript_line"> paint he would come back i remember the following year he would he would do a painting of the</div><div id="00:20:24.200" class="transcript_line"> carnival wouldn&#039;t he yes from the sketches he would come back so it was like a full-blown</div><div id="00:20:28.760" class="transcript_line"> yeah sort of color type of thing of what happened the year before and he&#039;d even capture an individual</div><div id="00:20:33.720" class="transcript_line"> face yeah yeah there you are jason yeah well that&#039;s yeah that&#039;s you over there in your t-shirt or your</div><div id="00:20:38.600" class="transcript_line"> your yellow reflective hyphids hyphids yeah but there we are yeah a great man yeah</div><div id="00:20:45.160" class="transcript_line"> and a great man of you know the history of cardiff in general you know oh yes and i&#039;ve</div><div id="00:20:49.240" class="transcript_line"> been a policeman down the docks when it was tiger bay and could tell you stories of all sorts</div><div id="00:20:54.040" class="transcript_line"> yeah in fact to be honest with you he was also in the british army and fought against the</div><div id="00:20:59.320" class="transcript_line"> mao mao in kenya so uh there&#039;s stories there that uh will come out at a later date</div><div id="00:21:06.760" class="transcript_line"> so that was 95 we&#039;ve been 95 yeah the dog sort of gets a bit confused in my memory as to you</div><div id="00:21:13.000" class="transcript_line"> know because we were at katay&#039;s quite a while then and uh yeah so the memories blend in to each other</div><div id="00:21:19.400" class="transcript_line"> being in being in there but uh yeah but but by this time i i i yeah i think of you as being</div><div id="00:21:25.480" class="transcript_line"> very much of a part of the swicker family and uh yeah and carl of carnival was the mainstay but</div><div id="00:21:31.960" class="transcript_line"> of course swicker has always done other projects throughout the year and you got involved in the</div><div id="00:21:39.400" class="transcript_line"> finale event uh for the sunday evening for the i think it was the first or second beyond the</div><div id="00:21:44.920" class="transcript_line"> border storytelling festival at saint donald&#039;s atlantic college in the vale of the morgan</div><div id="00:21:50.840" class="transcript_line"> what can you remember about that what was that experience that was fantastic as well it was um</div><div id="00:21:55.160" class="transcript_line"> i&#039;d never been to saint donald&#039;s before i&#039;d heard about the storytelling festival but i didn&#039;t think</div><div id="00:21:58.200" class="transcript_line"> it was be my cup of tea you know um but saint donald&#039;s atlantic college a fantastic venue</div><div id="00:22:04.200" class="transcript_line"> you know beautiful old you know castle by the sea in a little valley with a lovely big green</div><div id="00:22:09.960" class="transcript_line"> fields around here lovely you know sea views and cliffs there and uh you know i was lucky enough</div><div id="00:22:15.400" class="transcript_line"> to be there for two weeks with access to the swimming pool and lovely hot sunny weather</div><div id="00:22:20.280" class="transcript_line"> um i was working with with adrian then to do music the music element of it elephant</div><div id="00:22:32.200" class="transcript_line"> yeah music element of it but i was also helping with some of the costume building</div><div id="00:22:36.680" class="transcript_line"> and we had uh as we were there&#039;s a main sort of campsite at the top</div><div id="00:22:42.120" class="transcript_line"> where we had uh some big tents up there we&#039;ve had costumes in there and costume building in there and</div><div id="00:22:47.400" class="transcript_line"> on-site caterers as well uh mad on-site caterers and um yeah as i say we would just be down</div><div id="00:22:54.360" class="transcript_line"> wandering around the castle and stuff and then working on music building costumes and working</div><div id="00:22:59.080" class="transcript_line"> on how we were going to do this performance as well because it was all quite spontaneous and in</div><div id="00:23:04.680" class="transcript_line"> uh organic the way it came together i think it was based on the one of the ancient irish epics of lu</div><div id="00:23:11.880" class="transcript_line"> luke of the shining arm yeah shining arm and his magic spear and all the rest yes you&#039;re</div><div id="00:23:15.960" class="transcript_line"> not saying the eye of balor yeah yeah gothy was there setting fire to things as usual yeah there&#039;s</div><div id="00:23:21.640" class="transcript_line"> gothy there was um you know fire labyrinths um and a strange story with strange sounds being projected</div><div id="00:23:28.840" class="transcript_line"> through and stilt walkers and um yeah and dancers all around the place because the actual performance</div><div id="00:23:36.200" class="transcript_line"> was at one end of the what was the jousting field um but the performance was going on around to the</div><div id="00:23:41.400" class="transcript_line"> sides as well and converging on the main main thing there yes um because the storytelling</div><div id="00:23:47.080" class="transcript_line"> festival was generally quite quiet sort of festival because there&#039;s different storytelling things</div><div id="00:23:50.440" class="transcript_line"> going on and obviously everything else had to end before the performance happened so there was</div><div id="00:23:54.520" class="transcript_line"> explosion of everybody who was there it just came yeah so there was a you know big audience</div><div id="00:24:00.120" class="transcript_line"> lovely weather throughout and the evening was lovely warm weather and it&#039;s interesting that</div><div id="00:24:04.760" class="transcript_line"> that one-off performance led us to swicker to develop a purely professional piece not a community</div><div id="00:24:10.840" class="transcript_line"> piece of work called invasion of the soul which um again looked at that interpreted the same story</div><div id="00:24:16.920" class="transcript_line"> though in a different format um and actually toured it only got three performances it played</div><div id="00:24:23.080" class="transcript_line"> carniv bay it played narbeth and it played uh carnav and castle in north wales so it&#039;s amazing</div><div id="00:24:31.080" class="transcript_line"> how these things yeah emerged and it&#039;s great to remember yeah where they came from yeah yeah</div><div id="00:24:36.840" class="transcript_line"> absolutely um you know and working on the music as well we were trying out different instruments</div><div id="00:24:41.640" class="transcript_line"> and whether we&#039;re going to go more percussion or whatever and we built sort of mad trumpets</div><div id="00:24:45.880" class="transcript_line"> out of bits about you know yeah sort of scrap scrap instruments stuff just colorful mad scrap</div><div id="00:24:51.480" class="transcript_line"> things and uh yeah so we ended up doing a fair bit of drumming there was a few musicians there</div><div id="00:24:56.600" class="transcript_line"> not not too many it was just enough yeah um and i remember practicing up in the big field and it</div><div id="00:25:01.720" class="transcript_line"> was around the same time that saint athens air show was on and we had the red red arrows doing</div><div id="00:25:06.520" class="transcript_line"> air displays over the top of us when we were practicing the drumming you know i was practicing</div><div id="00:25:11.800" class="transcript_line"> my eyes

say carnival i&#039;m particularly</div><div id="00:25:21.560" class="transcript_line"> in carnival camps um yeah all human life is there yeah um would it be true to say that during the</div><div id="00:25:28.200" class="transcript_line"> course of a carnival camp you met somebody who was to be significant in later yes yes well uh yeah i</div><div id="00:25:34.840" class="transcript_line"> met
