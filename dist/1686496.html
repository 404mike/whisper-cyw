    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, this is a project from the HDA in Cardiff and it&#039;s about the memories, the people, the</div><div id="00:00:10.280" class="transcript_line"> recollections of how life was in Cardiff Bay, the docks and Bute Town in days gone by within</div><div id="00:00:20.120" class="transcript_line"> living memory. And we&#039;d like to say thank you to Heritage Lottery for providing that</div><div id="00:00:27.240" class="transcript_line"> bit of funding that allowed us to undertake this short project. This is part three of</div><div id="00:00:38.840" class="transcript_line"> the recollections of June Wagstaff, former landlady of the paddle steamer, the Boatsun,</div><div id="00:00:48.280" class="transcript_line"> amongst many other things. Now the quality on this isn&#039;t as good as we would want it</div><div id="00:00:56.120" class="transcript_line"> to be. The problem is during Covid we had to do these recordings over the phone, over</div><div id="00:01:02.680" class="transcript_line"> mobile phone and this I think is the only one that wasn&#039;t totally and absolutely clear.</div><div id="00:01:12.360" class="transcript_line"> But it is worth a listen. June is one of those people who was the heart of Tiger Bay, one</div><div id="00:01:22.120" class="transcript_line"> of the members of families and groups that made the place, well simply that, they made the place.</div><div id="00:01:34.520" class="transcript_line"> This is June Wagstaff, this is part three. First time I had a banana was at Barry Dock.</div><div id="00:01:42.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, actually that&#039;s how we had the banana contract from Barry Dock. For donkeys we had battles,</div><div id="00:01:51.040" class="transcript_line"> we had suit battles and suit shots. So we had the banana contract and we used to feed all the other battles</div><div id="00:01:57.840" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d buy a lot and we&#039;d buy our home, right, Nima? Oh yeah, we used to have a certain</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> large mom as well. No, they don&#039;t like their estuipine. They&#039;re a bit priceless now.</div><div id="00:02:13.360" class="transcript_line"> When there was Christmas, people in all of the fruit markets would along there</div><div id="00:02:18.240" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;d be there with my father, with bananas, they got to have it kept at the same temperature.</div><div id="00:02:25.920" class="transcript_line"> There used to be long wooden boxes then and they used to put those night lights in there</div><div id="00:02:31.600" class="transcript_line"> to keep them at the same temperature. But today the bananas in the supermarkets,</div><div id="00:02:37.200" class="transcript_line"> they go black and they&#039;re dirty, that&#039;s terrible. And the taste is not good. Well I tend to buy them</div><div id="00:02:44.160" class="transcript_line"> green now because they only do ripe in a couple of days you know. Yeah, but when you think about</div><div id="00:02:51.120" class="transcript_line"> those things, the simple things that appeared around the docks that other people didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> really see as much, you know, some of the food and stuff like that. No, but then they weren&#039;t interested</div><div id="00:03:04.480" class="transcript_line"> in the whole lot of them because you know what, I&#039;m telling you, near the entry house, they&#039;d always be</div><div id="00:03:10.880" class="transcript_line"> on the coat for the kids, you know. A lot of the kids didn&#039;t, it was just there for them, you know, and it was in line.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;d keep it to the kids. I feel sorry for the kids today, they haven&#039;t been,</div><div id="00:03:25.280" class="transcript_line"> well we all have, I haven&#039;t been taken to. I&#039;m still the same, no, I&#039;m black with bananas thinking</div><div id="00:03:33.200" class="transcript_line"> why I&#039;m cooking so cheap. Yeah. It&#039;s a habit. And I don&#039;t know about you, but as you get older as well</div><div id="00:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re cooking and there may be just the one of you or two of you, I can&#039;t cook for one.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> No. I try, I try, but I can&#039;t get it right. I can cook for a family.</div><div id="00:03:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there&#039;s no such thing as pork or pork or something, you know, I must go think some things later.</div><div id="00:04:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Because my daughter runs the carves radio.</div><div id="00:04:08.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, yeah, of course, I&#039;ve spoken to her once. Do you know her? I don&#039;t know her, I&#039;ve spoken to her I think once.</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we asked her to give me a ring, but I don&#039;t ask her to give you one, but because I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:04:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I think I&#039;ve got her number, but we&#039;ll see anyway. But yeah, yeah, I think it, what I&#039;m interested in</div><div id="00:04:29.360" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re interested in on the project is, is the history and it&#039;s just disappearing. Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:36.080" class="transcript_line"> And that, that&#039;s what the point of this was. It isn&#039;t really, it&#039;s a bit odd really.</div><div id="00:04:42.960" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s, it&#039;s like I&#039;ve done the most sound ones, because it&#039;s really nice.</div><div id="00:04:47.360" class="transcript_line"> You do, you sell Welsh also June from the bay. You can read it.</div><div id="00:04:51.680" class="transcript_line"> But, but people need to hear the voices. But that comes from jobs.</div><div id="00:04:56.640" class="transcript_line"> They need to hear that. You know what I mean? They need to hear the accent.</div><div id="00:04:59.120" class="transcript_line"> The accent. The way people talk.</div><div id="00:05:01.280" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t change your accent. It&#039;s not the same now.</div><div id="00:05:04.240" class="transcript_line"> You adapt so you can hear what you&#039;re talking about.</div><div id="00:05:07.120" class="transcript_line"> All over Cardiff.</div><div id="00:05:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:08.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s odd, you know.</div><div id="00:05:09.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:11.440" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re moving up the road now.</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:14.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:15.680" class="transcript_line"> My family moved up the road.</div><div id="00:05:16.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;re doing great.</div><div id="00:05:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Great, great, great.</div><div id="00:05:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:20.480" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like, I mean, I&#039;ve lived with anybody.</div><div id="00:05:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, Port was the next one up the road this time.</div><div id="00:05:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we just drive through.</div><div id="00:05:30.720" class="transcript_line"> The pub&#039;s gone now. It&#039;s not here.</div><div id="00:05:33.040" class="transcript_line"> Drive through Dynaponte.</div><div id="00:05:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:05:37.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:38.240" class="transcript_line"> My family.</div><div id="00:05:39.360" class="transcript_line"> I used to drive to Cardiff nearly every day because my mother was still going to the doctor, you know.</div><div id="00:05:44.160" class="transcript_line"> I knew just how I&#039;d gone to Australia when I went to Pantry.</div><div id="00:05:50.480" class="transcript_line"> What you going up there for?</div><div id="00:05:52.640" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people have got family up the valleys, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:05:55.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve got family.</div><div id="00:05:57.200" class="transcript_line"> My granddad became a miner. He&#039;s buried in Gatlinger.</div><div id="00:06:01.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:02.480" class="transcript_line"> But we, you know, we went, the people went where the work was as well.</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:06:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Of course. Yeah. Of course they did.</div><div id="00:06:10.720" class="transcript_line"> The men never stopped working and the women never stopped working.</div><div id="00:06:14.720" class="transcript_line"> No, no. No.</div><div id="00:06:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Because if there&#039;s any of those old families of mine who say I can&#039;t do this, my family and I was all night to see, they went to times.</div><div id="00:06:24.800" class="transcript_line"> But I still watch it again.</div><div id="00:06:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:28.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, the husband&#039;s just gone.</div><div id="00:06:31.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think, I think the people from the valleys, and you&#039;ll have seen them come to your pubs.</div><div id="00:06:35.760" class="transcript_line"> They get...</div><div id="00:06:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:06:37.360" class="transcript_line"> ...come to Cardiff, particularly on a match day, and they&#039;re more comfortable.</div><div id="00:06:42.400" class="transcript_line"> They were more comfortable, you know, the men from the valleys going to the bay than they were drinking in the middle of town.</div><div id="00:06:50.240" class="transcript_line"> People are welcome.</div><div id="00:06:50.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:06:51.440" class="transcript_line"> People welcomed them.</div><div id="00:06:53.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I was at the pub in Oxford this time, they said we&#039;d be waiting for you all our lives.</div><div id="00:06:59.040" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:07:03.280" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no.</div><div id="00:07:05.280" class="transcript_line"> We make a lot of friends at night.</div><div id="00:07:07.680" class="transcript_line"> And men are just all type of people, you know.</div><div id="00:07:11.520" class="transcript_line"> A good sense of humor.</div><div id="00:07:12.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:13.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the thing.</div><div id="00:07:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Without humor, you&#039;d never survive.</div><div id="00:07:18.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh no.

don&#039;t like about getting old.</div><div id="00:09:27.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m only doing this despite the government.</div><div id="00:09:29.040" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:09:31.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not even talking about my life.</div><div id="00:09:33.040" class="transcript_line"> You say that.</div><div id="00:09:35.040" class="transcript_line"> I guess in old age pension, that&#039;s about all.</div><div id="00:09:41.040" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, we&#039;ve got a quite a good lifestyle, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:09:45.040" class="transcript_line"> So, you work in the middle of the day.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re working from the valleys now, then?</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I can do...</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Is all your family gone from the valley?</div><div
