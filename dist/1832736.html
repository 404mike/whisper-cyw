    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not absolutely sure how my parents heard about the Kindertransport</div><div id="00:00:05.520" class="transcript_line"> because they weren&#039;t about, but we think that the Jewish community must have used</div><div id="00:00:10.560" class="transcript_line"> youngsters like Boy Scouts to go to the homes of families where they knew they were</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> children and explained to them that this opportunity existed. And we actually have</div><div id="00:00:20.640" class="transcript_line"> the application forms, two. One for me and shortly after that one for both my</div><div id="00:00:28.400" class="transcript_line"> sister and myself. You&#039;ll know that there were committees formed all over the country here,</div><div id="00:00:34.160" class="transcript_line"> both Jewish ones and non-Jewish, to try and find places for these children to go</div><div id="00:00:38.760" class="transcript_line"> because the government had said they would accept 10,000 unaccompanied Jewish children.</div><div id="00:00:44.320" class="transcript_line"> And so my parents were prepared to send us to this country convinced that they would be following.</div><div id="00:00:54.760" class="transcript_line"> So we were given a place and we left on the 10th of January for England.</div><div id="00:01:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Really, that&#039;s a very dramatic story. My parents, we were allowed one piece of luggage each</div><div id="00:01:11.680" class="transcript_line"> and they took us to the Western Railway Station in the evening, it was always in the evening.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were very sensible, they said their goodbyes and were just about to leave.</div><div id="00:01:23.720" class="transcript_line"> But I know that a lot of people were very upset and so we didn&#039;t snatch their children back,</div><div id="00:01:29.400" class="transcript_line"> they just couldn&#039;t let them go. But we got into a compartment which was fairly full of children and</div><div id="00:01:36.320" class="transcript_line"> between us the older ones decided that the little ones would go on a luggage rack which was made of</div><div id="00:01:42.240" class="transcript_line"> netting, they would be more comfortable up there. So we put my little sister up there and she was</div><div id="00:01:47.560" class="transcript_line"> promptly sick, which was actually very helpful because the next half hour I was very busy and</div><div id="00:01:53.680" class="transcript_line"> my parents said look after your sister, we must go now and we&#039;ll follow you soon, bye bye and off</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> they went, which was very sensible. And indeed they did follow eventually. Now the journey started</div><div id="00:02:08.600" class="transcript_line"> off with rumours going down the train that soon when we got to the border the Nazis would come and</div><div id="00:02:14.760" class="transcript_line"> inspect our papers and our luggage if they found anything that we shouldn&#039;t have had, we might get</div><div id="00:02:21.200" class="transcript_line"> sent back or there might be trouble. And there weren&#039;t rumours, it was true. And the Manstown</div><div id="00:02:27.520" class="transcript_line"> number was a little out of about 11 whose father had given him the family gold watch,</div><div id="00:02:31.800" class="transcript_line"> Fob watch and he got very panicky in case the Nazis found that. So he dropped it into the slit of a</div><div id="00:02:40.480" class="transcript_line"> ventilator and they didn&#039;t find it. We crossed the border having been examined and we all</div><div id="00:02:48.400" class="transcript_line"> breathed a big sigh of relief because it was very frightening. And of course from that moment onwards</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> he was fiddling around trying to get the watch out and never did. And I remember with all the</div><div id="00:03:00.520" class="transcript_line"> wisdom of my ten and a half years saying to him, look it&#039;s only a watch, your father will be very</div><div id="00:03:05.240" class="transcript_line"> happy that you survived, that he was most disgusted. I think the reason he had the watch was partly as a</div><div id="00:03:13.760" class="transcript_line"> family heirloom but partly his father would have thought maybe he can sell it and maybe live on.</div><div id="00:03:19.320" class="transcript_line"> There are pictures also of children who came with a violin, again partly perhaps to sell, partly to make a nipping.</div></div></p>
