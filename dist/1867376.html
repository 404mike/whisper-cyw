    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, this is the first oral history to be done for the Project 6 People to Collections</div><div id="00:00:06.360" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Lynx Landscape Partnership Programme.</div><div id="00:00:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Stephanie Cruz, the Ellen Lynx Cultural Heritage Officer, and we&#039;re here in the Ellen</div><div id="00:00:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Lynx office at the Agents House in Ellen Village.</div><div id="00:00:16.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the 3rd of October and I have with me Howard Sandilands of Casagobnia Prestine.</div><div id="00:00:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Howard, thank you very much for coming in.</div><div id="00:00:24.360" class="transcript_line"> Pleasure.</div><div id="00:00:25.360" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re going to talk about some photographs that you sent me in, but just before we can</div><div id="00:00:29.920" class="transcript_line"> kick off on those, if you could just tell me a little bit about your family, your parents,</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> what they did.</div><div id="00:00:37.200" class="transcript_line"> Well my parents were married in 1937 and I was born in 1946 in London.</div><div id="00:00:44.560" class="transcript_line"> I have a brother who&#039;s three years older and we grew up in London.</div><div id="00:00:49.160" class="transcript_line"> My father had his own business which was started by my grandfather.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I spent my childhood years and my school years in London before moving to basically</div><div id="00:01:04.280" class="transcript_line"> Worcestershire as a pre-college student before I went to agricultural college.</div><div id="00:01:10.520" class="transcript_line"> And then after college I spent a year abroad in Africa coming back to join an American</div><div id="00:01:18.040" class="transcript_line"> company in the agricultural industry.</div><div id="00:01:21.720" class="transcript_line"> And I stayed with them and their successors until 2007 when I retired on disability.</div><div id="00:01:32.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m guessing from your accent you might have spent a little bit of time in America.</div><div id="00:01:37.160" class="transcript_line"> 35 years.</div><div id="00:01:38.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:39.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, 35 years.</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> So I enjoyed every minute of it.</div><div id="00:01:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:01:42.760" class="transcript_line"> And what brought you back?</div><div id="00:01:44.160" class="transcript_line"> Well my late wife died in 2005 and subsequently I met an old friend who I actually had met</div><div id="00:01:54.360" class="transcript_line"> in Worcestershire during my pre-college practical days and she&#039;d been on her own for many years</div><div id="00:02:00.400" class="transcript_line"> and we got married in late 2008.</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:02:07.720" class="transcript_line"> We were living in America at the time.</div><div id="00:02:09.640" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s English and I dragged her to America.</div><div id="00:02:14.440" class="transcript_line"> But for one reason or another which I won&#039;t go into, we decided that we would spend our</div><div id="00:02:19.760" class="transcript_line"> retirement years back in the UK.</div><div id="00:02:23.800" class="transcript_line"> So I returned to the UK finally two years ago.</div><div id="00:02:29.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d previously purchased an old stone barn in Kasgov back in 2010 and we converted that</div><div id="00:02:38.560" class="transcript_line"> and that is where we&#039;re currently living.</div><div id="00:02:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:02:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:02:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:44.720" class="transcript_line"> So what was it that you sent me in?</div><div id="00:02:46.400" class="transcript_line"> Pictures of your parents and a visit to Ellen Valley when you were approximately how old?</div><div id="00:02:51.720" class="transcript_line"> Well it was probably about 1957 and I can date that because of what I looked like at</div><div id="00:03:00.680" class="transcript_line"> that time.</div><div id="00:03:01.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:02.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s an odd story because back in 2012 my wife Mary and I thought we&#039;d come out to</div><div id="00:03:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Ellen Valley, a glass of coffee and have a look around and as we drove from the visitor</div><div id="00:03:18.320" class="transcript_line"> centre around the reservoir I suddenly stopped the car because I said to her, I&#039;ve been here</div><div id="00:03:27.080" class="transcript_line"> before.</div><div id="00:03:29.600" class="transcript_line"> It was just one of those moments when you visualise all those years ago when you were</div><div id="00:03:35.880" class="transcript_line"> a child that you&#039;d been here.</div><div id="00:03:38.040" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t know exactly when.</div><div id="00:03:41.040" class="transcript_line"> And I looked and there was a little parking space with a waterfall and that is one of</div><div id="00:03:45.600" class="transcript_line"> the photographs that I&#039;m showing you here.</div><div id="00:03:49.920" class="transcript_line"> And then as I looked down the road I saw, which is probably the memory I had of the</div><div id="00:03:58.600" class="transcript_line"> reservoir with a little cottage on the hillside.</div><div id="00:04:03.640" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember at the time we spent probably a couple of hours at this particular spot</div><div id="00:04:11.600" class="transcript_line"> and some photographs were taken but I couldn&#039;t remember exactly which ones they were.</div><div id="00:04:17.600" class="transcript_line"> But I knew that my mother had sat on a rock somewhere by the waterfall.</div><div id="00:04:22.120" class="transcript_line"> I remembered that.</div><div id="00:04:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So we took some photographs and when I got home some weeks later I sorted through all</div><div id="00:04:31.520" class="transcript_line"> the old photographs from the family and it was just an amazing fact because it&#039;s almost</div><div id="00:04:39.080" class="transcript_line"> exact.</div><div id="00:04:40.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s almost exact.</div><div id="00:04:41.080" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:04:42.080" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a photograph taken, my mother and my father, my mother sitting on this rock</div><div id="00:04:45.280" class="transcript_line"> where I had sat and the other photograph which you can see here, which is of me standing</div><div id="00:04:57.680" class="transcript_line"> by a piece of walling was actually in actual fact where my mother stood beside the car</div><div id="00:05:03.760" class="transcript_line"> we had some 60 years before.</div><div id="00:05:08.480" class="transcript_line"> So it was one of those moments that I&#039;m sure everyone has.</div><div id="00:05:16.240" class="transcript_line"> They can go back into their childhood and their memories in their childhood are normally</div><div id="00:05:20.440" class="transcript_line"> more distinct than they were yesterday.</div><div id="00:05:21.960" class="transcript_line"> They certainly are for me.</div><div id="00:05:25.640" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s really the story behind the photographs.</div><div id="00:05:29.220" class="transcript_line"> We came back to Wales subsequently probably for the next three or four years as a family</div><div id="00:05:37.960" class="transcript_line"> until my brother was old enough to do what he wanted to do.</div><div id="00:05:42.400" class="transcript_line"> I know that I came back with my parents probably when I was 14 but we would come to the Allen</div><div id="00:05:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Valley and we would also go to Valor and Trorsfinnid on our way to Snowdonia.</div><div id="00:05:54.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:55.800" class="transcript_line"> Where we spent a number of pleasant holidays in that area.</div><div id="00:06:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And was the sun always shining?</div><div id="00:06:03.560" class="transcript_line"> No, the sun was not always shining.</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, it is Wales.</div><div id="00:06:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Not always shining at all.</div><div id="00:06:09.040" class="transcript_line"> But yes, and now we come back to Allen Valley.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably three or four times a year we came back I think the last time earlier this year</div><div id="00:06:23.860" class="transcript_line"> we decided to have a picnic at the place with that little waterfall and park the car and</div><div id="00:06:29.740" class="transcript_line"> walk down the road and over the stile.</div><div id="00:06:32.260" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a stile now by that little parapet.</div><div id="00:06:36.540" class="transcript_line"> We now have a dog.</div><div id="00:06:37.540" class="transcript_line"> So the idea was to bring the dog and we came early in the morning.</div><div id="00:06:40.220" class="transcript_line"> It was the worst thing we could have possibly done because there were more gnats around</div><div id="00:06:44.580" class="transcript_line"> than anything.</div><div id="00:06:47.260" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s a lovely place to come.</div><div id="00:06:48.920" class="transcript_line"> The interesting thing that I do remember is that there was no traffic then.</div><div id="00:06:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:55.440" class="transcript_line"> We were probably the only car, maybe one or two more.</div><div id="00:07:00.280" class="transcript_line"> The visitors car park wasn&#039;t as full as it is during midsummer and this would have been</div><div id="00:07:05.080" class="transcript_line"> taken in probably August time, July or August.</div><div id="00:07:09.960" class="transcript_line"> The roads were obviously much narrower.</div><div id="00:07:12.200" class="transcript_line"> Very, very little traffic.</div><div id="00:07:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Actually quite pleasant.</div><div id="00:07:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:19.600" class="transcript_line"> And what kind of car is it that your father drove?</div><div id="00:07:22.280" class="transcript_line"> That was a little standard 10.</div><div id="00:07:23.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know the name.</div><div id="00:07:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Who made those?</div><div id="00:07:26.440" class="transcript_line"> Standard Triumph.</div><div id="00:07:27.440" class="transcript_line"> It became Standard Triumph.</div><div id="00:07:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:31.440" class="transcript_line"> And was that the first car that you remember having?</div><div id="00:07:36.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:07:37.560" class="transcript_line"> The first car he had after the war was an Austin 10 and I do remember taking that to</div><div id="00:07:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Cornwall or being in it in Cornwall during very, very bad weather.</div><div id="00:07:52.040" class="transcript_line"> And my brother and I spent most of the time mopping water which was coming through the</div><div id="00:07:55.560" class="transcript_line"> back windows.</div><div id="00:07:56.560" class="transcript_line"> So there we are.</div><div id="00:08:02.080" class="transcript_line"> So now you sort of like drive up around the valley?</div><div id="00:08:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we drive around the valley and up and over the top and come back into Raida.</div><div id="00:08:13.920" class="transcript_line"> We have in actual fact gone towards Aberystwyth but the road is very narrow.</div><div id="00:08:19.400" class="transcript_line"> Over the top road.</div><div id="00:08:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Over the top road.</div><div id="00:08:21.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Lovely drive.</div><div id="00:08:23.400" class="transcript_line"> But we don&#039;t try and do it in August or July.</div><div id="00:08:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Normally in the spring or the fall.</div><div id="00:08:33.040" class="transcript_line"> So are there any other memories of the valley that you have?</div><div id="00:08:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Any of the dams?</div><div id="00:08:38.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Each of them you remember.</div><div id="00:08:42.080" class="transcript_line"> As children we would obviously get out of the car and walk where you could walk across</div><div id="00:08:46.080" class="transcript_line"> the dam and peer over.</div><div id="00:08:50.160" class="transcript_line"> But because it&#039;s so long ago sometimes you get confused with which dams you actually</div><div id="00:08:59.040" class="transcript_line"> went across because there are a number of dams obviously in this valley but there&#039;s</div><div id="00:09:05.640" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s less I believe in Baller and in Shor&#039;s Fenny because this one&#039;s on more of a different</div><div id="00:09:10.440" class="transcript_line"> levels whereas the others were just flooded.</div><div id="00:09:12.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s the series of them.</div><div id="00:09:16.240" class="transcript_line"> The interesting thing when you look at these photographs though, I mean apart from the</div><div id="00:09:21.920" class="transcript_line"> waterfall but if you look at this what I find fascinating is that a lot of the trees that</div><div id="00:09:31.520" class="transcript_line"> were there 60 years ago were already mature and today although there is more vegetation,</div><div id="00:09:39.720" class="transcript_line"> more trees it&#039;s still very much distinguishable.</div><div id="00:09:45.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the same place obviously.</div><div id="00:09:49.080" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:09:50.080" class="transcript_line"> And I did take another photograph of the little cottage here which is not very distinct but</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> it is exactly the same.</div><div id="00:10:00.800" class="transcript_line"> It hasn&#039;t changed one iota on the hillside there.</div><div id="00:10:05.640" class="transcript_line"> And unfortunately with only being new in post I&#039;m not sure where the location is in terms</div><div id="00:10:11.880" class="transcript_line"> of naming the dam and the cottage.</div><div id="00:10:15.240" class="transcript_line"> Well this is if you look on the map it&#039;s the extension it&#039;s quite some distance from the</div><div id="00:10:22.400" class="transcript_line"> visitor centre.</div><div id="00:10:24.840" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s actually goes round and stops.</div><div id="00:10:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Right, I shall get an expert on that.</div><div id="00:10:31.640" class="transcript_line"> Or you can try it down there you can actually see the waterfall.</div><div id="00:10:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Go and see where it is.</div><div id="00:10:36.080" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;re absolutely right the cottage itself which is visible in both the photographs looks</div><div id="00:10:40.960" class="transcript_line"> exactly the same and whilst the foreground of the cottage is a little bit more, sort</div><div id="00:10:47.720" class="transcript_line"> of like it has more trees in it now, it does, just the whole landscape is still exactly</div><div id="00:10:53.880" class="transcript_line"> the same.</div><div id="00:10:54.880" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:10:55.960" class="transcript_line"> You know you can go to some places that you visited many many years ago and you just think</div><div id="00:11:01.040" class="transcript_line"> is this the same place because the vegetation has grown, trees have grown, people have changed</div><div id="00:11:05.520" class="transcript_line"> houses and put extensions on or they&#039;ve been pulled down and rebuilt.</div><div id="00:11:10.600" class="transcript_line"> But here there is no question.</div><div id="00:11:13.200" class="transcript_line"> No absolutely not.</div><div id="00:11:15.760" class="transcript_line"> And I have to say the picture of your mum and dad at the waterfall that is by repute</div><div id="00:11:23.520" class="transcript_line"> one of the places that everybody is very fond of.</div><div id="00:11:27.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh absolutely.</div><div id="00:11:28.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:29.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s a lovely little spot and it always looks really peaceful and a lovely place to</div><div id="00:11:34.720" class="transcript_line"> actually sit.</div><div id="00:11:35.720" class="transcript_line"> So did you in your younger days, did you have picnics and things when you?</div><div id="00:11:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:11:41.480" class="transcript_line"> There was always picnics.</div><div id="00:11:44.480" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d go to some little, I suppose they probably weren&#039;t called delicatessens at the time,</div><div id="00:11:50.080" class="transcript_line"> but little local shops and pick up some bread and cheese and various things.</div><div id="00:11:55.280" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d normally have a flask of coffee or tea.</div><div id="00:11:58.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:11:59.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never drank coffee in those days but I probably drank something.</div><div id="00:12:03.800" class="transcript_line"> And we would have a picnic.</div><div id="00:12:04.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:05.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean most of our holidays in those days were going to and staying in bed and breakfast.</div><div id="00:12:12.040" class="transcript_line"> And we wouldn&#039;t travel great distances but within a two week trip we might stay at four</div><div id="00:12:19.400" class="transcript_line"> or five places.</div><div id="00:12:20.400" class="transcript_line"> But we did find in Snowdonia at the bottom of the Glanberis Pass a farmer.</div><div id="00:12:29.680" class="transcript_line"> His name was Hughes Jones and we stayed with them.</div><div id="00:12:32.440" class="transcript_line"> My mother stayed with them for many years afterwards after we&#039;d grown and left home.</div><div id="00:12:38.120" class="transcript_line"> As it started off as a bed and breakfast and became very good friends so we&#039;d stay with</div><div id="00:12:42.560" class="transcript_line"> them.</div><div id="00:12:43.560" class="transcript_line"> But most of them were people that we&#039;d just stay a night or two nights.</div><div id="00:12:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s quite a journey from London up in those days.</div><div id="00:12:53.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="00:12:54.160" class="transcript_line"> We used to start off about two o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:13:02.440" class="transcript_line"> And then travel up.</div><div id="00:13:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Sleep a lot of the way then.</div><div id="00:13:04.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sleep a lot of the way.</div><div id="00:13:08.960" class="transcript_line"> Good days.</div><div id="00:13:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Great memories as children.</div><div id="00:13:11.480" class="transcript_line"> We were very fortunate because to have a car and to just be able to travel.</div><div id="00:13:19.520" class="transcript_line"> We saw a lot of southern England as I said before particularly the southwest and all</div><div id="00:13:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Wales.</div><div id="00:13:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Oddly enough we never went to South Wales until I was probably a little bit older.</div><div id="00:13:32.400" class="transcript_line"> I can remember probably the first time we went to Pendean Sands and that area was when</div><div id="00:13:39.400" class="transcript_line"> I was 14 or 15.</div><div
