    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So, pear is pear. It&#039;s made out of special peri-pears, which is the pear equivalent of</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> cider apples. So they&#039;re not nice tasty ones. You can&#039;t make peri out of conference pears.</div><div id="00:00:16.720" class="transcript_line"> The taste is totally different to cider. It&#039;s a bit of a love-hate. Some people love it,</div><div id="00:00:21.600" class="transcript_line"> some people say, no. I think in recent years it&#039;s got very confused by words like pear</div><div id="00:00:28.880" class="transcript_line"> cider. Pear cider is a totally different product. It is a sort of appley type cider with a bit of</div><div id="00:00:36.400" class="transcript_line"> pear essence in generally, which is not the same as peri, which as I say is 100% pure pear juice.</div><div id="00:00:43.360" class="transcript_line"> Peri is very special to Monmouthshire. Monmouthshire is known as the Peri county</div><div id="00:00:50.080" class="transcript_line"> of the whole of the UK. It&#039;s also quite special to sort of areas like Worcestershire, which is where</div><div id="00:00:56.400" class="transcript_line"> my husband comes from, which is I think where his original interest in it evolved. We did have a</div><div id="00:01:02.240" class="transcript_line"> couple of old pear trees. Sadly the original ones died, but we have taken some grafts and they have</div><div id="00:01:08.880" class="transcript_line"> been DNA tested, so we will find out what they are hopefully in the next few months. I don&#039;t know why</div><div id="00:01:17.360" class="transcript_line"> why do we make so much peri? Because we have access to lots of different pears, I sort of find it more</div><div id="00:01:22.960" class="transcript_line"> interesting to make than cider. You tend to make ciders by blending apples before fermentation,</div><div id="00:01:29.920" class="transcript_line"> different types of apples to get the balance. With peri you try if you can to make it as a</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> single variety product and you do get very distinctive flavours from different types of pear.</div><div id="00:01:43.440" class="transcript_line"> I just really like that. I find that very interesting to find out how it comes out. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:48.720" class="transcript_line"> sort of become our USP in many ways is peri and I&#039;d like to expand on that.</div><div id="00:01:55.040" class="transcript_line"> So one of the most well-known peri pears is the Blatene red. It originates in Gloucestershire,</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> but it is widely found in Monmouthshire and I guess other parts of Wales as well. Pairs sometimes</div><div id="00:02:09.200" class="transcript_line"> have quite a lot of unfermentable sugars in them, natural unfermentable sugars, particularly</div><div id="00:02:14.800" class="transcript_line"> sorbitol. The Blatene red has quite a high level of this which means when it&#039;s fully fermented it&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:20.160" class="transcript_line"> still naturally sweet which makes a nice rounded flavour. We also have pears around here known as</div><div id="00:02:28.880" class="transcript_line"> Monmouthshire burgundy pears. There is some debate about whether they&#039;re different pears to Blatene</div><div id="00:02:33.360" class="transcript_line"> red or not. We will find out with the DNA results I hope, but they definitely taste different. I can</div><div id="00:02:39.920" class="transcript_line"> say that the peri tastes different, not the pear. The peri is more of a sort of wine class of peri,</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> slightly drier. Then we have lots of different ones. One of my favourites is the potato pear</div><div id="00:02:52.480" class="transcript_line"> which is quite difficult to use and make good peri out of, but if you do make it well the peri</div><div id="00:02:58.720" class="transcript_line"> tastes a very citrusy, it&#039;s quite an acidic pear, but it tastes of like limes, really limey. It is</div><div id="00:03:06.880" class="transcript_line"> quite hard to make but it can be beautiful, so that&#039;s one of my favourites as well. Probably the</div><div id="00:03:12.640" class="transcript_line"> Blatene red peri which we sell under the name Snowy Owl, that&#039;s probably because you tend to</div><div id="00:03:18.400" class="transcript_line"> find that the general public like something slightly sweeter. I use a variety of different</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> pears for the dry ones. We use quite a bit of thorn pear which ferments very quickly usually.</div><div id="00:03:30.160" class="transcript_line"> I think because the pear rots from the inside and it&#039;ll actually start rotting while it&#039;s still on</div><div id="00:03:35.040" class="transcript_line"> the tree, which means it&#039;s pretty much got going with its fermentation before you&#039;ve impressed it.</div><div id="00:03:40.400" class="transcript_line"> And that makes a very light, easy drinking peri which I sell as a dry or possibly a medium,</div><div id="00:03:46.880" class="transcript_line"> depending on the year. The sugar levels, the natural sugar levels in the pears will vary from</div><div id="00:03:52.400" class="transcript_line"> year to year, so you can get one product one year that will be really bone dry and the next year it</div><div id="00:03:57.920" class="transcript_line"> will be quite a bit sweeter.</div></div></p>
