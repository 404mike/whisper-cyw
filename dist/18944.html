    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> People from the various communities in the Vale of Glamorgan have been given nicknames.</div><div id="00:00:06.220" class="transcript_line"> Llanthwaite people are called Wennowantings. People from Cowbridge are called Call-again-tomorrows,</div><div id="00:00:12.940" class="transcript_line"> whilst those from Wick are called the Frolics. The Wennowanting story arises from a number</div><div id="00:00:20.940" class="transcript_line"> of Llanthwaite men who went to Cowbridge one day, about thirteen in number. They caroused</div><div id="00:00:30.860" class="transcript_line"> and enjoyed themselves, though they were supposed to be there at the market. When they met to</div><div id="00:00:37.860" class="transcript_line"> return, they decided that they would count themselves, which they proceeded to do, forgetting</div><div id="00:00:45.860" class="transcript_line"> to count themselves. So there were only twelve. When this was pointed out to people, they</div><div id="00:00:54.060" class="transcript_line"> each tried in turn, and each time they came to twelve and not thirteen, because they forgot</div><div id="00:01:03.060" class="transcript_line"> to count themselves. They made their way back, feeling very sorry for themselves having lost</div><div id="00:01:11.060" class="transcript_line"> one of their friends. But when it was pointed out when they returned to Llanthwaite that</div><div id="00:01:17.060" class="transcript_line"> they were indeed thirteen, they looked very silly. And that is the story behind the Wennowantings.</div></div></p>
