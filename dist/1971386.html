    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So the lady that played Jemima was a lady called Yvonne Fox. Unfortunately she died before I moved here so I never got to meet her.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But she is a local legend. If you ever mention Jemima then I would say nine times out of ten Yvonne Fox is mentioned in the next sentence.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s still revered by everybody and she played Jemima for quite a long time I think.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it came about from the bicentenary of the invasion. That&#039;s when she really kicked in sort of thing.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s a marble bust of her in the library, in the gallery where the tapestry is.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But what makes me smile about that is our current Jemima, Kay, is very tall and very, very slim.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s very slim with, well she&#039;s grey now, but she did have dark curly hair.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And Yvonne was very short, very buxom, blonde and you know like the complete opposite. They are the complete opposites.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Kay is far more the original Jemima than Yvonne was physically.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But spiritually, you ask anybody in the town, nobody will ever come close to Yvonne Fox.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The spirit of her or the spirit of Jemima in her was huge. She has a legacy.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact the last couple of Jemimas that we had, Jackie, a lady called Jackie played her for a little bit.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> She was dark haired. I mean she was a bit more buxom and a bit more fuller, cuddlier than Kay Slim.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But they got a lot of resistance, both of them, at the start of them taking on the role.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Not because they weren&#039;t like Jemima, because they weren&#039;t Yvonne Fox.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite an amazing legacy to leave really. And she has no idea.</div></div></p>
