    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> By staying in the Crizzau house we&#039;ve placed some distance between the house renovation project and us.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It meant we could treat the stay as more of a holiday.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The downside was that any site visits to the house meant a 20 mile round trip,</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> but at least we could separate ourselves from the slow progress on the renovation.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The benefits included experiencing life in a Greek house in a village and living in a new place.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Our stay in the house as the first residence since the rebuild led to a misunderstanding.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> This took place on the second afternoon of our stay.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We were locking the front door to take a stroll up into the village for a coffee or a cold drink</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> when we were hailed from the garden next door.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> An elderly smiling man was calling to us from his chair at a table on a shady terrace behind the house next door.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We replied good afternoon in our best Greek,</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> but he indicated that we should come into his garden and sit down.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It seemed only polite to comply and to explain we were going out in our Greek might make conversation tricky</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was a more difficult option.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We all sat down and all smiled at each other.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Names were exchanged, he was called Michaelis,</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and he pushed some of the walnuts he was cracking open towards us.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Smiling, he showed us that the nuts were ripe enough to be cracked open using bare hands.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The brief conversation was punctuated by a chorus of barking from a small dog</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> tethered to a kennel in a separate fenced off part of the shady garden.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We were asked if we liked the nuts and replied in broken Greek with a question whether they were from the garden.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> This was met with laughter, no no from Catharow.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> This was a plateau higher up in the mountains that we knew was heavily cultivated with products beyond the ubiquitous olive trees.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The walnuts, or as we now learnt, cremithia, were delicious.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately their dryness started me coughing.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Eleni called Michaelis with a surprisingly loud voice.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We heard some noise from behind a curtain over the door</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and a very small lady wearing an apron, her silver hair pinned up in a bun, appeared from inside the house.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> She was introduced as Eleni, his wife, and was quickly instructed to bring us drinks.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Raki, the great brandy for me, with fresh orange juice provided for the ladies.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> When I questioned whether Michaelis was drinking Raki, he indicated a heart condition with cardiac, the Greek for heart, giving us cardiac in English.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We sat there, the three of us smiling at one another, with the diminutive Eleni at a similar height, although she was still standing up.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I offered her my seat, but Michaelis quickly directed her into the house.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Minutes later she appeared with a plate of peeled and sliced apple.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> This was followed by a plate of peeled pear.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> At last Eleni produced a tiny child-sized chair from behind the curtain and sat down.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was time for a conversation that we would have to get used to in Crete.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the first questions a Greek asked you is, how old are you?</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Usually quickly followed by their age and questions and statements about children and grandchildren.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> After we owned up about our ages, we were informed that Michaelis was 82 and Eleni was 92.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We were dealing with the oldest waitress and her toy boy that we&#039;d encountered so far on the island.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The combined effect of the unaccustomed heat admittedly tempered by the shade of the garden,</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> the moonracky and the stress of Greek conversation meant that we would need to make our excuses and leave.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We achieved this only after accepting a large bag of warm nuts and pears.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Putting those inside the front door, we continued our stroll into town,</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> but this would not be our last conversation in the neighbour&#039;s garden.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The Hill Village was a tourist destination during the day,</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> with both cars and coaches bringing visitors to the long winding High Street,</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> with its collection of cafes, taverns and craft shops.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Lace, leather, pottery and glassware, as well as carved olive wood,</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> filled the shops and spilled onto tables on the narrow pavement.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> In previous visits we&#039;d call there for a drink or a meal,</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> sometimes en route to the higher Cathro Plateau, now known to us as the source of Michaelis&#039;s Walnuts.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> In the centre of the village was a small square,</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> where there were a number of bars and taverns which shared the space and placed their tables and chairs.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We stopped for a nice coffee and reflected on the generous hospitality we&#039;d received from our new neighbours.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We also speculated whether we would always be ambushed when leaving the house.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t be spending every outing in a rakie as pleasant as it was.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Although the days were often spent visiting the house project and driving out of the village on sorties to our favourite island spots,</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> most evenings found us back in the village.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We mixed our time between using the kitchen at home to rustle up some Cretan cuisine and eating suppers out in the village.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> In any event, most evenings when we were there we walked round the village for a stroll.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The place took on a different character at night.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Most of the tourist craft shops are shut, but the local food stores, bakers, butchers, hairdressers, ironmongers,</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> as well as the cafes and taverns reopened for evening business, sometimes until a surprisingly late hour.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> This made the large village quite a buzzing place at night.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> As we became more recognised through the frequency of our strolls,</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> it was apparent that we had not just driven to the village for a well-off supper.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite often we were politely asked where we were staying, not an unreasonable request,</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> as we had only spotted a couple of small buildings with rooms to rent signs.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The village, some 20 minute drive from the coast, was more of a day-trip destination.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> In the evenings we recognised the same people sitting outside their houses,</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and the council of Cullinithcys developed into longer conversations.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> By the end of the week we were chatting about our plans for our house, their children,</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> culinary recommendations, the changes on the island.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very pleasant experience and something we looked forward to.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There was the attendant benefit of being donated fruit and vegetables.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> You must try our apricots from the garden, they are very good this season.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We started to feel guilty not having anything to offer in return,</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> but we were assured by Manos when we discussed this dilemma with him</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> that most families had some connection with tourism</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and just saw a collective benefit in our stay.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> One morning there was a knock on the front door.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Stephanie opened it and for a split second thought that no one was there,</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> until looking down she saw all four foot six of Eleni looking up at her, smiling,</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and holding a plate full of warm cheese pies as a gift.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> This was so kind and they were delicious, melting the mouth pastry covering warm feta cheese,</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> contrasting with a coating of sweet local honey.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> We called round later that day to take the neighbours some flowers as a thank you for the gift</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and their early hospitality to us.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> There was some stilted conversation by us due to our limited Greek,</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> but it appeared that we should stay as Michalis wanted us to meet someone.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> A few minutes later a smiling young lady carrying a gift wrap box came into the garden.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The mystery was soon cleared up.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> This was their granddaughter and much to our relief spoke fluent English.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She worked as a secondary school teacher in the next town.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Katarina had been phoned to be told about her grandparents&#039; new neighbours</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and had been asked to come and translate the conversation.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Drinks and plates were brought and a box of cakes was opened.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandparents are very pleased to have you as their new neighbours</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and hope you will be happy in your new house.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We thanked her, but explained we were only borrowing the house for stays</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> while our house renovation in another village was being arranged</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and the house belonged to the architect.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This comment was met with confused looks and an exchange in Greek between our hosts and Katarina.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They are sorry, they thought you had bought the house.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather wants to know which village you prefer.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I replied that we both liked his village very much.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he asked why have you bought a house in another village then?</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> This was not going to be easy.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The cost schedule and a shock</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> After some wait it arrived, the email with the promised schedule of costs and it was a shock.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We discussed different components and had in the early stages been given some rough costings for the essential works.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The final figure was a consolidated total, which could be described as a total turnkey cost</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> with the schedule to include final cleaning, site clearance, painting and decorating</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and making some bespoke furniture that we had discussed, but it was too much.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It felt like one of the low points of the project.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> During the last visit to the island we completed detailed plans</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and even included where two-way light switches would be.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The details were an opportunity to properly consider how the necessary storage could be incorporated into the small areas we were working with.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of these plans were very creative and exciting</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and were a continuation of the periodic debate about our niches.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> The incorporation of glass panels and built-in storage was certainly a great way of making the most of the small dark rooms,</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> but the reality of the cost of this bespoke design was a sobering wake-up call.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> For a few days we did nothing. We were shocked. It was much more than we were expecting.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When we did talk about it we considered some extreme options,</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> which included valuing the house for the building permit and putting it up for sale.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Another less radical option would be to put the renovation on hold and moving on a camping basis,</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> using water from the village tap, solar battery lights or a generator and awaiting the arrival of mains drainage.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> An option already rumoured to be employed by an American owner living around the corner.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we considered abandoning the architect and looking for another builder to quote,</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> although I have this was practical from a distance of almost 2,000 miles.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Thinking how we got to this point, we recalled so many discussions and options that have been thought of,</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> refined or developed or ultimately discarded.</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Surely it wouldn&#039;t end with us selling it before we&#039;d ever stayed there.</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> At the first meeting with Manos we&#039;d considered the roof terrace and the small balcony,</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> the lack of a view and difficulties in creating openings in order to achieve this</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and later when planning consents were being arranged there were awkward dialogues with the planners</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> when there was a need to convince them we weren&#039;t trying to create a third story</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> but only a small terrace to allow us to see the view.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> At that point we considered abandoning the terrace idea and constructing some bizarre viewing platform</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> in the corner of the first floor room and making a virtue out of this by placing much needed storage underneath.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> At this point I decided to contact someone we&#039;d met in one of the other villages</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> whose house had already been renovated by Manos.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> This provided some welcome reassurances as their experience had been very similar.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It was reassured that this all in price was certainly negotiable</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and had in all probability been partially caused by our interest in design additions.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> When we similarly asked where costs could be reduced they&#039;d been told, everywhere.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So the discussions began.</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was right, the question was met with the same answer, of course everywhere.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly any activity we would have carried out ourselves at home was to be excluded</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> so internal decorating was out.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There were also the more adventurous elements which when suggested and the costs had been questioned</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> were normally met with, no it would not be expensive.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> When all of these were added together expense did seem an issue.</div><div id="00:12:26.000" class="transcript_line"> The glass spiral staircase up to the terrace was questioned.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they would in fact be more expensive than the more normal metal staircase.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, we&#039;ll be having metal then.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> At the end of some of these discussions we took stock with Manos.</div><div id="00:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The house would still be interesting with these changes, of course.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And we would still use some glass to get light down through the house.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that would still be done.</div><div id="00:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay then.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It was agreed that Manos would completely review the cost schedule</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> with a view to removing optional costs</div><div id="00:12:59.000" class="transcript_line"> as well as any costs or activities we could do ourselves such as decorating.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We had an anxious couple of weeks awaiting the new quotation</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> wondering whether we would have to reconsider Mothball or even completely abandon the project.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a real low point in the whole enterprise</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and to make things worse that summer was a particularly miserable one in Sussex.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Cold and wet.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> The idea of a completed holiday home in the sun seemed particularly appealing</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> but it seemed a distant prospect.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> A revised cost schedule arrived late that summer</div><div id="00:13:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but certainly made a reduction to the total</div><div id="00:13:36.000" class="transcript_line"> and several weeks of revisions followed back and forth between Crete and Sussex.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It was agreed that the final draft would be signed</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> when we returned for our autumn holiday in a few weeks&#039; time.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Works to start.</div><div id="00:13:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The October trip had seen us staying in the renovated house in the hills again.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> The main activity on this visit was the finalising of the works and project management contract.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Email drafts had been exchanged back and forth between Crete and Sussex the previous month</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and we really hoped to finalise details of the costs and sign the contract.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The island was warm as usual for this time of year.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The progress to this point had seemed slow with a delay on planning consents</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> followed by long discussions and emails about how the house should be designed.</div><div id="00:14:25.000" class="transcript_line"> The lack of space limited some options but also meant that more care was necessary</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> with the limitations placed on it by this.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Manus&#039; office was again inspirational with shelves full of architectural books</div><div id="00:14:39.000" class="transcript_line"> and glass tables laden with glossy magazines.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> One evening we were introduced to the idea of using a small mini digger</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> to dig out the septic tank under the house</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> and we were given an explanation of how access could be created</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> by removing half of the front wall.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> In short order we were introduced to the plant operator who called into the office.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> He unsuccessfully tried to reassure us by showing a photo of his mini digger on his phone</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> while giving us focal impressions of it.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I must admit we were far from reassured.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Staying in the renovated house had a number of advantages for us.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It allowed us to more carefully consider our real requirements for storage</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> as well as day to day living in a warm climate.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The house had a number of features that we enjoyed</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and hoped could be incorporated into the design of our own house.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a coolness in the downstairs room</div><div id="00:15:32.000" class="transcript_line"> held by small windows, shutters and the ability to get a through draft,</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> taking the warm air up the stairs and out onto the terrace.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The terrace itself provided both shade and sun</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and proved to be the place for breakfast under the shade and supper at sunset.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Colour in the house was generally limited to highlights</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> so the background colour had been lighter and cooler.</div><div id="00:15:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Lighting was flexible with feature lighting and useful dimmers.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> High level storage made most of the space.</div><div id="00:16:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Sympathetic mixes of contrasting materials provided interest.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Glass, thick ply cut across the layers, exposed stone, limed wood and painted concrete,</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> recycled old wood with faded paint, aged olive wood beams.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> These requirements were discussed at length, both by ourselves and later with Manos in his office</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and more leisurely under the stairs over supper on one of the terraces of one of the restaurants.</div><div id="00:16:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Some decisions were made during these talks.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The ground floor would have a stone floor as lightly coloured as possible</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and soft irregular shaped tiles.</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> There wouldn&#039;t be a chimney or a wood stove.</div><div id="00:16:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The space it would need could not be sacrificed.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Seating areas were needed on all floors and should be combined with storage.</div><div id="00:16:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of this could be fixed.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> An emergency water tank was advised for when the main supply was interrupted.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> This could be placed in the floor and linked to a pump.</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Some supply of water would be useful to the roof terrace, a small sink perhaps.</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Some screening on the terrace for shading and privacy was needed.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Various ways of bringing light into the ground floor was talked about again.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Some glass panels in the floor was a possibility, bringing natural light down through the building.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> A small safe should be provided with enough space for storing a laptop computer.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of the old wood that had been saved from the house could be recycled and used as features.</div><div id="00:17:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The signing of the works contract itself was toasted in the office with glasses of champagne.</div><div id="00:17:39.000" class="transcript_line"> The talking, planning and thinking phase was at last at an end,</div><div id="00:17:43.000" class="transcript_line"> or at least we hoped it was.</div><div id="00:17:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The celebrations were indeed premature, as could be seen from a few sample emails from Crete that were sent to us that winter.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> November. Greetings to you both.</div><div id="00:17:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still raining here.</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We need a two week period without any rain at all,</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> and it needs to be completely dry before we start demolishing so that we do not have problems.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We will inform you when we can start.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Best wishes, Mannals.</div><div id="00:18:13.000" class="transcript_line"> December past, and Christmas came and went in England and Crete.</div><div id="00:18:17.000" class="transcript_line"> We seemed to have drifted into another period of inactivity on the project.</div><div id="00:18:21.000" class="transcript_line"> We had agreed everything, signed the contracts and be told that builders and specialists were ready and willing to start, eager even.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It seemed ironic that wet weather in Crete was delaying things. England was sunny and cold.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We awaited news.</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> 17th January.</div><div id="00:18:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Many greetings to you and I hope you are both well.</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I am pleased to inform you we are finally starting works on Wednesday next week.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I will keep you informed.</div><div id="00:18:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Best wishes to you from a warm and sunny Crete.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Kandrigarj, Mannals.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Many greetings.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for the funds transfer.</div><div id="00:18:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The electrician started with the electric connection to the mains.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> As soon as we sign the connection contracts and have also electricity, the water is connected, we will start.</div><div id="00:19:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Finally, an email arrived on sunny February morning in Sussex.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We have finally started.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> This is the depth achieved after 30 hours of digging.</div><div id="00:19:19.000" class="transcript_line"> The initial debris and stone has already been transported away and this is what we are doing every two days.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It is extremely hard.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I am attaching seven photos and keep you updated.</div><div id="00:19:30.000"
