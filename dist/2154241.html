Some of the door panels in there were painted.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I heard that.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And he also invented a machine that planed the wood and put grooves in it.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you go in there, all the doors and the frames have got this wood.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And like there&#039;s five grooves in the middle.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And the planer did that and cut grooves as he did it.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So everything he did, he used this planer.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was George Dory? George Dory.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, one of the Dory, the old Dory, I suppose.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He lived down where the doctor&#039;s surgery is as well.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He built all those houses there.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Brinkoid? No, Kai Herbert Lane.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Sunnyfield, didn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> He built Sunny...</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it Sunnyfield or Sunnyside?</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Sunnyside, yes. That&#039;s right, the Evans family.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the houses in front.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because Sunnyside were built of what he had left from the other houses.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> From the ones on East Street?</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I see.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> At the back.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, are they?</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, the cement and everything was pretty poor.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean, they&#039;ve been done up chiefly now.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But they used to be all the windowsills were like concrete</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> and they would fall into bits.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They had new windows and new windowsills all the years.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, they&#039;re still standing, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s right, you know.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and friends of mine were born there.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, the Evans family, Cheryl and Janet.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember who lived there when I was young.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, this was the far end of town.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Beyond the pale, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you didn&#039;t come beyond the clock.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there we are.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, and Glandour was exactly where?</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me again.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, where you turn down to the last arc.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> On the corner there now.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, of course, it&#039;s a holiday home.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the Mid Wales holiday let&#039;s, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s right, because it was full of foreigners this last weekend.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> There were three foreign cars there, I noticed.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s wonderful to see them all there.</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And he built that and the next door to it.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I think Bernard&#039;s father built the two closest to the bridge.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, but the Doreys&#039; houses were quite different to Lloyd&#039;s houses, if you like.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So the Doreys, they&#039;ve been in this area for a long time then, have they?</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it must have been like 1900s anyway.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and the Lloyd family, of course, they&#039;ve been... Bernard Lloyd, well, there&#039;s so many Lloyds.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well...</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you related to them?</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> You must be.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Bernard is like... he was the first cousin to my father.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the generation before.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The Lloyds actually, it turns out by what I can understand, came from Levant.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They were sheep, drovers.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And they ended up, when the railway came, that was when they came here, they ended up in St. Arlen</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> because the railway came and they drove the sheep to the railway and then settled there.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was standing on a grave outside the church gate there at some big funeral a few years ago.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And somebody came and said, you know whose grave you&#039;re standing on?</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, well, he&#039;s a relation of yours, you look at it.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a Lloyd.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, wow.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And reading between the lines, nobody&#039;s ever told it to me, but reading the lines,</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> he was most likely the first one who settled like in St. Armen and got buried there.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there we are.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> You can chase it back.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m wondering though, the memorial stoned Jimmy Lloyd now,</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> are any of his family interested in taking it on, still going on with that type of work?</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think his daughter-in-law does a bit with Jimmy.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> His son, no, yeah, his daughter-in-law, that would be wouldn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> His son&#039;s wife.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, I don&#039;t know because David, Jimmy&#039;s son, is too settled in what he does.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> He traps the new town every day.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But his wife, and I do know the children, he&#039;s got a couple of boys, isn&#039;t he, I think?</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I really don&#039;t know much about this.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think he has got a couple of boys, because there&#039;s no Lloyds coming at all, you know, no male Lloyds.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But I did wonder about the memorial stone business, because that&#039;s been in the family for a while.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, since 1900 at least, if not earlier.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Like Ben.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Ben, Ben Lloyd.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Ben was really the, I suppose he was the first.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t he do something in the Houses of Parliament?</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> He did things all over the place, like, you know, he was a true artist, I should imagine,</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> because my father used to say, oh, well, uncle, he&#039;d have been an uncle to my father.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And dad used to say, well, Ben was one of these who did a project, like in Glasgow, if you like,</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and then he came home and fiddled around for a year while he spent the money.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when he spent the money, he went out and did another one.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> He did an art that he operated, right?</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, I don&#039;t suppose it was as bad as that, but that was the way it was told to me.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> He did a project somewhere and then he lived off the profit for as long as it lasted,</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> kind of thing, before he did the next one.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, he did some work, the Fountains in Lucerne.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Indeed.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I believe. And also Princess Street in Edinburgh, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The statue down the middle of that, he did some of the parts of that.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he?</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So I mean, he must have been internationally known then, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> To get jobs like that.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you look, the war memorials all over Blooming Wales are done by him.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, most interesting.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But he would have been like an uncle to my father.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the other one was Bernard&#039;s father, who was a brother to him.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember Bernard&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He died like in 1939, I think. Something like that.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas Uncle Ben, who was Jimmy&#039;s grandfather, I can remember him quite plain.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, he must have lived until the 50s, I think.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Or the late 40s at least.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div></div></p>
