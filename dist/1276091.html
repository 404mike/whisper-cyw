    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This video is to show an example, a selection of events that occurred across the British Empire in 1919.</div><div id="00:00:11.200" class="transcript_line"> One major event which still has ongoing consequences is in Ireland.</div><div id="00:00:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Now, in the 1918 general election, Sinn Fein won a large number of seats in that election.</div><div id="00:00:31.400" class="transcript_line"> In accordance with its manifesto, it chose not to use those seats in parliament in London,</div><div id="00:00:39.400" class="transcript_line"> and also it chose not to receive salary, and still that is the case.</div><div id="00:00:46.600" class="transcript_line"> But on the 21st of January 1919, Sinn Fein members created Dail Aeron, which met at the mansion house in Dublin.</div><div id="00:01:00.600" class="transcript_line"> It was intended to be the first complete step towards an independent Irish Republic.</div><div id="00:01:10.800" class="transcript_line"> That same day, the first shots of the Anglo-Irish war were...</div><div id="00:01:17.800" class="transcript_line"> ...happened.</div><div id="00:01:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Two Royal Irish constabularymen were killed in an ambush at Solohead Beg in Tipperary.</div><div id="00:01:26.800" class="transcript_line"> In British Guyana, the trade union movement finally moved towards being legal.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Herbert Crishlow, the father of trade unionism, Guyana, and the leader of the British Guyana trade union,</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> these are his quotes.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> January 21st 1919, we acted to start a trade union.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He means a legal trade union.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Charge an entrance fee and get the help of the unionists in England.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very good idea.</div><div id="00:02:04.200" class="transcript_line"> A hundred of people paid an entrance fee on the spot, and the British Guyana trade union was started.</div><div id="00:02:12.200" class="transcript_line"> It had taken 14 years.</div><div id="00:02:14.200" class="transcript_line"> Men on the waterfronts, the carpenters, shop assistants and others,</div><div id="00:02:18.200" class="transcript_line"> seen they could gain by it, began to join the union.</div><div id="00:02:23.200" class="transcript_line"> On April 5th 1919, I called a mass meeting for the eight hour day.</div><div id="00:02:29.200" class="transcript_line"> I was arrested.</div><div id="00:02:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Because I gave out a hand bill, we&#039;ll a verse from the Marseillaise, and was charged with sedition.</div><div id="00:02:38.400" class="transcript_line"> The prosecutor said it would have been all right if I had quoted the whole thing,</div><div id="00:02:44.400" class="transcript_line"> but I had chosen two lines which were a call to arms.</div><div id="00:02:48.400" class="transcript_line"> However, the charge was dropped.</div><div id="00:02:50.400" class="transcript_line"> Between then and January 1st 1920, we gathered 13,000 members and Â£59,700 in the bank.</div><div id="00:03:02.400" class="transcript_line"> In Trinidad, as across the Caribbean, merchants increased their prices immediately what was declared.</div><div id="00:03:13.400" class="transcript_line"> There was no immediate need for them to do so.</div><div id="00:03:16.400" class="transcript_line"> However, they did.</div><div id="00:03:19.400" class="transcript_line"> The consequences of this, of course, for the working classes who were already at full stretch,</div><div id="00:03:25.400" class="transcript_line"> was times got even harder.</div><div id="00:03:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Even more so because their wages did not rise, even though productivity did rise under demands from government.</div><div id="00:03:42.600" class="transcript_line"> There were strikes in 1917 by the oil workers,</div><div id="00:03:46.600" class="transcript_line"> and then in 1919 by rail workers, stevedores, sweepers, sugar and dock workers.</div><div id="00:03:53.800" class="transcript_line"> South Africa is always a case in point.</div><div id="00:03:58.800" class="transcript_line"> In 1910, of course, the South African Union, the government,</div><div id="00:04:04.800" class="transcript_line"> introduced legislation disenfranchising Coloureds, Indians and Africans.</div><div id="00:04:09.800" class="transcript_line"> Mahatma Gandhi led a passive resistance campaign that started in 1911.</div><div id="00:04:15.800" class="transcript_line"> But that wasn&#039;t the only form of resistance.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Two examples from 1919.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> 70,000 African miners went on strike at the Witsberrand.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> The strike was highly disciplined and organised and alarmed the government</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> who threw police cordons around each of the compounds,</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> preventing coordination of demands and action.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Troops broke through the workers&#039; barricades and, with bainiks and</div><div id="00:04:48.040" class="transcript_line"> bainiks fixed, killed three and wounded 40.</div><div id="00:04:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Police and armed white civilians also attacked a meeting of solidarity with the striking miners,</div><div id="00:05:00.040" class="transcript_line"> killing eight and wounding 80.</div><div id="00:05:03.040" class="transcript_line"> In Cape Town, the first South African Indian Conference was convened by the Cape British Indian Council.</div><div id="00:05:12.160" class="transcript_line"> That conference resolved to agitate for full civil rights and to resort to civil resistance until those rights were granted.</div><div id="00:05:23.160" class="transcript_line"> In Egypt, on 8 March 1919, the British authorities arrested populist leader Saad Zaghloul, exiling him to Malta.</div><div id="00:05:36.160" class="transcript_line"> That event triggered the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.</div><div id="00:05:41.280" class="transcript_line"> In India, one of the most shameful episodes in British Empire history,</div><div id="00:05:52.280" class="transcript_line"> the Jallinwala Bagh Massacre, also known as the Amritsar Massacre,</div><div id="00:05:59.280" class="transcript_line"> took place on 13 April 1919, when troops of the British Army,</div><div id="00:06:06.400" class="transcript_line"> including Gurkhas, under the command of Acting Brigadier General Reginald Dyer,</div><div id="00:06:12.400" class="transcript_line"> fired rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians who had gathered in Amritsar in the Punjab.</div><div id="00:06:19.400" class="transcript_line"> The civilians had assembled for a peaceful protest to condemn the arrest and deportation of two national leaders,</div><div id="00:06:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Sacha Pal and Safuddin Kichlu, but also to honour the Sikh Festival of Basaki.</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> Over 370 died.</div><div id="00:06:40.520" class="transcript_line"> In China, and I should explain that China was one of the allied nations, not one of the big ones, during World War I.</div><div id="00:06:53.640" class="transcript_line"> It was also present during the Treaty of Versailles.</div><div id="00:06:58.640" class="transcript_line"> One of the reasons that the British had been able to persuade China to be involved</div><div id="00:07:08.640" class="transcript_line"> was that they had promised that all Chinese territories taken by Germany would be returned to China.</div><div id="00:07:19.640" class="transcript_line"> They reneged on that promise.</div><div id="00:07:22.760" class="transcript_line"> And in the worst way possible, because they gave those territories to Japan.</div><div id="00:07:29.760" class="transcript_line"> The May the 4th Movement was an anti-imperialistic cultural and political movement</div><div id="00:07:36.760" class="transcript_line"> which grew out of student protests in Beijing on 4 May 1919.</div><div id="00:07:42.760" class="transcript_line"> The students were protesting against the Chinese government&#039;s weak response to the Treaty of Versailles,</div><div id="00:07:49.880" class="transcript_line"> especially them allowing Japan to retain territories in Shandong.</div><div id="00:07:54.880" class="transcript_line"> The atmosphere and political mood that emerged around 1919</div><div id="00:08:00.880" class="transcript_line"> are at the centre of a set of ideas that have shaped Chinese momentous 20th century,</div><div id="00:08:08.880" class="transcript_line"> according to Rana Mehta, the Oxford University historian.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s also true that that shaped thinking in a way that was fundamental to a future communist path.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Canada, June the 21st 1919, in what&#039;s called Bloody Saturday,</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> it was the Winnipeg General Strike,</div><div id="00:08:36.120" class="transcript_line"> and the Royal Northwest Mountie Police fired a volley of bullets into a crowd of unemployed war veterans,</div><div id="00:08:44.120" class="transcript_line"> killing two.</div><div id="00:08:47.120" class="transcript_line"> In Australia, there were a series of riots that had been occurring,</div><div id="00:08:53.120" class="transcript_line"> which were called the Red Flag Riots.</div><div id="00:08:58.240" class="transcript_line"> And in Brisbane, the most notable of them occurred.</div><div id="00:09:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Now the Red Flag Riots were in objection to an extension of the War Precautions Act,</div><div id="00:09:17.240" class="transcript_line"> which prohibited the flying of red flags,</div><div id="00:09:20.240" class="transcript_line"> which are considered to be a symbol of Bolshevism,</div><div id="00:09:23.240" class="transcript_line"> but also a symbol of the Trade Union Movement.</div><div id="00:09:26.360" class="transcript_line"> And following the arrest of one of the trade unions figureheads,</div><div id="00:09:33.360" class="transcript_line"> Peter Siminoff, in January 1919,</div><div id="00:09:37.360" class="transcript_line"> those demonstrations against the Red Flag Ban increased.</div><div id="00:09:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And on the afternoon of the 23rd of March 1919,</div><div id="00:09:47.360" class="transcript_line"> there was a demonstration against the War Precautions Act,</div><div id="00:09:51.480" class="transcript_line"> about 400 people who were marching from the trades hall.</div><div id="00:09:56.480" class="transcript_line"> This raised objections by returning soldiers.</div><div id="00:10:00.480" class="transcript_line"> And the following night, a crowd of 7,000 to 8,000 people, primarily soldiers,</div><div id="00:10:05.480" class="transcript_line"> tried to attack the trades hall.</div><div id="00:10:08.480" class="transcript_line"> They were held back by the police, but 100 men received police bayonet wounds.</div><div id="00:10:14.480" class="transcript_line"> The fighting lasted for two hours,</div><div id="00:10:17.600" class="transcript_line"> and in the end, 14 to 19 police officers were injured,</div><div id="00:10:22.600" class="transcript_line"> three police horses were shot, one died,</div><div id="00:10:25.600" class="transcript_line"> and 19 of the injured ex-servicemen had to be evacuated by ambulance.</div><div id="00:10:31.600" class="transcript_line"> As I said, not all nations wanted to be in World War I.</div><div id="00:10:37.600" class="transcript_line"> Ceylon, certainly the Senolis, were not in support of World War I,</div><div id="00:10:45.720" class="transcript_line"> but they had no choice.</div><div id="00:10:48.720" class="transcript_line"> So what World War I did was drive the forces of nationalism in Ceylon.</div><div id="00:10:59.720" class="transcript_line"> When the British arrested the prominent Senolis leaders</div><div id="00:11:04.720" class="transcript_line"> during what was a minor communal riot, it provoked widespread opposition.</div><div id="00:11:11.840" class="transcript_line"> In 1919, leaders of all communities,</div><div id="00:11:14.840" class="transcript_line"> feigning a need for a common platform from which to voice a nationalist viewpoint,</div><div id="00:11:21.840" class="transcript_line"> came together to form the Ceylon National Congress,</div><div id="00:11:26.840" class="transcript_line"> which united Senolis and Tamil organisations for the first time.</div><div id="00:11:31.840" class="transcript_line"> The non-white British Empire was taken into World War I,</div><div id="00:11:36.840" class="transcript_line"> as I&#039;ve said, by the British government.</div><div id="00:11:38.960" class="transcript_line"> Some places objected, and others, like the Caribbean,</div><div id="00:11:41.960" class="transcript_line"> felt it was their duty to act in support of Britain.</div><div id="00:11:45.960" class="transcript_line"> However, in order to supply the war effort,</div><div id="00:11:48.960" class="transcript_line"> their own standard of living dropped dramatically,</div><div id="00:11:51.960" class="transcript_line"> and legislation was introduced to stop sedition or demonstrations.</div><div id="00:11:57.960" class="transcript_line"> What we&#039;ve provided are just a few examples of events across the Empire.</div><div id="00:12:02.960" class="transcript_line"> As we move forward, we will provide a closer in-depth look</div><div id="00:12:08.080" class="transcript_line"> at individual countries and individual events.</div><div id="00:12:12.080" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jamie Baker, this is HDA Cardiff,</div><div id="00:12:15.080" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s the Racial Riot Project Wales 1919, funded by Heritage Lottery.</div></div></p>
