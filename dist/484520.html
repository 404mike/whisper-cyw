Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Elaine Morse.</div><div id="00:00:10.620" class="transcript_line"> The venue is the Swicker office and the date today is Sunday the 16th of November 2014.</div><div id="00:00:17.520" class="transcript_line"> Elaine, could you spell your name in full for the record please?</div><div id="00:00:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Elaine Morse.</div><div id="00:00:24.520" class="transcript_line"> M-O-R-S-E.</div><div id="00:00:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Like Inspector.</div><div id="00:00:26.520" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:00:30.040" class="transcript_line"> How did you first get to hear of or get involved with the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Right, well I grew up in Cardiff and left for about 10 years, went to live in Canada</div><div id="00:00:42.040" class="transcript_line"> and then came back to Cardiff in about 2000 and was looking for community, you know, reconnect</div><div id="00:00:53.600" class="transcript_line"> and meet new people.</div><div id="00:00:56.880" class="transcript_line"> Now my mum is a teacher in Glantau High School, she&#039;s a textiles teacher there and she said</div><div id="00:01:04.120" class="transcript_line"> hey, go down to Swicker, it&#039;s happening, the camp is opening, starting for the carnival</div><div id="00:01:12.080" class="transcript_line"> in July and I&#039;m not sure, that might have been 2000, summer 2000 and that&#039;s how it started.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I came when it was here at Chapter in the little next door.</div><div id="00:01:25.480" class="transcript_line"> The gym?</div><div id="00:01:26.480" class="transcript_line"> The gym is what we call it, when the camp was there, it was plastic all over the floor</div><div id="00:01:33.480" class="transcript_line"> and all the tables got set up and paint started flying around and I came to help with costume</div><div id="00:01:41.360" class="transcript_line"> and Kevin arrived and they started starting and I said, I&#039;d love to learn stilt work.</div><div id="00:01:52.200" class="transcript_line"> In about three minutes he said, go on then, strapped onto me, sat on a high wall, he</div><div id="00:01:58.400" class="transcript_line"> said one, two, three, up, right, walk, go on, go.</div><div id="00:02:02.320" class="transcript_line"> Was that it?</div><div id="00:02:03.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the science of I&#039;m still walking, demystified.</div><div id="00:02:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And that was it, like keep going, you&#039;ve got to keep moving, tick, tock, tick, tock, keep</div><div id="00:02:13.760" class="transcript_line"> walking nice and slow and relax.</div><div id="00:02:17.600" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:02:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Did he take you up Thompson Park?</div><div id="00:02:20.640" class="transcript_line"> We went straight for a walk up Thompson&#039;s Park and it was hilarious, crossing the crossroad,</div><div id="00:02:27.920" class="transcript_line"> we felt like giraffes and zebras and he went running up the bank, the grass bank and I</div><div id="00:02:36.960" class="transcript_line"> was maybe not on my first go.</div><div id="00:02:39.920" class="transcript_line"> And we did, we went for a walk.</div><div id="00:02:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember what your first costume was then?</div><div id="00:02:45.440" class="transcript_line"> Blimey.</div><div id="00:02:46.440" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:02:50.440" class="transcript_line"> Something red and black.</div><div id="00:02:54.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll have to have a look at the pictures and see what was the red and black in sort</div><div id="00:02:58.400" class="transcript_line"> of weird baskets.</div><div id="00:03:02.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll find them, we&#039;ll find them, we&#039;ll go through them.</div><div id="00:03:06.400" class="transcript_line"> So in terms of the different characters you played, did you have a favourite?</div><div id="00:03:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Which one sticks in your mind?</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Or do you have any affection for?</div><div id="00:03:18.040" class="transcript_line"> I think it was 2004.</div><div id="00:03:24.040" class="transcript_line"> There we go, spirit, spirit of Mother Earth.</div><div id="00:03:28.040" class="transcript_line"> I went back to university after I&#039;d come back to Cardiff and 2004 was when I graduated</div><div id="00:03:35.440" class="transcript_line"> so I had this weird bird, golden bird outfit that I&#039;d made for one of my projects at uni</div><div id="00:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> and I got to wear that and so that&#039;s my favourite one because I, well I got to put more time</div><div id="00:03:49.760" class="transcript_line"> into it because it&#039;s quite short and intense to make costume at camp isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh God absolutely.</div><div id="00:03:59.280" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re like, it&#039;s like, ah, intensive.</div><div id="00:04:01.280" class="transcript_line"> And how about the parade days itself, what are your memories of those?</div><div id="00:04:04.280" class="transcript_line"> What was they like?</div><div id="00:04:05.280" class="transcript_line"> Ah, the arriving in the morning and getting everybody ready and everybody making each</div><div id="00:04:11.880" class="transcript_line"> other up and everybody dressing each other and it&#039;s all massive community and bonding</div><div id="00:04:16.880" class="transcript_line"> and excitement and nervousness and it was wonderful.</div><div id="00:04:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Really, really wonderful, spot on in terms of that heart, that community, all ages, all</div><div id="00:04:29.880" class="transcript_line"> the disabilities, everybody, just everybody mucking in together helping with everything.</div><div id="00:04:35.880" class="transcript_line"> In terms of the reaction from the great unwashed Cardiff public, how do you feel they supported</div><div id="00:04:41.480" class="transcript_line"> the parade?</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh, I remember one of them that I think camp was down at the Squaw down the bay.</div><div id="00:04:49.480" class="transcript_line"> That was one of the camps I went to and the parade then went from the school, went through</div><div id="00:04:57.800" class="transcript_line"> the bay and then, I&#039;m not quite sure, oh yeah then into the Oval Basin, it was quite a short</div><div id="00:05:03.520" class="transcript_line"> parade but it was such a boiling hot summer, it was absolutely rammed and all the people</div><div id="00:05:11.920" class="transcript_line"> were just packed together and it just made it feel really, really full and the response</div><div id="00:05:19.120" class="transcript_line"> was just lovely, really amazing.</div><div id="00:05:21.720" class="transcript_line"> I loved that one most so it just went from the school very slow and intense and packed</div><div id="00:05:28.720" class="transcript_line"> and then ended up in the Basin with our dancing in the Basin.</div><div id="00:05:32.920" class="transcript_line"> You just have a big stage and the rest of it too, even a headliner, could have been</div><div id="00:05:36.920" class="transcript_line"> Testament Decker, Jimmy Cliff, I mean some of the reggae.</div><div id="00:05:39.920" class="transcript_line"> Could have been, I can&#039;t remember who, but there was that either.</div><div id="00:05:46.920" class="transcript_line"> And the statement after the parade.</div><div id="00:05:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:48.920" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to cross the stage on stilts?</div><div id="00:05:50.920" class="transcript_line"> Because there were times when we put the parade over the stage and each section got announced</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> and applauded and things like that.</div><div id="00:06:00.120" class="transcript_line"> The times that I did it was when the parade would stop in the Oval Basin was the big showpiece</div><div id="00:06:09.120" class="transcript_line"> and of course everybody was around in the Oval Basin, like that amphitheatre and there</div><div id="00:06:16.120" class="transcript_line"> was a, you know, that circle was held as the stage inside the Basin.</div><div id="00:06:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:06:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s all coming back to me, almost as if I was there.</div><div id="00:06:29.320" class="transcript_line"> I was, I remember that, I remember that.</div><div id="00:06:31.320" class="transcript_line"> So you did a number of years as a stilt walker, a bit of a sad ending to this story, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:06:37.320" class="transcript_line"> A little bit.</div><div id="00:06:38.320" class="transcript_line"> What happened?</div><div id="00:06:39.320" class="transcript_line"> I went on holiday with an art group.</div><div id="00:06:46.320" class="transcript_line"> We went to Krakow to see some art with all the six performers and we had a couple of</div><div id="00:06:53.520" class="transcript_line"> days in the mountains skiing and I had a big skiing accident, smashed my knee to bits</div><div id="00:07:00.520" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s too weak to stilt walk now because stilt walking is quite hard on the knees.</div><div id="00:07:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so I stopped and I need to donate my stilts to Swee Care.</div><div id="00:07:14.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very sweet of you, well accept them with open arms.</div><div id="00:07:17.720" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s two pairs, ones that I made at college for that EMA when I was in college.</div><div id="00:07:23.720" class="transcript_line"> I did D&amp;T so I had all the tools and equipment ready there and I made them in the holidays.</div><div id="00:07:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:07:33.720" class="transcript_line"> I made peg stilts and I have some plaster stilts so I&#039;ll bring them.</div><div id="00:07:39.720" class="transcript_line"> Wow, that&#039;s really sweet of you indeed.</div><div id="00:07:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Given that we reconnected when I saw you in the sewing place around the corner, we never</div><div id="00:07:50.920" class="transcript_line"> changed you to a sewing machine.</div><div id="00:07:51.920" class="transcript_line"> You escaped that fake worst of death.</div><div id="00:07:54.920" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s very clever of you if you don&#039;t mind me sewing so.</div><div id="00:07:57.920" class="transcript_line"> Costume is what I do for a living and I think it was the best mentality.</div><div id="00:08:09.120" class="transcript_line"> And to help with other things.</div><div id="00:08:11.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think that&#039;s important.</div><div id="00:08:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well and you already had your staff in place with Jude and that was my year when</div><div id="00:08:19.120" class="transcript_line"> she was headmaker.</div><div id="00:08:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:08:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Ben and Jude, well Ben and Jude was headmasters.</div><div id="00:08:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Do you see them when they come down?</div><div id="00:08:28.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I saw them.</div><div id="00:08:30.120" class="transcript_line"> I put blind-av on, they were up there doing some bits of projects.</div><div id="00:08:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:40.320" class="transcript_line"> And Frank Clown, he was there doing his performance.</div><div id="00:08:43.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if he does stuff with Sweeca.</div><div id="00:08:46.320" class="transcript_line"> But Ben and Jude and Ola, their little girl.</div><div id="00:08:53.320" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s beautiful.</div><div id="00:08:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:56.320" class="transcript_line"> And Ben is swimming the channel.</div><div id="00:08:58.320" class="transcript_line"> In stages.</div><div id="00:08:59.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s in stages.</div><div id="00:09:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:09:02.320" class="transcript_line"> This is a Facebook chat there, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:05.520" class="transcript_line"> This is the length of the channel in laps of a pool.</div><div id="00:09:09.520" class="transcript_line"> Not in one go.</div><div id="00:09:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s not in the channel.</div><div id="00:09:12.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:09:13.520" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s what I thought first of all.</div><div id="00:09:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, look at me thinking.</div><div id="00:09:16.520" class="transcript_line"> No, I thought that because I thought how very David Williams.</div><div id="00:09:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Thinking Ironman channel swim.</div><div id="00:09:22.520" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s doing it over time.</div><div id="00:09:23.520" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s still respectful.</div><div id="00:09:24.520" class="transcript_line"> Respect.</div><div id="00:09:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:09:26.520" class="transcript_line"> You bet.</div><div id="00:09:27.520" class="transcript_line"> You bet.</div><div id="00:09:28.520" class="transcript_line"> Either way, Elaine, thank you very much for your powerful memories.</div><div id="00:09:32.520" class="transcript_line"> We shall treasure those.</div><div id="00:09:33.720" class="transcript_line"> We shall keep them for future generations.</div><div id="00:09:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, Steve, thank you so much for my carnival experiences.</div><div id="00:09:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Thank you for the studs to come.</div><div id="00:09:42.720" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re coming.</div><div id="00:09:43.720" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re coming.</div><div id="00:09:44.720"
