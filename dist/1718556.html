We were, I think my parents just like us out of the house to be honest.</div><div id="00:01:37.120" class="transcript_line"> And we were given a lot of freedom. That&#039;s the thing that you see so different from today.</div><div id="00:01:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Because we used to just, we used to walk all over the place.</div><div id="00:01:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Our friends were kind of, Robert who used to live in Coompoyth, which is North Co...</div><div id="00:01:54.400" class="transcript_line"> The Griffiths live in Coompoyth, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:57.760" class="transcript_line"> And a bit further down, Kevin Pohl.</div><div id="00:02:01.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:01.940" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s up on the right as you&#039;re leaving the village and things like that.</div><div id="00:02:05.440" class="transcript_line"> And we used to walk down to the village over the saddle as it is between the</div><div id="00:02:09.360" class="transcript_line"> globe and the sugarloaf there over the top.</div><div id="00:02:14.560" class="transcript_line"> The little track that brings you out by David&#039;s old petrol pump.</div><div id="00:02:19.680" class="transcript_line"> When you finished the school, the junior school, where did you go to school after that?</div><div id="00:02:25.360" class="transcript_line"> We landed in the drum school.

He used to park his caravan on the yard as his dental surgery.</div><div id="00:03:15.120" class="transcript_line"> And everybody had to have a dental appointment.</div><div id="00:03:17.840" class="transcript_line"> From the school?</div><div id="00:03:18.880" class="transcript_line"> It was called the butcher. All the children were scared of it.</div><div id="00:03:23.200" class="transcript_line"> He only had to turn up and it was enough for some of them.</div><div id="00:03:29.280" class="transcript_line"> But otherwise it was all happy times.</div><div id="00:03:32.400" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:03:33.600" class="transcript_line"> And again, it was freedom in the school as well.</div><div id="00:03:37.520" class="transcript_line"> You know, your yard or your garden now, or that, when it was a school was unfenced</div><div id="00:03:43.280" class="transcript_line"> to those two little streams that could move on one side and until I don&#039;t go up the other</div><div id="00:03:48.400" class="transcript_line"> under the bridge.</div><div id="00:03:49.680" class="transcript_line"> That was unfenced.</div><div id="00:03:51.040" class="transcript_line"> And as kids, there&#039;s only one teacher in the school.</div><div id="00:03:55.920" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d be having a cup of tea.</div><div id="00:03:57.760" class="transcript_line"> And we, all the rest of us just running around like mad fishing with jam jars in the river.</div><div id="00:04:04.400" class="transcript_line"> And things. So, you know, it was a good time. We really enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:04:07.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think academically we learned what we needed for preparing us for our secondary school.</div><div id="00:04:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Did you catch anything?</div><div id="00:04:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Did you catch anything?</div><div id="00:04:18.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, minnows. We used to catch them.</div><div id="00:04:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Minnows and little, what do they call them, little fish.</div><div id="00:04:27.120" class="transcript_line"> There would always be jam jars on the windowsill in the school with tadpoles in it and minnows</div><div id="00:04:34.240" class="transcript_line"> that somebody caught and things like that kind of sitting around.</div><div id="00:04:38.240" class="transcript_line"> And of course, in those days, it was heated by a big, was it coal or was it wood?</div><div id="00:04:45.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a big kind of dark heater in the room with a chimney going up off it.</div><div id="00:04:51.360" class="transcript_line"> And that was the heating.</div></div></p>
