    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> in September of 1981 as a staff nurse and worked on one of the villas there for six months.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I was promoted to the charge nurse position on another villa, which was,</div><div id="00:00:21.360" class="transcript_line"> just carrying on that, which was very interesting because it was</div><div id="00:00:26.080" class="transcript_line"> in the way in which the area was organized it was probably seen as a very difficult</div><div id="00:00:35.840" class="transcript_line"> villa and no one was expected to stay there for very long in charge. It was where you were young</div><div id="00:00:43.280" class="transcript_line"> green people were put because of its difficulties and you weren&#039;t supposed to like it but you sort</div><div id="00:00:51.200" class="transcript_line"> of did your six months there and then you moved to somewhere that was a bit nicer you know it was</div><div id="00:00:56.400" class="transcript_line"> that sort of thing. Like everywhere it was understaffed but it was a very male dominated</div><div id="00:01:04.400" class="transcript_line"> staff group and I could see straight away that that wasn&#039;t particularly good. There was</div><div id="00:01:11.120" class="transcript_line"> there was a sort of a bit of a lads attitude amongst the staff</div><div id="00:01:18.880" class="transcript_line"> and there was only one female there and I felt that we certainly needed more definitely.</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> I think not necessarily I mean I wasn&#039;t privy to any in those days I wasn&#039;t privy to any</div><div id="00:01:41.600" class="transcript_line"> reasons why people should be moved or put in different places but I knew sometimes it was</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> used as a punishment ward in the hospital managers at the time if someone was you know this was long</div><div id="00:01:58.880" class="transcript_line"> before staff had appraisals and things like that. If you were seen as a bad member of staff</div><div id="00:02:10.320" class="transcript_line"> you would get moved to this particular area. In the few years I was there and I was there from 1981</div><div id="00:02:16.320" class="transcript_line"> until the end of 1986 the villa was transformed I think to from the back ward to the best one</div><div id="00:02:34.880" class="transcript_line"> and people wanted to come and work there because they saw that the attitudes amongst the staff</div><div id="00:02:41.280" class="transcript_line"> were positive they were different. I mean Lin was one who came as a youngster 18</div><div id="00:02:51.120" class="transcript_line"> and I think you know we got the staff to work as a team there was a better approach obviously</div><div id="00:03:01.680" class="transcript_line"> but I think how did you know in yeah I think I think we allowed sort of</div><div id="00:03:09.440" class="transcript_line"> how did the residents react I think we allowed sort of personal relationships</div><div id="00:03:14.880" class="transcript_line"> improve really you know I think the staff actually noticed the likes and dislikes of particular</div><div id="00:03:22.160" class="transcript_line"> individuals which was which was amazing you know it was something that I think a lot of people</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> hadn&#039;t considered before and for example I had I think about activities one member of staff</div><div id="00:03:35.920" class="transcript_line"> who liked walking and I said well you know we&#039;ve got some young active men here I think it was it</div><div id="00:03:44.880" class="transcript_line"> really in my view and the you know memory fades a bit but it was that the Walsh office taking away</div><div id="00:03:57.040" class="transcript_line"> the prospect of the simple as that the prospect of um resettlement we realized that we had</div><div id="00:04:05.600" class="transcript_line"> quite a few years left in the hospital and we wanted to do something positive you know rather</div><div id="00:04:10.720" class="transcript_line"> than just tread water and that was that was the worst possible you know that&#039;s what I said about</div><div id="00:04:15.200" class="transcript_line"> this you know you can&#039;t tread water these are people with there you know and so we again Dave</div><div id="00:04:23.760" class="transcript_line"> and one or two others were absolutely fantastic prime movers in this there were some really really</div><div id="00:04:29.360" class="transcript_line"> good staff there who were you know we looked at everything in depth you know why do we do this what</div><div id="00:04:35.680" class="transcript_line"> why why why do we you know what what is wrong with our practice you know and these were people</div><div id="00:04:42.400" class="transcript_line"> by and large who had very good practice for the times you know what I mean you know but they were</div><div id="00:04:47.440" class="transcript_line"> looking at all these sort of things and so the staff the staff meetings that we had um in those</div><div id="00:04:53.360" class="transcript_line"> days where um anyone could come along were unbelievable in terms of the the ideas and the</div><div id="00:05:00.640" class="transcript_line"> the thoughts that were coming out it was a very positive movement very positive and Dave and Pete</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> and Isabel and one or two others were prime movers in encouraging that and out of that not only came</div><div id="00:05:13.520" class="transcript_line"> a sort of um uh an improvement in um ways in which we could encourage choices and opportunities</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> but for the residents but also I think for the staff as well you know with better training and</div><div id="00:05:32.160" class="transcript_line"> better understanding really of what we were about and you know and sharing of experiences and</div><div id="00:05:40.080" class="transcript_line"> everything that perhaps the institution didn&#039;t have before was was seen as something that we could</div><div id="00:05:46.480" class="transcript_line"> now do unfettered in a way I mean it sounds ridiculous to say again it&#039;s me taking the</div><div id="00:05:51.760" class="transcript_line"> moral low ground unfettered by this resettlement nonsense of junk you know just I mean you know it</div><div id="00:05:57.600" class="transcript_line"> was um but meanwhile obviously we were still I in particular I was still planning for that you know</div><div id="00:06:04.560" class="transcript_line"> and um and I think there was a sort of there was a the gulf between the sort of the members of staff</div><div id="00:06:11.520" class="transcript_line"> and the and the parents was was actually quite wide and I think it was quite important to sort</div><div id="00:06:17.680" class="transcript_line"> of try to bridge that and um perhaps one of the ways in which we could do that was that we we made</div><div id="00:06:27.040" class="transcript_line"> quite a change as well on the in the in the way that the residents appeared by having proper clothes</div><div id="00:06:37.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean you&#039;ve probably heard about the hospital issue clothes yeah which standard issue which</div><div id="00:06:42.480" class="transcript_line"> were pretty crap what they were wearing those hostiles you closed when you started yeah yeah</div><div id="00:06:49.120" class="transcript_line"> um and there wasn&#039;t uh and the perennial problem of course was underwear you know</div><div id="00:06:56.400" class="transcript_line"> underwear underwear underwear all the time you know there was there was never enough and um</div><div id="00:07:01.920" class="transcript_line"> underwear shade between the patients um each when I first went to this place I then I&#039;m</div><div id="00:07:10.320" class="transcript_line"> memory faulty but I think people had individual underwear but there&#039;s never enough you know</div><div id="00:07:19.040" class="transcript_line"> and um this is just leading me onto all sorts of stuff now and so one one of the things I tried to</div><div id="00:07:27.440" class="transcript_line"> I tried to do is I&#039;ll come back to the parents in a minute was to encourage the staff who were</div><div id="00:07:32.480" class="transcript_line"> responsible for their small group to actually buy proper clothes you know take the client person</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> resident out shopping and buy some age-appropriate clothes and get some bloody underwear as well</div><div id="00:07:47.520" class="transcript_line"> you know while you&#039;re at it lots of it and I remember sess this this chat took uh took um</div><div id="00:07:56.480" class="transcript_line"> two people started to you know slow walks out on the hills and they loved it and it eventually</div><div id="00:08:03.360" class="transcript_line"> became something that was part of their week and you know would make sure that sess had perhaps a</div><div id="00:08:08.560" class="transcript_line"> day where he would take one particular gentleman who was really was um quite challenging at times</div><div id="00:08:14.320" class="transcript_line"> and he would spend six seven hours walking on the hills and he would come back in the evening</div><div id="00:08:22.240" class="transcript_line"> and he would be tired but happily tired you could see it you know you could see that he would</div><div id="00:08:27.840" class="transcript_line"> whereas before in in the evenings he would perhaps be um very energetic and perhaps and spent a lot</div><div id="00:08:35.280" class="transcript_line"> of his time pinching and biting and anything that he could uh that was going past him he would perhaps</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> just sat down in the chair and I would just think well yeah it&#039;s nice you know in the same way as I</div><div id="00:08:46.800" class="transcript_line"> would be reflecting on perhaps that I had an interesting day and I&#039;m feeling a bit knackered</div><div id="00:08:51.280" class="transcript_line"> now and um yeah so it was things like that I think that um generally started to make make people</div><div id="00:09:00.640" class="transcript_line"> realize that there was perhaps a bit more to a bit more to um the work the job and and I remember</div><div id="00:09:10.240" class="transcript_line"> sess this this um chat took uh the bathrooms had two baths in them</div><div id="00:09:18.240" class="transcript_line"> and so it was natural that two people would be bathed at the same time you know why on earth</div><div id="00:09:25.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean speed was the essence of this sort of thing you had to get things done you know the</div><div id="00:09:30.560" class="transcript_line"> quick you got things done I challenged one person once and she said oh um you know because baths</div><div id="00:09:37.040" class="transcript_line"> were done in the evening and it was she would say this was the um sole female oh we finished</div><div id="00:09:44.960" class="transcript_line"> by quarter past seven and so I said what do you mean you finished you finished at nine thirty</div><div id="00:09:50.240" class="transcript_line"> knowing what she meant she said well we finished we&#039;d done everything I said so what did you do</div><div id="00:09:55.760" class="transcript_line"> for the next two and quarter hours then well we she couldn&#039;t couldn&#039;t say what you know and it</div><div id="00:10:03.280" class="transcript_line"> was that sort of attitude that I was really trying to change because you didn&#039;t finish you</div><div id="00:10:09.280" class="transcript_line"> know you were your responsibilities were there for the people there right until you went home so</div><div id="00:10:16.160" class="transcript_line"> again I um said right okay bathroom privacy you know one person has a bath at a time</div><div id="00:10:26.080" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t go down too well um but that would mean we&#039;ll get everything done</div><div id="00:10:30.880" class="transcript_line"> a bit slower I said well yeah but I mean it doesn&#039;t mean to say you have to stay</div><div id="00:10:35.200" class="transcript_line"> later after your shift I&#039;m I&#039;m tracing this obviously you know after your shift finishes</div><div id="00:10:40.800" class="transcript_line"> but yeah it will be but that&#039;s the way it&#039;s going you know it needs to be done and I have to say I</div><div id="00:10:46.480" class="transcript_line"> um I try to encourage people to do that and I used to do it myself obviously so it was a</div><div id="00:10:52.240" class="transcript_line"> I believe very much in leading by example and those sort of things you know um quite a number</div><div id="00:10:58.240" class="transcript_line"> of the young men who lived there had parental visits which is quite surprising really and they&#039;d</div><div id="00:11:04.320" class="transcript_line"> been in hospital for most of their lives yet um there was a still um yeah you know it was great</div><div id="00:11:13.680" class="transcript_line"> actually it was wonderful um no no um no it tended to be weekends but there was the hospital was</div><div id="00:11:23.760" class="transcript_line"> this wasn&#039;t me this was the hospital sort of encouraged visitors to be honest I don&#039;t think</div><div id="00:11:28.960" class="transcript_line"> there was any um any restrictions on on when people could come it was generally down to the way that</div><div id="00:11:36.800" class="transcript_line"> the the villa used to manage those sort of things and what was convenient for</div><div id="00:11:41.360" class="transcript_line"> the parents or the visitors um in fact I remember we had one young man who</div><div id="00:11:48.720" class="transcript_line"> um used to go home every other week actually which was you know it was a must have been such</div><div id="00:11:55.120" class="transcript_line"> a trial for his parents because my goodness he was not easy um quite a number of the young men who</div><div id="00:12:01.440" class="transcript_line"> lived there had parental visits which is quite surprising really um they&#039;d been in hospital for</div><div id="00:12:08.240" class="transcript_line"> most of their lives yet um there was a still um yeah you know it was great actually it was wonderful</div><div id="00:12:18.300" class="transcript_line"> Did you fall out of the hospital by accident?</div><div id="00:12:19.600" class="transcript_line"> I hadn&#039;t been towards anyone</div><div id="00:12:21.520" class="transcript_line"> I could have productive died</div><div id="00:12:25.600" class="transcript_line"> it kind of made me feel a little bit worse</div><div id="00:12:29.920" class="transcript_line"> um I feel a little, Iお chassis</div><div id="00:12:36.880" class="transcript_line"> used to lead up to death</div><div id="00:12:39.920" class="transcript_line"> that was the first impression</div><div id="00:12:42.160" class="transcript_line"> and what was convenient for the parents or the visitors.</div></div></p>
