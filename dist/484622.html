Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:09.680" class="transcript_line"> The venue is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:11.920" class="transcript_line"> The date is the 20th of October 2014.</div><div id="00:00:16.080" class="transcript_line"> And the interviewee is Rob Smith.</div><div id="00:00:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Rob could you spell your name in full for us for the record?</div><div id="00:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> R-O-B-E-R-T-S-M-I-T-H.</div><div id="00:00:28.240" class="transcript_line"> Thanks very much.</div><div id="00:00:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Rob amongst your many attributes, you are musical director and founder of Wunderbras.</div><div id="00:00:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell us a little bit about the origins of Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:00:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah around the mid 80s there was a workshop project run by the Welsh Jazz Society.</div><div id="00:00:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And I was playing a lot with actually when it started when the Four Bars Inn opened,</div><div id="00:00:55.040" class="transcript_line"> which is where it was based.</div><div id="00:00:57.200" class="transcript_line"> Now Dempsey&#039;s.</div><div id="00:00:58.320" class="transcript_line"> When that opened I was actually working with the dance company away in Ireland for a while.</div><div id="00:01:02.400" class="transcript_line"> So when we came back we kind of missed out on this place.</div><div id="00:01:05.600" class="transcript_line"> Opening up.</div><div id="00:01:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:08.160" class="transcript_line"> You need a lower recording level Pumery.</div><div id="00:01:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s your recording level bro?</div><div id="00:01:13.920" class="transcript_line"> Input level.</div><div id="00:01:19.040" class="transcript_line"> So yeah that&#039;s better isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:21.440" class="transcript_line"> You can still hear me.</div><div id="00:01:22.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:23.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s peaking around 12.</div><div id="00:01:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah minus 12 that&#039;s where I&#039;d go.</div><div id="00:01:28.160" class="transcript_line"> So yeah so suddenly this new venue had opened in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:01:35.120" class="transcript_line"> This is going a bit a long way around the houses.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But myself and Jess Phillips who I was working with a lot at that time,</div><div id="00:01:43.840" class="transcript_line"> we just started going along to the workshop band and they went through a lot of tutors really quickly.</div><div id="00:01:48.640" class="transcript_line"> And at some point after a couple of years or a year and a half or something they said well why don&#039;t you run it.</div><div id="00:01:55.360" class="transcript_line"> So we decided to run it.</div><div id="00:01:57.200" class="transcript_line"> And we changed the way it worked really instead of just being a load of people turning up and playing solos in a set order.</div><div id="00:02:05.440" class="transcript_line"> We tried to build it into a functioning band almost like a little big band.</div><div id="00:02:11.360" class="transcript_line"> And we were ticking over with this quite nicely doing the odd performance in the four bars.</div><div id="00:02:16.480" class="transcript_line"> And then the carnival started up.</div><div id="00:02:19.520" class="transcript_line"> Mass carnival started up with Swicker in 1990.</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> And you wanted street music.</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> So basically we said well we&#039;ve got all these musicians.</div><div id="00:02:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s use this workshop band to create the street music.</div><div id="00:02:33.840" class="transcript_line"> So the first one was in 1990.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d already worked with you on running some community music.</div><div id="00:02:44.080" class="transcript_line"> Well it was a kind of community music orchestra for the final Taliesin project.</div><div id="00:02:48.480" class="transcript_line"> I believe it was the final Taliesin project which was Mad Dog.</div><div id="00:02:52.400" class="transcript_line"> So we put together a little community band for that which was nothing really to do with the jazz society.</div><div id="00:02:57.680" class="transcript_line"> It was completely set up by Swicker and it was bringing people in who were interested in community music I suppose and getting involved.</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> But in a fairly non-specialised way.</div><div id="00:03:11.040" class="transcript_line"> Just waiting for that peak to disappear.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So we did that and we brought these two things together to create a street band for the first mass carnival.</div><div id="00:03:23.440" class="transcript_line"> I think I wrote some music especially for it.</div><div id="00:03:26.640" class="transcript_line"> I think I remember the...</div><div id="00:03:29.040" class="transcript_line"> It was very much based on Soka music that first one.</div><div id="00:03:32.400" class="transcript_line"> So I worked out some original pieces and we took part in the parade.</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> And that gave a new dimension to the workshop band really because it meant that we could...</div><div id="00:03:46.960" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t only have to play jazz, we could play street music and I personally was very excited by this.</div><div id="00:03:55.920" class="transcript_line"> Wind forward a couple of years later I&#039;m training to be a community musician with Community Music Wales and I have to start up a project.</div><div id="00:04:05.440" class="transcript_line"> For my final project as part of that.</div><div id="00:04:08.400" class="transcript_line"> I mean if it was run now it would be a masters.</div><div id="00:04:10.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a really involved year long course.</div><div id="00:04:14.320" class="transcript_line"> It was way more than people have to do for a masters now but for some reason it wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:04:18.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was just a certificate in community music training.</div><div id="00:04:21.200" class="transcript_line"> But the final project you had to start up something and run it and evaluate it.</div><div id="00:04:28.320" class="transcript_line"> And I noticed that a lot of people we were working with, the musicians, what they wanted to do, they wanted to show off.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to play really long solos over jazz standards.</div><div id="00:04:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Whereas me and Jess were more into building something communally and getting people to be more creatively involved.</div><div id="00:04:46.160" class="transcript_line"> We were also into street music.</div><div id="00:04:48.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been to New Orleans in 1991.</div><div id="00:04:53.840" class="transcript_line"> I think for the 1991 mass we brought Claude down to beef up the street band.</div><div id="00:04:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Because he worked with the Grand Union and he&#039;d done loads of street music.</div><div id="00:05:03.760" class="transcript_line"> He knows a hell of a lot about that kind of music.</div><div id="00:05:06.640" class="transcript_line"> So we brought Claude Depper down in 1991.</div><div id="00:05:10.160" class="transcript_line"> And in that year I also got to go to New Orleans, total coincidence, and saw how street music could work in that context.</div><div id="00:05:19.120" class="transcript_line"> So I was really, I think at that period, the early 90s, I got a real appetite for street music.</div><div id="00:05:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Street brass music let&#039;s call it.</div><div id="00:05:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I thought it was something that was, I thought it was kind of, nobody was really doing it around here.</div><div id="00:05:37.280" class="transcript_line"> A couple of bands doing it, the sort of politically motivated bands like the Fallout band and things like that.</div><div id="00:05:44.240" class="transcript_line"> But I felt there was a way of doing it a lot better.</div><div id="00:05:47.840" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, the final project came up.</div><div id="00:05:49.920" class="transcript_line"> I thought all these guys, they don&#039;t really want to be in a street band.</div><div id="00:05:53.200" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going to start up a street band.</div><div id="00:05:54.960" class="transcript_line"> So the garden festival, Ebbw Vale Garden Festival in 1992, they gave us the seed funding of 500 quid to start something up in the valleys.</div><div id="00:06:04.720" class="transcript_line"> We found a very dynamic person called Denise Lord.</div><div id="00:06:10.400" class="transcript_line"> And she put together a band for a theatre project about, I think, the year before, Valley of the Kings, I think it was called.</div><div id="00:06:18.880" class="transcript_line"> And she was keen to try and get something going.</div><div id="00:06:21.360" class="transcript_line"> So we teamed up with her and we got and we started this little workshop in the valleys in Pontepri.</div><div id="00:06:27.440" class="transcript_line"> In the Muni Arts Centre, actually, the first sessions were.</div><div id="00:06:31.360" class="transcript_line"> And the first session, no, no, it was at Club of Bond, actually.</div><div id="00:06:34.160" class="transcript_line"> But the first session, nobody turned up.</div><div id="00:06:36.320" class="transcript_line"> And she said, don&#039;t miss out next week.</div><div id="00:06:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Come in fortnight time and I&#039;ll get in touch with all the contacts that I made for Valley of the Kings.</div><div id="00:06:47.120" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll make sure that there are people here.</div><div id="00:06:49.920" class="transcript_line"> And so we said, OK.</div><div id="00:06:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And we we we trust we didn&#039;t have any option but to trust that she knew what she was doing.</div><div id="00:06:59.360" class="transcript_line"> So we turned up two weeks later and there were about 10 people there.</div><div id="00:07:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And we thought, well, we&#039;ve got a project, you know, it&#039;ll run it for 10 weeks and they&#039;ll see out.</div><div id="00:07:08.640" class="transcript_line"> But after that 10 weeks, we performed a bit at the garden festival and a couple of selected venues in the valleys, really choice venues like the Gunnar&#039;s Estate.</div><div id="00:07:19.600" class="transcript_line"> Parading around the Gunnar&#039;s Estate where people just came out of their houses and stared at you as if you just beamed down from Mars or something.</div><div id="00:07:29.280" class="transcript_line"> And and then people who were in it were really didn&#039;t want to stop after 10 weeks.</div><div id="00:07:37.120" class="transcript_line"> So then they they got together and formed a committee and applied for the money to keep it going.</div><div id="00:07:42.800" class="transcript_line"> And they got that money and it&#039;s still going.</div><div id="00:07:45.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still going and it continues to go from strength to strength up and down, but from strength to strength.</div><div id="00:07:52.400" class="transcript_line"> Really, that&#039;s basically it.</div><div id="00:07:55.280" class="transcript_line"> But and that&#039;s a long winded story.</div><div id="00:07:57.600" class="transcript_line"> But that is it basically there is this tension with working with jazz musicians and doing street music is that a lot of jazz musicians, they just want to be in a club and playing.</div><div id="00:08:09.600" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got this image of what jazz is about, and it doesn&#039;t involve going out on the streets.</div><div id="00:08:14.880" class="transcript_line"> If it does, it&#039;s in a warm climate.</div><div id="00:08:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s but there are some of us in the band who are really enthusiastic about street music.</div><div id="00:08:23.280" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s the enthusiasm of that fear that call that&#039;s kept the street side of Wanderbass going.</div><div id="00:08:29.520" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve performed and led street bands in an extraordinary number of card carpools with quickly totting them up.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And you come to the grand total of 20 out of 25, which makes you a carpool hero.</div><div id="00:08:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve taken I&#039;ve ticked the ones I&#039;m pretty sure we did.</div><div id="00:08:52.160" class="transcript_line"> And I think I think it&#039;s 20.</div><div id="00:08:55.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s about 20.</div><div id="00:08:56.480" class="transcript_line"> I can well believe that.</div><div id="00:08:58.720" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, your forte is music and the music is vitally important for giving the energy for groups to dance to.</div><div id="00:09:07.360" class="transcript_line"> But in terms of costume and the various costumes that have been made for and provided for you and for Wanderbass, are there any good, bad or not or good, bad or ugly that stick in your mind, stuff that worked or stuff that malfunctioned?</div><div id="00:09:24.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was one there was one we we once did a carnival.</div><div id="00:09:28.240" class="transcript_line"> This must have been around the time that we started.</div><div id="00:09:31.760" class="transcript_line"> What Wanderbass can&#039;t have been very going for very long at this point.</div><div id="00:09:34.880" class="transcript_line"> But we did we did a little section of of mass with chapter for children.</div><div id="00:09:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And we had these guys who were basically students looking for a summer work placement.</div><div id="00:09:50.080" class="transcript_line"> They were our students and they made these beautiful costumes.</div><div id="00:09:53.680" class="transcript_line"> But they weren&#039;t used to mass, so they just made one off costumes.</div><div id="00:09:57.600" class="transcript_line"> And so the costumes were beautiful and the kids helped to design them.</div><div id="00:10:00.480" class="transcript_line"> And the thing looked amazing, but they weren&#039;t really, you know, until you&#039;ve actually walked a costume, you probably don&#039;t know much about comfort and things like that.</div><div id="00:10:09.920" class="transcript_line"> And they came up with this amazing costume.</div><div id="00:10:12.400" class="transcript_line"> The fruit was the theme and this amazing orange costume.</div><div id="00:10:15.200" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nobody to walk it.</div><div id="00:10:17.120" class="transcript_line"> So I just said, all right, well, I&#039;m not it&#039;s not staying in the box.</div><div id="00:10:21.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to walk it.</div><div id="00:10:22.080" class="transcript_line"> So I I decided I was going to play and there&#039;s still photos of me wearing this looking like Sun Ra or something.</div><div id="00:10:27.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a beautiful costume, but it&#039;s bizarre.</div><div id="00:10:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Bright orange, bright orange, sparkly stuff all over it and extensions and things like that.</div><div id="00:10:35.520" class="transcript_line"> The problem with it was that it had a it had a sort of with the frame over the head and and he had this big hat on.</div><div id="00:10:48.880" class="transcript_line"> And whenever the wind blew, it it blew up and it pushed my chin like that.</div><div id="00:10:54.800" class="transcript_line"> So it caught me under the chin and pushed my chin up, which when you&#039;re playing the soprano sax is really uncomfortable.</div><div id="00:11:00.480" class="transcript_line"> So I ended up like with cuts all over my chin and everything at the end of that parade.</div><div id="00:11:05.600" class="transcript_line"> So that one left a mental scar.</div><div id="00:11:09.120" class="transcript_line"> And I and I can&#039;t some of the yes, basically the ones that really stick in your mind are the ones that they either they haven&#039;t really thought it through.</div><div id="00:11:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Or they they&#039;ve thought it through, but they have forgot to think about the practicalities of playing an instrument.</div><div id="00:11:25.600" class="transcript_line"> So the best things are just to stick a bit of a hat on us and drape something over us and leave us in fairly comfortable clothing because they really I mean, a lot of the guys who design the costumes.</div><div id="00:11:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s better now because obviously they&#039;ve done it a few times, but they used to they forgot how hard we were working just to play the instrument sometimes.</div><div id="00:11:45.760" class="transcript_line"> And to give us extra things to do and the extra things to think about, it doesn&#039;t really work for musicians.</div><div id="00:11:51.200" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m in on a lot of ones where bits of costume have been discarded as part of the parade.</div><div id="00:11:57.840" class="transcript_line"> But that one stuck in the mind.</div><div id="00:12:00.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s interesting you mentioned stamina and exhaustion and well, you didn&#039;t mention exhaustion, but I just have.</div><div id="00:12:07.600" class="transcript_line"> And of course, an average</div><div id="00:12:11.360" class="transcript_line"> kind of carnival, kind of mass carnival parade would be an hour to 90 minutes.</div><div id="00:12:16.640" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that like trying to keep the energy up or even just the physicality of your lungs must be the size of God knows what I mean.</div><div id="00:12:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, you have to pace yourself and you know, you you think, right, we&#039;re going to have we&#039;re going to be going down St Mary Street.</div><div id="00:12:34.880" class="transcript_line"> And if the if it&#039;s gone well, if it&#039;s a nice day, you know, you&#039;re going to get a big crowd in St Mary Street and probably going to get to stop in St Mary Street as well.</div><div id="00:12:42.400" class="transcript_line"> And so you you kind of save your best material and a bit of energy for that.</div><div id="00:12:47.280" class="transcript_line"> But basically you either you either like it or you don&#039;t.</div><div id="00:12:51.520" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a people in Wunderbras who they they want to be in the band in order to be in the band.</div><div id="00:12:57.600" class="transcript_line"> You have to do parades.</div><div id="00:13:00.480" class="transcript_line"> So they put up with having to do parades.</div><div id="00:13:03.280" class="transcript_line"> And there are some in the band and all the leaders of the band, this includes who actually love doing parades because we&#039;ve got this image of this romantic image of New Orleans parades and things like that.</div><div id="00:13:15.040" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d all love to be in the New Orleans parade.</div><div id="00:13:17.040" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re trying to do that thing in Cardiff and we really believe in it.</div><div id="00:13:21.360" class="transcript_line"> And if you actually sign up for it and get into it and and because we worked really hard on making this street music work without trying to copy the New Orleans.</div><div id="00:13:33.360" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve drafted in arrangements from popular music that people in the crowd will recognise.</div><div id="00:13:39.440" class="transcript_line"> You know, because in New Orleans, they know all the traditional material.</div><div id="00:13:42.320" class="transcript_line"> So they play Saint and everybody loves it.</div><div id="00:13:45.520" class="transcript_line"> Whereas we&#039;ll play Kanye West and you get sort of, oh, but is that really what they&#039;re playing?</div><div id="00:13:50.640" class="transcript_line"> Are they really playing that?</div><div id="00:13:51.760" class="transcript_line"> So we get that kind of recognition factor.</div><div id="00:13:53.920" class="transcript_line"> But some of us really love it.</div><div id="00:13:55.840" class="transcript_line"> And and you don&#039;t really if you if you&#039;re actually committed to it and a couple of hours of really hard work.</div><div id="00:14:01.920" class="transcript_line"> You know, you bring a hip flask for a bit of energy replacement.</div><div id="00:14:07.520" class="transcript_line"> But if you if you really love it, then you don&#039;t think about what it&#039;s physically costing you until afterwards.</div><div id="00:14:14.880" class="transcript_line"> The next day, you&#039;re absolutely shattered.</div><div id="00:14:17.520" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, there are people who are never going to get that into it and they&#039;re doing it as a kind of suffer under sufferance.</div><div id="00:14:25.600" class="transcript_line"> And then there are people who just are totally into it and love it.</div><div id="00:14:28.800" class="transcript_line"> And if the weather&#039;s bad, it&#039;s harder to enjoy it.</div><div id="00:14:31.200" class="transcript_line"> It has to be said.</div><div id="00:14:33.120" class="transcript_line"> But if the weather&#039;s nice and the crowd are nice and and people are helping you,</div><div id="00:14:38.240" class="transcript_line"> because sometimes people really help you on the parade.</div><div id="00:14:40.400" class="transcript_line"> There was one.</div><div id="00:14:43.760" class="transcript_line"> There was one year, I remember I could see the woman there.</div><div id="00:14:47.280" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s got that blue headdress on.</div><div id="00:14:49.200" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s her name?</div><div id="00:14:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Atiola.</div><div id="00:14:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Atiola.</div><div id="00:14:51.360" class="transcript_line"> She was she was kind of with the band and she was she was being sort of I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:14:58.160" class="transcript_line"> But she was dancing around the band and she had so much energy and she was so good.</div><div id="00:15:03.360" class="transcript_line"> And she knew what carnival was about.</div><div id="00:15:04.720" class="transcript_line"> You could tell the way she interacted with people.</div><div id="00:15:06.560" class="transcript_line"> She was some kind of spirit.</div><div id="00:15:08.320" class="transcript_line"> And that made the band really got behind her and really performed that because she she kind of they followed her cue.</div><div id="00:15:17.120" class="transcript_line"> She was totally into it and she&#039;s an amazing performer.</div><div id="00:15:20.560" class="transcript_line"> She looks amazing.</div><div id="00:15:21.840" class="transcript_line"> The costume that she was wearing was amazing and the band just completely got into it.</div><div id="00:15:25.360" class="transcript_line"> She was dancing all around us and everything.</div><div id="00:15:27.280" class="transcript_line"> She just didn&#039;t stop for two hours.</div><div id="00:15:29.360" class="transcript_line"> And that was fantastic.</div><div id="00:15:30.560" class="transcript_line"> So when you when you&#039;ve got people who really kind of they&#039;re almost like guiding spirits who get you through it.</div><div id="00:15:36.640" class="transcript_line"> When you&#039;ve got people in in the carnival crew who will do that,</div><div id="00:15:40.720" class="transcript_line"> then that&#039;s great because then you feel like you&#039;re really part of something really big then.</div><div id="00:15:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And and then somewhere at the back of mind, the mind you&#039;re actually thinking,</div><div id="00:15:51.520" class="transcript_line"> well, when if it&#039;s Mardi Gras,</div><div id="00:15:53.360" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ll start doing this around 11 in the morning</div><div id="00:15:56.560" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ll still be doing it at 11 at night.</div><div id="00:15:59.280" class="transcript_line"> So two hours is not two hours is not that bad, really.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they probably sound really ropey after 12 hours doing it.</div><div id="00:16:08.480" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, two hours isn&#039;t that bad, really.</div><div id="00:16:11.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re wusses.</div><div id="00:16:14.080" class="transcript_line"> Clark Carnival has proved to be weatherproof in the sense that even when the weather is atrocious</div><div id="00:16:21.840" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ll refer to the three years in a row that 2005, six and seven were from setting up</div><div id="00:16:31.840" class="transcript_line"> the entire parade and the rest of it, we had, I mean, atrocious weather really, you know,</div><div id="00:16:37.760" class="transcript_line"> our audience had to be completely weatherproofed.</div><div id="00:16:40.800" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s mad.</div><div id="00:16:42.480" class="transcript_line"> What are the difficulties involved in actually playing brass in a consistent torrent?</div><div id="00:16:49.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s pretty it&#039;s pretty much impossible.</div><div id="00:16:52.720" class="transcript_line"> We have done it.</div><div id="00:16:53.440" class="transcript_line"> We have done things where we&#039;ve been waiting to go on the parade and it just</div><div id="00:16:59.120" class="transcript_line"> absolutely the heavens have opened and we&#039;ve just taken it on the chin and just gone with it.</div><div id="00:17:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Really, the rain does brass instruments do not like the rain.</div><div id="00:17:10.880" class="transcript_line"> The worst thing is saxes and flutes and wind and things like that,</div><div id="00:17:14.240" class="transcript_line"> because the mechanisms are very difficult and it actually rusts the mechanism.</div><div id="00:17:18.720" class="transcript_line"> So you can actually wreck an instrument if you, you know, if water gets in there.</div><div id="00:17:23.680" class="transcript_line"> The other brass, trumpets and trombones, tubas, things like that, they&#039;re not so vulnerable</div><div id="00:17:29.600" class="transcript_line"> because they don&#039;t have the delicate machinery, bit of oil all sorted out.</div><div id="00:17:35.760" class="transcript_line"> And they don&#039;t have the, you know, because so that&#039;s it really.</div><div id="00:17:40.880" class="transcript_line"> And you always leave it up to the players.</div><div id="00:17:42.640" class="transcript_line"> If a player is so worried about their instrument that they feel that they&#039;re going to</div><div id="00:17:49.040" class="transcript_line"> have to have thousands of pounds of work done on it, then they just leave.</div><div id="00:17:53.520" class="transcript_line"> They just don&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:17:54.480" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t make them do it.</div><div id="00:17:55.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s up to them.</div><div id="00:17:57.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t try and make them do it.</div><div id="00:17:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I say if you&#039;re, you know, if you&#039;re concerned about your instrument, just,</div><div id="00:18:01.360" class="transcript_line"> but a lot of people have got kind of will borrow,</div><div id="00:18:04.160" class="transcript_line"> will have a cheap old student instrument that they&#039;ll bring along to parades.</div><div id="00:18:08.640" class="transcript_line"> If they think it&#039;s going to rain, things like that.</div><div id="00:18:11.200" class="transcript_line"> People generally tend to get into it, but it is really tricky.</div><div id="00:18:14.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the same for everybody else is that your fingers are slippy on the instrument and you,</div><div id="00:18:19.280" class="transcript_line"> it means you can&#039;t play the notes.</div><div id="00:18:20.720" class="transcript_line"> You intend to play a note and you don&#039;t get the right note.</div><div id="00:18:24.800" class="transcript_line"> You, you also, the wind in your, the rain in your eyes is a problem.</div><div id="00:18:29.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s best if you&#039;ve got some kind of head gear that keeps the rain out of your eyes</div><div id="00:18:33.120" class="transcript_line"> because that can be really horrible.</div><div id="00:18:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Apart from that, same for everybody else, really same, same as it is for everybody else.</div><div id="00:18:40.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s horrible when it&#039;s raining and it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s, it&#039;s,</div><div id="00:18:44.720" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s one reason why street street art hasn&#039;t really taken off in this country.</div><div id="00:18:50.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the weather.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I mean, whether it&#039;s fairly predictable in, in other places.</div><div id="00:18:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Obviously this project, the anniversary project deals primarily with Cardiff carnival,</div><div id="00:19:02.240" class="transcript_line"> but as you, as you said in the opening remarks, you and I have</div><div id="00:19:06.160" class="transcript_line"> worked on projects that predate Cardiff carnival and in Swicker,</div><div id="00:19:11.840" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve worked on other projects, which I would say, share the same celebratory outlook,</div><div id="00:19:17.760" class="transcript_line"> but their format and presentation have been different.</div><div id="00:19:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Which ones stick in your mind as we, as we look back at our history?</div><div id="00:19:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, we, before, before anybody has, any of us had got into our steady arts work,</div><div id="00:19:33.920" class="transcript_line"> if there&#039;s such a thing exists, exists.</div><div id="00:19:36.320" class="transcript_line"> We, we did the carnival, we did the fundraiser for the miners together.</div><div id="00:19:41.360" class="transcript_line"> And that was a memorable experience just because we were taking a hell of a risk, just</div><div id="00:19:45.840" class="transcript_line"> wandering into pubs and playing Christmas carols and collecting music.</div><div id="00:19:49.920" class="transcript_line"> But I think that was just making a big impact and then going as quickly as possible.</div><div id="00:19:54.080" class="transcript_line"> And it was, it was for a purpose.</div><div id="00:19:56.320" class="transcript_line"> I, we were raising specifically, I tried to play the old heartstrings.</div><div id="00:20:01.520" class="transcript_line"> It was specifically for presence for the striking miners children,</div><div id="00:20:06.320" class="transcript_line"> which you just thought most people couldn&#039;t get too annoyed about.</div><div id="00:20:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, most people didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:20:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Most people were really nice.</div><div id="00:20:11.440" class="transcript_line"> There were a few exceptions, but they were, most people were really nice about it and</div><div id="00:20:14.960" class="transcript_line"> we were right behind it.</div><div id="00:20:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and that&#039;s how I remember.</div><div id="00:20:19.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we were.</div><div id="00:20:20.480" class="transcript_line"> Skinheads in the floor.</div><div id="00:20:21.520" class="transcript_line"> But there were a couple of, there were two pubs, I remember, where we were set upon in,</div><div id="00:20:26.080" class="transcript_line"> in to vary it, where for various reasons, one because political objections and one</div><div id="00:20:30.960" class="transcript_line"> because you shouldn&#039;t go in that pub really at that time on Friday night.</div><div id="00:20:37.760" class="transcript_line"> I believe you were groped in the spotlands.</div><div id="00:20:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was groped in the spotlands.</div><div id="00:20:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Which is a great title for an album, which is where you had to, to record it.</div><div id="00:20:45.360" class="transcript_line"> But, and then the floor of, it was a well-known right wing pub where people weren&#039;t very</div><div id="00:20:49.520" class="transcript_line"> sympathetic to what we were trying to do and we were probably under a bit of physical danger</div><div id="00:20:53.600" class="transcript_line"> there, but we got away eventually.</div><div id="00:20:57.280" class="transcript_line"> So there was that, yeah, making a big impact.</div><div id="00:20:59.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think that sort of had a spirit of straight work about it, really, just going there,</div><div id="00:21:04.800" class="transcript_line"> making a big impact and get out.</div><div id="00:21:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, guerrilla music.</div><div id="00:21:07.280" class="transcript_line"> We also, I mean, as I said, there was the, the Madov project, which is where you pulled</div><div id="00:21:13.360" class="transcript_line"> me into the Taliesin fold and that is kind of what led to the straight art, the swicker</div><div id="00:21:19.200" class="transcript_line"> and the carnival arts.</div><div id="00:21:22.080" class="transcript_line"> But the big things that we worked together on were in 1910, early 1910s, early 1910s,</div><div id="00:21:26.560" class="transcript_line"> 1998, which was the bridge, a bont.</div><div id="00:21:31.680" class="transcript_line"> And the thing that we did up in Tolvine, which was called Crossing Borders, Torifiniai, and</div><div id="00:21:39.200" class="transcript_line"> yeah, those were, those were a bit like oratorios.</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They were, yeah, so they were celebratory and they were very much creating a musical</div><div id="00:21:48.080" class="transcript_line"> structure that people could just get involved in and write from people who&#039;d never played</div><div id="00:21:52.880" class="transcript_line"> samba.</div><div id="00:21:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Kids in schools who&#039;d never played samba getting good enough to go on stage and perform</div><div id="00:21:58.400" class="transcript_line"> samba in a very short period of time.</div><div id="00:22:00.960" class="transcript_line"> To amateur choirs, to brass bands, to wonder brass were involved.</div><div id="00:22:07.120" class="transcript_line"> We had a tabla group, we had a rapper, we had folk singer, gospel choir, things like</div><div id="00:22:14.080" class="transcript_line"> that.</div><div id="00:22:14.240" class="transcript_line"> So it was just bringing together a lot of existing groups and trying to make something</div><div id="00:22:18.080" class="transcript_line"> interesting out of the combination and writing original music for them.</div><div id="00:22:23.040" class="transcript_line"> That was the amazing thing because it just gave me a big canvas to work with and just,</div><div id="00:22:30.240" class="transcript_line"> you know, it&#039;s a bit daunting to write for 100 people and then to try and coordinate</div><div id="00:22:34.640" class="transcript_line"> a performance of 100 people.</div><div id="00:22:36.640" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s that, you know, that big canvas is a really exciting project to be able to</div><div id="00:22:43.920" class="transcript_line"> work on really, to write for.</div><div id="00:22:45.920" class="transcript_line"> The bridge in particular is a project I feel quite proud of and your role in that was,</div><div id="00:22:50.240" class="transcript_line"> you know, totally central in the rest of it.</div><div id="00:22:52.960" class="transcript_line"> My only shame, looking back, the only shame is of course it was for one night only, one</div><div id="00:22:58.480" class="transcript_line"> performance.</div><div id="00:22:59.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we haven&#039;t recorded but there seems to be a body of work and a body of music in</div><div id="00:23:03.840" class="transcript_line"> particular which is, even now, I can listen to and think it&#039;s fabulous.</div><div id="00:23:11.120" class="transcript_line"> We often have visitors or colleagues from elsewhere in the world and sometimes from</div><div id="00:23:17.440" class="transcript_line"> carnival cities, you know, etc.</div><div id="00:23:21.040" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a track there that I play quite regularly and put it on, I don&#039;t let them</div><div id="00:23:26.960" class="transcript_line"> know what it is, and I ask them about the hank of it and then they tell me they feel</div><div id="00:23:34.400" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s exuberant and wonderful.</div><div id="00:23:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s written this?</div><div id="00:23:37.520" class="transcript_line"> What is this?</div><div id="00:23:38.080" class="transcript_line"> Where did this, where&#039;s it from?</div><div id="00:23:40.320" class="transcript_line"> And I explain it came from Cardiff and, yeah, largely from your head with all the</div><div id="00:23:44.640" class="transcript_line"> resources that were put together.</div><div id="00:23:46.640" class="transcript_line"> And for me that&#039;s a very telling moment where they just go like, wow, that could be any</div><div id="00:23:51.840" class="transcript_line"> carnival city in the world, that is carnival music.</div><div id="00:23:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m really proud of that, I&#039;ve always, you know, ever since we did that, just because</div><div id="00:24:01.680" class="transcript_line"> of the, just at some point we actually, we planned it out and then the money comes</div><div id="00:24:09.760" class="transcript_line"> through and then you put all the groups, you get all the groups, you talk to these groups,</div><div id="00:24:15.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re interested, you go and meet them and they say, yeah, we&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="00:24:19.200" class="transcript_line"> And then everybody goes away and they say, right, and you say, right, I&#039;ve got to write</div><div id="00:24:24.400" class="transcript_line"> that music now, 45 minutes of music for probably about an hour of music, I can&#039;t remember exactly</div><div id="00:24:30.960" class="transcript_line"> the length of it, it was definitely between 45 and an hour.</div><div id="00:24:33.600" class="transcript_line"> That sounds right.</div><div id="00:24:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Of all, for all those people and nobody&#039;s going to get off stage for the whole time,</div><div id="00:24:39.440" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;ve got to try and keep them busy for the whole time.</div><div id="00:24:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And that was, and then, and then, and who&#039;s going to help me write it?</div><div id="00:24:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Well, nobody.</div><div id="00:24:46.240" class="transcript_line"> But it was great.</div><div id="00:24:48.080" class="transcript_line"> The one great thing about that was that I didn&#039;t feel like I was on my own because</div><div id="00:24:52.400" class="transcript_line"> Menna was there as well, Menna Elvin wrote the words for that and she was great because</div><div id="00:24:56.000" class="transcript_line"> she was doing some kind of opera project and she was faxing me lyrics from New York,</div><div id="00:25:01.920" class="transcript_line"> this just felt really glamorous, something, something, yeah, just getting the fax of a</div><div id="00:25:07.440" class="transcript_line"> new bit that she&#039;d written from New York.</div><div id="00:25:09.280" class="transcript_line"> So even though she was doing something in New York and working, developing an idea for</div><div id="00:25:14.400" class="transcript_line"> an opera or something, she was still thinking about this piece that we were going to do.</div><div id="00:25:19.200" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, that was that was really exciting and but really challenging as well and I</div><div id="00:25:23.280" class="transcript_line"> sweated a lot of that one.</div><div id="00:25:26.240" class="transcript_line"> I think you really pulled it off.</div><div id="00:25:28.160" class="transcript_line"> As you have done with this interview, Rob Smith, what can I say other than it&#039;s been</div><div id="00:25:33.040" class="transcript_line"> a pleasure working with you for more than 25 years.</div><div id="00:25:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, we did have a project in the pipeline again, unfortunately, Money Won&#039;t West, which</div><div id="00:25:42.400" class="transcript_line"> was called The Demon King and was going to reflect some of your more current musical</div><div id="00:25:48.160" class="transcript_line"> influences and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:25:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Shall we end just by, can you tell us where you&#039;re coming from, what that might hold in</div><div id="00:25:53.920" class="transcript_line"> the future and your trip to media?</div><div id="00:25:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yeah, well, we around the time, around the time that Madoc happened, which is 1989,</div><div id="00:26:03.600" class="transcript_line"> I believe, a way of continuing that relationship that you developed with the Samaj Centre in</div><div id="00:26:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Grangetown was to use Vishram Vasani, who is the local, he was a kind of music community</div><div id="00:26:20.640" class="transcript_line"> music leader, but obviously the place was also a temple.</div><div id="00:26:25.040" class="transcript_line"> So it was very much to do with Hindu culture and Gujarat, where a lot of those guys came</div><div id="00:26:32.480" class="transcript_line"> from, but it was to build on his expertise in music and to give, to allow the kids in</div><div id="00:26:39.680" class="transcript_line"> on that, bring the kids in on that.</div><div id="00:26:41.280" class="transcript_line"> And one of the ways that we decided to do that was he would give us pieces of music</div><div id="00:26:46.880" class="transcript_line"> to learn and we&#039;d kind of, we&#039;d notate it in Indian notation and then teach the kids</div><div id="00:26:52.000" class="transcript_line"> how to play on keyboards.</div><div id="00:26:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So we were kind of, we were kind of cultural intermediaries really between Vishram&#039;s</div><div id="00:26:57.760" class="transcript_line"> generation and I suppose his grandchildren or his children&#039;s or grandchildren&#039;s</div><div id="00:27:04.720" class="transcript_line"> generation.</div><div id="00:27:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was great because I learned a lot about Indian music on that.</div><div id="00:27:09.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d studied Indian music a little bit at university, but it&#039;s all very dry and theoretical</div><div id="00:27:15.840" class="transcript_line"> when you do it there, but actually to get your hands dirty and get down there and actually</div><div id="00:27:19.840" class="transcript_line"> learn some stuff and then teach it to some Indian kids or kids, Welsh kids, but whose</div><div id="00:27:25.280" class="transcript_line"> ancestry is Indian.</div><div id="00:27:27.200" class="transcript_line"> That was really exciting and I&#039;ve always, I&#039;ve treasured that really as a special place</div><div id="00:27:33.840" class="transcript_line"> in my musical treasure chest, if you like, for a long time.</div><div id="00:27:38.800" class="transcript_line"> And this year I was able to renew that by going to India and working with some top</div><div id="00:27:43.520" class="transcript_line"> flight Indian musicians, put a track together.</div><div id="00:27:46.880" class="transcript_line"> I went with Jenny Allen and we went over with some Welsh folk music.</div><div id="00:27:53.360" class="transcript_line"> We combined it with Indian ragas and we created a track there with some Indian musicians,</div><div id="00:28:02.080" class="transcript_line"> which is upon SoundCloud as we speak.</div><div id="00:28:05.360" class="transcript_line"> But also there was the project, there was the, around that time you were mooting a project</div><div id="00:28:10.960" class="transcript_line"> which is based on the demon king, the going over to salon and rescuing, is it Princess</div><div id="00:28:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Sita?</div><div id="00:28:18.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:28:19.040" class="transcript_line"> Ravana, evil swine, kidnapper.</div><div id="00:28:21.840" class="transcript_line"> From, and we were going to do a sort of carnival-esque version of that, but using</div><div id="00:28:27.040" class="transcript_line"> Indian musical influences.</div><div id="00:28:29.200" class="transcript_line"> And so at some point we should be able, at some point we should be able to do that</div><div id="00:28:34.160" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;ve now, you know, we&#039;ve gone to India and done a bit of research and</div><div id="00:28:39.920" class="transcript_line"> I kind of know how the music works well enough to kind of draw on that influence to create</div><div id="00:28:45.920" class="transcript_line"> some music that would be specific to the project.</div><div id="00:28:48.160" class="transcript_line"> And so I think hopefully at some point that project will happen.</div><div id="00:28:52.480" class="transcript_line"> I sincerely hope so.</div><div id="00:28:55.280" class="transcript_line"> Because we&#039;ve done a lot of the groundwork really by applying for little bits of money</div><div id="00:29:00.640" class="transcript_line"> from here and there and listening to and working with Indian musicians and all the</div><div id="00:29:08.800" class="transcript_line"> ammunition is there to create that project so we should be able to do it at some point.</div><div id="00:29:14.080" class="transcript_line"> I sincerely hope to put that funding bullet in the gun and make it happen.</div><div id="00:29:17.920" class="transcript_line"> Rob Smith, you are more than the carnival hero with 20 carnivals under your belt.</div><div id="00:29:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;re the mainstay of celebratory music in Wales as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:29:28.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, we haven&#039;t talked about samba.</div><div id="00:29:31.520" class="transcript_line"> So when we were first doing music with brass, we were very much involved with the samba band</div><div id="00:29:38.800" class="transcript_line"> as well.</div><div id="00:29:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And so I think for me, for the early Swicker carnivals, samba was the sound of the carnival</div><div id="00:29:47.120" class="transcript_line"> and the brass was like more ambition than achievement.</div><div id="00:29:51.120" class="transcript_line"> The problem with working with the samba band was that there&#039;s a lot of them and they play</div><div id="00:29:54.880" class="transcript_line"> really loud.</div><div id="00:29:55.680" class="transcript_line"> So obviously we were outgunned a lot of the time.</div><div id="00:29:57.920" class="transcript_line"> So in the end, we&#039;ve kind of done our own thing.</div><div id="00:30:00.720" class="transcript_line"> But I think the hats off to the samba band because the samba galettes and all that,</div><div id="00:30:07.680" class="transcript_line"> the samba offer is a much more open offer.</div><div id="00:30:10.080" class="transcript_line"> You need a little bit of instrumental skill to do the brass stuff.</div><div id="00:30:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Whereas with samba, it&#039;s a very open offer and people can get involved at a very,</div><div id="00:30:19.360" class="transcript_line"> you know, beginners can get involved and learn the patterns and work their way up.</div><div id="00:30:24.560" class="transcript_line"> So I think for me, yeah, probably more samba is the sound of carnival.</div><div id="00:30:29.040" class="transcript_line"> But I agree, we&#039;ve sort of contributed something to the sound of carnival and carnival.</div><div id="00:30:34.720" class="transcript_line"> I would never downgrade that.</div><div id="00:30:36.560" class="transcript_line"> I think, no, not yourself, Wonder Brass, the music.</div><div id="00:30:42.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been the soundtrack that&#039;s animated.</div><div id="00:30:45.520" class="transcript_line"> The city streets.</div><div id="00:30:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Mr Rob Smith, we thank you and salute you.</div><div id="00:30:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:30:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Ti ma de.</div></div></p>
