id="00:04:42.320" class="transcript_line"> I had five, and when the little ones started to go to school then I went to look for a job.</div><div id="00:04:50.320" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where we went me and my friends to go part time while the kids were in school.</div><div id="00:04:59.320" class="transcript_line"> So we went to Fish and Price first for a while.</div><div id="00:05:04.320" class="transcript_line"> So you were living now in Lichau this time?</div><div id="00:05:06.320" class="transcript_line"> No, Gosainan.</div><div id="00:05:07.320" class="transcript_line"> Gosainan.</div><div id="00:05:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh sorry no, I was living in Lichau then, I remember now.</div><div id="00:05:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, cos I was living in Lichau.</div><div id="00:05:15.320" class="transcript_line"> The house that we got was, my husband was born next door, so he hasn&#039;t moved far, so next door we were.</div><div id="00:05:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And his mother and father was living there.</div><div id="00:05:28.320" class="transcript_line"> But before we had that house, we lived with his mother and father before they had the council house.</div><div id="00:05:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Right, so the children, how old was your youngest child when you went then back to work?</div><div id="00:05:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Well they were in school I know.</div><div id="00:05:43.320" class="transcript_line"> Cos I didn&#039;t like to leave him on his own too young.</div><div id="00:05:48.320" class="transcript_line"> I should imagine he would have been a sixth nine, something like that.</div><div id="00:05:54.320" class="transcript_line"> What date was that, do you remember?</div><div id="00:05:56.320" class="transcript_line"> No I can&#039;t remember that date.</div><div id="00:05:58.320" class="transcript_line"> When was your son born?</div><div id="00:06:02.320" class="transcript_line"> So it would be about...</div><div id="00:06:06.320" class="transcript_line"> In the early 70s then that you went then?</div><div id="00:06:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, cos I remembered after, it was 1973 that we were made redundant.</div><div id="00:06:16.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I remembered when I looked it up, it was 1973.</div><div id="00:06:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So your first job then in the factory was in Fisher and Price?</div><div id="00:06:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Fisher and Price, yes.</div><div id="00:06:27.320" class="transcript_line"> And where was that, where was the factory?</div><div id="00:06:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Well next door to Mettoys, so just about next door to Mettoys it was.</div><div id="00:06:35.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s Forest Park?</div><div id="00:06:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, Forest Park.</div><div id="00:06:38.320" class="transcript_line"> How did you get to work there then?</div><div id="00:06:40.320" class="transcript_line"> By bus.</div><div id="00:06:42.320" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes if we might have a lift, but very rare, but we had to go for a bus then.</div><div id="00:06:48.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a service bus, not a works bus?</div><div id="00:06:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, a service bus, another works bus then.</div><div id="00:06:53.320" class="transcript_line"> So you went, you decided, two or three of you together decided to go?</div><div id="00:06:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Well two of us, yes, well three of us, but one didn&#039;t stay, she didn&#039;t like it, she only stayed one day.</div><div id="00:07:05.320" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t like it, so my other friend and I stayed then for a while, but she left as well.</div><div id="00:07:10.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think she went to Mettoys, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:07:15.320" class="transcript_line"> The three of you went up together, did you have an interview?</div><div id="00:07:20.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had an interview, yes.</div><div id="00:07:23.320" class="transcript_line"> So we had that, but it was part time it was, at 9.00 until 3.00, because we can come home for the time the children come home from school, see.</div><div id="00:07:34.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was a nice time, but of course when we went over to Mettoys we had to go full time, which was a problem, but we did manage it then.</div><div id="00:07:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, because the oldest girl, she was there to watch them coming home from school and she was there to like a moment of work, so they were all right.</div><div id="00:07:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise I would have to leave there if it was full time, because I was puzzling to stay really, because I was thinking of the kids there.</div><div id="00:08:05.320" class="transcript_line"> But my daughter and my son as well, they said they&#039;d watch them, so that&#039;s the day then they went full time then.</div><div id="00:08:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So you were working part time, were there lots of others working part time?</div><div id="00:08:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, a lot of us were part time, yes.</div><div id="00:08:22.320" class="transcript_line"> What did Fisher Price actually produce?</div><div id="00:08:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Wooden toys, the things like that, you know, well they&#039;re still selling them now, and they were good toys, the Fisher Price was, very good toys.</div><div id="00:08:33.320" class="transcript_line"> What were you doing there? Do you remember the exact job you were doing?</div><div id="00:08:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Well we were on the line, we were, see, and I can remember one thing we were doing, as the people who will remember, you know the dogs that you pull, we were doing them, we were, and I can&#039;t remember the other ones, we were doing a lot of them.</div><div id="00:08:55.320" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember what you were doing to this dog? Were there different parts?</div><div id="00:09:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, different parts, everybody was doing their different parts here. I&#039;m not sure what I will remember. I think I was putting the wheels on, I&#039;m not sure.</div><div id="00:09:10.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s on the line then?</div><div id="00:09:12.320" class="transcript_line"> It goes up to the line, see, until they come to the end, and then there&#039;s a supervisor then to see that there&#039;s no reject, and nothing like that&#039;s on it as well.</div><div id="00:09:22.320" class="transcript_line"> So did you have any training at all?</div><div id="00:09:24.320" class="transcript_line"> No, he didn&#039;t have no training.</div><div id="00:09:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Just told what to do?</div><div id="00:09:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Just told what to do and carry on.</div><div id="00:09:29.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember your first day there? What sort of impression did that do on you?</div><div id="00:09:36.320" class="transcript_line"> We were a bit nervous, because the foreman that we called was there, I can&#039;t remember his name. We were all afraid of him.</div><div id="00:09:45.320" class="transcript_line"> Because if the machine happened to break, we were afraid to tell him, because he didn&#039;t like the machines to be broken, so we were calling the boys then to come and mend it for us.</div><div id="00:09:56.320" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what we went to do then. He&#039;s all right to work with, but don&#039;t get the machines broken. He doesn&#039;t like that at all.</div><div id="00:10:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Is that because he had to produce so much?</div><div id="00:10:06.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I tried, as well, see.</div><div id="00:10:08.320" class="transcript_line"> So he produced so much work, time and motion, time and body, is it?</div><div id="00:10:12.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the first day at all, or you don&#039;t remember that?</div><div id="00:10:17.320" class="transcript_line"> No, not really.</div><div id="00:10:19.320" class="transcript_line"> How many other girls would have been working then on the line in the room, in the factory? Was it very big?</div><div id="00:10:26.320" class="transcript_line"> No, the Pritchard Price wasn&#039;t that big, not as big as Mettoy&#039;s. It was very small. Well, not small, and it wasn&#039;t big. But Mettoy&#039;s was the biggest, well, it was.</div><div id="00:10:37.320" class="transcript_line"> How many women have been working on the line? Can you give us some idea?</div><div id="00:10:42.320" class="transcript_line"> 10 or 20?</div><div id="00:10:44.320" class="transcript_line"> No, it won&#039;t be 10 or 20. It could be 10, but it won&#039;t be 20. Say about 10. 10 of us would be less, might.</div><div id="00:10:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to wear anything special to that?</div><div id="00:10:57.320" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I didn&#039;t have to wear anything special.

towards the children and food as well, see, because, I mean, it wasn&#039;t much, but it was something.</div><div id="00:13:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Otherwise, if he was working, I&#039;d had good wages, I wouldn&#039;t have bothered to go to work, but he wasn&#039;t working at the time then.</div><div id="00:14:00.320" class="transcript_line"> What was your husband&#039;s job?</div><div

of that out as well, and the stamps as well, but only half a stamp we were paying, because it was only part time.</div><div id="00:15:05.320" class="transcript_line"> We could have paid the full, but because we weren&#039;t earning that much, we went off of it then, so it was half a stamp we were paying then at that time.</div><div id="00:15:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to clock

were?</div><div id="00:15:28.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, well we had to finish a job first, and we had to get them out, they gave us a target to get out, and we had to do that target, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t have your bonus sort of thing, you know.</div><div id="00:15:40.320" class="transcript_line"> So we had to do that before we could clock out anyhow, but we did manage it anyhow.</div><div id="00:15:46.320" class="transcript_line"> So it was so much a day exactly?</div><div id="00:15:48.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, we had to get our target out, they&#039;d

class="transcript_line"> No, I couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:15:57.320" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:15:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And then the bonus was on top of your wage, was it?</div><div id="00:16:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, if we had the bonus we&#039;d go on top of our wage then, see, to build it up a bit then, yes.</div><div id="00:16:06.320"

they bring them around for you, in their packets ready for you.</div><div id="00:16:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Were you given pay rises, you know? Do you remember if the money went up at all?</div><div id="00:16:37.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think, it was only that the bonus was making it more in the way.</div><div id="00:16:43.320" class="transcript_line"> If you can get the bonus out.</div><div id="00:16:46.320" class="transcript_line"> How many years did you work in Fisher Price before moving to Metoey?</div><div id="00:16:52.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:16:54.320" class="transcript_line"> Were you talking about four, five, six years or more?</div><div id="00:16:58.320" class="transcript_line"> No, it couldn&#039;t have been that.

Or was it Welsh at all?</div><div id="00:33:12.320" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t hear anybody speaking Welsh, most likely there was, there might, but I didn&#039;t hear anything.</div><div id="00:33:18.320" class="transcript_line"> What about the Swansea girls?

So, when you look back now at the days in the factory, what stays in your mind, you know?</div><div id="00:33:56.320" class="transcript_line"> When you look back at, your memory goes back to those times.</div><div id="00:34:00.320" class="transcript_line"> What are the most interesting or important things that you remember of that time?</div><div id="00:34:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I started in Fishing Price, in the way, making those toys.</div><div id="00:34:13.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I can remember, making that little dog and things like that.</div><div id="00:34:19.320" class="transcript_line"> And the women as well, you know, going out.</div><div id="00:34:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And one time we were going in and they were taking us to...</div><div id="00:34:31.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what&#039;s that name now?</div><div id="00:34:34.320" class="transcript_line"> We had to go to another factory to do something there. I can&#039;t remember what it was, though.</div><div id="00:34:42.320" class="transcript_line"> But we had to have the best to go. But we never did anything there.</div><div id="00:34:47.320" class="transcript_line"> So, we enjoyed that. We were in the bus. I mean, friend in the bus we were.</div><div id="00:34:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Not in Port Talbot.</div><div id="00:34:55.320" class="transcript_line"> So, you were supposed to be showing another company, another group how to do things, were you?</div><div id="00:35:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Or just meeting up with them?</div><div id="00:35:02.320" class="transcript_line"> No, I think it&#039;s to show them how to do some toys there.</div><div id="00:35:08.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to picture where it was.</div><div id="00:35:12.320" class="transcript_line"> But then we didn&#039;t get there. We didn&#039;t do anything in there.</div><div id="00:35:19.320" class="transcript_line"> We were sitting outside. It was a lovely day. We just sat on the wall talking.</div><div id="00:35:23.320" class="transcript_line"> We never went in the factory.</div><div id="00:35:26.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what it was. We were doing something inside a factory or something, so we couldn&#039;t do nothing.</div><div id="00:35:31.320" class="transcript_line"> So, we sat outside and we enjoyed buying ice cream. And that was some ice cream as well.</div><div id="00:35:37.320" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what it was.</div><div id="00:35:41.320" class="transcript_line"> So, did they organise any trips out at all for you?</div><div id="00:35:44.320" class="transcript_line"> Like a trip in the summer or something?</div><div id="00:35:46.320" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:35:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Any parties for children or anything?</div><div id="00:35:50.320" class="transcript_line"> No, nothing like that.
