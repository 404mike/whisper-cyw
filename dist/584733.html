    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The interview recorded with Steve Halfway on 8th March 2017 contains some stories which listeners may find upsetting.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Please proceed to listen at your own discretion.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> We will now begin recording the interview with Steve Halfway.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The recording takes place on the 8th of March at Oasis on Splot Road.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The volunteers present are Kayleigh Williams and Lara Taffer.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> This recording is being collected as an oral history and will be part of the Chronicle Project, a project led by VCS Cymru and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to introduce yourself please?</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Steve and I live in Splot and I&#039;ve lived here for about 20 years now.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I was originally born in Abergavenny which is a little town about an hour away.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t speak English but I&#039;ve been living in Splot for 20 years and the local phrase is I&#039;m now a Splot boy and I feel like I live and belong here.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you tell us the story again about how you started volunteering at Oasis?</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, about two years ago my big passion is music and I noticed there was a concert on for a Congolese choir</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was looking at the flyer on the internet and it said there would also be a small community choir from a local refugee centre.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought that&#039;s surprising so I looked it up, it was called Oasis, and I was really surprised to find that it was just 100 yards from where I lived.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, oh that&#039;ll be interesting, I&#039;ll send them an email and say I haven&#039;t got any particular skills, however I can speak English and I&#039;m quite friendly.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And take it from there. So I sent the email and they invited me along.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And how many years ago was that?</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That was probably over two years.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you do any other volunteering before you came to Oasis?</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I might have done but I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, do you want me to tell you about the first time I came down?</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I came down as a UK national where everything is well ordered, got a national insurance number, the streets are metal, the street lights come on every day, you turn on the tap and you get water.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I came down to Oasis and I met people from all over the world.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I came in I felt a bit uncomfortable because basically I was the only white person there.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went into the cafe room and I&#039;d say that most of the people there would be young black African men where their future is uncertain.</div><div id="00:02:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They would be asylum seekers where they would come from a part of the world which may well be war torn, where there may not be water on tap, where there might not be metal roads, where things aren&#039;t certain.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite amazing to come in to meet people from around the world where my world is very certain and safe and secure.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And their world on that day would be, they would be asylum seekers in Britain but at any moment they could be told by the home office, sorry you&#039;re off home tomorrow.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And so what kind of things do you volunteer for at the centre? What are some of your responsibilities?</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I came down just to see what was what and then they pointed me in the direction of being in charge of the garden.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought well okay I&#039;ll give it a go. And I came down about a week later all ready to make a start.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was the only person there waiting to start. And I thought well hang on.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And again this is what I found out about Oasis which is what I like is that things aren&#039;t particularly well organised.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s about three different time zones, African time zone, British time zone and Middle Eastern time zone.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And they don&#039;t marry up. But anyway I thought well I don&#039;t think this is going to work.</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So I hear that they did some English so I went in and said oh you know I understand you do some English.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> How about if I help out with the English teacher? And that&#039;s how I then went along to the first English class.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was a very good teacher actually. The current English teacher is good but not as good as the first English teacher.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went along and I did some work with her and I did it once a week up until now.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever had the chance to, if music&#039;s your passion, share that passion with the people at the refugee centre?</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well occasionally there&#039;s been some music here but I can&#039;t play an instrument and I can&#039;t read the instrument.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But music is my great passion. I go to loads of music. And when they have some music on here I come and listen to it.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Although another thing I&#039;ve got involved with as well as helping teach English, I help with this conversation group called the fan group called Friends and Neighbours.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And via that I&#039;ve got to know some Sudanese Muslim women. And recently I arranged for them to come to the opera.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And they absolutely loved it. The opera was really good. Welsh National Opera, a world class opera company.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> They were doing La Boeme which is a beautiful opera. And the Welsh National Opera did it to a very high standard which I really enjoyed.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But the Sudanese Muslim women absolutely loved it. And I&#039;m passionate about music.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But the thing about opera, if you go to the audiences, dominated by white pensioners. There&#039;s no question about it.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> If you go to the opera it&#039;ll be dominated by affluent white pensioners.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But I like to take young people. And on this occasion I took three Sudanese Muslim women. And they loved it.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact the young people loved it and the Sudanese Muslim people loved it. So it doesn&#039;t have to just be a preserve for old white Afro people.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And so what motivated you to get involved with volunteering here?</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It seemed like an interest. I&#039;m interested in the world. And probably at the time I thought well I&#039;ll be interested. Try it out.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But in retrospect, yeah it&#039;s been magnificent. And I&#039;ve got more out of it than I&#039;ve put in.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Because just by walking down the road I meet people from all over the world.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> For example the fan group. One week there was some women from Mosul and also some men from Aleppo.</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And how current is that? I mean you can see it on the news, you can read about it on the internet, on the newspapers.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But actually come to meet people who&#039;ve lived through those experiences. And I find that immense.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> One of our questions is how does volunteering help you get to know your community better?</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Well my local community is... I&#039;m well known in my street and they are overwhelmingly white and lived here for decades.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And a few of them are racists to be quite frank. And I know the racists.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But some people in... I&#039;d say that these are part of my community as well. The refugees and asylum seekers.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And the thing I like about Splott is that over the 20 years I&#039;ve lived here it has become more and more multicultural.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t say that people love each other, but they get on. Which is really magnificent.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And what I&#039;m proud of in Splott is that this place sits here and there&#039;s no bother. No bother.</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not saying that the local community can flood it in and they all do things together.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But it sits here, it&#039;s quite obviously for... the great majority of people who come in will be young African men.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But it doesn&#039;t have any problems.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the groups that we&#039;ve interviewed before was Adams Down Arts Association.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And... pause for a second.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was mentioning before, one of the previous interviews we did was with Adams Down Arts Association.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had run a program here. Did you?</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:09:01.000" class="transcript_line"> No? I&#039;m involved in that. Just thought I would ask.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So what... they obviously have a craft room and they do sports. What are some of the other programs that they have available?</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I&#039;m only involved in the English language teaching and the fan group. I know there&#039;s lots of other things going on.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But exactly what I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But I guess that the main thing is it&#039;s a centre for people to come together, asylum seekers and refugees, where they get companionship.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the biggest thing is probably the cafe. Where people can go in and they&#039;ll have a friendly face to chat with.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know how many volunteers are...</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And the thing is I love doing this. It&#039;s completely informal. I&#039;ve found my own way in and I now do what I enjoy.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got to know people and chat to all sorts of people.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But the formal structure I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Are you given a lot of autonomy to choose what kinds of things you do?</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah. I think I am, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And the thing is I choose to do this work and I love OASIS and I come down a couple of times a week.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I could do a bit more if people ask me or if there&#039;s a specific thing I would like.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m very boundaried in terms of I don&#039;t want to take on too much.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the people at OASIS, the asylum seekers and refugees are, in my experience, lovely good-hearted people.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But their needs are immense.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t want to... I&#039;m not going to give too much.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it would just suck me dry.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Just give what you can.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well, I give what I can and I give what I enjoy giving.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve got the luxury of saying so far but no further.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Does anybody else in your family or friends volunteer here with you?</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, not my family but my... I&#039;ve got some friends come.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> They came out to help out with English as well, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably two other friends.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you the inspiration for that?</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t say inspiration but...</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I put the finger on them and they come.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And in fact my friend Stuart comes and he loves it.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He absolutely loves it.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any frustrations or disappointments that you find by doing volunteer work?</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> No. As I say, if I&#039;ve found any frustrations or disappointments or anything I didn&#039;t like, I just wouldn&#039;t do it.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;m retired. I&#039;ve got the luxury of choosing what I do and what I don&#039;t do.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So it is very luxurious.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any favourite memories of volunteering here that stand out?</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure I have. It doesn&#039;t occur to me at the moment but I&#039;m sure not.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> If it comes back to me I&#039;ll tell you.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one that&#039;s hard to do on the spot.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> For example, the women that came from Mosul and some women that came from Aleppo.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Another very powerful experience was when a woman came to the discussion group and she was from Syria and couldn&#039;t speak much English.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> But she told you very clearly what it was like to go through that experience.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> She made her journey with her family from Syria, a war tour zone, via Libya.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And she told us how on one occasion she was stopped at where the Czech soldiers are.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And her daughter was taken away and raped.</div><div id="00:12:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they got on a boat to come to Europe and the boat sank and two of her sons were drowned.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do you say?</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That was very memorable. Not the best memory but extremely memorable.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that volunteering here has changed you in any way?</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s enriched my life. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s changed me but I&#039;ve met some good people here and I&#039;ve become friends with a few refugees.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is really good. So I think it&#039;s built on my life. I&#039;m still the same old difficult bugger I was.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think your volunteering or even volunteering here has benefited the wider community and the people that come in here and seek help?</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The wider community? I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But the people who&#039;ve come here.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think just a friendly UK national who can speak the English language and is willing to talk.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s my guess. I think that&#039;s more than a guess.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> That is beneficial to the refugees and asylum seekers who want to learn English.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they, like everybody, if you go abroad on holiday, like to Spain, go with your friends or your family.</div><div id="00:14:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s incredible how little Spanish you&#039;ll have to speak.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You point, say por favor, dos, and that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="00:14:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But you don&#039;t have to learn. And this is the same with people here.</div><div id="00:14:32.000" class="transcript_line"> People come from Eritrea. They live together. They have their little Eritrean cafe.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And so the old bit of English. So to actually speak with a UK native speaker, I think is immense.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And so do you actually lead the ESOL classes?</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I am the helper. They tried to make me the teacher, but I refuse.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I am a very experienced helper for the teacher.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But a very bad English teacher.</div><div id="00:15:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What does helping entail?</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> What it entails is you have the teacher, the front is called Richard, very nice man.</div><div id="00:15:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And help, I ask him awkward questions.</div><div id="00:15:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I find my natural environment is to sit at the back with the African men, right?</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Who tend to be a bit, you know, keep out of the way.</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> But I encourage them to come forward.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you bring a little bit of comic relief?</div><div id="00:15:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the one, yeah, comic relief.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:15:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Thanks, can I ask you?</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> If you had to define volunteering, how would you define it?</div><div id="00:15:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t get any monetary reward.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I come along and do what I can.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s volunteering.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think I do it because I think if it&#039;s worthwhile, I think it was not worthwhile.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t bother.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Although I did, and I did do, I don&#039;t know if you want me to go on to another bit of volunteering.</div><div id="00:16:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I did some volunteering a couple years ago and it was a project, it looked brilliant.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was working with primary school kids and it was specifically shy, withdrawn primary school kids.</div><div id="00:16:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I saw the video and all these poor little children, you have to be very careful and bring them out of their shell.</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you do with that project?</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I got assigned with three other volunteers and we went to this primary school and ADHD,</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> challenging behaviour problems, I wouldn&#039;t put them down as shy little children.</div><div id="00:16:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They were full on.</div><div id="00:16:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Which primary school was it?</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can&#039;t remember the name, but it was like towards Llanrhymne here, I think Llanrhymne.</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But the kids were very challenging.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, hang on, you&#039;re a big man with a big loud voice, so take it easy.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Let the young women come forward, you know what you&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:17:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But they ran rings round us and by the time I thought, hang on, time to step forward,</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> they were already running the show.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> This is over a period of weeks.</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So in fact that wasn&#039;t a good experience.</div><div id="00:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What I&#039;d like to ask actually is if you had to give some advice or words of inspiration</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> to somebody who was interested in volunteering, what would you say?</div><div id="00:17:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, give it a go.</div><div id="00:17:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Give it a go.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean in terms of Oasis, I would say give it a go and it&#039;s immensely rewarding.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The people there, the refugees and the silent seekers are really good hearted people,</div><div id="00:18:09.000" class="transcript_line"> so give it a go.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But be boundaried because their needs are immense.</div><div id="00:18:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So you could be swallowed up.</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So you need to be careful.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And in fact I say this to my friends when they come along, you know,</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> just do, it would be very tempting to get too involved,</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s the advice I would give in this project.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you&#039;d like to add that we haven&#039;t asked to do?</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> How much do I get paid?</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a volunteer as well.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I thought it was worth a favour.</div><div id="00:18:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Get a can of four Polish lagers, strong 5%.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But thank you very much for your time.</div><div id="00:19:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
