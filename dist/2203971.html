    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I mean I just marvel at human nature and the survival instinct, you know, that despite</div><div id="00:00:06.480" class="transcript_line"> everything that people go through they still have something within them that needs them to move</div><div id="00:00:13.360" class="transcript_line"> forward, to adapt and to continue and to move on. So you know that in itself is quite impressive.</div><div id="00:00:25.280" class="transcript_line"> Well I think there&#039;s a couple of things. I mean we were lucky that Jamaat Khana was very important</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> and we had somebody from our Jamaat Khana that would come and pick us up on a Friday. And I</div><div id="00:00:39.880" class="transcript_line"> think having that link to our community, just being able to pray, I think in all of my life,</div><div id="00:00:49.960" class="transcript_line"> in all of the the biggest challenges that I&#039;ve had in my life, the opportunity to silence your</div><div id="00:00:57.760" class="transcript_line"> mind and pray with a group of people with whom you have a sense of belonging,</div><div id="00:01:08.640" class="transcript_line"> I think has been a very powerful thing for me in terms of just helping me rationalize,</div><div id="00:01:17.600" class="transcript_line"> re-energize and just think differently about certain things. I was still studying, I was still</div><div id="00:01:25.160" class="transcript_line"> only 16 but this was like the big wide world that I hadn&#039;t entered, you know, being so restricted.</div><div id="00:01:31.200" class="transcript_line"> But I was making money and I was able to, when I turned 17, pay for my own driving lessons and I</div><div id="00:01:40.560" class="transcript_line"> was able to buy my own car and that really changed the face of our lives, you know,</div><div id="00:01:47.280" class="transcript_line"> certainly for my parents because then I was able to take them very easily to community events,</div><div id="00:01:53.200" class="transcript_line"> community functions, to weddings, to other things. So now they had a much stronger sense of belonging</div><div id="00:01:59.360" class="transcript_line"> than they had before. So that was great. There was nobody to talk to. We just got on with it.</div><div id="00:02:09.880" class="transcript_line"> We had to. I think you develop a certain amount of resilience, you know, when you&#039;ve had the kind</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> of experience that our family has, you have to have a certain type of experience. You know,</div><div id="00:02:21.840" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t have people to talk to, we didn&#039;t have, you know, anybody that would put their</div><div id="00:02:27.840" class="transcript_line"> arms around us and say it&#039;s going to be all right. No, we just had to deal with it. That&#039;s what it was.</div></div></p>
