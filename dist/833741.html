    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother and father were very friendly with Peg and Dave.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were related to Peg. I think one of them was related to Peg.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, they were very friendly and lived in Odfellow Street, Peg and Dave.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Williams, Dave Williams.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he, at the time, of course they got to know Joe, obviously being intellectual as well.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And Peg was invited by Katriona to go up to the Isle of Skye.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> For a week, I&#039;m not sure how long.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, up they went and Peg said,</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, what are we doing here? Well, we&#039;re going to have a dinner tonight.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;ll meet all the krachach, she said, of the Isle of Skye.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So they sat at the table and Peg didn&#039;t say much of anything.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t know them. And Katriona started saying,</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What a wonderful bathroom Peg had.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And all mother of pearl and all. It was an exquisite bathroom.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And Peg just looked. She couldn&#039;t believe this because she didn&#039;t have a bathroom.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t have a bathroom.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Things like that happened all through.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Peg enjoyed the luxury up there. Of course, servants bringing breakfast in bed and all that.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, back they came.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And after that it was a man in a rug.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my mother used to go there regularly.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Two Pegs in Odfellow Street now, this was.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And she looked at the half rug and she said,</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit chubby, Peg. Yes, it is, Peg said.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to Swansea on Saturday and we&#039;re going to buy a new one.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother said, Oh, good. I&#039;m looking forward to that.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mother was very pleased that they were good. And she told my father, oh.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So she went back in about a week or so and called in Pegs.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, Well, seeing the old one still there, she said, Well, where is it?</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And Peg said, up there on the bookshelf. Four books.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what they&#039;d gone to town.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And Dave couldn&#039;t resist them, she said. Had to have his books.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the books are more important.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So it shows how well he spent his money.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> He spent his money wisely.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he was a wrecking weight.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I knew Peg was working for, I think, the local Labour Party.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She was writing a lot of stuff for them at the time, you know, same time.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, Dave had a job in London with the NCB.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So he accepted that. And off they went to London for a while.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure how long, but it was the time when this smog, they called it,</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> was in London. She was a killer, really.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were there because my mother and father went to, for a weekend, I think, to stay with them.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And yes, Peg and Dave were very intellectual.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember Joseph&#039;s visit to the Royal Academy?</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He was, that was late in his lifetime, really, that he was accepted by the Royal Academy and delighted, of course.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all went up for a meeting. I don&#039;t know whether Peg and Dave went, but Dave went, I think.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father passed away then, I think. So it was a bit later than that, again, 1960, more like 1970, 1980, is it?</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So a bit further on down the road.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the visit to Katriona&#039;s brother&#039;s party. He was a politician.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And Joe had to go up to this big dinner party.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s right, yes.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he came over and he said to my father, I&#039;ve been invited, Katriona and I have been invited to this political dinner.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you believe it? I didn&#039;t think much of that.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father said, oh, that&#039;s nice, Joe. What will you wear?</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, as I am, painting clothes, spattered with oil paints, trousers and everything. And I&#039;ll go as I am.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my father said, I&#039;ve got a dinner jacket you can borrow. Oh, no, no, I&#039;ll go as I am. They like me or they won&#039;t like me.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So what happened was that Katriona&#039;s brother from the yellow sky had been appointed a liberal candidate for some constituency.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was, the dinner was in his honour. So when they came back, Joe came over and, well, how did it go?</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, grand, he said, very good. Were you embarrassed at all?</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> My father thought going in compared to all these people in the evening talks.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t change his mind? He went adamant in his painting clothes?</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, he didn&#039;t. No, he went as he was. And he said, no, they were embarrassed. Not me.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I always remember that. I was there.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was very strong, strong-willed. Yes. And he was more of a, take me as who I am. He wouldn&#039;t posh.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, he wouldn&#039;t. No. He was like that. But I don&#039;t know what you&#039;d call it, really.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was, no, no, he refused everything my father could offer. Well, only a jacket he could offer him anyway.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> My father didn&#039;t go, no one did in those days very much. And no, were you embarrassed? No, they were.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> What are your memories of Joe sketching around the Strygon Lice? Was he often out with a pencil and paper sketching?</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally. Occasionally. But of course he had done that in the initial, early days, I think.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So he did that earlier on in his time in the Strygon Lice? Yes, yes. But he went further afield, of course with my father, you know.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And sketching and with friends. And I think that was his, he was more concentrating on going underground, painting the colliers underground.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father took a photograph. My father was used to going down. And I think it was on his schedule in Colliery.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a very deep mine. So he would, the lift, you know, go right down. So he took Joe there sketching the colliers underground.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d built up this friendship with them then. Yes. Yes, he liked them very much.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And as you say, he was very interested in the working man and painting him. But he got on very well with your father too.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. So he was very much involved with the family coming round every day. Yes. For Eastkick. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And your daughter Carol. Oh yes. She was small at the time. So she was a little child at the time. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was always under the table. You know the plush clothes with the fringe. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And Carol was always under the table and we had to call her out and offer her a biscuit or something before she&#039;d come.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And then Joe came in. And then he saw she put, she knew there was a different voice and different accent you see.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So she pulled up the fringe that. And then when she saw him, she was all smiles. And he was talking to her and lifting her up onto his lap then.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh nice. So he was obviously part of the family a lot then. Yes.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course I was at an awkward age was I. You know. My twenties. Yes.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he sketch, paint any of the family? No he didn&#039;t. Did he cater any of the family? Did he take any of the family out?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> No he didn&#039;t. No he didn&#039;t actually. I don&#039;t know whether Joe&#039;s. Wendy. This one. Oh that&#039;s the one is it? Yes.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes and that one. Did you still go sketching? My father sketched as well. So perhaps he thought you know it was a bit awkward.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. But he never wanted to even, any one of us really.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So the family had some sort of creative-ness about them. So obviously Joseph obviously felt a kinship with your family.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well I don&#039;t know. He was, I think he wanted a children didn&#039;t he? Very much. And the fact that he married again and had the children, I think he was very happy.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And Katriona it was some illness that really took the baby. She lost her baby, the first baby then. Well the final one for all I know.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And their parents came down and they, first of all they weren&#039;t very keen on having Joe as a son-in-law. Because he wasn&#039;t very well off you see.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But then they gradually, when Katriona lost the baby they came down, the mother and father, and they made up, do you remember seeing them? No.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see them. I think a short visit I think it was. What were the favourite places that Joe enjoyed to go to in the Stugan light? You said about the cafe and the cinema.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> What other places did he enjoy to go into? Jim&#039;s shop. Oh yes he loved Jim&#039;s shop. Who was Jim? Jim and the Skedwin Arms is here. Directly across is a little shop.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I think now they&#039;re selling pet food. Yes. And everyone liked Jim. But Jim was a real socialist you know. More of a communist really. So whether they had that in common I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t really know. Can you tell us more about that side of Stugan light? Part of Stugan light was called the Red Square. My father was a socialist. But he wasn&#039;t, I don&#039;t know, but a communist.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But I know Jim was because he used to have letters. Jim Lewis, the Kremlin, Red Square, Moscow. And he&#039;d receive the letters. And oh just a laugh in those days.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know how many were that way inclined. But socialism was big wasn&#039;t it? The Labour Party. Dialic was a communist. Oh there was yes.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Can you tell us a bit more about that? No my father was a socialist and that was it. But communism was creeping in. And there were a crowd of people who were very interested in the Russian left group you know.</div><div id="00:12:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And they went to live in the Ernest as I say a little community. I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve ever heard of it. And very small. It grew of course. And when my father came out of university that&#039;s what he set up was the ILP, Independent Labour Party.</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother made 200 red ties. Sold them for the boys who were members. And they had dances. They held dances in a hall. I think it was behind the present co-operative stores in Ustrad.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Behind there. There was a big hall. And they had dances every Wednesday I think it was. And my mother said my father couldn&#039;t dance very well. But she made all these ties for the boys. It was quite creeping in I think.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I think definitely the communist side. That&#039;s of course the ILP had been going for years in Ustrad. And the valley. When we came to live here we met a few of the boys who were members.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Was Joe still in Ustrad and Leis then? We came here in 1960. No. He just left. 58. Yes. Just left. We&#039;d have approved of that.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> What about Joan Littlewood? Oh yes. Joan Littlewood came. So many well known people came to lecture and perform in the welfare hall. Joan Littlewood was one. She had been in London.</div><div id="00:14:00.000" class="transcript_line"> She was very big. You know. Well known. I think it was the Oh What a Lovely War. That was the one. Joan Littlewood. She was very good. And she came and we were sitting in the audience expecting the curtain to open.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They came in from the side. The two little actors. They came in and we were surprised that that was a novelty really. Obviously seemed to be quite a very active place. It was. Because we had the cinema, we had the welfare hall for dances and everything. And the church hall. So we were well blest really.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So throughout the year there were events that everyone could join in with. This is a constant annual. Yes. From Christmas to Easter to parades. We had the carnival of course. The monkey parade. I&#039;d like to know more about that. My grandmother used to talk about the monkey parade.</div><div id="00:15:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a Sunday event. Can you tell me the origins of the monkey parade? No. I know that reading in the paper that there were only two towns or districts still holding a monkey parade. That was in Yorkshire. In York itself I think. York itself. And Estragonas. And Slavera rather. Slavera it was. There was nothing in Estragonas of monkey parades.</div><div id="00:15:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d go on a Sunday after church. Our chapel. And everybody over 15 or 16 would go to the wood house. The road house. The road house. And what would you do there? And we went in there and we had an ice cream each. And then chatting. And then we&#039;d start walking then down to the cinema.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boys would be waiting. And if you were lucky you would be asked to be escorted home. But if you weren&#039;t you would have to jump on the bus and penny ride home. So we always had to keep the penny in case we didn&#039;t strike lucky.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So there were boys and girls socialising in one place? Yes. After the chapel did you say? The younger generation. Oh yes. I think most of them were. Well then the war came of course. And most of them went. The boys went.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether the monkey parade. Because I was married then of course. And I don&#039;t know whether they kept on with the monkey parade after that. But it petered out anyway didn&#039;t it? Didn&#039;t last very long after that.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any going in Swansea? No funnily enough but my grandmother, my mamgie, always used to talk about the monkey parade. The Morriston monkeys. On an evening going up and down Woodfield Street. Boys on one side, girls on the other. But I believe it was like what was the called? Monkey parade.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well we did it in Pontetower. Up and down. After we went to chapel and then Rangosis, the Italian cafe. And then we&#039;d walk up one side and the boys on the other side. It was like a parade. How did you know you were meant to do that? I don&#039;t know. A tradition.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> A tradition. For years it was going. And down here it was on the parade ground where the trees are. The avenue. And Nostra Gunlas from the capital cinema to the empire cinema. Up and down. Up and down all the time. Until you decided well, let&#039;s jump on the bus and go home.</div><div id="00:18:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So you had to wait in case a young lad went to hold your hand or to walk you home. Excellent. Yes, well they were very polite and everything was nice. Different because we could afford one ice cream. My friend Esme, she wouldn&#039;t take an ice cream, she&#039;d have a cigarette.</div><div id="00:18:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And my friend Esme, she used to tell her, if you didn&#039;t smoke you could have one of these. It didn&#039;t make any difference. And she met two boys from, she thought they were from Oxford, they were from Oxford. So she thought Oxford University. Oh dear.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But it had happened that they were Cullum Training College outside Oxford. But she still carried on with this trooper, he was a Yorkshire boy, and he went to the Air Force and was killed in the Battle of Bresin in the early days of the war.</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But you had so many dances in the week, so many dances in the welfare and the church hall.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, fair and the money. Church hall is a stretch on a Wednesday, and if you could afford it, once a month perhaps down in the rink here. That was very expensive because you had to hire a car, you know, to come back, town and back.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mr Griffiths had a beautiful car, Ford, I don&#039;t know, it was a special car anyway.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a Charabont?</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, it was just a big car, you know, but a very luxurious car. And he used to charge us ninepence each to go to and down the valley.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> A bit like a taxi.</div><div id="00:20:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, that&#039;s right. So, we were so lucky to have a cinema and three dance halls if you wanted them.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And what kind of music were played at the dances?</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, modern up-to-date music. Everett Davies and his broadcasting band from Aberystwyth came down occasionally to a slavera.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;d had to pay more, of course. We couldn&#039;t always afford him. But once a year he&#039;d come for the old reunion, a slavera grammar school reunion.</div><div id="00:20:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where we all went. I think it was about two and six, or something, a ticket.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And how old would you have been then when those dances were taking place?</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> How old would have you been when you went up to the dances?</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I was 17, 18. I was married in 1941.</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a lot of fun.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Sounds like a lot of fun.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> 1941, yes. Because the dances started, that&#039;s right, it should have been 1939.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the rink was closed then. When we turned up one Saturday we&#039;d come down with Mr Griffiths in his car and there was a big notice up.</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> These premises are closed until further notice. Making them bomb proof or something.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:21:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did the Sturgenleis change with the coming of World War II?</div><div id="00:21:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the boys left, you see, the young boys. That was the trouble. And in the dances, it was very noticeable then.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There were no boys. Hardly any. Only young, too young really for us.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And then of course I was married then. And quite a few were married at the time.</div><div id="00:22:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there a change in the town? Obviously the younger men were out fighting.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there a general change of...</div><div id="00:22:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well we used to have these...what do they call them now? Oh, my memory.</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There were special...</div><div id="00:22:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Dances.</div><div id="00:22:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Efforts, yes.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, raising money, is it?</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, raising money to send parcels out to them, you know.</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to have those all through the war, really.</div><div id="00:22:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Fundraising.</div><div id="00:22:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:22:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And we never thought they&#039;d go and dream of things like that. They were always coming back.</div><div id="00:22:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, of course. And with, obviously, Joseph Kimover, the Moser.</div><div id="00:23:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Were there other emigre residents in the Sturgenleis area at all? That you knew of?</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Dr. Bullets. And there was Dr. Bullets, and he became very popular.</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And he died recently, I think, about a year ago, or two years ago.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mrs. Bullets, they ran away, actually, from Poland.</div><div id="00:23:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They came down to Italy and then came across. They had two children then.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So they lived in the Sturgenleis as well.</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And of course, Joe had to leave because of his health. That&#039;s why he left.</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Because he loved it there.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> The damp climate, is it?</div><div id="00:23:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. The climate defeated him. Well, the doctor advised him to go.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And yet, we thought he&#039;d have gone to sunnier climes, you know, like France or Italy or somewhere.</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But London they chose anyway.</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But did he go to Paris in 1946 on a trip?</div><div id="00:24:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know much about that?</div><div id="00:24:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Only that he, Katriona told us that he&#039;d left to Paris to find out about his parents.</div><div id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was then, was it? Right, it was that time.</div><div id="00:24:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that was then, yes. Sorry, yes.</div><div id="00:24:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you do taking Wendy&#039;s sketching?</div><div id="00:24:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. I used to take her, yes.</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, please tell. Please tell about that. That sounds like a lovely story.</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was very, no, she didn&#039;t want to go. And I said, well, if I come with you.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, she said, that would be all right, I think. She wasn&#039;t sure whether I&#039;d make a difference.</div><div id="00:24:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, we went round Pennebont, over the river, Pennebont, and down to Gyms and round to take scenes in the night.</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> The lights fell on horses and cabs and buses and cars.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I did one and he approved, and Wendy did that one, and I thought it was very good.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s the one, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good. And she was going to do art at all levels, you see. Then, of course, that was the time.</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So did Joseph influence Wendy&#039;s work?</div><div id="00:25:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. Oh, bigger than people and that, because he was with Roland Braud, you know, the Delbanco Gallery, and very popular.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us more about those who visited Joe at his studio?</div><div id="00:25:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so many artists, weren&#039;t there? I don&#039;t know, particularly. Only the ones I mentioned were Dr. Roland.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was another writer, and David Martin, of course, was a writer.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think lots of people who we didn&#039;t even know, you know, at some times.</div><div id="00:26:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So you sometimes get some characters coming down into the town from London and sort of made the place even more colourful than it was.</div><div id="00:26:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And Catuina&#039;s come for dishes. She didn&#039;t have dishes.</div><div id="00:26:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, when they came, that&#039;s right, she didn&#039;t have enough dishes.</div><div id="00:26:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Or it was wartime and we were all rationed.</div><div id="00:26:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And Joe came over and asked if my mother&#039;d lend him some dishes for these people who came from London.</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mother said, well, my father, it was actually, found a flask, put a towel or something, and got all her best dishes and put them in.</div><div id="00:26:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t have any. And, don&#039;t bring them back broken, she said to Joe.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Which luckily he didn&#039;t, so he was always welcome then after that.</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So Catuina was preparing a banquet, was she?</div><div id="00:27:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:27:15.000" class="transcript_line"> To impress the London art crowd.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> From London anyway.</div><div id="00:27:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m shouting, am I?</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not at all.</div><div id="00:27:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m told I shout because I&#039;m hard of hearing.</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But as Joseph has a figure around the town at that time.</div><div id="00:27:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, Joe Bach.</div><div id="00:27:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it sort of, did he come?</div><div id="00:27:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, brilliant.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he loved that.</div><div id="00:27:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He loved to be called Joe Bach.</div><div id="00:27:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he fit, when he was saved, did he fit in straight away into the house?</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he fit in straight away into the town?</div><div id="00:27:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think they did.</div><div id="00:27:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he take a while to just...</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course she was a cracker really, wasn&#039;t she, from the other sky.</div><div id="00:27:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And must have found it a bit difficult settling in to Welsh life.</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, I think I&#039;ve written about all the shops in Ustrad, most of them.</div><div id="00:28:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course he went every day to get cherries.</div><div id="00:28:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Bag of cherries.</div><div id="00:28:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Bag of cherries.</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what a pound of cherries is, I imagine.</div><div id="00:28:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was something to do with...</div><div id="00:28:23.000" class="transcript_line"> It all stemmed from something that happened in Warsaw.</div><div id="00:28:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it typhus?</div><div id="00:28:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they brought typhus in.</div><div id="00:28:34.000" class="transcript_line"> To the ghetto?</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> To the ghetto.</div><div id="00:28:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And apparently, of course, half of them died, he said, but his family survived.</div><div id="00:28:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And one day he was walking along and he&#039;d got...</div><div id="00:28:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, perhaps he didn&#039;t have the typhus.</div><div id="00:28:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It would have killed him probably, because he was quite young then, about 16.</div><div id="00:28:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was walking along and he saw this cherry on a wall.</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And he picked it up and it was so nice that he became...</div><div id="00:29:07.000" class="transcript_line"> A big fan.</div><div id="00:29:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Did Joe talk much about his past?</div><div id="00:29:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he did initially, to my mother and father, particularly.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> About his mother, particularly, he was fond of his mother.</div><div id="00:29:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He adored his mother.</div><div id="00:29:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And, yes, he was very fond of his family.</div><div id="00:29:29.000" class="transcript_line"> His heart broke when he came back.</div><div id="00:29:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But if I say the word Joseph Herman to you now,</div><div id="00:29:36.000" class="transcript_line"> What are the first things that spring to mind?</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> When I think of Joe?</div><div id="00:29:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I just see him, actually.</div><div id="00:29:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe his physique?</div><div id="00:29:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, well, he wasn&#039;t tall.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he always wore this hat, this black hat and his green cloak.</div><div id="00:29:56.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the cloak made of?</div><div id="00:29:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Harris tweed. Oh, it was. Really, yes, good.</div><div id="00:30:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Very good material.</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I remember.</div><div id="00:30:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And, of course, in summertime he didn&#039;t have the cloak.</div><div id="00:30:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He just came in this little waistcoat thing.</div><div id="00:30:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Brown waistcoat. I remember brown.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And a shirt.</div><div id="00:30:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Sort of a check shirt.</div><div id="00:30:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And corduroy trousers.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Always corduroy trousers.</div><div id="00:30:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Not very clean sometimes. Full of paint.</div><div id="00:30:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother said, I wish he&#039;d wash his trousers.</div><div id="00:30:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish he&#039;d have them cleaned.</div><div id="00:30:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And my father said, yes, but think of the good work he&#039;s turning out.</div><div id="00:30:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:30:41.000" class="transcript_line"> This was just about...</div><div id="00:30:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So Joseph was still around, still in Minister Gernice?</div><div id="00:30:45.000" class="transcript_line"> No, this was when in the camera club.</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came up to me one night in the camera club.</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there. I attended as often as I could because I was keen on photography.</div><div id="00:30:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And my jaw came in and he went right up to me, this finger, and he put it right there.</div><div id="00:31:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He said you were pregnant.</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know. You know, you get embarrassed.</div><div id="00:31:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I hope nobody had heard.</div><div id="00:31:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went home and a few days later I found I was.</div><div id="00:31:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I spoke to Mr. Richards, the chemist, about it.</div><div id="00:31:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, yes, because this, when you&#039;re pregnant, this vein becomes enlarged.</div><div id="00:31:21.000" class="transcript_line"> The vein in the eye.</div><div id="00:31:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t know that, of course.</div><div id="00:31:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the jaw did. No, I don&#039;t think, perhaps he didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:31:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He just had that... Instinct. Yes.</div><div id="00:31:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So did he always, did he smoke? Did he smoke a pipe?</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t remember him smoking at all.</div><div id="00:31:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think he did, no.</div><div id="00:31:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And his outfits were always quite simple, but the best, if you had the Harris tweed.</div><div id="00:31:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:31:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, Katriona probably bought it because she bought eight of his paintings, didn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:31:53.000" class="transcript_line"> To help him, of course, you know.</div><div id="00:31:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:31:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they were well suited, but then something happened and they had to go away.</div><div id="00:32:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And she fell ill, I think, and went home.</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> What was their home like, the studio?</div><div id="00:32:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember what it looked like inside, where he worked?</div><div id="00:32:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, where he worked.</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was, his easel was there, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:32:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had this big easel and he had the small ones, you know, and all the paint work.</div><div id="00:32:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a bit messy, actually.</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> If you were house proud, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d put up with it.</div><div id="00:32:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But then he turned out such lovely work, everyone appreciated that.</div><div id="00:32:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was asked to lecture here and there, you know.</div><div id="00:32:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Did he lecture at Estragon Nice?</div><div id="00:32:44.000" class="transcript_line"> In, well, the Cameraclub first, of course, and then the welfare hall and the church hall.</div><div id="00:32:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He gave a lecture there, a few lectures.</div><div id="00:32:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think were they popular lectures?</div><div id="00:32:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, they were all, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:32:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And what were the lectures about?</div><div id="00:33:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh, well, about his work.</div><div id="00:33:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And if he was painting something at the time, he&#039;d talk about that.</div><div id="00:33:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d ask questions then, what kind of paint he does and brushes and all that.</div><div id="00:33:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to one in the welfare.</div><div id="00:33:17.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, oh, very well supported, that one.</div><div id="00:33:21.000" class="transcript_line"> There must have been about 40 people there.</div><div id="00:33:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was a lot going on at the time.</div></div></p>
