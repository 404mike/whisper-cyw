I just remember doing the carnival.</div><div id="00:01:09.440" class="transcript_line"> So my first carnival that I participated in,</div><div id="00:01:15.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember what costume I was wearing.</div><div id="00:01:20.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t, I just remember that the route used to be from,</div><div id="00:01:24.240" class="transcript_line"> is it the Cattays Community Centre? And so I remember the Cattays Community Centre</div><div id="00:01:29.200" class="transcript_line"> and I remember what it used to look like inside</div><div id="00:01:31.040" class="transcript_line"> and you know, it&#039;d have all these crazy big</div><div id="00:01:34.320" class="transcript_line"> structures hanging up from the ceiling and there&#039;d be music playing outside,</div><div id="00:01:38.880" class="transcript_line"> drumming and I just remember it was really weird. I thought it was weird when</div><div id="00:01:43.520" class="transcript_line"> I first went there. I just thought there&#039;s nothing I&#039;ve ever seen like this</div><div id="00:01:46.720" class="transcript_line"> before in my whole life and literally every shade and size and</div><div id="00:01:52.400" class="transcript_line"> personality range of people all together in one building and I thought</div><div id="00:01:57.280" class="transcript_line"> this is bizarre. And yeah, it was amazing actually</div><div id="00:02:02.720" class="transcript_line"> because when you&#039;re so young and then you just see all these different types of</div><div id="00:02:05.680" class="transcript_line"> characters and people and all these different costumes and</div><div id="00:02:08.800" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s all these different bright colours</div><div id="00:02:10.960" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s people making costumes, there&#039;s people putting on costumes and</div><div id="00:02:14.720" class="transcript_line"> trying on costumes, there&#039;s also music and people drumming and people</div><div id="00:02:20.560" class="transcript_line"> trying things outside. It&#039;s a lot to take in for a child I</div><div id="00:02:25.120" class="transcript_line"> think and I remember from maybe a few years down the line</div><div id="00:02:31.040" class="transcript_line"> I went with a friend, obviously still with my mum</div><div id="00:02:34.640" class="transcript_line"> because I was probably what maybe eight or nine years old and I took a friend</div><div id="00:02:38.560" class="transcript_line"> and my friend freaked out and that&#039;s when I realised, okay this is not</div><div id="00:02:44.080" class="transcript_line"> not everyone can handle this. This is powerful juju.</div><div id="00:02:48.480" class="transcript_line"> And I think because of my upbringing, because of my mum being an</div><div id="00:02:51.840" class="transcript_line"> artist and my mum being a dancer and also my father being a dancer</div><div id="00:02:55.600" class="transcript_line"> and we traveled a lot and being familiar with</div><div id="00:03:00.640" class="transcript_line"> street art and dance and music and costumes and crazy people in general.</div><div id="00:03:07.040" class="transcript_line"> My mum used to have been taken around when she was</div><div id="00:03:09.840" class="transcript_line"> performing and would be in the dressing room</div><div id="00:03:11.920" class="transcript_line"> and artists are weird people, they&#039;re crazy</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> and so that is something that I was used to and I guess my friend</div><div id="00:03:18.880" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t used to that kind of stuff and</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess for a child as well if you&#039;ve got people on stilts</div><div id="00:03:25.680" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re in crazy costumes and they&#039;re literally like</div><div id="00:03:29.760" class="transcript_line"> 12 feet above adult size that&#039;s pretty scary and so for me</div><div id="00:03:38.240" class="transcript_line"> seeing my friend freak out was like a big sort of like wake-up call</div><div id="00:03:43.040" class="transcript_line"> I thought oh okay I get it now. Not everybody spends the summer this way.</div><div id="00:03:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah and so for quite a few years I think</div><div id="00:03:55.360" class="transcript_line"> we did the carnival and I remember one particular year more than any of the</div><div id="00:04:00.880" class="transcript_line"> others because it seems to be at that age it was a bit of a blur it was just</div><div id="00:04:03.840" class="transcript_line"> like oh I did carnival but it was one blur of a few years mixed together but</div><div id="00:04:08.640" class="transcript_line"> I do remember one particular year and it was the year that it rained</div><div id="00:04:12.240" class="transcript_line"> and we got massive like publicity as well because it rained and</div><div id="00:04:16.400" class="transcript_line"> like costumes being adapted on the day and I remember particularly our costume</div><div id="00:04:23.440" class="transcript_line"> that was supposed to look one way and then we ended up completely changing it</div><div id="00:04:27.920" class="transcript_line"> because there was something I think it was a plasticky fabric I</div><div id="00:04:31.680" class="transcript_line"> can&#039;t remember what the fabric was but it was plastic</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was supposed to be on the body wrapped somewhere on the body we ended</div><div id="00:04:38.640" class="transcript_line"> up using that material and wrapping it on our heads and we ended up looking</div><div id="00:04:42.160" class="transcript_line"> sweeties and I remember just looking like sweet rappers and the reason why we did</div><div id="00:04:46.640" class="transcript_line"> that is so that we would not get wet but it actually ended up looking really good</div><div id="00:04:51.120" class="transcript_line"> and yeah and then I remember also another time was when it was the night</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> carnival and we finished by the museum and it was like I don&#039;t know what time it</div><div id="00:05:04.560" class="transcript_line"> was but I just remember being like oh my god I&#039;m supposed to be in bed and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:08.800" class="transcript_line"> like really really really late and I&#039;ve never been out this late before</div><div id="00:05:13.920" class="transcript_line"> and they had all these like amazing costumes and some of them had like</div><div id="00:05:18.400" class="transcript_line"> lights on them as well for the feature of the fact that it was in the evening</div><div id="00:05:21.680" class="transcript_line"> and I just remember one particular set of costumes that stood out for me that I&#039;ll</div><div id="00:05:27.280" class="transcript_line"> never forget was the skeleton costumes because they looked amazing they were</div><div id="00:05:32.800" class="transcript_line"> basically body suits with imagery of skeletons but then they were like glowing lights on them</div><div id="00:05:40.720" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know if it was neon glow in the dark or if it were actually else</div><div id="00:05:46.720" class="transcript_line"> led lights yeah and so yeah that image in my head will always be like a classic</div><div id="00:05:54.720" class="transcript_line"> carnival years memories that&#039;s one that comes straight to my mind and also just</div><div id="00:06:00.400" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s a spectacular thing to see like on the the the framing of the museum staircase</div><div id="00:06:06.640" class="transcript_line"> and having live percussion like on the stairs and then the actual costumes on the top part</div><div id="00:06:13.680" class="transcript_line"> of the entrance and you&#039;re just standing there from a distance and you&#039;re looking at it and</div><div id="00:06:17.760" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re just thinking wow like that just looks amazing and obviously I was in the con I was in</div><div id="00:06:23.600" class="transcript_line"> the procession but then that that final kind of finish up it is it is spectacular that you</div><div id="00:06:31.120" class="transcript_line"> kind of forget you&#039;re in the procession yourself and you&#039;re just like oh my god and I think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:37.040" class="transcript_line"> probably a lot of the times I don&#039;t remember what I was wearing actually if you&#039;d asked me oh what</div><div id="00:06:42.400" class="transcript_line"> what you know what did you wear each year you know when you&#039;re that age I don&#039;t have a clue</div><div id="00:06:46.800" class="transcript_line"> because I think I was always so fascinated by all the other costumes around me that I&#039;ve totally</div><div id="00:06:52.480" class="transcript_line"> forgot what I was wearing and then yeah and then I didn&#039;t I stopped going I think and it was probably</div><div id="00:06:58.960" class="transcript_line"> to do with you know school projects and getting you know school became more academic and was doing</div><div id="00:07:06.160" class="transcript_line"> more projects you know outside of school and after school dance and things like that that</div><div id="00:07:12.320" class="transcript_line"> probably didn&#039;t go for maybe a few years and probably as well because I went away during that</div><div id="00:07:18.320" class="transcript_line"> time was a summer period like you do go on holiday but I think then when I came back</div><div id="00:07:25.840" class="transcript_line"> the carnival had moved to the pavilion in Butetown and that was again very very different</div><div id="00:07:36.640" class="transcript_line"> it was almost like a totally separate carnival to the first few ones that I&#039;d been to when I was younger</div><div id="00:07:43.360" class="transcript_line"> and I think as well it was different because that time my mum was then working in it and she</div><div id="00:07:50.080" class="transcript_line"> was teaching dance and it used to be with Jane Bellamy and my mum and then I remember that being</div><div id="00:07:59.440" class="transcript_line"> very different again I think it changes a lot depending who&#039;s running you know the classes</div><div id="00:08:04.560" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s running the music sessions you know who&#039;s leading the creative sector of it it changes</div><div id="00:08:14.240" class="transcript_line"> because each person has their personality and how they run things it&#039;s very different and I think</div><div id="00:08:19.840" class="transcript_line"> that also affects everything else so it gives a totally different vibe and so each person that</div><div id="00:08:27.440" class="transcript_line"> then is working on the carnival gives something different to the next person and the next person</div><div id="00:08:33.920" class="transcript_line"> the next person that comes and that&#039;s what I really like actually about the journey that</div><div id="00:08:38.560" class="transcript_line"> carnival&#039;s gone through is that we&#039;ve seen all the different shades and colours of what people bring</div><div id="00:08:46.480" class="transcript_line"> to the process of being involved in carnival and so yeah I think when it&#039;s the first year or so or</div><div id="00:08:54.240" class="transcript_line"> the first few years I remember one of my costumes very very specifically because I remember rehearsing</div><div id="00:09:03.520" class="transcript_line"> so much for the dance and I think it was probably also to do the fact that I had been doing dance</div><div id="00:09:08.560" class="transcript_line"> outside of school and that you know that at that point in my life I was kind of getting more</div><div id="00:09:12.800" class="transcript_line"> involved in dance I was a little bit older I was probably what was 11 no probably 9 10 that age</div><div id="00:09:20.160" class="transcript_line"> and it was the costume was like skyscrapers like building basically a building doesn&#039;t sound</div><div id="00:09:29.520" class="transcript_line"> amazing now I&#039;m saying it but it was amazing it was like a backpack it was the first time that I</div><div id="00:09:33.360" class="transcript_line"> was wearing a backpack and it was a children&#039;s backpack so it wasn&#039;t huge but obviously when</div><div id="00:09:38.960" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re that age and you&#039;ve never worn a backpack before it is huge to you and you&#039;re like oh my</div><div id="00:09:43.920" class="transcript_line"> god it&#039;s heavy and how are we going to dance with this you know and then you look back at the photos</div><div id="00:09:49.040" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re like oh that was nothing what am I talking about but yeah it was it was a new</div><div id="00:09:53.920" class="transcript_line"> experience for me because it&#039;s dancing with a backpack is very different to just you know</div><div id="00:09:59.360" class="transcript_line"> freestyling on the street and doing what the hell you like and doing cartwheels and running up and</div><div id="00:10:02.640" class="transcript_line"> down the road you can&#039;t really do that when you&#039;ve got a backpack and likewise you can&#039;t really just</div><div id="00:10:07.120" class="transcript_line"> be bumping into any old person because you&#039;ve got to be spatially aware and so the choreography</div><div id="00:10:13.600" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;ve learnt it was all about you know being aware of each other because you know you&#039;re in a</div><div id="00:10:19.200" class="transcript_line"> group and and there&#039;s probably about 10 people with the same backpack so when you&#039;re doing turns</div><div id="00:10:24.720" class="transcript_line"> and things like that and you&#039;re traveling to the side to stay in line with the people next to you</div><div id="00:10:28.800" class="transcript_line"> and so there&#039;s all these kind of skills that I was learning and it&#039;s not really skills that you</div><div id="00:10:34.960" class="transcript_line"> would learn in the dance class because you don&#039;t wear backpacks like how often in your life do you</div><div id="00:10:40.480" class="transcript_line"> say yeah I wear a backpack yeah so it&#039;s very specific to carnival experience and yeah I just</div><div id="00:10:49.920" class="transcript_line"> remember loving it like that particular year I really really enjoyed because it felt</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> so full on I just remember Monday to Friday every day there was a session maybe it was an hour</div><div id="00:11:05.520" class="transcript_line"> or two hours with a break in between and you&#039;d have your dance class and it was very structured</div><div id="00:11:12.160" class="transcript_line"> so you know most of the day you&#039;re kind of here and there kind of creating bits and bobs here</div><div id="00:11:16.720" class="transcript_line"> and there helping out you come and go but then there&#039;s a set hour that you know okay now we&#039;re</div><div id="00:11:22.720" class="transcript_line"> going to do some dancing and what&#039;s nice is that gradually throughout the weeks you start to see</div><div id="00:11:28.800" class="transcript_line"> the costumes come together and you might you know in one rehearsal you might think oh now the hats</div><div id="00:11:34.320" class="transcript_line"> are finished so we can dance with the hats you know and that&#039;s really exciting because it&#039;s like</div><div id="00:11:38.560" class="transcript_line"> oh the costume&#039;s almost ready and then you know the last week you can actually practice with the</div><div id="00:11:43.920" class="transcript_line"> backpacks and you realize oh I&#039;ve been doing the turns and leg kicks like this but now we can&#039;t do</div><div id="00:11:48.960" class="transcript_line"> it like that because it&#039;s totally different when you&#039;ve got a backpack and you know I can&#039;t do this</div><div id="00:11:52.960" class="transcript_line"> crazy whip that I was doing before now I&#039;ve got to be a little bit more agile and make sure they</div><div id="00:11:57.200" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t bump into the person next to me and so there&#039;s all these things that the process that</div><div id="00:12:01.120" class="transcript_line"> you go through from the first week to the second week to the third week is very different and</div><div id="00:12:07.920" class="transcript_line"> so that was that was the first maybe it could have been the second year maybe of being at the</div><div id="00:12:14.640" class="transcript_line"> pavilion and I remember a lot about being in the pavilion because the space the environment was</div><div id="00:12:22.240" class="transcript_line"> very different you had like field in the back where you could always go out and practice dancing</div><div id="00:12:28.640" class="transcript_line"> outside which I don&#039;t remember doing so much at Cattay&#039;s and I think that&#039;s just because it was</div><div id="00:12:34.720" class="transcript_line"> the main road right outside the building so that was different having space where you could actually</div><div id="00:12:41.360" class="transcript_line"> freely go out whenever you wanted and go over some dancing and there would be classes music</div><div id="00:12:48.560" class="transcript_line"> classes percussion that sometimes they would be in the room upstairs or sometimes they would be</div><div id="00:12:52.480" class="transcript_line"> outside depending on the weather and I think that really changes it completely because it</div><div id="00:12:57.760" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s more related and suited to the actual day of the carnival because that is outdoors that is on</div><div id="00:13:04.400" class="transcript_line"> the road and you do have to travel and move forwards progressively it&#039;s not just you know</div><div id="00:13:10.960" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re dancing you&#039;re not just on the spot you are constantly moving forwards and so I think</div><div id="00:13:17.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s one thing you notice and I think a lot of people notice and it&#039;s one thing people talk about</div><div id="00:13:24.160" class="transcript_line"> is when you&#039;re learning things even for the musicians when you&#039;re drumming it suddenly becomes</div><div id="00:13:30.480" class="transcript_line"> a totally different world when you&#039;ve got to coordinate your hands and your legs at the same</div><div id="00:13:34.640" class="transcript_line"> time and you&#039;re thinking oh my god like this is just totally different I don&#039;t even think I can</div><div id="00:13:39.760" class="transcript_line"> do this but somehow you get there in the end you know because when you&#039;re practicing you&#039;re</div><div id="00:13:44.560" class="transcript_line"> sitting down or you&#039;re just standing still but then the day of the carnival you&#039;re actually</div><div id="00:13:48.320" class="transcript_line"> expected to walk for maybe 40 minutes you know and drumming continuously and obviously there are</div><div id="00:13:55.120" class="transcript_line"> breaks and stops here and there but generally speaking it&#039;s a very different process and so</div><div id="00:14:01.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think it&#039;s the same with the dance that&#039;s something that you know is always exciting because</div><div id="00:14:07.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a challenge and it&#039;s and the other thing that&#039;s exciting is the element of surprise because</div><div id="00:14:14.320" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t actually predict what the day of the carnival is going to be like you can&#039;t predict</div><div id="00:14:19.360" class="transcript_line"> how your costume is going to be you can&#039;t predict you know how certain you know crowds at certain</div><div id="00:14:28.080" class="transcript_line"> points that you arrive are going to shock you or surprise you or put you off or you know the roads</div><div id="00:14:32.960" class="transcript_line"> are going to be really narrow at one point and then they&#039;re going to be really broad at another</div><div id="00:14:36.400" class="transcript_line"> point and how you respond to all those changes as you&#039;re going along is all about being in</div><div id="00:14:44.480" class="transcript_line"> in the mood like not in the mood but in the state of mind and staying in that place of</div><div id="00:14:51.600" class="transcript_line"> complete commitment to just enjoying carnival like you have to just go with it and I think it&#039;s</div><div id="00:15:00.320" class="transcript_line"> probably not suited to people who like to know how things are going to go because you know that&#039;s why</div><div id="00:15:05.760" class="transcript_line"> maybe sometimes people do get a bit pissed off during carnival because they think oh well you</div><div id="00:15:09.760" class="transcript_line"> know I can&#039;t dance now because the road&#039;s narrow and you know and they get a bit stressed and</div><div id="00:15:14.800" class="transcript_line"> you know it&#039;s like listen you just got to go with that yeah you got to brush it off it&#039;s all part</div><div id="00:15:19.360" class="transcript_line"> of the experience but I think for me growing up and being young and going through it from a young</div><div id="00:15:27.600" class="transcript_line"> age and till I&#039;m the age that I am now I&#039;ve been able to kind of adapt and understand all those</div><div id="00:15:36.320" class="transcript_line"> processes and the experiences that I&#039;ve had have taught me lots of different things you know when</div><div id="00:15:43.280" class="transcript_line"> there was a year that I kind of put a lot of I think I was probably maybe 14, 15 I put a lot of</div><div id="00:15:50.640" class="transcript_line"> effort into not that I hadn&#039;t previously but this particular year I put a lot of effort into my own</div><div id="00:15:55.920" class="transcript_line"> costume because I think previously you kind of sometimes you don&#039;t know what costume you&#039;re</div><div id="00:16:01.760" class="transcript_line"> going to wear until the last week but you&#039;re still there helping out and it was this year that I knew</div><div id="00:16:07.840" class="transcript_line"> I was like right this is a costume I&#039;m going to have and I&#039;m going to make sure that mine&#039;s the</div><div id="00:16:12.480" class="transcript_line"> best and you know I&#039;m going to spend every day like putting all my sequins on it and blah blah blah</div><div id="00:16:18.880" class="transcript_line"> and you have a particular expectation or particular view of how it&#039;s going to turn out</div><div id="00:16:28.160" class="transcript_line"> and how it&#039;s going to look on you even though you haven&#039;t even tried it out yet because you&#039;re still</div><div id="00:16:31.520" class="transcript_line"> putting it together but you&#039;re still like oh it&#039;s yeah it&#039;s going to look like this and it&#039;s going</div><div id="00:16:34.960" class="transcript_line"> to fit like this and this is how it&#039;s going to go and then the last week comes and you&#039;re thinking</div><div id="00:16:39.600" class="transcript_line"> oh my god it&#039;s not it&#039;s not actually coming together how I wanted it to and it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:16:43.360" class="transcript_line"> fitting on me how I wanted it to I wanted to be a little bit shorter here and a little bit longer</div><div id="00:16:47.200" class="transcript_line"> there and you know and the hat is falling every time I dance it&#039;s falling down drooping over my</div><div id="00:16:52.720" class="transcript_line"> face and you know and all these things are part of the experience but you know when you&#039;re just</div><div id="00:16:58.720" class="transcript_line"> realizing those things it becomes a bit of a stressy moment and you&#039;re thinking ah no it was</div><div id="00:17:04.880" class="transcript_line"> supposed to be perfect and I think when you hold on to those things that&#039;s when you have a difficult</div><div id="00:17:11.840" class="transcript_line"> time because that was probably one of the years I did was very frustrated because you know obviously</div><div id="00:17:19.360" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re going to be dancing and and walking for 40 minutes your costume isn&#039;t going to stay sitting</div><div id="00:17:25.200" class="transcript_line"> perfectly on you for the whole time and I think people who don&#039;t know about carnival who are not</div><div id="00:17:30.800" class="transcript_line"> experienced they don&#039;t know these things and you know sometimes it sounds silly because you you you</div><div id="00:17:37.760" class="transcript_line"> kind of after the experience you think oh my god I was so stupid like why did I think that was</div><div id="00:17:42.160" class="transcript_line"> going to be like that obviously not you know and the same when you&#039;re designing a backpack you know</div><div id="00:17:49.280" class="transcript_line"> you have an idea or you have an image of yeah it&#039;s going to look like this and it&#039;s going to fit like</div><div id="00:17:53.760" class="transcript_line"> that but when it comes to actually the logic of it and you know how much weight you&#039;ve got on the</div><div id="00:17:58.640" class="transcript_line"> left and how much weight you&#039;ve got on the right and how structurally how equal and how balanced it</div><div id="00:18:03.840" class="transcript_line"> is if it&#039;s a if it&#039;s a shape that you think oh my god it&#039;s a really unique shape it&#039;s going to look</div><div id="00:18:09.120" class="transcript_line"> really interesting but the actual statistics of it is that there&#039;s more weight on the left than</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> there is on the right obviously after 20 minutes of walking with more weight on the left and the</div><div id="00:18:18.720" class="transcript_line"> right you&#039;re obviously going to have a backache when the breeze comes it&#039;s obviously going to</div><div id="00:18:22.560" class="transcript_line"> you know trip you up and make you fall to one side than the other and you&#039;re going to really</div><div id="00:18:26.320" class="transcript_line"> struggle with it and you know the kind of knowledge that I have now I can apply that and I can at least</div><div id="00:18:33.520" class="transcript_line"> know that okay yes this year I&#039;m being ambitious and this year yeah I&#039;m going to have a really bad</div><div id="00:18:38.640" class="transcript_line"> left side of my back but I want to create this shape and this is you know the costume that I</div><div id="00:18:44.480" class="transcript_line"> want to make or I would ideally like to wear this costume but I&#039;m aware that it&#039;s going to be tricky</div><div id="00:18:52.400" class="transcript_line"> or I&#039;m aware that yeah it&#039;s not going to be that easy or that comfortable to wear but when you&#039;re</div><div id="00:18:57.440" class="transcript_line"> younger you don&#039;t know all these things and so there have been you know a year one one year here</div><div id="00:19:04.880" class="transcript_line"> one year there like in the summer where it hasn&#039;t been that great or I haven&#039;t enjoyed it because</div><div id="00:19:11.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had those expectations and I haven&#039;t achieved those expectations because I didn&#039;t think it</div><div id="00:19:17.040" class="transcript_line"> through properly and you know there&#039;s been I remember that that the year that I&#039;m talking</div><div id="00:19:22.080" class="transcript_line"> about was it was a skirt a samba skirt that I had and the beads just fell off because the way I&#039;d</div><div id="00:19:28.800" class="transcript_line"> made it you know it wasn&#039;t made with the knowledge that you know maybe someone who&#039;s done it a few</div><div id="00:19:38.560" class="transcript_line"> years who&#039;s been making samba style costume because there&#039;s lots of different styles of</div><div id="00:19:43.840" class="transcript_line"> costumes you can make there&#039;s lots of different ways of making skirts or making trousers or making</div><div id="00:19:50.080" class="transcript_line"> tops and this this style that I was going for you know the way that you would make it</div><div id="00:19:57.760" class="transcript_line"> you know it wasn&#039;t the approach that I was going for it was more of a visual so I was looking at</div><div id="00:20:03.680" class="transcript_line"> it thinking this is going to look good but I wasn&#039;t actually aware of how it&#039;s made how is</div><div id="00:20:08.720" class="transcript_line"> that going to last what&#039;s the durability of it and I think that&#039;s something when you have experience</div><div id="00:20:13.920" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s all all those kind of elements have to take place when you make a costume you have to</div><div id="00:20:19.440" class="transcript_line"> think about is it is it durable more longer than 30 minutes longer than 40 minutes is going to last</div><div id="00:20:24.800" class="transcript_line"> is it going to last rain is it going to last wind is it going to last through dancing because some</div><div id="00:20:30.240" class="transcript_line"> costumes you can wear if you&#039;re just walking but if you start dancing in it it starts to slowly</div><div id="00:20:34.320" class="transcript_line"> fall apart you know and so that&#039;s another thing you have to bear in mind and I guess as well if</div><div id="00:20:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I was making costume purely for myself one of the things that I have to take into consideration</div><div id="00:20:45.840" class="transcript_line"> which maybe not everyone else does but because I know that I dance my pants off when the carnival</div><div id="00:20:51.360" class="transcript_line"> comes I know that I literally go all out 100% I don&#039;t hold back and so for me I have to consider</div><div id="00:21:03.280" class="transcript_line"> I have to do a little test run I have to put the costume on and literally jump around like crazy</div><div id="00:21:07.760" class="transcript_line"> and be like okay is it going to fall off because this is probably what I&#039;ll do on the day of the</div><div id="00:21:11.200" class="transcript_line"> carnival you know when the music starts playing and when you know the whistles start blowing</div><div id="00:21:15.360" class="transcript_line"> everyone&#039;s there and the energy really rises I&#039;m not going to be like oh yeah just doing a sidestep</div><div id="00:21:21.360" class="transcript_line"> you know in a few turns here no I&#039;m going crazy so I need to make sure that my costume is going</div><div id="00:21:25.680" class="transcript_line"> to be able to last my dancing and so yeah I guess over the years these are things that I&#039;ve come to</div><div id="00:21:32.880" class="transcript_line"> learn and it&#039;s been really good for me because it&#039;s things that I can apply to other things as</div><div id="00:21:40.880" class="transcript_line"> well I think carnival has taught me a lot of skills a lot of teamwork skills a lot of creative</div><div id="00:21:50.080" class="transcript_line"> skills you know working with different materials and also teaching skills because even when I wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:59.040" class="transcript_line"> you know part of the team even when I wasn&#039;t working even when I was just a child and I was</div><div id="00:22:02.880" class="transcript_line"> just participating or as a teenager whatever you know you&#039;re still having to to work with a group</div><div id="00:22:08.640" class="transcript_line"> of people and you&#039;re still having to dance with a group of people and sometimes you have to help</div><div id="00:22:13.600" class="transcript_line"> each other out because you some people can&#039;t make every day some people can only make once a week</div><div id="00:22:20.080" class="transcript_line"> and you want to make sure that you look great as a group when the day the carnival comes so it&#039;s</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> also about helping each other out and you know if that person only comes on a Tuesday and you know</div><div id="00:22:31.360" class="transcript_line"> that oh she&#039;s only going to come next Tuesday well that next Tuesday I&#039;m going to make sure</div><div id="00:22:35.040" class="transcript_line"> that even though the teacher&#039;s delivering the exercises and delivering the the steps</div><div id="00:22:40.640" class="transcript_line"> but you&#039;re also there to help that person as well and if you know that you can contribute and you</div><div id="00:22:44.560" class="transcript_line"> know that oh well I know how to break this step down you know it goes like this and blah blah blah</div><div id="00:22:49.120" class="transcript_line"> and in it you know likewise if you know that you&#039;re going to see that person outside of carnival and</div><div id="00:22:53.520" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re not you might see them in town or you know that you&#039;re it&#039;s one of your friends and you&#039;re</div><div id="00:22:57.760" class="transcript_line"> going to meet them on the weekend to have a cup of tea or whatever you know you&#039;re still going to make</div><div id="00:23:02.640" class="transcript_line"> that effort to to talk about well you know carnival&#039;s next weekend so let&#039;s try and go</div><div id="00:23:08.560" class="transcript_line"> over it really quickly and you know get it together and it&#039;s all about teamwork even if you&#039;re not</div><div id="00:23:15.280" class="transcript_line"> part of even if you&#039;re not a professional working for the carnival and you&#039;re still just a member</div><div id="00:23:21.520" class="transcript_line"> of public and I think that&#039;s what&#039;s really nice as well being on the other side when I have been</div><div id="00:23:28.080" class="transcript_line"> working as a professional in the carnival and you see the members of public working together as a</div><div id="00:23:33.040" class="transcript_line"> team and you see you know members of public who you know they may not have great experience in</div><div id="00:23:38.640" class="transcript_line"> in artistry or or you know making things and crafting but they still are able to help each</div><div id="00:23:45.760" class="transcript_line"> other and oh well you know I was using a biro pen to stick the sequins down you know because that</div><div id="00:23:51.040" class="transcript_line"> you know helps to make sure I don&#039;t burn my fingers and to someone who&#039;s never used a</div><div id="00:23:54.640" class="transcript_line"> glue gun before and they&#039;ve just burnt themselves and it&#039;s like you know all these little they might</div><div id="00:23:58.640" class="transcript_line"> sound silly but they are still tricks to the trade and you know little things that help when you&#039;re</div><div id="00:24:04.480" class="transcript_line"> making things and and especially when you see children doing that and they you know the way</div><div id="00:24:11.600" class="transcript_line"> that children communicate is really fascinating because they always talk like they&#039;re little</div><div id="00:24:15.200" class="transcript_line"> adults you know but then you&#039;re looking at them you know oh they&#039;re so cute and she&#039;s like oh yes</div><div id="00:24:20.480" class="transcript_line"> well you know you have to make sure that when you&#039;re stapling it you know that you do you hold it</div><div id="00:24:24.320" class="transcript_line"> here and you know and it&#039;s just so cute because it it&#039;s really a very positive environment and</div><div id="00:24:33.680" class="transcript_line"> you see a lot of people change over the you know even though it&#039;s only three weeks and it&#039;s not</div><div id="00:24:38.480" class="transcript_line"> that long you see a lot of people change over those three weeks and especially people who&#039;ve never</div><div id="00:24:44.080" class="transcript_line"> been before and you know they might have come the first week and they&#039;re very unsure and they&#039;re not</div><div id="00:24:50.320" class="transcript_line"> you know they&#039;re doubtful of whether they want to do it or not and they don&#039;t really ask questions</div><div id="00:24:57.200" class="transcript_line"> because they don&#039;t really they don&#039;t want to bother you and but they still don&#039;t know what they&#039;re</div><div id="00:25:01.520" class="transcript_line"> doing how to make you know what what are they cutting out they don&#039;t know how to do it but</div><div id="00:25:05.200" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re sitting there and you know that oh they&#039;re a bit unsure so you go and talk to them and you</div><div id="00:25:08.880" class="transcript_line"> encourage them and you say oh you know don&#039;t worry you can do this and you have your 10 minute break</div><div id="00:25:13.520" class="transcript_line"> and you can come back whenever you want and blah blah blah and gradually then the second week they</div><div id="00:25:17.920" class="transcript_line"> come back and they&#039;re a bit more familiar and they they actually know what they&#039;re doing so that</div><div id="00:25:21.600" class="transcript_line"> you see them kind of going up and getting their own things and you know they&#039;re a little bit more</div><div id="00:25:25.760" class="transcript_line"> confident and then they do come up and ask you know oh i wanted to do this but i was thinking</div><div id="00:25:29.920" class="transcript_line"> this might look better and and you start to see that they then offer their own opinions of you</div><div id="00:25:34.720" class="transcript_line"> know how they want to make the costume and that&#039;s also nice as well because some people come up with</div><div id="00:25:38.800" class="transcript_line"> really good ideas and they commit themselves to those ideas as well which is really nice</div><div id="00:25:45.040" class="transcript_line"> to see sometimes when someone comes and they actually end up making their own their own</div><div id="00:25:52.880" class="transcript_line"> costume and you know it&#039;s all great when someone&#039;s all talk but you sometimes you just don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:25:59.120" class="transcript_line"> because you don&#039;t know that person you don&#039;t know if they&#039;ve got experience you don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:26:03.200" class="transcript_line"> how often they&#039;ve done things like this so sometimes someone come and go oh yeah yeah i&#039;m</div><div id="00:26:07.280" class="transcript_line"> gonna make this costume i&#039;m gonna do this and blah blah and you&#039;re kind of nodding your head</div><div id="00:26:10.800" class="transcript_line"> yes okay okay let&#039;s see you know but it&#039;s really nice when you get to the last week and that person</div><div id="00:26:17.200" class="transcript_line"> has actually achieved that and you go oh my god like it&#039;s not that i wasn&#039;t expecting much of you</div><div id="00:26:22.400" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s that actually you&#039;ve gone on your own journey and you&#039;ve given yourself your own</div><div id="00:26:30.400" class="transcript_line"> goals and achievements and you&#039;ve structured your time and you&#039;ve been organized with it and</div><div id="00:26:37.280" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s really really important i think when you see people do that because it also it it lets other</div><div id="00:26:45.040" class="transcript_line"> people see that as well because other people kind of go oh but she made that costume herself wow and</div><div id="00:26:51.680" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve seen all the hard work that that person&#039;s put into it and it makes them think and they go</div><div id="00:26:55.680" class="transcript_line"> wow well i was just coming in monday once a week and you know could have come in a bit more but</div><div id="00:27:00.720" class="transcript_line"> now it makes me feel like i should be coming in more and you know it makes me want to actually</div><div id="00:27:04.720" class="transcript_line"> make my own costume and that&#039;s i think great because it actually boosts everyone else up</div><div id="00:27:12.240" class="transcript_line"> and it brings everyone on a on a higher level and i think that&#039;s what&#039;s really good about carnival</div><div id="00:27:19.760" class="transcript_line"> is that you&#039;re always you&#039;re never satisfied with you know just what you can get first chance</div><div id="00:27:26.160" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s always a well now i&#039;m going to improve it this much more or now that the second week&#039;s gone</div><div id="00:27:31.760" class="transcript_line"> and i&#039;ve made my costumes finished but you know what i&#039;m still not satisfied i want to make it</div><div id="00:27:35.680" class="transcript_line"> even better and it&#039;s always those people that you&#039;re watching on the sides that make you kind of</div><div id="00:27:42.240" class="transcript_line"> reflect on yourself about those things because someone in that room is always going to be pushing</div><div id="00:27:47.600" class="transcript_line"> to the next level and that&#039;s what brings everyone else up to push the next level and i think that&#039;s</div><div id="00:27:51.360" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s what&#039;s really great about carnival but yeah i think later on as i going back to you know my</div><div id="00:27:59.760" class="transcript_line"> experiences carnival later on when i was a little bit older i started to then you know do my own</div><div id="00:28:08.080" class="transcript_line"> things so when i was about six 16 17 that&#039;s when i kind of you know i still was you know just coming</div><div id="00:28:15.360" class="transcript_line"> along every few days a week and my mum was still working on the carnival and you know we&#039;d kind of</div><div id="00:28:24.800" class="transcript_line"> me and my mum that&#039;s that&#039;s another conversation but you know it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s funny kind of</div><div id="00:28:32.560" class="transcript_line"> being a child and your mum&#039;s taking you along and then you start to become a little bit more</div><div id="00:28:36.480" class="transcript_line"> independent and your mum&#039;s working on the carnival and it&#039;s this kind of thing of well fion you know</div><div id="00:28:42.400" class="transcript_line"> you should be coming in and you know you need to do this and make sure that you go to the rehearsal</div><div id="00:28:48.080" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re like yes yes mum yes mum and then you know it changes because then it&#039;s it&#039;s a different</div><div id="00:28:56.240" class="transcript_line"> story when you&#039;re working on the carnival and your mom&#039;s working on the carnival and it&#039;s just it&#039;s</div><div id="00:29:02.160" class="transcript_line"> totally different but um i&#039;ll talk about that later but going back to going back to you know</div><div id="00:29:11.200" class="transcript_line"> participating in the carnival at that age you know i was more independent so i remember being</div><div id="00:29:17.200" class="transcript_line"> a little bit rebellious sometimes and you know the the style of the costume was this and i was like</div><div id="00:29:22.720" class="transcript_line"> yeah i like that but i want to do it like this you know and this this kind of like subtle quiet</div><div id="00:29:30.880" class="transcript_line"> rebellious rebelliousness coming out you know where i remember one year i cut my skirt much shorter</div><div id="00:29:37.440" class="transcript_line"> than it was supposed to be and it was quite funny actually because my mum was like fion what are</div><div id="00:29:43.840" class="transcript_line"> you doing this is not how the costume&#039;s supposed to be you&#039;re not allowed to do that and i guess</div><div id="00:29:49.120" class="transcript_line"> as well when you when your parent is a member of the staff and you&#039;ve got friends and their parents</div><div id="00:29:56.320" class="transcript_line"> aren&#039;t so it&#039;s almost like it&#039;s almost like you&#039;re on a pedestal a bit i guess because they look up to</div><div id="00:30:03.280" class="transcript_line"> you and whatever you do they copy and so that was the problem with that year and that&#039;s why i got</div><div id="00:30:08.960" class="transcript_line"> really told off about it was because i cut my skirt because i thought well you know i&#039;m going</div><div id="00:30:13.440" class="transcript_line"> to do what i want to do and i cut my skirt a lot shorter and turned up and all the other girls had</div><div id="00:30:20.080" class="transcript_line"> really long skirts and they looked at me and they&#039;re like why is your skirt really short and i was</div><div id="00:30:24.640" class="transcript_line"> like i just thought it looked better and then literally within the next 20 minutes all these</div><div id="00:30:31.200" class="transcript_line"> four other girls had also cut their skirts really short and then someone came along and was like</div><div id="00:30:37.600" class="transcript_line"> what is going on that&#039;s a waste of fabric you know and it&#039;s all these things that you don&#039;t consider</div><div id="00:30:42.720" class="transcript_line"> because you&#039;re kind of being absent-minded about oh well you know i want to look the best and</div><div id="00:30:47.040" class="transcript_line"> you know and you don&#039;t think about all these other things because you know you&#039;re still</div><div id="00:30:50.960" class="transcript_line"> essentially you&#039;re still just a kid you know turning up and just participating in this happy</div><div id="00:30:55.280" class="transcript_line"> free-go-lucky carnival experience but yeah that&#039;s that&#039;s i remember that year kind of</div><div id="00:31:03.200" class="transcript_line"> i guess stepping out a little bit and being a little bit more independent and then the year</div><div id="00:31:08.080" class="transcript_line"> after that you know it wasn&#039;t like that then because i thought oh yeah i&#039;m older now i need</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> to be more responsible and yes people are gonna follow me if i do something some you know other</div><div id="00:31:21.360" class="transcript_line"> people are going to do the same so that means i can&#039;t you know for example i can&#039;t be</div><div id="00:31:29.200" class="transcript_line"> alternating my costume the way that you know i might want to um because then that means that</div><div id="00:31:35.920" class="transcript_line"> everyone else is allowed to do the same and then where do you where do you leave where do you go</div><div id="00:31:40.880" class="transcript_line"> with that if everyone starts doing their own changes to their own costumes then you don&#039;t</div><div id="00:31:45.040" class="transcript_line"> have a structure anymore so then you have to you start thinking on the bigger picture and the and</div><div id="00:31:52.320" class="transcript_line"> the the perspective of how and the knock-on effect of everything else it&#039;s not just about you anymore</div><div id="00:31:59.840" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s also something that is really important about carnival it&#039;s never just about you and</div><div id="00:32:07.280" class="transcript_line"> i guess you have to go through that experience to realize that because sometimes people do turn up</div><div id="00:32:12.080" class="transcript_line"> and they do go well i want this costume and i this and i that and you know eventually they realize</div><div id="00:32:19.360" class="transcript_line"> that well actually you don&#039;t have that much fun when it&#039;s just about you you know with the day of</div><div id="00:32:24.320" class="transcript_line"> the carnival yeah you might have the best costume or you might have chosen the best costume and you</div><div id="00:32:29.040" class="transcript_line"> might be with the best band and you might be in the best location of the carnival but then it&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:34.720" class="transcript_line"> still you&#039;re still by yourself and then it&#039;s like are you having a great time now that you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:32:39.040" class="transcript_line"> your best costume and you&#039;re with the best band and does that actually give you the opportunity to</div><div id="00:32:44.320" class="transcript_line"> have the greatest carnival year no it doesn&#039;t because it is about being with everyone else</div><div id="00:32:49.600" class="transcript_line"> and sometimes i&#039;ve had the greatest experience even when i&#039;m in a costume that i really don&#039;t like</div><div id="00:32:55.920" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s because you have to kind of forget about the superficial things because it&#039;s not about the</div><div id="00:33:00.320" class="transcript_line"> superficial things even though we are making costumes that look fantastic it&#039;s not always</div><div id="00:33:05.280" class="transcript_line"> about looking fantastic it&#039;s also about being able to engage with everyone around you and being</div><div id="00:33:10.240" class="transcript_line"> able to engage on all levels because you do get all types of people coming in and doing carnival</div><div id="00:33:17.040" class="transcript_line"> you get people with special needs you get people with learning disabilities you get people with</div><div id="00:33:23.200" class="transcript_line"> social inadequacies or you know people who have issues at home and so they&#039;re not as confident</div><div id="00:33:30.880" class="transcript_line"> you get people who are extremely confident and love to talk about all the things they&#039;re doing</div><div id="00:33:36.640" class="transcript_line"> and bring it to the carnival as well and you get people who are extremely skilled and can actually</div><div id="00:33:42.960" class="transcript_line"> really help in the process even though they&#039;re not part of the team you also get people who&#039;ve</div><div id="00:33:47.680" class="transcript_line"> never done anything like this before and they can&#039;t dance and they can&#039;t you know play drums here and</div><div id="00:33:53.360" class="transcript_line"> there but they still get involved and they still try really hard and eventually they do actually</div><div id="00:33:57.120" class="transcript_line"> get something out of it and it&#039;s about giving everyone the opportunity to engage with each other</div><div id="00:34:04.720" class="transcript_line"> so yeah i think over the years that is what i&#039;ve come to realise that&#039;s the fundamental about</div><div id="00:34:12.160" class="transcript_line"> carnival it&#039;s really about connecting with lots of different types of people and you know when i</div><div id="00:34:20.240" class="transcript_line"> started to work in the carnival that&#039;s something that really comes to play because you have to be</div><div id="00:34:27.280" class="transcript_line"> able to communicate with all different types of people you know you have to be able to communicate</div><div id="00:34:33.200" class="transcript_line"> with people who aren&#039;t that fortunate and for them carnival is amazing and you know they kind of want</div><div id="00:34:41.280" class="transcript_line"> to take everything that they can at first opportunity and they and you know thinking oh</div><div id="00:34:46.160" class="transcript_line"> my god everything&#039;s free let&#039;s just make the most of it you know i mean but then at the same time</div><div id="00:34:51.600" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re talking to people who&#039;ve done it for years and they&#039;re like oh yeah it&#039;s nothing to me you</div><div id="00:34:55.520" class="transcript_line"> know it&#039;s just you know the usual you know and it&#039;s like it&#039;s a very different head space when</div><div id="00:35:01.440" class="transcript_line"> you you&#039;re literally in one minute you&#039;re talking to someone who&#039;s got special needs and literally</div><div id="00:35:06.080" class="transcript_line"> two seconds later someone else is coming to you who&#039;s got loads of experience who&#039;s got loads of</div><div id="00:35:10.720" class="transcript_line"> ideas and they&#039;re like oh i wanted to do this but then i want to do that and then you know and you&#039;re</div><div id="00:35:14.080" class="transcript_line"> like oh my god like i&#039;ve just been trying to get someone who doesn&#039;t want to do anything at all</div><div id="00:35:18.960" class="transcript_line"> trying to get them to do at least one thing and then i&#039;m trying to get someone else to not do</div><div id="00:35:23.200" class="transcript_line"> everything that they want to do because there&#039;s too many ideas but i&#039;m trying to get them to focus</div><div id="00:35:26.400" class="transcript_line"> on one thing you know so it&#039;s quite broad when you&#039;re working in the carnival it&#039;s a very broad</div><div id="00:35:32.800" class="transcript_line"> place to be and especially for me i i have experienced in a few different things you know</div><div id="00:35:40.320" class="transcript_line"> so i&#039;m experienced as a dancer but that&#039;s not just my forte because i love making things i love</div><div id="00:35:47.280" class="transcript_line"> crafting and i love you know the the sequining and and um that&#039;s it called a fiber pole making</div><div id="00:35:54.640" class="transcript_line"> fiber pole and making the infrastructures for backpacks and um i do so occasionally i&#039;m not</div><div id="00:36:04.320" class="transcript_line"> one for sewing that much i&#039;ve got to say it&#039;s probably not the greatest but you know when</div><div id="00:36:10.800" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve only got two people on the sewing machine and you&#039;ve got about 50 costumes that need sewing</div><div id="00:36:14.880" class="transcript_line"> yes you have to unfortunately have to get the people who aren&#039;t that great at sewing to help</div><div id="00:36:19.280" class="transcript_line"> along and that was me um so i&#039;ve been you know involved in all the different aspects and</div><div id="00:36:27.920" class="transcript_line"> to the extent as well of playing drums and getting involved with the percussion</div><div id="00:36:32.960" class="transcript_line"> and so for me it&#039;s really satisfying because a lot of other opportunities that i have they&#039;re always</div><div id="00:36:42.160" class="transcript_line"> one or the other i&#039;m either doing music or i&#039;m doing art or i&#039;m doing dance whether it&#039;s teaching</div><div id="00:36:49.840" class="transcript_line"> or performing whatever it&#039;s always one form and that&#039;s what i actually really love about carnival</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a unique environment to work in because you&#039;re constantly going backwards and forwards</div><div id="00:37:01.680" class="transcript_line"> from all those different elements um you know i could have one hour where i&#039;m dancing and literally</div><div id="00:37:09.120" class="transcript_line"> as soon as i&#039;ve finished teaching dance i go back to making my backpack again you know and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:37:14.960" class="transcript_line"> very refreshing for me um and so that&#039;s the other side of it you know from being</div><div id="00:37:22.080" class="transcript_line"> participating in it and then working in the carnival is is a different thing altogether</div><div id="00:37:29.120" class="transcript_line"> because you have the responsibilities and you have to organize and you have to be um what do you call</div><div id="00:37:35.600" class="transcript_line"> it you have to be able to go from one thing to the other whereas when you&#039;re participating</div><div id="00:37:43.760" class="transcript_line"> i remember when i was you know when i was a kid i actually didn&#039;t do that much making especially</div><div id="00:37:48.560" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re a child you want loads of energy you literally sit down for 20 minutes and you do your</div><div id="00:37:52.800" class="transcript_line"> cutting and you&#039;re like okay i&#039;m bored you know and then you want to just dance for the rest of</div><div id="00:37:56.640" class="transcript_line"> the day so for me when i was a kid i didn&#039;t do that much craft making actually i would maybe do</div><div id="00:38:02.160" class="transcript_line"> bits and bobs here and there but i was mainly loving the dancing and you know especially when</div><div id="00:38:07.120" class="transcript_line"> as soon as music was playing that was it i was up and dancing so i remember when i was a child that</div><div id="00:38:12.000" class="transcript_line"> was mainly an environment where i could just dance and no one would be like oh she&#039;s weird</div><div id="00:38:17.040" class="transcript_line"> you know because obviously if i&#039;m in school and i just start dancing people are going to be like</div><div id="00:38:20.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah she&#039;s a weirdo but in carnival you know it was always normal it was always acceptable to just</div><div id="00:38:26.080" class="transcript_line"> go and just do whatever and pick up a drum and play it or you know paint on the wall so yeah</div><div id="00:38:34.080" class="transcript_line"> for me that&#039;s the the spectrum from being participating in it and working in it</div><div id="00:38:40.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very different but at the same time it&#039;s the same so yeah</div><div id="00:38:47.760" class="transcript_line"> can i just say that is one of the most eloquent accounts of a carnival journey i&#039;ve ever heard</div><div id="00:38:53.440" class="transcript_line"> in my professional career uh fionn bless you and thank you very much indeed</div></div></p>
