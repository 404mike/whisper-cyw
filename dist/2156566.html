    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Stephanie Cruise of Ellen Links and today it&#039;s the 10th of November 2022 and I&#039;m talking to Hugh.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Hugh, could you give me your full name and year of birth please?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;m Hugh Rickards and I was born in 1964 so I&#039;m 58.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much. Now, back in August this year you visited Ellen Valley.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me why you came and what your first impressions were?</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, yes, well I came from Birmingham as part of a group called the GOATS.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The GOATS stands for Getting On At The Shed, which is a group of people, it&#039;s an over 50s group based in our local park,</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> who get together, we try to do good things and get interested in things and look after each other.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we became interested in the Ellen Valley through your artist Kate Green,</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> who was singing songs about the water pipe that links Ellen Valley to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And so as a part of our interest in that, we started talking with Ellen Links and that led to us coming up there for the weekend</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to stay over at the bunkhouse and to see what was going on.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And back then, as you remember, there was very little water in the reservoir and it&#039;s a very different picture from what I guess it looks like today.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think where the dams were ever flowing at the moment, we had some glorious weather back in the summer.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you find the bunkhouse? How did you find Concrete?</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. It&#039;s in a great situation.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, it&#039;s a dark sky side. So we had the help of some astronomers and their telescopes.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We could see all sorts of things that I&#039;d never seen before.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Dying stars and supernovas and galaxies and all sorts of things like that.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, it was very comfy and friendly and we were very well looked after.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We cooked our own food and did astronomy and had a little fire outside as well.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was just a great experience for all of us.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Good. And before your introduction to Cape Green, did you know where the water in Birmingham came from?</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. Well, as anybody who lives in Birmingham for any length of time knows,</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> there is an old and slightly dilapidated model of the Irland Valley in Cannon Hill Park, which is one of the major parks in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, we used to go walking around this little model, which is probably about, I don&#039;t know, 10 yards square in the park.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just a sort of miniature model of all the dams and the valleys.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think most people in Birmingham, probably because of that, we know where our water comes from.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We know it comes from the Irland Valley and we know it comes from Wales.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you know how close the Irland Valley is to Birmingham?</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t really. I had a vague idea, I think. I had a vague idea.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, now I know, thanks to Kate, it&#039;s 73 and a half miles because she sings about that in her song.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, that&#039;s right. And slightly uphill most of the way from Birmingham there, which is helpful for getting the water back the other way.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It is. It is indeed. It is indeed.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned your community group in the park. Now, how did you actually get involved in GOATS?</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. Well, GOATS was my idea, myself and my friend Ian.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re just coming to our retirements. He&#039;s fully retired and I&#039;m partially retired.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And we really wanted to set up a group in the local community that was for over 50s.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Initially, it was for predominantly men who were a little bit more likely to be socially isolated.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But we have a mixture of men and women these days.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely, lovely. And you do all sorts of activities, do you?</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we tend to do what the members want us to do.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> We spend a lot of time talking about things we might do and then we follow our interests.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So we sometimes go on cultural outings to different towns and cities.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And we sometimes do countryside activities or crafty activities like blacksmithing or bicycle maintenance or scything.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow. And it&#039;s really whatever people in the group want to do.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re also trying to develop the group to be a group that is a source of wisdom for the community as well.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So like a village elders sort of function. And we&#039;re working on that at the moment.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Nice. OK. You mentioned the weather back in August and it is slightly wetter here today.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, we&#039;re in Fort Hampton or Splendour at the moment.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you think you&#039;d be tempted to come back to the valley?</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, definitely. I mean, we&#039;ve got good we have good links with Elan Links now.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, we want to just pursue and develop those.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We are still I mean, there are a few bits and pieces of connections now because I think there&#039;s a plan to regenerate the Elan Valley model in Cannon Hill Park.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We want to be part of that. We&#039;re also looking at the concrete posts.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether you know about the concrete posts, which are which Kate walked around as you walked around the whole perimeter of the Elan Valley and did a photographic exhibition in Hereford.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Very recently, we all went to see.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think one of these concrete or one of the concrete posts, maybe one that hadn&#039;t been used, I understand it&#039;s in a shed somewhere on the site.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Kate&#039;s going to use as part of an exhibition in Birmingham.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we as a part and cartridge part, we&#039;d be quite happy to twin with the Elan Valley, even though we&#039;d say the Elan Valley is slightly bigger than our part being, I think, one percent of the area of Wales.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re only a little part of about five acres.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;d love to twin with you, I think.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be a lovely idea.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be really nice.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think things like your siding course could be used down here so you could come and help with some of the maintenance on the Elan Valley Trust and work alongside rangers and things.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s exactly the sort of thing we&#039;d like to get involved with.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> The Cape Green project was wonderful because those concrete posts mark the watershed, which was the city council, so they&#039;re very historic items.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course, there&#039;s a lot of Bronze Age and Iron Age and Roman features in the valley as well.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So it is quite a special area.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But do you want to leave me with any impressions that you&#039;ve got from the valley, from your tour around the valley?</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> What did you actually think of the place?</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, amazing. I suppose a really warm welcome from the people of the Elan Valley of all kinds.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Very warm welcome and absolutely breathtaking scenery and peace.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And the ability to have a swim in the river as well. That was fantastic.</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s something I won&#039;t forget.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s wonderful. Well, hopefully he will see you back in the valley fairly soon.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been lovely talking to you today. I&#039;ve no doubt.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m most grateful for you adding to the story of Elan Valley.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> No problem. Anytime.</div></div></p>
