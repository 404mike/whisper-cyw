    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been with Mencap 22 years now.</div><div id="00:00:04.520" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a colourful character.</div><div id="00:00:07.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve known Jan Kanch and some of those guys for years and years because Jan Kanch organises</div><div id="00:00:15.960" class="transcript_line"> the Mencap discos and dinners and then they do Gateway in Abera on which I&#039;ve also been</div><div id="00:00:21.880" class="transcript_line"> to.</div><div id="00:00:22.880" class="transcript_line"> But I belong to the Gateway up here in Aberystwyth.</div><div id="00:00:27.240" class="transcript_line"> She was doing self-advocacy and I was doing advocacy group with the centres.</div><div id="00:00:35.440" class="transcript_line"> She used to come and be in the buildings and just be an advocate for people that had problems</div><div id="00:00:44.720" class="transcript_line"> and you know just be a voice for people to chat to.</div><div id="00:00:51.520" class="transcript_line"> So we used to have meeting groups in the centres.</div><div id="00:00:55.400" class="transcript_line"> Anything from parking issues to access.</div><div id="00:01:01.440" class="transcript_line"> But how they had advocacy came about was through a lady called Claire Turner.</div><div id="00:01:07.480" class="transcript_line"> She was with People First and that was my involvement during the 90s.</div><div id="00:01:15.040" class="transcript_line"> I think my proudest moment was being a rep at the old Wales People First.</div><div id="00:01:22.800" class="transcript_line"> It was about, for me, I always thought it was about working together as a team.</div><div id="00:01:30.400" class="transcript_line"> But quite often nobody would like to take out on the responsibility.</div><div id="00:01:37.920" class="transcript_line"> So they used to come and see me and I&#039;d say yeah I&#039;ll do it but then I realised hang on</div><div id="00:01:44.160" class="transcript_line"> a minute I needed help here to actually make this happen.</div><div id="00:01:50.080" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I got a bit stressed towards the end and I just thought I&#039;ve done with this.</div><div id="00:01:58.840" class="transcript_line"> I did that for six years.</div><div id="00:02:01.480" class="transcript_line"> I chaired one group down in Aberon but I thought I couldn&#039;t do it anymore because I had to</div><div id="00:02:09.120" class="transcript_line"> have a fish to fry if you like.</div><div id="00:02:12.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a keen swimmer and a keen musician and I&#039;m an author, activist.</div><div id="00:02:24.880" class="transcript_line"> I just hope that I was able to make a change in some way even if it&#039;s very small.</div><div id="00:02:37.080" class="transcript_line"> I went into Daycentre Services to start with.</div><div id="00:02:42.080" class="transcript_line"> I did that for 20 years but when I moved up here in 2005 I didn&#039;t want to do that anymore.</div><div id="00:02:54.800" class="transcript_line"> So I was one of the first people in Curydeacon to have direct payments.</div><div id="00:03:04.200" class="transcript_line"> If I&#039;ve got problems I can always talk to Jan.</div><div id="00:03:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Well I played music for them and I&#039;ve done some drumming and I&#039;ve performed for them.</div><div id="00:03:19.680" class="transcript_line"> They got open day or something or if I get asked would you like to be a part of an event</div><div id="00:03:28.880" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re organising.</div><div id="00:03:30.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah I know Beth and Dylan.</div><div id="00:03:33.760" class="transcript_line"> They will often ring and say can we come out, we want to come out and see you.</div><div id="00:03:39.960" class="transcript_line"> We haven&#039;t seen you for ages, can we have a cash out?</div><div id="00:03:44.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes come on in.</div><div id="00:03:48.880" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t very good at learning.</div><div id="00:03:52.840" class="transcript_line"> However when it was music day and swimming day I enjoyed doing them.</div><div id="00:04:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Swimming because it gives me freedom to move freely in the water.</div><div id="00:04:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Music because I find music therapy for me and it helps keep my fingers going.</div><div id="00:04:17.360" class="transcript_line"> We all meet up once a year and everybody comes and it&#039;s just oh well we haven&#039;t seen you</div><div id="00:04:23.840" class="transcript_line"> for ages, how have you been doing?</div><div id="00:04:30.120" class="transcript_line"> And these events usually go on until about 11.30.</div><div id="00:04:36.120" class="transcript_line"> This time at the Moody Cow but in the past at Seaglin Christmas summer, well it&#039;s Christmas</div><div id="00:04:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Christmas dinner, Christmas food or ice cream or something.</div><div id="00:04:51.560" class="transcript_line"> And then they have one in the summer which could be I don&#039;t know chicken, anything really.</div><div id="00:05:01.280" class="transcript_line"> It gives us a chance to meet all our friends again and everybody goes and it is busy, busy.</div><div id="00:05:11.160" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t always move around in there, there&#039;s so many people.</div><div id="00:05:15.600" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all my friends as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:05:21.320" class="transcript_line"> You know even people I haven&#039;t met before.</div><div id="00:05:24.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always wanted to be out there as a person with a disability even though I kid myself</div><div id="00:05:34.360" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have a disability.</div><div id="00:05:36.200" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t stop me.</div><div id="00:05:38.320" class="transcript_line"> It does not stop me.</div><div id="00:05:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Hygienx is a physical acting agency that takes people with non-disability and disability</div><div id="00:05:54.680" class="transcript_line"> and trains them to become actors and actresses and teaches you about film techniques and</div><div id="00:06:04.280" class="transcript_line"> acting for screen and for theatre.</div><div id="00:06:07.920" class="transcript_line"> We do all sorts of play games and silly characters role play.</div><div id="00:06:16.720" class="transcript_line"> At the minute they&#039;re working with doctors so they&#039;re doing a lot of role play down in</div><div id="00:06:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff with the doctors.</div><div id="00:06:29.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been involved with Unity Festival down in Clenechie.</div><div id="00:06:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Unity Festival is a big festival that brings all the Hygienx academies together but there</div><div id="00:06:46.120" class="transcript_line"> are about three or four not yet.</div><div id="00:06:52.840" class="transcript_line"> What you do is you work on a show and then you take it to something like the Unity Festival</div><div id="00:06:59.880" class="transcript_line"> and perform it.</div><div id="00:07:01.880" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a street theatre.</div><div id="00:07:06.200" class="transcript_line"> You get to meet all sorts of different people and what is nice there, there&#039;s always different</div><div id="00:07:14.640" class="transcript_line"> tutors that come in because I&#039;m involved with the mid academy up here in Aberystwyth which</div><div id="00:07:21.120" class="transcript_line"> meets every Monday at half nine to half three.</div><div id="00:07:25.600" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a full on day.</div><div id="00:07:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Two years we didn&#039;t do it because of Covid.</div><div id="00:07:34.320" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately it puts a stop on things because I&#039;ve done a lot of stuff.</div><div id="00:07:45.480" class="transcript_line"> When you chat to people and tell them what you do they just go oh bloody hell you put</div><div id="00:07:52.560" class="transcript_line"> me to shame.</div><div id="00:07:54.240" class="transcript_line"> My proudest moment is being able to be on stages playing or doing dance or doing Hygienx</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> or but what does keep me going is music.</div><div id="00:08:12.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always been surrounded by music and good people.</div><div id="00:08:19.600" class="transcript_line"> I was lacking in confidence at some points in my life.</div><div id="00:08:25.040" class="transcript_line"> Both with Menkepke, Deacon, Peoplefest and the groups that I was involved with in the</div><div id="00:08:34.320" class="transcript_line"> day centres has given me a sense of confidence.</div><div id="00:08:40.920" class="transcript_line"> You can talk to Jan about anything and everything.</div><div id="00:08:49.280" class="transcript_line"> And if she can&#039;t help you then she might be able to give you the right people that you</div><div id="00:08:56.200" class="transcript_line"> can get in touch with.</div><div id="00:08:57.600" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s another person that gives you the tools to deal with whatever life throws at you.</div><div id="00:09:04.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just wonderful to have Jan and Menkepke ready to give you the help.</div></div></p>
