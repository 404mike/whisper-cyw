    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Recording made by Glenys James in Ponoka, Alberta on the 3rd of July 1974 with several</div><div id="00:00:10.440" class="transcript_line"> members of the Welsh settlement. The interviews are in English and in Welsh, starting in English</div><div id="00:00:17.620" class="transcript_line"> with Griffith Jones, followed by a group interview with Hugh Roberts, Mrs Annie Roberts, Kelt</div><div id="00:00:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Hughes, Evan Thomas, Garonwy Davies and Yorwith Davies.</div><div id="00:00:56.240" class="transcript_line"> Mr Griffith Jones, you were born in Canada of Welsh parents.</div><div id="00:01:14.280" class="transcript_line"> Since we did not speak Welsh in the home, I didn&#039;t learn Welsh when I should have and I</div><div id="00:01:31.760" class="transcript_line"> regret it since. However, I do like to hear the Welsh and one of the biggest thrills I had in</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> visiting Wales this summer was to hear the little children speak it. It sounded good. Dad</div><div id="00:01:47.920" class="transcript_line"> came from Wales, Tre Gyrfaen, first in 1891 and after several trips back came out again in 1910</div><div id="00:01:57.680" class="transcript_line"> and settled in the Wood River District. Mother is of Welsh, was of Welsh parents and she came from</div><div id="00:02:05.720" class="transcript_line"> the United States to Canada in 1902 and they were married in 1911. There were four of us that were</div><div id="00:02:15.080" class="transcript_line"> born to them and probably I speak as good of Welsh as any of them which isn&#039;t very good.</div><div id="00:02:21.360" class="transcript_line"> Now your father was well known in the area here for his Welsh writing of England Neon both Welsh</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> and English. He was well known all over North America in fact because he contributed to the</div><div id="00:02:38.360" class="transcript_line"> Welsh papers and he competed in all the Welsh Estadwods that he could with his England Neon</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and he won many prizes with them. Can you recall any of these England Neon that he wrote? I could</div><div id="00:02:54.720" class="transcript_line"> say one in English. As you know the England must have consonants that harmonize and one that he</div><div id="00:03:06.600" class="transcript_line"> won a prize on in English was Lindy how well he landed in Paris though peril confronted. Gritty</div><div id="00:03:15.800" class="transcript_line"> Yank with great head away he went undaunted. I wish I could say some of them in the Welsh</div><div id="00:03:25.320" class="transcript_line"> because they sounded very musical even to my Canadian ears. When you visited Wales this year</div><div id="00:03:34.320" class="transcript_line"> for the first time what else impressed you about Wales and the Welsh way of life? We had the good</div><div id="00:03:43.320" class="transcript_line"> fortune to attend the command begone in Rosanus Grigogh and this gave us one of our biggest thrills</div><div id="00:03:51.080" class="transcript_line"> and also to see the old churches and houses where dad lived where he went to church and some of the</div><div id="00:04:02.160" class="transcript_line"> farms that he trampled over looking after his Welsh sheep. We met many of my cousins too whom</div><div id="00:04:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I had never seen and one thing that really impressed me especially in the Kiriogh Valley</div><div id="00:04:18.280" class="transcript_line"> was the way everyone spoke Welsh and they would rather speak Welsh than English. Did you have a</div><div id="00:04:25.120" class="transcript_line"> chance to practice your Welsh there? Oh yes I had many opportunities and we are looking forward to</div><div id="00:04:32.080" class="transcript_line"> going back again as soon as possible possibly two years. Wednesday the 3rd of July in Ponoka.</div><div id="00:04:47.920" class="transcript_line"> Now Mr. Hugh Roberts, do you remember the story of the chapel in Wood River when it started?</div><div id="00:04:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the chapel started in 1914. The Welsh church was open in Ponoka beyond the chapel in Wood River.</div><div id="00:05:17.120" class="transcript_line"> delicious clouds</div><div id="00:05:19.200" class="transcript_line"> They

class="transcript_line"> and only a few of us went there.</div><div id="00:14:39.240" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of people came there</div><div id="00:14:41.240" class="transcript_line"> to

class="transcript_line"> And then in the chapel, then.</div><div id="00:26:05.440" class="transcript_line"> And we were teaching at the road mam.</div><div id="00:26:12.440" class="transcript_line"> And Tada and Mamma were teaching us in the school.</div><div id="00:26:19.440" class="transcript_line"> And when we were growing up, we went to watch classes.</div><div id="00:26:26.440" class="transcript_line"> And when we were in the 16th or 17th grade, we were in the adult class.</div><div id="00:26:34.440" class="transcript_line"> And we were teaching Welsh in the school.</div><div id="00:26:42.440" class="transcript_line"> And we had a Bible that was in Welsh, that was in English.</div><div id="00:26:48.440" class="transcript_line"> And we had a lot of fun trying to get different interpretations of the Bible in Welsh and the Bible in Welsh.</div><div id="00:27:06.440" class="transcript_line"> At the beginning of the school, the magic school, we couldn&#039;t speak Welsh.</div><div id="00:27:15.440" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t speak English, we could only speak Welsh.</div><div id="00:27:19.440" class="transcript_line"> And what we were teaching was through the school.</div><div id="00:27:28.440" class="transcript_line"> And we were taught all three classes when we were little.</div><div id="00:27:33.440" class="transcript_line"> The first year in the magic school.</div><div id="00:27:39.440" class="transcript_line"> And the magic school was around the whole of the children of Wales.</div><div id="00:27:46.440" class="transcript_line"> Some of the different languages there, but Welsh was the most.</div><div id="00:27:53.440" class="transcript_line"> It was magic for a couple of years.</div><div id="00:27:56.440" class="transcript_line"> I have a lot of friends who went to school and went to school in the same school as me.</div><div id="00:28:12.440" class="transcript_line"> Some of them were older.</div><div id="00:28:20.440" class="transcript_line"> And the school was very different from the rest of the children.</div><div id="00:28:25.440" class="transcript_line"> But talking about the school.</div><div id="00:28:32.440" class="transcript_line"> We had a school here in the early 1900s to before 1910.</div><div id="00:28:42.440" class="transcript_line"> And carried on for several years.</div><div id="00:28:47.440" class="transcript_line"> Then it carried on until about 1925 or somewhere in that neighborhood.</div><div id="00:28:56.440" class="transcript_line"> And then for a while we didn&#039;t have Stelwood again until the 1930s, the end of the 1930s.</div><div id="00:29:06.440" class="transcript_line"> And then they petered out.</div><div id="00:29:11.440" class="transcript_line"> And after about a lapse of 10, 15 years, we, descendants of the Welsh in Woodriver,</div><div id="00:29:22.440" class="transcript_line"> again started up the Stelwood, which is now called the Woodriver Festival.</div><div id="00:29:28.440" class="transcript_line"> And we are carrying on to this day, which is an annual event.</div><div id="00:29:33.440" class="transcript_line"> During the first festivals when I was a child, it consisted of music, elocution,</div><div id="00:29:43.440" class="transcript_line"> handiworks, such as making halters of things, cooking, and writing limericks.</div><div id="00:29:58.440" class="transcript_line"> These were competitive festivals.</div><div id="00:30:03.440" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of the singing was competitive.</div><div id="00:30:08.440" class="transcript_line"> Classes were old and young, even for the ones over 50.</div><div id="00:30:13.440" class="transcript_line"> Choirs were quite prominent.</div><div id="00:30:16.440" class="transcript_line"> And at that time, nearly all the Welsh people could sing that were here.</div><div id="00:30:23.440" class="transcript_line"> There were several quartets in one competition, and it was quite competitive.</div><div id="00:30:31.440" class="transcript_line"> And some of the choirs that were in this community were led by some of the Welsh people that came over from Wales.</div><div id="00:30:45.440" class="transcript_line"> And I think the tradition is still carrying on.</div><div id="00:30:50.440" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh people are still able to sing, and the Welsh songs are quite close to the heart</div><div id="00:30:56.440" class="transcript_line"> of most of the young people in the district at the present time.</div></div></p>
