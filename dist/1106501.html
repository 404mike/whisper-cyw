She was laid to rest at Machynllyd Cemetery.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I went up to see Dad the following day and he broke down, breaking his heart.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In the end we were both crying as we missed her so much.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> On the day we said goodbye to Mam at the crematorium and after the lovely food we&#039;d had at Lleti Gwynne Aberystwyth,</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> my sisters and I went back to Dad&#039;s house.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> He shared some of Mam&#039;s jewellery as he wanted to do it while we were all together.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I was given Mam&#039;s wedding ring which was 22 carat gold and some of it being Welsh gold.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I had been promised it ever since I was a little girl because I was the eldest.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Mam had it made smaller for her finger when she became ill as she had lost so much weight.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> As it happened it fitted my finger perfectly.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was also given Mam&#039;s peridot birth ring which Dad had bought for her from Clogau Gwld,</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> as Welsh gold from Dog Allumaen because I was the only one born in August.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Mam was born on the 10th of August and I on the 13th.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I do actually prefer Celtic designed jewellery. I&#039;m not one for diamonds etc.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I had been invited to go to a surprise party in the Midlands on the 9th of October 2004.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Mam&#039;s cousin Eilwen Rhys was 60 years old and her son Gavin was arranging this party for her.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I went with my two sisters Anne and Sian.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Anne was a very good driver but the navigator, Sian, was a little cocky.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I would have been able to drive around such a busy place.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> We were staying at a travel lodge in Oldbury and arrived at 20 past two on the day of the party.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We met many of Mam&#039;s family there and had a great time.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Mam had one favoured cousin but sadly he had died. His name was Gwyn.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d been an opera singer, a tenor, also a very good chef and worked at some of the best hotels in London.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> His son Gareth was at the party and they showed him the little booklet of Mam&#039;s story that I had put together as Gwyn, his father, was mentioned in it.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The taxi we booked to take us back to the travel lodge never turned up but we managed to find another one.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t like the look of the driver so Sian and I decided that Anne should sit in the front seat because she was an ex-policewoman.</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> The driver was Indian and was having a conversation with another man on his radio.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Sian and I heard Anne say to him that he was going the wrong way but he insisted it was right.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Sian and I looked at each other. I thought that the three of us were going to be kidnapped.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank goodness we arrived back at the lodge safe and we laughed about it after.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But you never know with three beautiful women do you?</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Sharon, my daughter, was expecting her fourth baby.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 8th of June 2005, Sharon&#039;s little girl was born and I stayed with Sharon during the birth.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I even cut the umbilical cord. Then the midwife handed the baby to me to hold. It was such a wonderful moment.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The midwife also allowed me to film her examining the baby while Sharon had asleep.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Sharon called the baby Kelsey Jade. We were home the next day.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Ma came to fetch us and my dad and Patrick were waiting by Sharon&#039;s house to welcome them home.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> My dad was very protective towards her and as she grew older the bond between them was so strong.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Kelsey helped my dad to come to terms with my mam&#039;s death and it&#039;s strange that mam had told Sharon she was going to have a little girl one day.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Kelsey Jade was christened on the 9th of October 2005 at Holy Trinity Church, Corris by the Reverend Geraint Appiorweth.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Her godparents were Jane and Brian Vaughan. There was food afterwards prepared by her uncle Pat.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a chef at the Dwinan Pyrpyn Cainws. We had an enjoyable gathering of friends and family.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I recorded it all on film and Ray took plenty of photographs.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Ray and I had bought Kelsey&#039;s christening gown etc and she still dresses her doll in it now at my house.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Kelsey&#039;s name is at the beginning of the New Baptist Book at the church,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> whereas her brothers are on the last page of the Old One which is now at the archives in Dog Alley.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always had my grandchildren down almost every Saturday since they were born, also quite a few sleepovers.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I had so much fun with them even though it was very tiring.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The boys have now grown up and I don&#039;t see them very often but I have loads of films of all the good times we had.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve made copies for each one which are saved in their special memory boxes with love from 9 Jew.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> My favourite Saturday was when I took the boys down by the river in Kaikinos where my mam used to take us.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a very hot day and we took a picnic, also ships etc to play with.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The mud by the river was extremely wet as the cows had been walking in it</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> but they thought it was funny when their wellies were being sucked down and they couldn&#039;t move.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was Ciaran who had to abandon his wellies and by now they were all filthy</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> so they washed their clothes in the river laughing so much before going home.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Kelsey also has lots of sleepovers too.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Once she had a bath with candles lit all around her, then went to watch Tide Ray printing photos in his dark room.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We put her camp bed on the landing and left the whole light on all night for her.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Kelsey also has had many many sleepovers here throughout her childhood.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Remembrance Sunday this year coincides with the length of November our Mr&#039;s Day.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It also happens to be 30 years since Ray served in Belize and Northern Ireland</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and 25 years since Ray narrowly missed service in the Falklands War.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> In addition to all that, this year marked the end of the military campaign to maintain peace in Northern Ireland.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> This 38 year campaign was I believe the longest continuous one in British military history.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Ray and I each decided individually that we would like to attend a Remembrance Day parade this year</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and we were delighted when we found out that not only did we both want to go</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> but we had even picked Corris as our preferred venue.</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The service is also one of the first to be held in the Institute since its major renovation</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and reopening to the people of Corris.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Connor and Kieran said they would like to come too so it was quite a family outing setting out from a revile.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> The service was held inside the Institute and conducted by the Reverend Richard Staunton from Upper Corris.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a relatively informal but moving service and not too long.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The boys enjoyed it and behaved extremely well, raising many appreciative comments from other members of the congregation.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Many said how nice it was to see youngsters attending a memorial service of this kind and how smart and polite they were.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> After the service wreaths were laid in the front window and then turned to face outwards so that passers-by could see them properly.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I put a copy of a page from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website with the wreaths.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s noted the death of my great uncle John Corriswin Thomas who was a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He was killed on Friday the 29th of May 1942, aged 26 in Libya.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> His name is inscribed on the 1939 to 1945 war memorial in the outer porch of the Institute.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Although Corriswin Thomas is buried in a war grave in Libya, his name is inscribed on his mother&#039;s gravestone in the Ryoboth Cemetery in Corris.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is what we had come to see.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And to the right of the grave is his sister Ellen Jones and her husband John Gomer Jones.</div><div id="00:09:23.000" class="transcript_line"> These are the boys&#039; great-great-grandparents on their mother&#039;s side.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Corriswin&#039;s mother was their great-great-great-grandmother.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> After inspecting the stones and having a brief lesson in their family history from me,</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> they put their Remembrance Day poppies into a vase in front of the gravestone with Corriswin&#039;s name on it.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We said our farewells to the family and walked back to the car.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> As we were not far from Abel-Leveni, we decided to carry on that direction and show the boys the quarry where their tied ken worked</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and lived for a while when I was a small baby.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> After that, it really was time to go home on this cold November day.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all glad we went though.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> On the 23rd of March 2008, I decided to have an Easter egg hunt in my garden for the grandchildren.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d already bought a bubble machine for them and there were small buckets containing Easter eggs at the co-op where I worked.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Also some cut-out arrows to place around the garden to add to the adventure.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great fun to see little Kelsey&#039;s face when she found an egg.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The boys were very good with Kelsey and I&#039;m sure they let her find most of the eggs to fill her bucket.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when Sharon was little insisting on having her Easter egg on the dressing table in the bedroom.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Patrick wanted his there too, so I gave in, but they had to promise not to eat it until Easter Sunday.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It shows how naive I was because when Sunday arrived, there was only the front half of the egg still intact.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> They had eaten the back halves. I think they were hoping to eat them before I discovered it.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m almost sure it was Sharon&#039;s plan.</div></div></p>
