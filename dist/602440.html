    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So, first, can you repeat your name for the record?</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Derek Hughes.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And are you originally from Swansea?</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;ve lived in Swansea all my life.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> All your life?</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:00:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, when and why did you first become a supporter of Swansea?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was in Swansea Technical School, which is down the bottom of White Street, and we</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> used to have boys from our school that played for the school boys.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Swansea school boys were a terrific team, one needed a shield, more than any other team,</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> except for Manchester.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But then, as we got a bit older, we started to go down to see the Swans, and my great</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> friend in school is elder brother, Scryne, played for the Swans.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So, Billy, Scryne and I, we got to know that we could sell programs for the Swans.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So, we used to sell 20 dozen programs.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They were thruppance each other at first, then six-pence, and used to get so much a</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> dozen, it amounted to something like an old money.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> We sold the 20 dozen, which we would, because in those days, it was always sold out.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you&#039;d get six and eight pence, you know, money, plus the tips.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Which years are we talking about?</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> This is 1948, the season 48, 49, 49, 50, and probably 50, 51.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, if you were lucky, you would get to put the half-time scores up.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the half-time score box was on the small bank, and it was the best view in the ground</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> of the match.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you were able to stay there.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d get five shillings for that.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So, all together, you&#039;d come out of there with about a pound, which was like, I would</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> think, 20 or 30 pounds a day.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a lot of money, really.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And the half-time scores, then, you&#039;d put them up, and people would look at their programme,</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, A, game A, the score.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And as a footnote, whatever the score with Cardiff was, because of the love-hate relationship,</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> it would get a cheer.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So, if Cardiff were winning, hey!</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> If Cardiff were losing, hey!</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s still true to this day.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So, as I say, I used to stand at the top of the road leading down to what was the Arsenal</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> end, and the junction with St Helens Road.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And SEL programme was there, about one o&#039;clock, just before the match.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d started, go down, go in, and you could stand on the touchline and watch the game</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> at the very least.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Good, convenient.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And one morning of the match, I went to get my programme, and 13 and 14, and Rish Carter,</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether you&#039;ve heard of him, but he was the rain moony of the day,</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> rain-frooding London, I think it was Derby, because they were down there playing the Swans.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> He said to me, oh, son, and rub my hair.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I haven&#039;t washed my hair since.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He was an and-a-hole, so Tommy Lawton was a great player.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d meet all these, and they were like all guys, and they were all men.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re good with kids, and we in general, you know.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d give you autographs and you&#039;ve got no problem.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d say that the team in those days would consist of 11 internationals every game.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I went to them every game.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Albeit, they were Irish and Welsh internationals.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> There weren&#039;t any English.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The only Englishman who played regularly for them was a guy by the name of Weston.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He wasn&#039;t an English international, but he played what was in those days centre-half.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And Roy Paul, who played left-half, was the first player from this country to go and play abroad in South America.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> In South America?</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He played for Bogota.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a former Swans player.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Roy Paul went out there for a few years, but whilst he was here, he also played for Wales.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They were, in those days, the Swans, if they lost two of them games, it was a disaster.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they&#039;d lose one, perhaps, or none at all.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Wouldn&#039;t win many home away games.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But the underground would be packed, really.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I don&#039;t know what the capacity was in those days, but just before the match over the Tannoy,</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> they would announce which health and safety now would have a fit.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Please move further down so people could get in, you know, so on the big bank,</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and be sort of standing shoulder-to-shoulder packed in there.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d, us little kids, they&#039;d pass us down over their heads, the crowd would, for us to stand in front.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Happy days, lovely boys.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And great games we saw.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the greatest game you remember?</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I remember seeing John Charles playing down there, and his brother, Mel Charles.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Swans, as they say, I saw them down there when they were promoted then.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on, I told you, stick my son down.</div><div id="00:06:05.000" class="transcript_line"> When, in the season, I think, when they got promoted to what is now the Premiership.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, they finished sixth that year in the Premiership.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, that was the greatest result.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> As a footnote, do you know that they&#039;re in the Guinness Book of Records?</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. What happened was Swans were relegated in consecutive seasons,</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> and had to apply for re-election to the league.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So they applied for the fourth division, they won promotion to the third, the second, and the Premiership in consecutive seasons.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they, I think, they went straight back down again.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And the sad thing about that was that the captain, I&#039;ve forgotten his name now, but he started to play really badly,</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and the crowd was to be wimped.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> A poor man had Parkinson&#039;s disease, and we didn&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a sad note.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But in general, they were lovely days, and we used to enjoy the games.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was another footnote, there&#039;d be one policeman there at the game, and he&#039;d be watching the game.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And the spectators were integrated.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> They waged, and there&#039;d be good-natured banter, but never any violence and fighting.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, when my son was 13, I&#039;d been taking him down.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the skinheads arrived on the scene, and that stopped me taking him.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When was that?</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my son was only 57.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Did that be 1970, say?</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, 70, 71, that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was skinhead.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But in general, the Vetch field, which got its name from?</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve heard a couple of stories about that.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a weed called the Vetch.</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a weed that grows along the seafront.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And the weed is the Vetch.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It is.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the weed field.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Really.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And there we are, really.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m still going to support them.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hoping to get tickets for the game with West Ham.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> My son and I, my son is now 54.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And he and I, so I&#039;ve got to, perhaps you can advise me how I can get hold of some tickets.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I shall phone the office and see.</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the fixture list is coming out Saturday, the 23rd of June, for the coming season.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So once I know when West Ham are down here, I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s more towards the end of the season.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I can get in touch and see if I can get a season ticket or not.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And unfortunately, there&#039;s only a couple of thousand tickets.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite difficult to get a ticket.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know if they&#039;re going to extend the Liberty?</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> There is provision for them to put another tier on the Liberty.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Since they&#039;ve got 40 million, I hope they do that.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they certainly have this approval.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you been to the Liberty Stadium?</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, indeed.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you like it?</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh fabulous, fabulous.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the conditions down the Vetch, you know, were primitive, to say the least.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Also funny, on another footnote, yet another footnote.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Watching the European Championships, which are brilliant, and thoroughly enjoying them.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But the ball, the modern ball, I think is a bit too light.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Balloon.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But the old ball weighed a ton.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember one game where Roy Keane was probably the grandfather of Keane.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know Keane?</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, sure, sure.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He was full back, and Fisher was it, two Irish internationals.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And someone, I think it might have been Tommy Lawton, with a hell of a shot on him.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Hammered the ball towards goal, and Keane met it, and headed it to the halfway line.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And he turned, and it weighed, it was soaking wet.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And it must have weighed about four pounds.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> He turned to his colleague and said, oh that hurt, it stiffened, and fell over backwards, completely unconscious.</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a nice story.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he&#039;s always wonderful.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I know with kids behind that goal, all cheering.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Hey, any of it?</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Last question, you showed me your wallet about West Ham, like do you fancy West Ham as well?</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, another story.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Serves you right.</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was a little boy, after the war, about 1946, I was 11, we started to play football in school again.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Because we didn&#039;t through the war.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother, I was 13, I was in the technical college by this time.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I played before that.</div><div id="00:11:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the technical college, you had to have your own kit to play.</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> If you were picked for the school team, well obviously.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very difficult to get kit, so my mother managed to get me a tight yellow jumper.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were playing in the trials, and they know this place, Ganges, the field, up in town here, playing trials for the school.</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the lads had a West Ham jersey, a proper West Ham jersey.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So he went in my, so we swapped jerseys.</div><div id="00:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, the West Ham jersey, because I was only a little lad, probably came down there.</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been a West Ham supporter ever since.</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a nice story. Thank you. Thanks for sharing it.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> There we are.</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you leave us a contact, like a telephone number or an email, we might contact you again.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s my home number, which you know the code, 01792, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> 893758, so that&#039;s my phone.</div><div id="00:12:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mobile is 07760.</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Take this to the chemist and we&#039;ll make it through.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a pleasure.</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a pleasure for me.</div></div></p>
