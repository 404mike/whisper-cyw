    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I first started here, everybody had to call me Dr Wood, all the patients, you know, and I used to say, I would just call me Pete, and oh, you can&#039;t do that, you know.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So would you have worn a uniform instead?</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Christ no. Well, they tried to make me wear one of these white coats initially, and I remember going down once and somebody saying, I&#039;ll have two cornets and a 99 please.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just selling ice cream.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Because when it first started, the nurses here were in uniforms, you know, and in fairness, there was, I don&#039;t know if it was in Collomage or whatever it was, came from Yorkshire, I can&#039;t remember his name though.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first thing he did was to do away totally with uniforms and there was resistance to it initially, but then, and now, for Christ&#039;s sake, they&#039;re back in uniforms. I can&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Over the years, we worked towards establishing advocacy and self-advocacy.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember one of the first things I did when I was appointed as the general manager stroke clinical director was to call in the then nursing officers and tell them straight away, the practice of putting people in pyjamas will cease immediately.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll say nothing about it because probably you could all be prosecuted for doing what you do, but forget that, just stop it now.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s not the case that you will deny, people used to be denied having their Mars bars and things like that. You do not have that control anymore.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of the, in fairness, a lot of the charge nurses and senior nurses appreciated that and implemented it.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there were a number of key appointments and one of them was the appointment of Dave MacDonald.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Me and Steve Hughes appointed him as head of day services and I think he was a staff nurse when we appointed him as head, you know, there was outrage that he jumped so many, but he was a bit of a maverick, he was a bit of a lad, but his heart was in the right place.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a bright lad because he was into sociology and he understood about cultures and things like that.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he got, like myself, he was interested in advocacy and culture of civil rights and so forth, you know.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, he and I linked with Paul Ramcheram in a university and we had a research project.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I can give my version of that, I&#039;m sure Dave would be far more eloquent.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Basically, one of the things we tried to do is to separate kind of work, stroke, activity, day activities from residential living, just like you and I do.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we have our home lives and we have the place we go to work and okay, you might fraternise with some people from work, but not everybody and they&#039;re two separate.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Initially, people stayed on their villas all day long, many did.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Something called sessional therapy and social therapy was introduced here, but they pushed that much further to day services where people would go and do constructive things.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Preferably work, you know, proper occupational things, but also developing skills and so forth.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And although I had involvement, he always pulls me leg about it.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We started something called room management in the old sessional therapy, which was just getting as many people engaged in doing things, you know.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He used to take the mickey out of me because I was measuring things and drawing graphs and things like that.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I always pulled his leg that he banished me from day services, he didn&#039;t, but essentially he&#039;d got it right.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So we left him to get on with it and for years he&#039;d done an excellent job and he&#039;d done some quite innovative things here.</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, when I first started, there were two large villas, one of them was called Villa 1 and 2, the other was Villa 3 and 4, they were two separate buildings.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had upstairs and downstairs, they had about 60 or more in each and most of the other villas had about 30.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> This was the children&#039;s villa and when I started I think they had about 18.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after about, I&#039;d been here about 10 years, we got a letter of commendation from the Welsh office saying that,</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> pleased that Brynna Neve no longer has any children living in the hospital.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And people said, how did you do it? So I said, well we just sat there and let them become adults because that&#039;s what happened.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t do anything, they just became adults and so there were no longer children, just didn&#039;t admit any more children, you know.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Although for many years people were still admitted here for short-term care and many came in from short-term care and never went out again.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No, when I first started here I always remember, actually in this very villa, Villa 17, the charge nurse bought 30 sweaters in righty sizes but all the same.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t believe it, she just bought all the same for the residents and they were just kept in the drawer and when they were dressing them in the morning,</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> just get one and see if it&#039;ll fit and that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember one of the nurses telling me that one of the villas was for the older ladies and most of them wore dentures, you know.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And her job was to clean the dentures at night and she used to just put them all in one bucket and give them a good shake and then hand them out and they were lucky if they got their own teeth back.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Ridiculous. I don&#039;t want to laugh at it but oh my God, some of the things that used to happen.</div></div></p>
