Were you the child that she was pregnant with?</div><div id="00:02:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:02:05.600" class="transcript_line"> And she locked you and your mother?</div><div id="00:02:06.600" class="transcript_line"> In the bedroom.</div><div id="00:02:07.600" class="transcript_line"> In the bedroom.</div><div id="00:02:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And eventually did things get better?</div><div id="00:02:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, things got better because my dad moved away from Devon.</div><div id="00:02:16.600" class="transcript_line"> And moved away from his family so that he would stop ill treating his wife.</div><div id="00:02:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:02:23.600" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t realise that the Brits were fighting against the Italians weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:02:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Indeed.</div><div id="00:02:32.600" class="transcript_line"> At the time. And I didn&#039;t realise that.</div><div id="00:02:35.600" class="transcript_line"> So as a child you were brought up in a strange dilemma of not knowing quite who you were.</div><div id="00:02:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Especially when your mum was feeling kind of very disconcerted.</div><div id="00:02:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. And she couldn&#039;t speak English you see.</div><div id="00:02:49.600" class="transcript_line"> So were you brought up speaking Italian?</div><div id="00:02:52.600" class="transcript_line"> I could speak a bit of Italian yes. But my mum couldn&#039;t speak English.</div><div id="00:02:57.600" class="transcript_line"> So that must have been very difficult for her.</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Must have been terrible. Did she survive all this? Did she end up a nice rounded easy mum?</div><div id="00:03:09.600" class="transcript_line"> She did. But her dad had an affair with somebody who he eventually married and they had nine children.</div><div id="00:03:19.600" class="transcript_line"> And I think he met her when he was working on the buses. I think he was a bus conductor when he met her.</div><div id="00:03:30.600" class="transcript_line"> And they ended up having a lot of children.</div><div id="00:03:34.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh my God.</div><div id="00:03:36.600" class="transcript_line"> But Jean, his wife, wouldn&#039;t let me have anything to do with the children.</div><div id="00:03:43.600" class="transcript_line"> I tried to see him and everything you know. Because we&#039;re half sisters and brothers.</div><div id="00:03:49.600" class="transcript_line"> But she hated me because I belonged to an Italian that the Brits fought against.</div><div id="00:04:02.600" class="transcript_line"> You really carried a lot of your life. You&#039;ve got over it now.</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah. Oh yeah definitely.</div><div id="00:04:10.600" class="transcript_line"> But my mum was dying emotionally. So well.</div><div id="00:04:15.600" class="transcript_line"> Well listen, thank you so much because that&#039;s a really interesting memory.</div></div></p>
