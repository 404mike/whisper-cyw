    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Carnive Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Venue The Swicker Office.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The date, Monday the 3rd of November.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Amanda Thompson.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Amanda, for the record, could you please spell your name in full?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my name is Amanda, that&#039;s A-M-A-N-D-A.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Thompson, which is spelled T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Amanda, you&#039;ve got a long and venerable history in helping the Carnival come about.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you care to tell us about your initial involvement and that which happened thereafter?</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I came to work for Swicker initially part-time and I started in 1995.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I worked as an assistant to Steve for nine years until 2003.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So I saw quite a few different manifestations of the Cardiff Carnival over that time.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And various different people who worked on it.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And every year an increase in the number of people that took part in it.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Are there any costumes that stick in your mind in particular?</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I have to say, as the co-organiser with myself, we weren&#039;t able to wear costumes because the police never recognised us as the organisers.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But in our picture archive there will certainly be the classic picture of you as, I like to call you Miss Wales, a giant backpack costume.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> In red, white and green, holding two white flags as well.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. That was in 2005.</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the Wales window on the world carnival, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I will have to have a costume next year then to mark the 10th year since then.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was a great opportunity to wear a great big backpack costume, which I think I&#039;ve always wanted to have done that.</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m glad I got a chance to do that.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You did actually let me take part in the carnival in the first year when I joined in 1995.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, excellent. What were you doing in the first one?</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I was so very new and you thought you can&#039;t work on carnival, you can&#039;t go out there, promote carnival, you can&#039;t tell other people why they should get involved unless you&#039;ve experienced it yourself.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what happened. I took part in that. It was one of the dancing groups, if I remember rightly.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I think, you know, the number one thing about carnival is about transformation.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what it does. It transforms you. You never forget that experience.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why people should take part.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite right, too. There&#039;d be lots of different sort of, what should we say, different ways in which parading has always been perennial and will always be part of the carnival experience.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But back in the day, of course, we used to show ourselves on the steps of the National Museum.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I talk to different people, I kind of have a feeling that that was a bit of a golden age.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, can you remember what that felt like?</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a golden age. It wasn&#039;t that staged either.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we did prepare to a certain extent, but a lot of it just kind of happened spontaneously.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We were lucky because very little ever really went wrong.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But some really terrific things came out of that.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But these were in the days, I think, before all the health and safety kicked in and and lots of other restrictions, really.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> There was more space. We had maybe a little bit more freedom to do things.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But now you have, of course, a lot more staged performances, but you also spread it out a lot more.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot more people get to see it now.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You just have to change with the times, really.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think every year we did it. You know, the standard changed.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Things got better and better and better, didn&#039;t they? Absolutely.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the people that you have making the costumes now have sort of picked up on a lot.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what&#039;s gone on in the past and developed their skills.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s really quite a professional.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s what I&#039;m quite telling is that quite a high percentage of the current team of artists</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> certainly the artistic coordinator, Adrian Spinola, have actually grown through the project and started as community participants themselves.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s very real. They were, you know.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Adrian did, didn&#039;t he? Absolutely.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember when he first started, he just kind of walked through the door one day and then took part.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he brought along a few of his neighbors from the same streets that wanted to get involved.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And it just kind of grew and grew and grew.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s he must have learned loads along the way. Yes.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and a lot of it with carnival is trial and error, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh, there&#039;s no right or wrong in carnival.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Other than if the costume works, it works and you&#039;ll know.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll know. Yes.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And also, I think that there&#039;s been so many different influences from different cultures along the years as well.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve had makers on this carnival project that really, you know, they were Caribbean.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve also got a lot from all different parts of Wales and a lot of different other cultures, European and South American and Far East and whatever mixed into it as well.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I feel that after these 25 years, what you&#039;ve got here is just a really unique, genuinely multicultural product for the diff.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, and which in a way is by virtue of being made in Wales by Welsh people of every shape, size, queen, color is definitively Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, carnival camp is a, you know, is where it all happens, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The mini village of creativity.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any fun moments based on?</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s got to be Cattay&#039;s Community Center then, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How on earth did we squash everything into that space?</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Somehow we did. It was always rammed.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The days down at Butetown Youth Pavilion with a lot more space were good.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> We made it here too, didn&#039;t we? One year in the studio here in Chapter.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that. That was that was good. That was quite popular with people.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s gone all over. Where are you now? Fitz Allen High School.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Fitz Allen High School. And it&#039;s gone down very well indeed.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So and the joy of Fitz Allen is that A, we have enough space indoors.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But in order to parade properly, we need to be able to rehearse people out of doors so that they&#039;re dancing into space and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had far more space to actually practice parading, which I think is very important.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Cattay&#039;s was very difficult.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Very difficult. There was nowhere.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Here was very difficult, really, in terms of outdoor space.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Did a bit of. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And we used other venues like Mount Stewart. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> School and that. Yes.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you think of some of the the outcomes down the bay when there was more money around and there were bigger stages and we might have a headliner provided by the by the county council?</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I think the ones that have worked best are the ones that we&#039;ve done that off stage because the stage, a big stage, you can you&#039;ve only got certain sight lines.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of what you&#039;ve done since has really increased the accessibility to people.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess in an ideal world, you&#039;d like a mix of both, wouldn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d maybe like to do a big stage show.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I think in an ideal world would like to.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And not necessarily all the same day.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a point where we before austerity to hold that we were hoping to build it up into a week long week long or at least a long weekend.</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing else. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Which could really lend itself to that because you&#039;ve got so much to show off there.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I think with the big shows, it was a lot more pressure because you had to produce quite a polished finished show.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it would rain.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And Carnival is so spontaneous. Sometimes community participants being spontaneous does not equal a polished performed show.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll have seen a number of carnivals take place in the rain.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah yes.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the the Blue Devils?</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And the fact that we have to.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So these are body painted Blue Devils brought over from Paramen in Trinidad, Spooky and Catcher.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And they taught us a tradition from the Caribbean that involves painting your body blue, surprisingly.</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, in Cardiff, it totally tipped out on the day, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And they had to be followed round by a special team of bucketers with blue dye.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Every five minutes, was it washed off with throw another bucket of blue on them, which I thought was quite funny.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Only in Wales.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely. And also, if you&#039;re looking at the street when the carnivals passed down in the rain, you just got this kind of mix of glitter and paint and bits of costumes that line in the street behind you.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite a nice. It&#039;s good for that, though, isn&#039;t it, Rain?</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It is good for that.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were quite a few years when we didn&#039;t get rained on at all.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m surprised so little was rained off over those years.</div><div id="00:09:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, in many senses, we&#039;ve never been rained off.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, I mean, we&#039;re weatherproof in the sense that it goes ahead, whatever happens.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I mean, people have worked for at least three weeks, you know, and probably longer in their heads to get it together.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And we have that one off opportunity. We don&#039;t have the opportunity to reschedule things, do we?</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, once you&#039;ve got your road closures in place.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember a few and I think this is carnival spin offs really.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Costumes remade costumes with a lot of plastic waterproofing involved.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You remember that we did quite a lot of that.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And here&#039;s the memory that just popped into my head was the course we were preparing down at the town center in Grangetown on the day that Princess Diana died.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And that was announced and that was canceled.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And that it was a re a re a remount for Cardiff Bay Development Corporation.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose if we&#039;re going to tell the story in full, it was the first time we&#039;ve ever tried to remount a carnival parade.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And whilst we&#039;ve had hundreds of enthusiastic carnivalists and community participants in the original parade,</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> we had formed a contract with Cardiff Bay Development Corporation,</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> which we then used the money to actually fund the original parade on the basis that hundreds of these people would come back and do it all again.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I can recall you and I being there and being somewhat bemused and then horrified by the low turnout.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, of course, we turned on the radio to discover that Lady Di had in fact died and public events across the UK were canceled.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Football matches, everything.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So on one level, what can I say other than had that not happened?</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, perhaps all the other Cardiff carnivals might not have happened.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We would have been hard pushed, as you know, because I mean, you were running the books as much as everything else.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> We would have been hard pushed to repay that money to CBDC.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, it&#039;s not our fault really that one.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, absolutely not.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s been such a powerful thing.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing. I am amazed.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, I have to say everybody for posterity.</div><div id="00:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The fact that Steve has kept this going for 25 years,</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> 25 years in the face of quite a lot of adversity often and always a struggle with finances,</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> always a struggle, never really knowing what money is going to be there to do it.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The fact it&#039;s been going for 25 years is an incredible achievement.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And talking of incredible achievements, we wish at this point to award you Amanda Thompson, the honorary title.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> No money goes with it of carnival hero for nine years,</div><div id="00:12:25.000" class="transcript_line"> joining me at the helm in Swicka producing these fabulous events for the community at large.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much indeed. You&#039;re welcome.</div></div></p>
