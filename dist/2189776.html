    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the Longest Yarn.</div><div id="00:00:05.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m speaking to Arianne Strange, who&#039;s going to tell us about her mum.</div><div id="00:00:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Arianne, welcome and I&#039;m dying to hear all your memories.</div><div id="00:00:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, my mum&#039;s name was Joyce May Williams and she lived in Blenai Faustiniogh.</div><div id="00:00:23.040" class="transcript_line"> During the war, they used to make hand grenades in Penrinday Drith.</div><div id="00:00:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Many a nice used to talk about it when I used to work in the local fish and chip shop.</div><div id="00:00:34.960" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go home with a bag of chips and you&#039;d share these stories.</div><div id="00:00:38.400" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d share these stories with your mum and she was happy to talk about it.</div><div id="00:00:43.440" class="transcript_line"> And what special things did she tell you? Because it must have been an amazing time.</div><div id="00:00:48.880" class="transcript_line"> When they made the hand grenades, they used to leave a message inside.</div><div id="00:00:54.320" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think it was the real things they used to put in it.</div><div id="00:00:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Like they would say blonde.</div><div id="00:00:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Blonde when they went.</div><div id="00:01:01.360" class="transcript_line"> And then I remember her saying that one day they had a visit from a soldier whose</div><div id="00:01:08.960" class="transcript_line"> this hand grenade had saved his life.</div><div id="00:01:11.440" class="transcript_line"> And he came to see the woman that had put her name down.</div><div id="00:01:16.160" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d found the note in the hand grenade and she effectively had saved his life.</div><div id="00:01:21.360" class="transcript_line"> Did he say how?</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t say properly.</div><div id="00:01:24.800" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:01:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Well, I can&#039;t remember, you know, but he must have used it.</div><div id="00:01:29.200" class="transcript_line"> And then he found this message and he came to thank her.</div><div id="00:01:32.400" class="transcript_line"> Goodness, that must have been amazing for her.</div><div id="00:01:34.800" class="transcript_line"> What sort of messages did they put in?</div><div id="00:01:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Do you know?</div><div id="00:01:37.200" class="transcript_line"> They used to say blonde, blue eyes, Blenifestiniog and the names.</div><div id="00:01:43.680" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d come and this lady just had a visit.</div><div id="00:01:47.360" class="transcript_line"> Did they all do it?</div><div id="00:01:48.400" class="transcript_line"> Was it quite common or was it just your mum doing it?</div><div id="00:01:52.560" class="transcript_line"> It was quite common.</div><div id="00:01:53.600" class="transcript_line"> And as she was saying, you know, they used to have to wear the turbans</div><div id="00:01:57.760" class="transcript_line"> because the powder that they worked with used to bleach the hair.</div><div id="00:02:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:02:01.760" class="transcript_line"> And did it damage their, did they wear gloves?</div><div id="00:02:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Did it damage their hands?</div><div id="00:02:04.160" class="transcript_line"> They used to wear the overalls and things.</div><div id="00:02:06.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite interesting really.</div><div id="00:02:08.640" class="transcript_line"> How long did she do that for?</div><div id="00:02:11.520" class="transcript_line"> Towards the end of the war because as the war ended,</div><div id="00:02:16.480" class="transcript_line"> I think things became normal, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:02:19.760" class="transcript_line"> And they used to have like the prison of war camps in the area.</div><div id="00:02:23.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And quite a lot of Polish people stayed behind</div><div id="00:02:27.600" class="transcript_line"> and married some of the local women.</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, oh, right.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve got the mixture of the surnames then</div><div id="00:02:32.400" class="transcript_line"> and the Italian prisoner of war as well.</div><div id="00:02:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s quite a mixture of people when I used to go to school.</div><div id="00:02:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Was she very surprised when the soldier arrived at the door</div><div id="00:02:43.360" class="transcript_line"> thanking her for saving his life?</div><div id="00:02:44.880" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t her, it was a friend actually.</div><div id="00:02:46.880" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:02:47.280" class="transcript_line"> But they had a good laugh about it</div><div id="00:02:49.200" class="transcript_line"> and he saw the funny side of things.</div><div id="00:02:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Amazing that he did it.</div><div id="00:02:53.600" class="transcript_line"> So whereabouts did they put these bits of paper on these hand grenades?</div><div id="00:02:57.360" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how safe it would have been.</div><div id="00:02:59.120" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I can&#039;t, I thought they were just sort of spherical</div><div id="00:03:03.360" class="transcript_line"> and did they put them inside or in the box?</div><div id="00:03:06.160" class="transcript_line"> We might have to look into it, won&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:03:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Amazing memory.</div><div id="00:03:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And did she, did all this stop then at the end of the war?</div><div id="00:03:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:13.040" class="transcript_line"> And then came the National Service then, didn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:16.480" class="transcript_line"> And they had a lot of people coming to the area</div><div id="00:03:19.600" class="transcript_line"> because they used to do the training in Transvernay that way.</div><div id="00:03:23.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:03:24.160" class="transcript_line"> And isn&#039;t that factory still there?</div><div id="00:03:27.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still there but it was there for a long long time.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:31.120" class="transcript_line"> And I think there was an explosion once.</div><div id="00:03:33.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh right.</div><div id="00:03:34.720" class="transcript_line"> If I remember rightly.</div><div id="00:03:36.400" class="transcript_line"> So after the war, did your mum then go back to being a housewife</div><div id="00:03:40.160" class="transcript_line"> which was one of the problems, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:42.240" class="transcript_line"> The men came back and the women went back to the kitchen.</div><div id="00:03:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Well she met my dad then and they got married</div><div id="00:03:50.720" class="transcript_line"> and I think she came of as all-time housewife because there was five of us.</div><div id="00:03:54.560" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s such a wonderful story.</div><div id="00:03:56.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s lovely to see that you&#039;ve got these memories really</div><div id="00:03:59.120" class="transcript_line"> when they&#039;re not with you anymore.</div><div id="00:04:00.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I know and she&#039;d be glad to be remembered.</div><div id="00:04:03.680" class="transcript_line"> So anything else that you can...</div><div id="00:04:06.240" class="transcript_line"> No, I do remember my uncle, my mum&#039;s oldest brother.</div><div id="00:04:10.080" class="transcript_line"> He signed up when he was underage.</div><div id="00:04:12.960" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:04:13.600" class="transcript_line"> And he went over to Germany.</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Did he survive?</div><div id="00:04:16.240" class="transcript_line"> He did survive and he got a medal and he never spoke about it.</div><div id="00:04:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Only later on and he just died a couple of years ago in his 90s.</div><div id="00:04:27.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh and he still didn&#039;t speak about it?</div><div id="00:04:29.040" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:04:29.360" class="transcript_line"> Even as some of them as they got older did, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:04:32.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he never spoke about it.</div><div id="00:04:33.520" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:04:34.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh gosh.</div><div id="00:04:36.160" class="transcript_line"> I remember my mum used to say about my grandfather, my Tide,</div><div id="00:04:40.320" class="transcript_line"> that he was gassed during the war, you know,</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s how he died young, he was only in his 30s.</div><div id="00:04:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, so that&#039;s your grandfather in the first World War?</div><div id="00:04:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Goodness.</div><div id="00:04:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a long line of heroes.</div><div id="00:04:52.080" class="transcript_line"> You do remember, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:04:53.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s nice to remember them and that&#039;s what remembrance is all about, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:57.680" class="transcript_line"> So thank you, Erin, for coming in.</div><div id="00:04:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so pleased to speak to you again.</div><div id="00:05:00.880" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
