Because even the milk had to be the right kind of milk for Passover.</div><div id="00:00:41.580" class="transcript_line"> So we used to take a tin can, go down to the farm at the bottom of the road, and we used to milk the cow straight into the can.</div><div id="00:00:50.180" class="transcript_line"> It was to take it home and that&#039;s what we drank, that kind of milk.</div><div id="00:00:55.080" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t get it from the milkman because it wasn&#039;t kosher enough.</div><div id="00:00:58.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing, we were like, King back.</div></div></p>
