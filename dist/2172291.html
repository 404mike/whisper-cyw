    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Malith. This is Paminda and Robin interviewing</div><div id="00:00:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Malith at her home in Swansea. And this is the Tuesday the 16th of July 11.15am. Thank</div><div id="00:00:18.120" class="transcript_line"> you very much, Malith. And really this is a story about you. So let me launch into a</div><div id="00:00:23.960" class="transcript_line"> first question. Your early memories of Kampala and Uganda? Well, I didn&#039;t know any different.</div><div id="00:00:33.240" class="transcript_line"> We lived in a little suburb of Kalolo, which is a beautiful area and beautiful houses,</div><div id="00:00:41.760" class="transcript_line"> not as tall as this house, but lovely houses and bungalow with a beautiful front garden,</div><div id="00:00:48.600" class="transcript_line"> with a pomegranate tree. As you stood in the house, you looked right. There was a pomegranate</div><div id="00:00:54.440" class="transcript_line"> tree on the right. So very happy memories, actually. I was born in 61, after a very,</div><div id="00:01:03.320" class="transcript_line"> very long wait. Mum and Dad had been married for about 20 odd years, so it was a really</div><div id="00:01:08.080" class="transcript_line"> lovely welcome surprise. And I was told that, because I didn&#039;t know where babies came from,</div><div id="00:01:14.160" class="transcript_line"> because we didn&#039;t talk about things like that. So I was saying, how did I come to be here</div><div id="00:01:19.320" class="transcript_line"> to my mum? So I was defrosted from a hospital freezer. So I was really, you know, and I</div><div id="00:01:25.320" class="transcript_line"> said, why did you pick me? Well, I was the prettiest one there. So, you know, that&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:29.880" class="transcript_line"> how it all happened. And of course, that was perfectly fine by me. And yeah, beautiful</div><div id="00:01:36.680" class="transcript_line"> in a lovely home in Kallolo on Bukota Street and pomegranate tree on the right, lovely</div><div id="00:01:46.680" class="transcript_line"> garden. And then we used to grow pineapple. My sister and I would grow pineapple, but</div><div id="00:01:52.280" class="transcript_line"> of course we kept digging it up to see how it&#039;s grown. So we used to disturb them too</div><div id="00:01:56.480" class="transcript_line"> much. And then on the back there was papaya tree growing, which didn&#039;t always give us</div><div id="00:02:02.720" class="transcript_line"> a lot of fruit, but the pomegranate was really abundant. And we also had a beautiful scented,</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> fragrant frangipani tree called Champa. It&#039;s a Champa family. And when the flowers used</div><div id="00:02:19.880" class="transcript_line"> to fall, my sister and I used to trample on them, but they&#039;d always bounce back up. So</div><div id="00:02:24.040" class="transcript_line"> it was like they were very forgiving, I used to say. The flowers are very forgiving, but</div><div id="00:02:28.480" class="transcript_line"> the scent was absolutely gorgeous. And the market, which was superb, was just down the</div><div id="00:02:37.760" class="transcript_line"> road really on Bukota Street, out of the house left, and you were in the beautiful market.</div><div id="00:02:43.520" class="transcript_line"> And my sister and I used to go down with my mum, and we used to, if we were lucky, we</div><div id="00:02:49.400" class="transcript_line"> would be given, treated to a sugar cane juice. So there was a man with a mangle, and the</div><div id="00:02:55.520" class="transcript_line"> juice would drop into a bucket, and we would have that while mum did her shopping, and</div><div id="00:03:01.440" class="transcript_line"> everybody carried a bit back. I was the eldest with my sister and myself, so I carried more.</div><div id="00:03:08.160" class="transcript_line"> But the African women would come to sell their green beans and what have you, and their wares,</div><div id="00:03:13.920" class="transcript_line"> or the makai, which is the corn, all with the head and everything on, which is wonderful</div><div id="00:03:20.840" class="transcript_line"> really, and a lot of sound noise, and then we&#039;d have a good time, go along the little</div><div id="00:03:27.120" class="transcript_line"> market street, and then come back home with them, having had our treat. And sometimes</div><div id="00:03:31.720" class="transcript_line"> we used to get lucky, and there would be a candy floss machine, which was amazing to</div><div id="00:03:37.880" class="transcript_line"> see candy floss being made. You know, this is sort of 60s, 70s, so it was really exciting</div><div id="00:03:43.880" class="transcript_line"> to see a candy floss machine. We didn&#039;t have a lot of toys, but we had a very happy childhood,</div><div id="00:03:51.120" class="transcript_line"> as we thought, and on the back of the house was a big yard really, so we were very naughty,</div><div id="00:03:59.120" class="transcript_line"> and it was a flat roof, so we lived in an extended family, which is quite normal because</div><div id="00:04:05.680" class="transcript_line"> my father and my mother, that marriage was a second marriage for both of them, because</div><div id="00:04:12.200" class="transcript_line"> both their partners had died. And what had happened was my dad got widowed, his first</div><div id="00:04:21.120" class="transcript_line"> wife died in a fire, and the boys that they had were only one and a half and two and a</div><div id="00:04:27.400" class="transcript_line"> half years old, so in those days it was okay to remarry under those circumstances, and</div><div id="00:04:34.400" class="transcript_line"> my dad was making a lot of money, he was one of the wealthiest men in Uganda, he was listed,</div><div id="00:04:46.480" class="transcript_line"> and so he went to India to find a bride to Gujarat, and he went to Rawal, because my</div><div id="00:04:54.400" class="transcript_line"> dad originally was from Singara, but the farm would always fail, there wasn&#039;t enough crops,</div><div id="00:05:01.880" class="transcript_line"> and their father, their parents said, you&#039;ve just got to try and get out of here, you know,</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t survive like this, so the four brothers, my father was the second of the four brothers,</div><div id="00:05:13.400" class="transcript_line"> they all went to Uganda and tried to make a success of their lives, and my dad was one</div><div id="00:05:19.080" class="transcript_line"> of the most successful people, but without a wife and two small children, there was an</div><div id="00:05:26.480" class="transcript_line"> accident with a fire, that&#039;s how she died, because in those days you&#039;d have, you didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:05:32.880" class="transcript_line"> have like an iron that plugged in into electrics, you had a coal iron, and also there was open</div><div id="00:05:39.480" class="transcript_line"> fuel there, with open source of liquid fuel, and of course we had staff, which sounds terrible,</div><div id="00:05:47.520" class="transcript_line"> but we had a lot of Africans working for us, like my sister and I also had a maid, and</div><div id="00:05:53.720" class="transcript_line"> that was all quite normal, because we employed people, and when Mrs Rupert really had the</div><div id="00:06:01.160" class="transcript_line"> first caught fire, she was wearing her sari, but instead of what she should have done was</div><div id="00:06:07.080" class="transcript_line"> took her sari off as it caught fire, but you wouldn&#039;t undress in front of the staff, African</div><div id="00:06:13.520" class="transcript_line"> male staff, or even female staff, so what she did was she ran to the outside loo to</div><div id="00:06:19.400" class="transcript_line"> try and get the water from the loo, but there wasn&#039;t enough water in there, and as a result</div><div id="00:06:25.040" class="transcript_line"> she burned to death, so it was a dreadful tragedy, so my father was left with two small</div><div id="00:06:33.240" class="transcript_line"> boys, one and a half and two and a half year old, and so he went to India to find a bride,</div><div id="00:06:40.640" class="transcript_line"> which was again quite normal in those days, and he heard about a woman whose husband had</div><div id="00:06:46.480" class="transcript_line"> also died, and my mother&#039;s first husband, I asked her, she was married at something</div><div id="00:06:52.240" class="transcript_line"> like fifteen, because in those days, that&#039;s girls, as soon as they reach puberty, you</div><div id="00:06:58.120" class="transcript_line"> had to get them quickly married and settled, and I said to my mother, what happened to</div><div id="00:07:04.680" class="transcript_line"> your first husband, because I was, I think even as a small child I was probably a little</div><div id="00:07:09.880" class="transcript_line"> researcher growing, so I was always asking questions, and I was just relentless, and</div><div id="00:07:16.200" class="transcript_line"> I think she didn&#039;t know quite how to deal with me, so in the end she would answer me,</div><div id="00:07:21.360" class="transcript_line"> she was very reluctant to talk about negative things, because I think obviously looking</div><div id="00:07:25.440" class="transcript_line"> back as an adult now, it must have brought up terrible memories for her, so I said, what</div><div id="00:07:31.180" class="transcript_line"> happened to your husband, and she used to say, oh he was a lovely man, we were only</div><div id="00:07:36.280" class="transcript_line"> married nine months, and she used to say, you know where the wee wee comes from, because</div><div id="00:07:41.480" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t know anatomical words, and you know where a man does his wee wee, well instead</div><div id="00:07:47.880" class="transcript_line"> of wee wee there would be a lot of blood coming out, so I worked out, it was, and she said</div><div id="00:07:52.600" class="transcript_line"> it was a cancer, so I worked out it might have been a bladder cancer or something like</div><div id="00:07:56.880" class="transcript_line"> that, anyway within nine months of being married, he was gone, and of course she now as a widow</div><div id="00:08:04.880" class="transcript_line"> living with her siblings, she had two brothers and about four sisters or so, she was, it</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> was going to be difficult to marry her off, because once you&#039;ve been married the once,</div><div id="00:08:21.480" class="transcript_line"> nobody wants you again, because your clastor is like second hand goods if you like, and</div><div id="00:08:29.480" class="transcript_line"> so when my dad went to India and heard about this woman who&#039;d lost her husband, he went</div><div id="00:08:37.400" class="transcript_line"> and put a proposal forward that I will marry her, I&#039;ve got two small boys, one and a half,</div><div id="00:08:43.760" class="transcript_line"> two and a half, and my mother had the proposal through her parents, my mother had never met</div><div id="00:08:51.200" class="transcript_line"> my dad, and my mother said no, I am not going to, because she&#039;d never been out of the village,</div><div id="00:08:57.520" class="transcript_line"> so she was very frightened, I mean she&#039;s only a fifteen year old who&#039;s lost her husband,</div><div id="00:09:03.360" class="transcript_line"> and she said no I&#039;m not going to Africa, you know I&#039;m too scared, I want to stay with</div><div id="00:09:08.280" class="transcript_line"> you, obviously mum and dad, and the village, she&#039;d never been outside of Rawal, and money</div><div id="00:09:14.940" class="transcript_line"> was tight, and she was another mouth to feed, so she just refused, but they had to sit her</div><div id="00:09:22.460" class="transcript_line"> down and say to her look we&#039;ve got all your other sisters and we&#039;ve got two brothers here,</div><div id="00:09:28.460" class="transcript_line"> and basically you&#039;re another mouth to feed and nobody else is going to actually marry</div><div id="00:09:34.020" class="transcript_line"> you because you&#039;ve been widowed now, and widowhood in India is well seen as, it&#039;s almost like</div><div id="00:09:41.280" class="transcript_line"> the woman is blamed for it, like bad karma, unfortunately, and there&#039;s a huge stigma about</div><div id="00:09:49.280" class="transcript_line"> losing your husband, and as you know in the years before there was the Sati, which is</div><div id="00:09:56.280" class="transcript_line"> where the widow actually burnt herself as well while the husband was on fire, being</div><div id="00:10:02.280" class="transcript_line"> cremated, and that had to be stopped then, and that practice even carries on in rural</div><div id="00:10:10.280" class="transcript_line"> India now, so they had to sit my mother down, the parents, and said basically be honest</div><div id="00:10:18.280" class="transcript_line"> with her and say to her you&#039;re another mouth to feed and we actually are struggling here,</div><div id="00:10:25.480" class="transcript_line"> and my mother was persuaded to marry my dad, and the only time, the first time she saw</div><div id="00:10:32.520" class="transcript_line"> him was on her wedding day, and she went to raise the garland of flowers up round her</div><div id="00:10:38.600" class="transcript_line"> neck and she looked at him and she was really horrified because he had spotty skin, and</div><div id="00:10:44.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve inherited that, so it was a bit like oh my god mum and dad what have you done to</div><div id="00:10:50.080" class="transcript_line"> me, you know, but she couldn&#039;t say anything and she was married, and off she went on a</div><div id="00:10:57.640" class="transcript_line"> long journey to East Africa having never left the village her entire life, and the fact</div><div id="00:11:04.680" class="transcript_line"> that the other clinch point was the fact that my dad said I don&#039;t want any dowry either,</div><div id="00:11:10.960" class="transcript_line"> so that was a big bonus because you had to give a dowry if you wanted to marry your daughter</div><div id="00:11:15.600" class="transcript_line"> off, and sometimes in these days often the groom will ask for a car or even a house or</div><div id="00:11:23.400" class="transcript_line"> whatever before I&#039;ll marry your daughter, anyway dad was self-made and he said I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:11:29.360" class="transcript_line"> want anything, I don&#039;t need anything, I just want somebody, my wife, to bring up my two</div><div id="00:11:35.480" class="transcript_line"> boys and be a wife. Mum and dad went and they married in Kenya and then they settled in</div><div id="00:11:42.800" class="transcript_line"> Uganda, and he was under a lot of pressure with his work but mum brought up the two boys</div><div id="00:11:50.280" class="transcript_line"> as her own, and she always thought of them as her own boys, and so it was an incredible</div><div id="00:11:56.360" class="transcript_line"> surprise some twenty years on in her forties she managed to get pregnant, because she always</div><div id="00:12:03.200" class="transcript_line"> believed in God, very religious spiritual woman and the guru that she followed had</div><div id="00:12:10.520" class="transcript_line"> said to her to start fasting on a Thursday, that was his special day for fasting, and</div><div id="00:12:19.600" class="transcript_line"> I used to go to a lot of the prayers with her as I grew up and she always used to say</div><div id="00:12:24.320" class="transcript_line"> this is the guru who made you happen, and she always credited him with that, and I used</div><div id="00:12:31.680" class="transcript_line"> to go to all the temples with her and the bhajans singing and I used to sing as well</div><div id="00:12:38.680" class="transcript_line"> bhajans and hymns as equivalent to, and then two years after that my little brother was</div><div id="00:12:49.520" class="transcript_line"> born but he was still born and meanwhile my older brother, older brother, two brothers</div><div id="00:12:57.520" class="transcript_line"> we called him suru, he had children as well and the son that they had Jethan was literally</div><div id="00:13:06.880" class="transcript_line"> nine months difference or so between me and him because I came very late, so I was his</div><div id="00:13:12.280" class="transcript_line"> auntie but I was only literally months older than him, and then when my mum got pregnant</div><div id="00:13:19.280" class="transcript_line"> again, two years later with a son, which would have been an incredible achievement,</div><div id="00:13:27.640" class="transcript_line"> especially as boys are more revered than girls, my younger brother was also getting married</div><div id="00:13:34.640" class="transcript_line"> his name was Ratilal and my mother sort of said that I&#039;m struggling with the pregnancy</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> in my forties and I&#039;ve got this pregnancy again and asked if he would delay him from</div><div id="00:13:49.280" class="transcript_line"> his wedding so that the baby would be born and they refused to delay the wedding, he</div><div id="00:13:59.800" class="transcript_line"> refused to delay the wedding, he didn&#039;t want to wait and as a result when the baby was</div><div id="00:14:06.800" class="transcript_line"> born, the child, he was perfect, my mother would cry about it, he was perfect but he</div><div id="00:14:12.080" class="transcript_line"> was still born because obviously Indian weddings, the attitude was oh well don&#039;t do it, don&#039;t</div><div id="00:14:19.440" class="transcript_line"> do anything and just sit down but as the mother of the groom you couldn&#039;t just sit down and</div><div id="00:14:24.840" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got hundreds and hundreds of relatives coming from all over and there&#039;s lots of food,</div><div id="00:14:31.560" class="transcript_line"> lots of preparations, prayers, different ceremonies to the wedding, it&#039;s not like just a registered</div><div id="00:14:39.440" class="transcript_line"> wedding like it is in often cases and she lost the baby and I did say to her mum could</div><div id="00:14:47.440" class="transcript_line"> you not have said delay the big wedding and she said I did try but they didn&#039;t want</div><div id="00:14:55.480" class="transcript_line"> to wait, he didn&#039;t want to wait so she always said he was perfect, your little brother,</div><div id="00:15:01.600" class="transcript_line"> perfectly born and her lips would turn downwards but she would find it very difficult to cry</div><div id="00:15:09.320" class="transcript_line"> as I do actually, I don&#039;t show my emotions that easily so then two years after that she</div><div id="00:15:15.120" class="transcript_line"> was pregnant again and my little sister was born, another baby then was found in the hospital</div><div id="00:15:20.040" class="transcript_line"> freezer defrosted and brought home and she also was brought home because she was the</div><div id="00:15:25.280" class="transcript_line"> prettiest one in the freezer so of course it was all very magical and it was only later</div><div id="00:15:33.040" class="transcript_line"> I realised the consequence of losing the brother because obviously the male would have been</div><div id="00:15:39.920" class="transcript_line"> an amazing asset to have with us and he would have had status whereas girls don&#039;t have</div><div id="00:15:46.080" class="transcript_line"> the status and everything seemed to be fine, we lived with my older brother Suru and he</div><div id="00:15:53.680" class="transcript_line"> had four children, three boys and a girl, we grew up together and then when I was aged</div><div id="00:16:01.320" class="transcript_line"> eight basically my partnership with grief began because my dad had a sudden heart attack</div><div id="00:16:08.220" class="transcript_line"> and I was at school and one of my cousins Ramneek came to fetch me and wouldn&#039;t tell</div><div id="00:16:16.380" class="transcript_line"> me what&#039;s wrong so I was saying what is wrong, what is wrong and he just wouldn&#039;t say what</div><div id="00:16:20.940" class="transcript_line"> was wrong, I knew something was wrong but I was just insistent but he wouldn&#039;t say and</div><div id="00:16:26.660" class="transcript_line"> he just let me find out so once we got to the house, we got back to the house there</div><div id="00:16:32.100" class="transcript_line"> was loads of shoes outside and I knew something terrible had happened and my dad had come</div><div id="00:16:38.300" class="transcript_line"> home, this was 1969 and one of the staff, I think it was Francisco, the male staff,</div><div id="00:16:49.300" class="transcript_line"> we had the African Ugandan guy had helped him up the steps and into bed and I could</div><div id="00:16:56.540" class="transcript_line"> see my dad jolting up and shaking and then my mum would push him down again to lie down</div><div id="00:17:02.620" class="transcript_line"> and he jolts up and shake and I didn&#039;t realise but that was a heart attack he was having</div><div id="00:17:09.420" class="transcript_line"> and there wasn&#039;t a lot of medicine in those days, you didn&#039;t know what had caused it and</div><div id="00:17:18.220" class="transcript_line"> he died and Chetan who was my brother&#039;s oldest son and I understood but the youngsters didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:17:26.380" class="transcript_line"> understand as much so we were just screaming and crying because we were really close to</div><div id="00:17:31.420" class="transcript_line"> dad and that was his grandad, my dad and so we were locked in the bathroom because we</div><div id="00:17:36.940" class="transcript_line"> were making such a racket and then we were taken out and then we were sent off to one</div><div id="00:17:43.940" class="transcript_line"> of my uncle&#039;s houses, just tears and snot all running down, not understanding but knew</div><div id="00:17:51.500" class="transcript_line"> that this was terrible catastrophe and then eventually we were, when all the ceremonies</div><div id="00:17:58.500" class="transcript_line"> had finished, the funeral ceremonies and the bhajans and the goodbyes and we were taken</div><div id="00:18:07.060" class="transcript_line"> back to Kalolo and there then in the lino somebody, one of the ladies said when there</div><div id="00:18:14.860" class="transcript_line"> were people sitting all, my dad was on the bed and people were sitting all across the</div><div id="00:18:18.940" class="transcript_line"> floor cross legged and all the way and there was hundreds of shoes there because you don&#039;t</div><div id="00:18:27.460" class="transcript_line"> take shoes into somebody&#039;s house especially at a time like that because obviously the</div><div id="00:18:32.140" class="transcript_line"> gods and goddesses are coming to collect the departed one and somebody said oh you know</div><div id="00:18:37.540" class="transcript_line"> I can see the gods here and somebody actually could see in the lino a shape of one of the</div><div id="00:18:43.580" class="transcript_line"> gods and everybody then could see it so we all had to clear this area because then it</div><div id="00:18:49.300" class="transcript_line"> was quite evident that the gods had come to collect my dad so it was seen as a blessing</div><div id="00:18:54.900" class="transcript_line"> and then that area was decorated with the red, the kanku, the blessed mark and even</div><div id="00:19:04.260" class="transcript_line"> I could see the skirt and I realize now later on as a researcher when one person sees it,</div><div id="00:19:11.660" class="transcript_line"> other people do see it but I didn&#039;t know that at the time but it seemed to give my</div><div id="00:19:15.580" class="transcript_line"> mum a lot of comfort and then I realized dad was taken away but only the men go to the</div><div id="00:19:22.740" class="transcript_line"> crematorium, the women aren&#039;t allowed because we&#039;re too delicate and it&#039;s not the done</div><div id="00:19:27.620" class="transcript_line"> thing and the first born son would light the funeral pyre and so dad was taken away and</div><div id="00:19:35.620" class="transcript_line"> then as dad was taken away mum was surrounded by lots of women, all the women were left</div><div id="00:19:42.620" class="transcript_line"> behind and mum wanted me with her, somebody else was looking after my little sister and</div><div id="00:19:48.620" class="transcript_line"> then we went back into the house and my mum was crying and saying I may as well be dead</div><div id="00:19:53.620" class="transcript_line"> myself and I may as well just kill myself now, I&#039;ve got nothing now and all the women</div><div id="00:20:01.620" class="transcript_line"> and this was in front of me as well and I said to mum you&#039;ve got me mum, you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:20:06.620" class="transcript_line"> us mum and then when we went back up into the backyard then I noticed one of the women&#039;s</div><div id="00:20:15.620" class="transcript_line"> arms reached out and wiped away my mum&#039;s red dot on her forehead to signify her wedding,</div><div id="00:20:22.620" class="transcript_line"> her marriage, you know a sign of pride and then somebody took off all her colourful bangles</div><div id="00:20:30.540" class="transcript_line"> and got a stone and smashed them up because from now on mum wouldn&#039;t be allowed to wear</div><div id="00:20:35.980" class="transcript_line"> colourful clothes so I saw a big transition in her clothes and any of her jewellery and</div><div id="00:20:43.260" class="transcript_line"> so she could wear a plain gold bangle and very plain things but she wouldn&#039;t be allowed</div><div id="00:20:47.780" class="transcript_line"> to have decorations so she always had to dress in white now and that would signify her status</div><div id="00:20:53.420" class="transcript_line"> as a widow and it started our partnership with grief basically so that was the end of</div><div id="00:21:03.060" class="transcript_line"> the security we&#039;d known because we&#039;d had four bed roomed house and a big lounge in</div><div id="00:21:09.420" class="transcript_line"> the middle and then corridors in the front and the back so it was quite a nice big house</div><div id="00:21:15.540" class="transcript_line"> and my side of the family, my mum and dad and my sister and I, we slept on the one side</div><div id="00:21:22.220" class="transcript_line"> and my step brother, his wife and four kids were on the other side and it was fine for</div><div id="00:21:31.780" class="transcript_line"> a few weeks and then as often happens in the case of widowhood because the father&#039;s gone</div><div id="00:21:38.780" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve lost your status, my brother then, Suru, had never really worked and my dad couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:21:46.780" class="transcript_line"> get him to work. He liked running the casino, my dad had a casino as well as the business</div><div id="00:21:55.540" class="transcript_line"> and he had a taxi rank as well so he was happy with the casino side of it, gambling machine</div><div id="00:22:03.540" class="transcript_line"> but he wasn&#039;t really into working with my dad&#039;s shops and things on South Street in</div><div id="00:22:10.540" class="transcript_line"> Kampala and within a few months he then just left and we didn&#039;t even see them go because</div><div id="00:22:21.260" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d have been really upset, my sister and I and my mother if we&#039;d seen them go but</div><div id="00:22:25.340" class="transcript_line"> it was all obviously packed, everything was packed, arranged and we woke up one day to</div><div id="00:22:30.980" class="transcript_line"> start our play programme as you know you always have to play or run or catch tiggy or share</div><div id="00:22:37.860" class="transcript_line"> the bicycle out and like Chetan and I would ride the bicycle and we&#039;d have these games</div><div id="00:22:45.060" class="transcript_line"> where if it&#039;s a Bollywood song, if it&#039;s a woman singing I got a chance to go on the</div><div id="00:22:49.500" class="transcript_line"> bicycle but if it&#039;s a man singing he had a chance but then if there was three or four</div><div id="00:22:54.460" class="transcript_line"> women singing in a row he would cry so then you know we had to make another rule well</div><div id="00:23:00.140" class="transcript_line"> if it&#039;s a man and a woman singing you can have a go then but the youngsters couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:23:05.060" class="transcript_line"> get on the bicycle so we&#039;d take them round the yard, our backyard with us, one of us</div><div id="00:23:12.060" class="transcript_line"> holding and the other one guiding the cycle well all that went, everything was just gone</div><div id="00:23:17.420" class="transcript_line"> and we woke up one day and then gone and there were no way to be seen and my brother and</div><div id="00:23:28.700" class="transcript_line"> my sister-in-law Sila did come back and take us to the cinemas because we always used</div><div id="00:23:33.020" class="transcript_line"> to go to open air audience on the weekend but they would never, you know they never</div><div id="00:23:40.060" class="transcript_line"> lived there again basically so they were using dad&#039;s money basically to rent in town in</div><div id="00:23:47.300" class="transcript_line"> Kampala so but they did still come back to take us to the cinema and it was Bollywood</div><div id="00:23:54.780" class="transcript_line"> movies, open air so it was all singing, dancing, happy, always a happy ending and somehow all</div><div id="00:24:00.780" class="transcript_line"> the difficulties are overcome and love always triumphs somehow between a man and a woman</div><div id="00:24:07.500" class="transcript_line"> but it also became quite evident that women once you&#039;ve lost your dad and you&#039;ve not</div><div id="00:24:18.940" class="transcript_line"> got a brother who cares for you because the other brother Ratila who had a business sugar</div><div id="00:24:24.980" class="transcript_line"> factory in Lugazi and dad had always insisted on education, he was very pro-education and</div><div id="00:24:33.860" class="transcript_line"> he had sent my younger of the two brothers Ratila to Germany and India and he&#039;d done</div><div id="00:24:41.180" class="transcript_line"> his engineering degree and he&#039;d travelled and then he&#039;d set up this sugar factory and</div><div id="00:24:48.740" class="transcript_line"> my dad obviously helped him with all that but he lived in Lugazi so he was never really</div><div id="00:24:58.460" class="transcript_line"> close by anywhere apart from family occasions when he&#039;d come and you know it was all,</div><div id="00:25:04.860" class="transcript_line"> he was still obviously very much part of the family and what does happen with once you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:25:11.860" class="transcript_line"> lost your dad and your husband is as a woman and especially with brothers who are not interested</div><div id="00:25:18.860" class="transcript_line"> in taking care of you or looking after you is you are open to abuse and assault and it&#039;s</div><div id="00:25:25.940" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry to say this but it&#039;s quite a common thing in the culture so we were extremely</div><div id="00:25:32.980" class="transcript_line"> vulnerable but they also, when my step-brother left, said to me, I&#039;m going to go to the</div><div id="00:25:41.860" class="transcript_line"> school, my step-brother left, he also took away Francisco, our most trusted male staff</div><div id="00:25:47.580" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d had from when we were small. So now if we wanted somebody, mum had to appoint this</div><div id="00:25:55.700" class="transcript_line"> other staff but he was always drinking and drunk and he would always try and grab us</div><div id="00:26:01.540" class="transcript_line"> and so as soon as it got dusky we&#039;d have to lock the doors, we couldn&#039;t play in the yard</div><div id="00:26:07.220" class="transcript_line"> anymore and he used to keep banging on the kitchen which was at the back and we would</div><div id="00:26:13.700" class="transcript_line"> be curious as two little girls seeing why is he banging, what&#039;s happening and we&#039;d</div><div id="00:26:18.700" class="transcript_line"> open the wooden shutters and every window had bars on it so for security, metal bars</div><div id="00:26:25.700" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d be like trying to put his hand through the metal bars to try and grab us and there</div><div id="00:26:31.900" class="transcript_line"> was also assaults from the family as well, the extended families but that was, I didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:39.780" class="transcript_line"> realise at the time, I just couldn&#039;t believe people were treating me differently and eyeing</div><div id="00:26:46.020" class="transcript_line"> me up differently because I was the older of the two and I was beginning to, I was about</div><div id="00:26:52.060" class="transcript_line"> you know 11, 10, 11 so I was beginning to turn really and it wasn&#039;t even safe to go</div><div id="00:26:59.540" class="transcript_line"> and visit the relatives because you could be isolated and assaulted and unfortunately</div><div id="00:27:05.340" class="transcript_line"> that was common then as it turned out and I didn&#039;t have any awareness of any of that</div><div id="00:27:13.740" class="transcript_line"> and then it was frightening but then we had one of the cousins who, my dad had insisted</div><div id="00:27:22.900" class="transcript_line"> because the other part, one part of the family actually worked with dad and a lot of the</div><div id="00:27:28.540" class="transcript_line"> cousins worked with dad in the shop, he had a trade shop and all sorts of goods he used</div><div id="00:27:38.300" class="transcript_line"> to sell in his business and this part of the family, also actually the sons, the cousins</div><div id="00:27:47.580" class="transcript_line"> worked with dad because obviously my stepbrother, Suru, you could never get him to do any work,</div><div id="00:27:52.500" class="transcript_line"> he just liked the casino work and running around basically and one of the sons, my dad</div><div id="00:28:00.420" class="transcript_line"> had always said, oh you know because his brother had died so he wanted to make sure he looked</div><div id="00:28:04.940" class="transcript_line"> after all the sons and I never met my uncle, Kalyanji, but his sons were, always worked</div><div id="00:28:14.620" class="transcript_line"> in the shop with dad and one of the sons, he said I&#039;m going to make sure I pay for</div><div id="00:28:20.820" class="transcript_line"> his education and I&#039;m going to make sure, because Ratilal, my own stepbrother, went</div><div id="00:28:27.260" class="transcript_line"> to India and Germany and he said I&#039;m going to make sure I help him with his education</div><div id="00:28:33.900" class="transcript_line"> so we&#039;ve got a doctor in the family so he paid for all his medical training and supported</div><div id="00:28:38.700" class="transcript_line"> him to get his medical degree in India and he came back qualified as a doctor but we</div><div id="00:28:45.700" class="transcript_line"> were safe then or so we thought and then the other frightening incident that happened</div><div id="00:28:52.700" class="transcript_line"> was the military were doing rounds when Idi Amin came up, came into power saying the Asians</div><div id="00:29:00.060" class="transcript_line"> are leeching the country and they don&#039;t care about you and all this business and the</div><div id="00:29:07.060" class="transcript_line"> military were coming round and you&#039;d have a warning to say they&#039;re coming so you had</div><div id="00:29:15.060" class="transcript_line"> to make sure, they come with guns, it&#039;s not like the military in this country and you&#039;d</div><div id="00:29:18.060" class="transcript_line"> have to make sure you had wads of money ready to hand over and once they&#039;re banged on the</div><div id="00:29:25.060" class="transcript_line"> door you had to open the door and the military were doing rounds and the military was doing</div><div id="00:29:32.060" class="transcript_line"> the rounds and Mrs Manick had said to mum just lock your door and stay indoors and can</div><div id="00:29:43.100" class="transcript_line"> you get one of your cousins, one of the boys from the extended family to come and spend</div><div id="00:29:48.740" class="transcript_line"> the night with you because we knew that night the military were coming. We were absolutely</div><div id="00:29:54.500" class="transcript_line"> petrified and you know don&#039;t open the door she said to my mum because she was afraid</div><div id="00:30:02.180" class="transcript_line"> I was scared as well because mum could be quite feisty as well, not educated but she</div><div id="00:30:07.780" class="transcript_line"> stood her ground, she was quite strong lady in many ways which I didn&#039;t appreciate at</div><div id="00:30:14.460" class="transcript_line"> the time when I&#039;ve seen other widows just being kicked about, I didn&#039;t realise how strong</div><div id="00:30:21.040" class="transcript_line"> mum had been and what it must have took. She&#039;d also been suicidal as well and after dad died</div><div id="00:30:29.040" class="transcript_line"> she was so alone and deserted by the family, by all the extended family that one day she</div><div id="00:30:36.040" class="transcript_line"> said, I was only a child, I was only something like nine and she said I&#039;m going to kill</div><div id="00:30:43.040" class="transcript_line"> myself and we were just at the back area near the kitchen and she started to put, she put,</div><div id="00:30:50.040" class="transcript_line"> she stuck her dress, you know her sari with a match and so I cried and cried and I tried,</div><div id="00:30:57.040" class="transcript_line"> you know I didn&#039;t know what to do so I&#039;d be like flapping at the flames and she kept</div><div id="00:31:00.680" class="transcript_line"> saying that and then she&#039;d come to her mind, she was so depressed and she&#039;d put the fire</div><div id="00:31:06.840" class="transcript_line"> out and she&#039;d dab herself down and she burned quite a few of her saris by doing that, the</div><div id="00:31:12.840" class="transcript_line"> corners of her saris, her pala and my sister had also witnessed this so she then one day</div><div id="00:31:20.840" class="transcript_line"> had also been playing with matches in the back bathroom and she was only between four</div><div id="00:31:26.440" class="transcript_line"> and five and then she came out screaming, we were at the back, it was daylight and my</div><div id="00:31:31.740" class="transcript_line"> sister came out of the bathroom screaming and crying and I looked at her and the flames</div><div id="00:31:37.260" class="transcript_line"> were on the dress and there was a sink there and my mother was scooping up water from the</div><div id="00:31:41.840" class="transcript_line"> sink and throwing it at my sister but it wasn&#039;t working, the flames were burning her white</div><div id="00:31:47.440" class="transcript_line"> dress and I just didn&#039;t know what to do, I mean it was only nine and not seen a fire,</div><div id="00:31:53.440" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t know what to do and so my mum just said go and ask next door neighbour what to</div><div id="00:31:58.440" class="transcript_line"> do so I ran to the man next door and he was in the back yard and I said what do I do,</div><div id="00:32:04.680" class="transcript_line"> what do I do, my sister&#039;s on fire, throwing water at her isn&#039;t working and my mum was</div><div id="00:32:11.680" class="transcript_line"> panicking, I was in a total panic and he said oh lay her down on the ground with the blanket,</div><div id="00:32:17.000" class="transcript_line"> wrap it over and just lay her down so I ran back in and I was just screaming get a blanket,</div><div id="00:32:23.320" class="transcript_line"> get a blanket, get a blanket so mum went and got a blanket and I grabbed it and I rolled</div><div id="00:32:28.000" class="transcript_line"> her in it and laid her down to put the flames out and then I was just crying and screaming</div><div id="00:32:33.800" class="transcript_line"> at my mum then in return and I said, I didn&#039;t know how to express myself very well but I</div><div id="00:32:39.240" class="transcript_line"> remember saying to her you taught her how to do this, watching you, you taught her,</div><div id="00:32:45.240" class="transcript_line"> and after that mum never threatened suicide again and I was crying and I said to mum you</div><div id="00:32:51.000" class="transcript_line"> know don&#039;t you love us but she never did that again.</div></div></p>
