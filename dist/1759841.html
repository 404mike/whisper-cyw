    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m just going to say at the top that my name is Marsha Armani and I&#039;m here with Laura Phelps</div><div id="00:00:06.120" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re here to interview Tim Rooney and it is, we&#039;re at your home in Marshfields.</div><div id="00:00:12.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:00:13.160" class="transcript_line"> And it is Tuesday July the 16th 2019.</div><div id="00:00:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Okay so I&#039;m just going to pop this down here then Tim.</div><div id="00:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> Tim Rooney that&#039;s a good Irish name.</div><div id="00:00:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah this is originally Irish.</div><div id="00:00:28.840" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got some relatives in Northern Ireland.</div><div id="00:00:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:31.840" class="transcript_line"> So I wonder if you could just start off, could you just introduce yourself?</div><div id="00:00:34.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah well I was born in Northern Ireland and born in 1956 and obviously my dad had a farm</div><div id="00:00:46.440" class="transcript_line"> here then which was bigger than it is now.</div><div id="00:00:52.080" class="transcript_line"> And when I got to school, I wasn&#039;t very keen on school, always had horses, always been</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> involved with horses, started riding point to pointing when I was 14.</div><div id="00:01:07.600" class="transcript_line"> And I did like metal work in school so it seemed the obvious thing to do to start an</div><div id="00:01:11.960" class="transcript_line"> apprenticeship when I was 16 which I did out at Penhow and did my four year apprenticeship</div><div id="00:01:18.800" class="transcript_line"> then and got my certificate, my registered shoeing smith and I&#039;ve been shoeing horses</div><div id="00:01:26.280" class="transcript_line"> ever since.</div><div id="00:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had 15 apprentices, my son being one of them.</div><div id="00:01:32.760" class="transcript_line"> My first apprentice was Billy Crothers from Rumney and Cardiff and he became world champion</div><div id="00:01:39.680" class="transcript_line"> farrier on five occasions.</div><div id="00:01:45.480" class="transcript_line"> My second apprentice was Hayden Price who&#039;s been Olympic farrier a couple of occasions.</div><div id="00:01:54.200" class="transcript_line"> My third apprentice was Andy Martin who&#039;s now got a practice near Chippen Norton in</div><div id="00:02:01.680" class="transcript_line"> the Cotswolds.</div><div id="00:02:02.680" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s an eminent farrier and judge and trains race horses as well.</div><div id="00:02:09.320" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, quite a few apprentices over the years.</div><div id="00:02:13.320" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say what&#039;s a stable?</div><div id="00:02:15.120" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s a stable?</div><div id="00:02:16.120" class="transcript_line"> A talent?</div><div id="00:02:17.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a bit obvious isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:19.840" class="transcript_line"> They all started here, they all did their apprenticeships with me and spent four years</div><div id="00:02:23.600" class="transcript_line"> here.</div><div id="00:02:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Who did you train under then?</div><div id="00:02:26.400" class="transcript_line"> I trained under a chap by the name of Christopher Bell who was a Scotsman who lived at Penhow</div><div id="00:02:32.960" class="transcript_line"> and he married, the old forge at Penhow was run by a gentleman by the name of Percy Townsend</div><div id="00:02:41.200" class="transcript_line"> and Percy Townsend had four daughters and Lou Bell married one of his daughters and</div><div id="00:02:46.440" class="transcript_line"> moved from Invergordon in Scotland down to live in South Wales and I did my apprenticeship</div><div id="00:02:52.800" class="transcript_line"> with Lou.</div><div id="00:02:54.080" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of, what did you learn from him that you&#039;re clearly passing down?</div><div id="00:02:59.040" class="transcript_line"> What are you, what have you learned from him?</div><div id="00:03:00.440" class="transcript_line"> Work ethic I think as much as anything else and to do quality work which is the most important</div><div id="00:03:08.920" class="transcript_line"> thing because horses have to keep, they have to keep horses on the road, keep them sound.</div><div id="00:03:14.800" class="transcript_line"> Why did you do your apprenticeship at Penhow?</div><div id="00:03:17.480" class="transcript_line"> Tell us what Penhow is.</div><div id="00:03:18.480" class="transcript_line"> Penhow is only a small village between Newport and Chepstow on the A48 and there were very</div><div id="00:03:25.480" class="transcript_line"> few forges or farriers around when I started in 1972 and there were very few farriers around.</div><div id="00:03:38.440" class="transcript_line"> I think between Chepstow and Cowbridge there were four guys shewing horses, now there&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:43.200" class="transcript_line"> something like 50 shewing horses.</div><div id="00:03:47.040" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s changed a bit, we&#039;ve trained too many now.</div><div id="00:03:51.640" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s changed though in the equine world, why are there more?</div><div id="00:03:55.200" class="transcript_line"> Well horses became a lot more popular for riding, for recreational riding, you know</div><div id="00:04:03.720" class="transcript_line"> as far as ponies in pony club, riding clubs, general riding and a lot of sort of livery</div><div id="00:04:12.480" class="transcript_line"> yards now have got all weather surfaces where people don&#039;t have to go riding out on the</div><div id="00:04:20.040" class="transcript_line"> roads because the roads are getting so busy now in this area, as in most areas, that it&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:26.840" class="transcript_line"> more dangerous to ride on the road than it used to be.</div><div id="00:04:30.520" class="transcript_line"> Lord Trudiga, he was a huntsman wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He was the master of the hunt, he wasn&#039;t a huntsman.</div><div id="00:04:39.280" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the difference?</div><div id="00:04:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Well the master is the boss and oversees everything, the huntsman is the man that works with the</div><div id="00:04:45.240" class="transcript_line"> hounds and actually hunts the hounds.</div><div id="00:04:48.280" class="transcript_line"> So they would have used horses?</div><div id="00:04:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes definitely.</div><div id="00:04:52.640" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m just trying to think why there are so few farriers.</div><div id="00:04:57.080" class="transcript_line"> Well there were a few farriers then.</div><div id="00:05:00.720" class="transcript_line"> So you started in 1972 and there were only four then?</div><div id="00:05:05.240" class="transcript_line"> In this area, yes.</div><div id="00:05:06.640" class="transcript_line"> So when Lord Trudiga was hunting that was much further back?</div><div id="00:05:10.240" class="transcript_line"> There was, yes definitely and you see when Lord Trudiga was hunting it would have been</div><div id="00:05:16.400" class="transcript_line"> pre-second world war.</div><div id="00:05:19.920" class="transcript_line"> The Trudiga estate got split up and it was bought by the Eagle Star Insurance Company</div><div id="00:05:28.840" class="transcript_line"> and all the farms were then individually sold off by the Eagle Star Insurance Company, that&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:35.080" class="transcript_line"> who my dad bought this place off the Eagle Star in 1949 I think it was.</div><div id="00:05:43.200" class="transcript_line"> Had been Trudiga estate for?</div><div id="00:05:44.560" class="transcript_line"> This was all Trudiga estate owned farms, the lot.</div><div id="00:05:48.360" class="transcript_line"> Most of the houses in this area and I think the most easterly farm on the Trudiga estate</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> is the other side of Penhow in fact on the A48 and they owned, the estate was massive.</div><div id="00:06:04.600" class="transcript_line"> You familiar with this area?</div><div id="00:06:06.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:07.240" class="transcript_line"> And Rupera, you&#039;ve been up to Rupera Castle, well that was Lord Trudiga as well.</div><div id="00:06:12.160" class="transcript_line"> The Llanrumney Hall, so all of Llanrumney and Rumney, Lower Macken, Rupera, Macken,</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Baselick, Ruderrin, because the original kennels for the estate were in Baselick because they</div><div id="00:06:32.800" class="transcript_line"> never had the kennels too close to the main house because of the smell of the hounds and</div><div id="00:06:41.480" class="transcript_line"> so as it was then you&#039;d sort of come out of the Trudiga house and hack up to what is</div><div id="00:06:49.480" class="transcript_line"> Junction 28 now and then go up Forge Lane and the kennels were just at the top of Forge</div><div id="00:06:55.080" class="transcript_line"> Lane on the right hand side.</div><div id="00:06:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And when you go to the top of Forge Lane and you&#039;ve got the Trudiga arms in front of you,</div><div id="00:07:04.160" class="transcript_line"> there were workshops to the left of that as well.</div><div id="00:07:06.280" class="transcript_line"> My goodness, there must have been so many people who were tenants of the Trudiga estate.</div><div id="00:07:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:14.640" class="transcript_line"> So I wonder if we can just go back a little bit and talk about your parents, who were they?</div><div id="00:07:20.240" class="transcript_line"> My mum and dad came from St Andrews and Dines Powys.</div><div id="00:07:25.920" class="transcript_line"> My mum was from Dines Powys, dad was St Andrews, two villages a mile apart.</div><div id="00:07:31.960" class="transcript_line"> My dad was one of five, my mum was one of ten.</div><div id="00:07:38.560" class="transcript_line"> They got married and had my older brother just as the Second World War began and then</div><div id="00:07:47.760" class="transcript_line"> dad was away in the army, he was in the Royal Artillery and spent about four years in Burma</div><div id="00:07:54.040" class="transcript_line"> during the Second World War.</div><div id="00:07:55.040" class="transcript_line"> What, he was a prisoner?</div><div id="00:07:56.600" class="transcript_line"> No, he was a captain in the Royal Artillery, so he was in Burma.</div><div id="00:08:01.320" class="transcript_line"> So he was...</div><div id="00:08:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Fighting the Japs.</div><div id="00:08:03.720" class="transcript_line"> Goodness, what was his name?</div><div id="00:08:07.040" class="transcript_line"> Gustafus Emerson Rooney.</div><div id="00:08:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:08:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Why, what a name!</div><div id="00:08:12.120" class="transcript_line"> Did he use that name, that kind of in common?</div><div id="00:08:15.920" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t like it, so he got it shortened and everyone called him Govo.</div><div id="00:08:20.880" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:08:21.880" class="transcript_line"> I wonder what his parents were thinking.</div><div id="00:08:25.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, his mother was an Emerson, his father was Rooney, so they were all named...</div><div id="00:08:33.360" class="transcript_line"> My uncles were Dennis Emerson Rooney, Bernard Emerson Rooney, William Emerson Rooney and</div><div id="00:08:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Gustafus Emerson Rooney.</div><div id="00:08:40.200" class="transcript_line"> Gosh!</div><div id="00:08:41.200" class="transcript_line"> He totally got the best name.</div><div id="00:08:44.200" class="transcript_line"> Wow, Govo.</div><div id="00:08:45.680" class="transcript_line"> So he spent four years in Burma with the Royal Artillery.</div><div id="00:08:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Did he ever talk about his experiences?</div><div id="00:08:52.960" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot.</div><div id="00:08:55.240" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot, no.</div><div id="00:08:59.440" class="transcript_line"> He came back with a samurai sword that he&#039;d actually taken off a dead Japanese officer.</div><div id="00:09:08.640" class="transcript_line"> And when dad died, mum was short of money, so it got sold in Sotheby&#039;s because the inside</div><div id="00:09:17.080" class="transcript_line"> of the scabbard has the Japanese, the history of that particular family and their family</div><div id="00:09:23.080" class="transcript_line"> tree on it, inscribed on it.</div><div id="00:09:25.440" class="transcript_line"> So it made then in 1974, that made about £750, which was quite a lot of money.</div><div id="00:09:33.680" class="transcript_line"> We used to play with it as kids.</div><div id="00:09:36.440" class="transcript_line"> What a story!</div><div id="00:09:39.440" class="transcript_line"> Did he say anything else about his experiences?</div><div id="00:09:46.640" class="transcript_line"> Just how nasty the Japanese were to fight.</div><div id="00:09:51.880" class="transcript_line"> They were not nice people.</div><div id="00:09:55.840" class="transcript_line"> Then obviously things have changed over the years, but no, he didn&#039;t say a great deal.</div><div id="00:10:02.080" class="transcript_line"> And your mother then, tell us about her, what was her name?</div><div id="00:10:05.400" class="transcript_line"> Margaret Winifred.</div><div id="00:10:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Well that&#039;s more like it.</div><div id="00:10:08.400" class="transcript_line"> Margaret Winifred Hill was her maiden name.</div><div id="00:10:11.800" class="transcript_line"> And as I say, she was one of ten, six girls, four boys, and they were born in St Andrews.</div><div id="00:10:18.120" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather, her dad, was Walter Hill who started Hill&#039;s Transport in Cardiff, which</div><div id="00:10:25.800" class="transcript_line"> became quite a big firm.</div><div id="00:10:30.680" class="transcript_line"> But then he died, he died before I was born.</div><div id="00:10:33.400" class="transcript_line"> Well both my grandfathers did.</div><div id="00:10:37.440" class="transcript_line"> But he died without making a will, so there were family feuds for many years after that.</div><div id="00:10:44.480" class="transcript_line"> So do you know how your parents met?</div><div id="00:10:47.160" class="transcript_line"> In a village in Dinness Parish.</div><div id="00:10:49.640" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t picture where Dinness Parish is.</div><div id="00:10:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Right, Leckwith.</div><div id="00:10:54.760" class="transcript_line"> Is it Cardiff?</div><div id="00:10:57.480" class="transcript_line"> Just to the west of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:10:59.480" class="transcript_line"> Ah, OK.</div><div id="00:11:00.480" class="transcript_line"> Wenvo?</div><div id="00:11:01.480" class="transcript_line"> Do you know Wenvo?</div><div id="00:11:03.920" class="transcript_line"> When you go from Wenvo going towards Roos Airport, when you get to where Wenvo Garden</div><div id="00:11:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Centre is, if you turn left at there, then the first place, the village you&#039;ll come to</div><div id="00:11:16.480" class="transcript_line"> is St Andrews, and the next one is Dinness Parish, and then Leckwith, and you come down</div><div id="00:11:22.340" class="transcript_line"> into Cardiff by Cardiff City Stadium.</div><div id="00:11:25.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, OK.</div><div id="00:11:26.480" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:11:27.480" class="transcript_line"> So what brought your parents here?</div><div id="00:11:29.480" class="transcript_line"> And were they from farming stock?</div><div id="00:11:33.040" class="transcript_line"> Dad was from farming stock, and then was obviously transport business.</div><div id="00:11:40.200" class="transcript_line"> And obviously because these farms were being sold up then by the insurance company, that</div><div id="00:11:46.320" class="transcript_line"> was what brought him here.</div><div id="00:11:49.240" class="transcript_line"> So Dinness Parish, what&#039;s the landscape there?</div><div id="00:11:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Is it flat?</div><div id="00:11:53.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:11:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Is it hilly?</div><div id="00:11:55.680" class="transcript_line"> No, hilly.</div><div id="00:11:56.680" class="transcript_line"> OK, so this would have been completely different landscape.</div><div id="00:11:58.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:59.160" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember him ever talking about maybe the challenges of that?</div><div id="00:12:04.200" class="transcript_line"> I think they had a lot of work to do when they first came here, as far as sort of taking</div><div id="00:12:11.400" class="transcript_line"> concerned.</div><div id="00:12:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Cleaning out reams, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:12:17.400" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;ve been trying to explain to Laura, because neither of us are from the area, so</div><div id="00:12:21.920" class="transcript_line"> explain to Laura, you know, the unique drainage system here.</div><div id="00:12:27.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:12:28.440" class="transcript_line"> So, but if you&#039;re, it must be quite a challenge for a farmer coming from a hilly area to come</div><div id="00:12:36.440" class="transcript_line"> here.</div><div id="00:12:37.480" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, because you&#039;ve got to, I mean, fortunately we&#039;re not too bad here.</div><div id="00:12:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Once you get just slightly lower down, then it&#039;s, the boundaries of the fields are all</div><div id="00:12:50.080" class="transcript_line"> reams.</div><div id="00:12:51.080" class="transcript_line"> Here, we&#039;ve still got quite a few hedges.</div><div id="00:12:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Why is that then?</div><div id="00:12:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Why have you got hedges and not reams?</div><div id="00:12:57.140" class="transcript_line"> Because we&#039;re just above the structure of the reams.</div><div id="00:13:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:13:02.080" class="transcript_line"> OK, I&#039;ve never thought about that.</div><div id="00:13:06.720" class="transcript_line"> So when your parents came here, did it look different?</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Well all the farm buildings were that side then.</div><div id="00:13:16.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:13:17.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:18.880" class="transcript_line"> These were, Dad sold this for development in 1970.</div><div id="00:13:29.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, around about 1970 I suppose.</div><div id="00:13:35.760" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of farm was it?</div><div id="00:13:38.200" class="transcript_line"> Milking cows, sheep, pigs, chickens.</div><div id="00:13:45.600" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a milk rang then?</div><div id="00:13:47.320" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:13:48.440" class="transcript_line"> But in the village here then we had a dairy.</div><div id="00:13:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I know.</div><div id="00:13:52.280" class="transcript_line"> Where, you&#039;ve got, just the other side of the shop was Cambroy and United Dairies.</div><div id="00:13:59.160" class="transcript_line"> And all the local farmers, there were a structure of very small farms all around here.</div><div id="00:14:05.360" class="transcript_line"> And I think, we sat down and worked it out a few years ago, that between Rumney and Newport,</div><div id="00:14:13.960" class="transcript_line"> below the A48 there were something like 40 milk producing farms, but now there are three.</div><div id="00:14:22.960" class="transcript_line"> They probably milk the same amount of cows, because they&#039;re all huge farming units.</div><div id="00:14:29.440" class="transcript_line"> Whereas these were all small farms, pretty much self-sufficient, because we&#039;d have 20</div><div id="00:14:37.160" class="transcript_line"> odd cows and some sheep, some pigs, some chickens, maybe fatten a couple of turkeys up for Christmas,</div><div id="00:14:45.840" class="transcript_line"> that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:14:46.840" class="transcript_line"> I wonder if your father ever used the livestock market on, is it Tindy Brown?</div><div id="00:14:51.400" class="transcript_line"> Tindy Brown?</div><div id="00:14:52.600" class="transcript_line"> He could, I never knew it as Timo Lane, I always knew it as Market Road.</div><div id="00:14:59.200" class="transcript_line"> Because the market was, and the market, I can&#039;t remember the market being in use, but</div><div id="00:15:05.560" class="transcript_line"> he could when he first came here, because they&#039;d be able to drive the stock to market then.</div><div id="00:15:12.240" class="transcript_line"> When you say drive, do you mean on the road?</div><div id="00:15:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:16.760" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, there&#039;d be milking cows walking up and down here all the time, going from</div><div id="00:15:21.920" class="transcript_line"> the field to the dairy back and forth.</div><div id="00:15:26.200" class="transcript_line"> That was the norm in all villages.</div><div id="00:15:29.080" class="transcript_line"> When you say to the dairy, you mean...</div><div id="00:15:31.320" class="transcript_line"> To be milked.</div><div id="00:15:32.320" class="transcript_line"> ...milking parlour.</div><div id="00:15:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:34.320" class="transcript_line"> So you had your own milking parlour, did you?</div><div id="00:15:35.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was a cowshed there and that&#039;s where they were all milked.</div><div id="00:15:39.640" class="transcript_line"> So our milk was in a cooler here, and that&#039;s the only milk we ever had.</div><div id="00:15:48.120" class="transcript_line"> Went into a churn?</div><div id="00:15:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, we&#039;d have to take the churns down to the dairy every morning.</div><div id="00:15:57.880" class="transcript_line"> So do you know, we&#039;ve just turned off the main road to come up here, how much has that</div><div id="00:16:02.440" class="transcript_line"> road, for example, changed?</div><div id="00:16:05.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, this village in Castleton has changed considerably.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was, between here and the Gateway Chapel just down the road, there were no houses.</div><div id="00:16:21.200" class="transcript_line"> And then from the Gateway Chapel to the Mason&#039;s Arms pub, there were no bungalows.</div><div id="00:16:28.280" class="transcript_line"> So it has changed considerably, the village.</div><div id="00:16:31.960" class="transcript_line"> It was just a really rural...</div><div id="00:16:33.800" class="transcript_line"> Very rural, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:36.600" class="transcript_line"> So it was all farmland?</div><div id="00:16:41.320" class="transcript_line"> Pretty much so, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:44.320" class="transcript_line"> I was just taking Laura down towards Rumney, you know, where the meals are.</div><div id="00:16:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:50.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, I&#039;ve spoken to people who said that was all farmland in recent...</div><div id="00:16:56.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, all small holdings, all small farms, small holders.</div><div id="00:17:01.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:03.280" class="transcript_line"> So your mother pitched in on the farm as well as she helped out?</div><div id="00:17:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, she was a good worker, Mum.</div><div id="00:17:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Had to be up at six every morning to get out there and help.</div><div id="00:17:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Because Dad, he had what&#039;s called farmer&#039;s lung, which is from the spores in Faustey</div><div id="00:17:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Hay, and that affected his breathing quite considerably.</div><div id="00:17:29.840" class="transcript_line"> So he couldn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:17:32.640" class="transcript_line"> From a young age, I could never remember him being able to do very much physical work.</div><div id="00:17:38.360" class="transcript_line"> So Mum had to do quite a lot.</div><div id="00:17:40.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:17:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm.</div><div id="00:17:42.920" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m the youngest of five.</div><div id="00:17:47.760" class="transcript_line"> So as soon as I was old enough, I was helping as well.</div><div id="00:17:50.560" class="transcript_line"> You just all had to pitch in?</div><div id="00:17:53.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:17:54.360" class="transcript_line"> So before we move back onto you, Tim, are there any other memories or anecdotes your</div><div id="00:18:01.880" class="transcript_line"> parents told you about running a farm here?</div><div id="00:18:05.680" class="transcript_line"> It was hard work, but quite rewarding.</div><div id="00:18:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Because the big garden where my son&#039;s house is there now, that was our lawn and garden.</div><div id="00:18:18.600" class="transcript_line"> For the house here.</div><div id="00:18:20.920" class="transcript_line"> And so we&#039;d grow the veg.</div><div id="00:18:25.560" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d be always food here.</div><div id="00:18:27.160" class="transcript_line"> There was an orchard just down there.</div><div id="00:18:28.840" class="transcript_line"> There was another orchard just up here.</div><div id="00:18:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So we always had plenty of apples, pears, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:18:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Cider?</div><div id="00:18:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Cider?</div><div id="00:18:37.720" class="transcript_line"> No, no, we didn&#039;t make any cider.</div><div id="00:18:40.120" class="transcript_line"> Could have done.</div><div id="00:18:41.120" class="transcript_line"> The old man was more of a whiskey drinker than a cider drinker.</div><div id="00:18:44.120" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t have a mobile cider press around you?</div><div id="00:18:47.400" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:48.400" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:49.400" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:18:50.400" class="transcript_line"> Did the...</div><div id="00:18:51.400" class="transcript_line"> What about haymaking time and stuff?</div><div id="00:18:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:54.440" class="transcript_line"> Was that something... did your parents have to do the old-fashioned rick and...</div><div id="00:18:58.360" class="transcript_line"> They did before they moved here.</div><div id="00:19:01.120" class="transcript_line"> By the time they&#039;d moved here, which is, as I say, after the Second World War, small bales</div><div id="00:19:07.200" class="transcript_line"> of hay were being produced then.</div><div id="00:19:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Did your father then, when your parents came here, did they have workhorses?</div><div id="00:19:16.160" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:18.160" class="transcript_line"> He had an old tractor.</div><div id="00:19:19.640" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:19:20.640" class="transcript_line"> That was quite early for a tractor then.</div><div id="00:19:22.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, they started before the Second World War, the tractors.</div><div id="00:19:26.640" class="transcript_line"> They started in the sort of 20s and 30s, but they didn&#039;t come into a lot of use until the</div><div id="00:19:32.920" class="transcript_line"> early 50s.</div><div id="00:19:33.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:34.920" class="transcript_line"> So he was quite early then, really, wasn&#039;t he?</div><div id="00:19:36.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:37.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:38.920" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s your earliest memory here?</div><div id="00:19:40.920" class="transcript_line"> This has been your home forever?</div><div id="00:19:43.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it has.</div><div id="00:19:44.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:45.360" class="transcript_line"> When my wife and I got married, we moved to a little house in Baislech and then moved</div><div id="00:19:51.320" class="transcript_line"> back to Mallards Reach and then ended up buying this back off my mum, because she was getting</div><div id="00:19:59.360" class="transcript_line"> elderly, living on her own, because Dad died when I was 18, so...</div><div id="00:20:06.120" class="transcript_line"> So she found it tough, and so I bought it back off her.</div><div id="00:20:11.480" class="transcript_line"> So it was still a small holding then?</div><div id="00:20:13.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:14.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Mum would rent the ground out just to get a bit of small income.</div><div id="00:20:22.840" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ve always had the forge there, so obviously I would pay Mum rent for the forge until we</div><div id="00:20:29.480" class="transcript_line"> bought it.</div><div id="00:20:30.480" class="transcript_line"> So did you go to Marshfield School?</div><div id="00:20:32.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:33.520" class="transcript_line"> So what was that like?</div><div id="00:20:34.520" class="transcript_line"> So you were there...</div><div id="00:20:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was an old church school, Marshfield School.</div><div id="00:20:39.080" class="transcript_line"> Where Marshfield School is now, the building just the other side of the traffic calming,</div><div id="00:20:46.840" class="transcript_line"> was the church school, that was the school.</div><div id="00:20:49.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:20:50.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:51.040" class="transcript_line"> Ah.</div><div id="00:20:52.040" class="transcript_line"> Erm, let me see...</div><div id="00:20:56.040" class="transcript_line"> So you would have been there in the 60s?</div><div id="00:20:57.680" class="transcript_line"> That would have been...</div><div id="00:20:59.960" class="transcript_line"> I started in Marshfield School in 1961, and I moved then up to Beysleyck when I was 11,</div><div id="00:21:09.880" class="transcript_line"> so 1967.</div><div id="00:21:10.880" class="transcript_line"> So what was school like then?</div><div id="00:21:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Marshfield School was quite a nice little school.</div><div id="00:21:21.640" class="transcript_line"> Erm, you start off in what was the Infants, and then moved up three classes before moving</div><div id="00:21:30.800" class="transcript_line"> on to Beysleyck.</div><div id="00:21:33.320" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do as a child down here?</div><div id="00:21:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Played quite a lot.</div><div id="00:21:38.480" class="transcript_line"> What sort of things did you do?</div><div id="00:21:40.840" class="transcript_line"> Climbing trees, making dens.</div><div id="00:21:44.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever play in the rings?</div><div id="00:21:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Erm, no, not really.</div><div id="00:21:52.160" class="transcript_line"> No, between here and the county club in St Melons, which is only three quarters of a</div><div id="00:21:58.680" class="transcript_line"> mile as the crow flies directly across there, erm, and Dad rented a lot of ground there</div><div id="00:22:04.760" class="transcript_line"> off the guy who bought the golf course back in the 1940s.</div><div id="00:22:15.160" class="transcript_line"> That would have been off the... presumably that was off the Trinidad estate as well.</div><div id="00:22:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Erm, a chap by the name of Gwyn Davies, and he and Dad were quite friendly, so Dad used</div><div id="00:22:25.280" class="transcript_line"> to rent the ground off him, and we had the grazing on the golf course during the winter</div><div id="00:22:30.200" class="transcript_line"> as well.</div><div id="00:22:31.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:22:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Because golf wasn&#039;t the sport or pastime that it is now, and during the winter no one would</div><div id="00:22:38.680" class="transcript_line"> play golf.</div><div id="00:22:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Do you like graze grazing?</div><div id="00:22:40.680" class="transcript_line"> So we grazed sheep up there.</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness, can you imagine?</div><div id="00:22:43.360" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d use what were the roughs then.</div><div id="00:22:47.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean the roughs are about this high now.</div><div id="00:22:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Do you play golf at all?</div><div id="00:22:51.280" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:22:52.280" class="transcript_line"> Erm, but all golf courses now, the grass, there&#039;s no long grass anywhere, whereas when</div><div id="00:22:59.480" class="transcript_line"> we had the ground up there, erm, we&#039;d make hay off the roughs in the summer time, and</div><div id="00:23:07.800" class="transcript_line"> graze sheep in the winter time.</div><div id="00:23:09.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh that&#039;s hilarious.</div><div id="00:23:10.960" class="transcript_line"> Of course, when we were making hay then, cutting the grass, you&#039;d be finding lots of golf balls,</div><div id="00:23:16.400" class="transcript_line"> so we&#039;d go and sell them as kids, we&#039;d go and sell them back to the golfers.</div><div id="00:23:19.800" class="transcript_line"> What did the golfers ever have anything to say about that?</div><div id="00:23:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Were they ever up there at all?</div><div id="00:23:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they didn&#039;t know anything different, that wasn&#039;t the norm then.</div><div id="00:23:27.760" class="transcript_line"> What about the seawall?</div><div id="00:23:30.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go down there?</div><div id="00:23:31.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to go down there as kids playing.</div><div id="00:23:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Which part of the seawall did you go down?</div><div id="00:23:35.640" class="transcript_line"> By the lighthouse.</div><div id="00:23:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Okay, and what sort of things did you get up to down there?</div><div id="00:23:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Catching, erm, crabs.</div><div id="00:23:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:23:44.480" class="transcript_line"> What, going down on the foreshore then?</div><div id="00:23:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:46.960" class="transcript_line"> So was that ever, were your parents ever concerned about you being down there?</div><div id="00:23:52.680" class="transcript_line"> They generally took us down there.</div><div id="00:23:55.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh!</div><div id="00:23:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha ha ha!</div><div id="00:23:58.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, because you have to know the tides though, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:24:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Because it has to be...</div><div id="00:24:03.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, the tides can be very dangerous, so we&#039;d never go too far from the seawall.</div><div id="00:24:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:24:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever go out and find anything?</div><div id="00:24:13.280" class="transcript_line"> Find anything, as in?</div><div id="00:24:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Clay pipes, cannon balls?</div><div id="00:24:19.240" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:24:20.240" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:24:21.240" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:24:22.240" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever swim in the water there?</div><div id="00:24:24.440" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:24:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:24:26.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s muddy.</div><div id="00:24:27.440" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha!</div><div id="00:24:28.440" class="transcript_line"> Well, people have done, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:24:30.440" class="transcript_line"> My dad would take us down to cold nap baths to swim.</div><div id="00:24:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:24:36.040" class="transcript_line"> Ha ha ha ha!</div><div id="00:24:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Well, I learnt to swim in the swimming pool in the county club.</div><div id="00:24:40.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:24:41.840" class="transcript_line"> It was a private house then, and it had an indoor pool, which were very rare things in</div><div id="00:24:47.400" class="transcript_line"> those days.</div><div id="00:24:48.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, quite posh.</div><div id="00:24:49.400" class="transcript_line"> Hmm, very posh.</div><div id="00:24:50.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got your own now though, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:24:51.400" class="transcript_line"> A hot tub, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:52.400" class="transcript_line"> So we had just been down at the lighthouse in the big chalet park there.</div><div id="00:24:57.880" class="transcript_line"> What was there before that was established?</div><div id="00:24:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, I can&#039;t remember it anything other than a caravan park, because there were kids that</div><div id="00:25:05.320" class="transcript_line"> came to Marshfield School from the caravan site there.</div><div id="00:25:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:25:09.760" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t a gypsy travelling?</div><div id="00:25:12.960" class="transcript_line"> No, never.</div><div id="00:25:13.960" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:25:16.080" class="transcript_line"> So, do you know there&#039;s lots of gypsy travelling camps around?</div><div id="00:25:20.600" class="transcript_line"> Have they always been down here?</div><div id="00:25:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:25:23.000" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They were situated between Peterstone, as in by the six bells, and Rumney.</div><div id="00:25:35.520" class="transcript_line"> The verges there are very, very wide.</div><div id="00:25:37.240" class="transcript_line"> Now this horse is tethered out there.</div><div id="00:25:39.640" class="transcript_line"> But there would be a couple of Romany gypsies with their caravans parked on some of those</div><div id="00:25:45.160" class="transcript_line"> wide verges, and that&#039;s where they lived.</div><div id="00:25:50.920" class="transcript_line"> But the gypsy camps now, they&#039;re Irish tinkers, they&#039;re not real old gypsies.</div><div id="00:25:56.000" class="transcript_line"> These were the proper old Romany gypsies.</div><div id="00:25:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, what, with roll-top caravans?</div><div id="00:25:59.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, roll-top caravans, slightly darker skins, and the ladies would come round selling pegs</div><div id="00:26:08.880" class="transcript_line"> or telling fortunes.</div><div id="00:26:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:11.280" class="transcript_line"> So, would never turn them away.</div><div id="00:26:14.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh, really?</div><div id="00:26:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:26:16.200" class="transcript_line"> So, let&#039;s just go back to when you started to become, when did you first think about</div><div id="00:26:22.360" class="transcript_line"> becoming a farrier?</div><div id="00:26:23.360" class="transcript_line"> When I was in school and Dad, I wanted to leave school and he said, well, you&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:26:28.400" class="transcript_line"> to go to work.</div><div id="00:26:30.640" class="transcript_line"> And that was really the only thing that appealed to me.</div><div id="00:26:33.400" class="transcript_line"> So, I started my apprenticeship with the idea of doing my apprenticeship and then doing</div><div id="00:26:38.160" class="transcript_line"> something else afterwards.</div><div id="00:26:40.280" class="transcript_line"> But as I say, Dad died halfway through my apprenticeship.</div><div id="00:26:45.720" class="transcript_line"> So there was always stuff to do here.</div><div id="00:26:48.520" class="transcript_line"> And then I met my wife when I was 18 or 19.</div><div id="00:26:54.280" class="transcript_line"> We got married when I was 21.</div><div id="00:26:57.640" class="transcript_line"> And the rest, as they say, is history.</div><div id="00:27:00.680" class="transcript_line"> But so, why did you choose Penhow to do your apprenticeship?</div><div id="00:27:05.320" class="transcript_line"> We used to take horses out there to be shod.</div><div id="00:27:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Roaring horses?</div><div id="00:27:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:09.720" class="transcript_line"> OK, so how long have you kept horses?</div><div id="00:27:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my gosh.</div><div id="00:27:13.400" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather, Dad&#039;s father, was a horse dealer and used to sell horses to the army.</div><div id="00:27:21.840" class="transcript_line"> And he used to race horses.</div><div id="00:27:24.120" class="transcript_line"> My father raced.</div><div id="00:27:25.120" class="transcript_line"> All of my uncles raced.</div><div id="00:27:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, my goodness.</div><div id="00:27:28.320" class="transcript_line"> So, let&#039;s just go to your father&#039;s father.</div><div id="00:27:31.320" class="transcript_line"> What was his name?</div><div id="00:27:32.920" class="transcript_line"> He was Gustavus as well.</div><div id="00:27:36.720" class="transcript_line"> My goodness.</div><div id="00:27:37.720" class="transcript_line"> So, he was a horse dealer?</div><div id="00:27:39.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:27:40.200" class="transcript_line"> And farmer.</div><div id="00:27:43.600" class="transcript_line"> OK, well, tell me about him then.</div><div id="00:27:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, he was dead before I was born.</div><div id="00:27:48.160" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s only hearsay from what I heard from my father.</div><div id="00:27:53.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he had four sons and a daughter.</div><div id="00:27:55.840" class="transcript_line"> So I think he was quite strict.</div><div id="00:27:58.480" class="transcript_line"> And he was still riding into his 70s.</div><div id="00:28:02.760" class="transcript_line"> When you say riding, what, leisure riding or racing?</div><div id="00:28:05.440" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, riding horses to get them schooled or sell.</div><div id="00:28:11.040" class="transcript_line"> And he used to sell horses to the army because the army wanted as many horses as they could</div><div id="00:28:15.400" class="transcript_line"> get, especially leading up to the Second World War.</div><div id="00:28:18.800" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:28:20.800" class="transcript_line"> And then his sons, because my dad was the youngest of the four sons, and the other sons</div><div id="00:28:31.480" class="transcript_line"> all went into horses in one way or another.</div><div id="00:28:34.240" class="transcript_line"> And what sort of way?</div><div id="00:28:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Dennis went to work for a chap in the West Country who had hunters and he produced</div><div id="00:28:47.760" class="transcript_line"> the hunters for him.</div><div id="00:28:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Uncle Barney was head lad in a racing yard out of Chepstow for Colin Davis.</div><div id="00:28:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was a very successful yard.</div><div id="00:29:00.400" class="transcript_line"> And then Uncle Bill, he went to Northern Ireland and he became the biggest winner of point</div><div id="00:29:11.280" class="transcript_line"> to point races for many, many years until the record was broken about 12 years ago.</div><div id="00:29:18.160" class="transcript_line"> And he also had stallions that stood there.</div><div id="00:29:21.840" class="transcript_line"> He had a son and four daughters.</div><div id="00:29:24.480" class="transcript_line"> His son got killed racing.</div><div id="00:29:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Broke his neck, got killed.</div><div id="00:29:29.080" class="transcript_line"> My cousin Jerry, Uncle Bill got killed actually and they said the last rites over him because</div><div id="00:29:36.240" class="transcript_line"> they thought he was Catholic.</div><div id="00:29:38.840" class="transcript_line"> But he survived, just a full son.</div><div id="00:29:41.640" class="transcript_line"> My Uncle Barney, he broke his neck at Worcester races but he survived.</div><div id="00:29:46.040" class="transcript_line"> My brother broke his neck and he survived.</div><div id="00:29:48.280" class="transcript_line"> Wow, they&#039;re jockeys.</div><div id="00:29:50.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:51.280" class="transcript_line"> But when you say jockey, do you mean you said point to point?</div><div id="00:29:56.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, point to point amateur racing.</div><div id="00:29:59.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, so they&#039;re jockeys.</div><div id="00:30:01.600" class="transcript_line"> Amateur jockeys.</div><div id="00:30:03.880" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:30:04.880" class="transcript_line"> OK, so what&#039;s the difference then?</div><div id="00:30:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Amateurs don&#039;t get paid.</div><div id="00:30:12.840" class="transcript_line"> But, I mean, are you tougher?</div><div id="00:30:16.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, normally you&#039;ve got a day job as well.</div><div id="00:30:20.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but is the course...</div><div id="00:30:22.360" class="transcript_line"> The courses were a lot tougher than they are now.</div><div id="00:30:27.240" class="transcript_line"> And when I started point to point, and I said I was 14, and in point to points and it under</div><div id="00:30:33.960" class="transcript_line"> rules then, there were no, what I call, safety factors.</div><div id="00:30:37.640" class="transcript_line"> Now, the number of horses that run in each race, there&#039;s a limit as to how many can run.</div><div id="00:30:43.480" class="transcript_line"> There were no safety factors in those days.</div><div id="00:30:47.040" class="transcript_line"> Every race was a cavalry charge.</div><div id="00:30:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Would you have worn a helmet?</div><div id="00:30:51.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but not as good as they were now.</div><div id="00:30:55.200" class="transcript_line"> You know, health and safety has improved that considerably in so much as the helmets and</div><div id="00:31:06.240" class="transcript_line"> the body protectors.</div><div id="00:31:07.240" class="transcript_line"> We had no body protectors.</div><div id="00:31:09.160" class="transcript_line"> Just a flimsier sort of helmet.</div><div id="00:31:13.120" class="transcript_line"> And so your dad was a horseman too?</div><div id="00:31:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:31:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Dad rode about 70 winners point to point in.</div><div id="00:31:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:31:18.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:31:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Where did he race then?</div><div id="00:31:22.280" class="transcript_line"> With any races down here?</div><div id="00:31:23.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, local point to points.</div><div id="00:31:25.640" class="transcript_line"> Where?</div><div id="00:31:26.640" class="transcript_line"> Beyslech, Macken, Penhow, Howick near Chapstow, Bonvillsten, Penturk.</div><div id="00:31:37.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there were a lot of local point to points.</div><div id="00:31:40.880" class="transcript_line"> So was he still racing later in life?</div><div id="00:31:45.880" class="transcript_line"> He would have finished racing in the sort of late 60s and then I started in 1970.</div><div id="00:31:54.680" class="transcript_line"> So he would have probably finished in 1964, 65 maybe.</div><div id="00:31:59.960" class="transcript_line"> So you kept horses here?</div><div id="00:32:01.400" class="transcript_line"> Always, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:02.400" class="transcript_line"> How many did you have?</div><div id="00:32:03.400" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the most we&#039;ve ever had.</div><div id="00:32:07.520" class="transcript_line"> He would probably have been about a dozen.</div><div id="00:32:10.280" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how you knew the farrier in Penhow?</div><div id="00:32:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Dad brought yours up there.</div><div id="00:32:15.240" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s quite away from here, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:32:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is.</div><div id="00:32:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Why did he not choose somewhere closer?</div><div id="00:32:21.480" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t, well there was one in Macken but he wasn&#039;t, there was one very old gentleman</div><div id="00:32:26.840" class="transcript_line"> in Macken who didn&#039;t want to take on any more work.</div><div id="00:32:30.240" class="transcript_line"> But his son hadn&#039;t done any proper training so dad didn&#039;t want to take the horses to him.</div><div id="00:32:37.720" class="transcript_line"> He wanted to take them to a guy that was well trained.</div><div id="00:32:40.680" class="transcript_line"> So this was a Scottish guy?</div><div id="00:32:41.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:32:42.960" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d been there for a long time?</div><div id="00:32:44.640" class="transcript_line"> No, he was quite a young guy.</div><div id="00:32:46.720" class="transcript_line"> Lou was only sort of 30, 31 when I started my apprenticeship.</div><div id="00:32:53.360" class="transcript_line"> And then by the time I was getting to the end of my apprenticeship in 1976, Lou had</div><div id="00:32:59.160" class="transcript_line"> to give up because he got bad sciatica, back trouble.</div><div id="00:33:04.660" class="transcript_line"> So I was able to take on some of his work and then the business progressed from there.</div><div id="00:33:10.120" class="transcript_line"> So when you finished your apprenticeship did you set up here?</div><div id="00:33:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:14.600" class="transcript_line"> So what were the early days like then here?</div><div id="00:33:17.280" class="transcript_line"> I mean was there much, did you and do you get much custom from the area?</div><div id="00:33:25.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, because there weren&#039;t very many farriers about then so I was pretty much inundated</div><div id="00:33:33.640" class="transcript_line"> with work.</div><div id="00:33:34.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why I took on apprentices to help me.</div><div id="00:33:38.880" class="transcript_line"> And the business progressed from there.</div><div id="00:33:41.440" class="transcript_line"> Can you probably just go back to Penhow slightly?</div><div id="00:33:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:44.440" class="transcript_line"> So is that Penhow Beagles?</div><div id="00:33:46.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well that was very close to where the forge was in Penhow.</div><div id="00:33:51.200" class="transcript_line"> You know where the Forester&#039;s Oaks pub is?</div><div id="00:33:53.800" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:54.800" class="transcript_line"> When you pass the Forester&#039;s Oaks you climb a hill and halfway up that hill there&#039;s an</div><div id="00:34:00.200" class="transcript_line"> entrance in on the right hand side to Hunter&#039;s Lodge and Derek Jones had the Beagles there.</div><div id="00:34:07.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where he kept the Monmouth Beagles and then the forge at Penhow was just past</div><div id="00:34:13.760" class="transcript_line"> the Crosswind pub.</div><div id="00:34:16.160" class="transcript_line"> As you pass the Crosswind pub there&#039;s a little house on the right hand side.</div><div id="00:34:18.920" class="transcript_line"> That was the house for the forge and the buildings were just a little further down.</div><div id="00:34:23.240" class="transcript_line"> So you would have had lots of hunts?</div><div id="00:34:25.400" class="transcript_line"> A lot of horses came to the forge then.</div><div id="00:34:27.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:28.640" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t go out shooing.</div><div id="00:34:29.640" class="transcript_line"> No, they came to you.</div><div id="00:34:31.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:34:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Well how much is your job going out then?</div><div id="00:34:34.440" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:34:35.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean...</div><div id="00:34:38.160" class="transcript_line"> We go out to shoo virtually every horse we shoo now because people, number one, they</div><div id="00:34:44.960" class="transcript_line"> would prefer you to go to them because it&#039;s more convenient.</div><div id="00:34:50.360" class="transcript_line"> It suits us a lot better because the horses are quieter in their own environment than</div><div id="00:34:54.800" class="transcript_line"> putting them in a trailer or a lorry and taking them to a forge because they&#039;re out of their</div><div id="00:34:59.000" class="transcript_line"> comfort zone a little bit then.</div><div id="00:35:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Whereas when I was at Penhow most of the horses that came to the forge to be shot were ridden</div><div id="00:35:06.240" class="transcript_line"> there.</div><div id="00:35:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Ridden there?</div><div id="00:35:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Well yeah, it was a different... the traffic wasn&#039;t like it is now.</div><div id="00:35:14.840" class="transcript_line"> So do you know, I&#039;ve seen people trotting along here with those little carriage... not</div><div id="00:35:24.440" class="transcript_line"> carriage, not sure...</div><div id="00:35:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Sulky.</div><div id="00:35:26.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a silky.</div><div id="00:35:27.440" class="transcript_line"> A silky?</div><div id="00:35:28.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:35:29.440" class="transcript_line"> S-I-L?</div><div id="00:35:30.640" class="transcript_line"> S-U-L-K-I-E.</div><div id="00:35:32.640" class="transcript_line"> Sulky.</div><div id="00:35:33.640" class="transcript_line"> Sulky, okay.</div><div id="00:35:34.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s what they&#039;re called and that&#039;s what they train them behind that and then</div><div id="00:35:37.880" class="transcript_line"> race them on tracks.</div><div id="00:35:39.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, okay.</div><div id="00:35:41.240" class="transcript_line"> So is that necessarily a gypsy traveller type thing?</div><div id="00:35:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is a little bit but they do a certain... they do some road races as well which aren&#039;t</div><div id="00:35:53.480" class="transcript_line"> legal I don&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:35:54.480" class="transcript_line"> Well I think I&#039;ve seen them on the A48.</div><div id="00:35:57.840" class="transcript_line"> They go on the A48, they go on the risk of bypass.</div><div id="00:36:01.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s quite scary.</div><div id="00:36:03.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:36:04.040" class="transcript_line"> So do you get custom from these... you know the horses at Tether?</div><div id="00:36:08.400" class="transcript_line"> I have shot some of them for them in the past.</div><div id="00:36:11.240" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t shoot any for them now.</div><div id="00:36:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:36:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Some my son does a few.</div><div id="00:36:16.840" class="transcript_line"> But would that have been quite a bit of custom at some point?</div><div id="00:36:20.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because they wear the shoes out very quickly.</div><div id="00:36:23.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:36:25.040" class="transcript_line"> So where do most of your customers come from then?</div><div id="00:36:29.840" class="transcript_line"> Well word of mouth, I mean I&#039;ve been shooing for most of my customers for 30 odd years</div><div id="00:36:34.040" class="transcript_line"> I suppose.</div><div id="00:36:35.040" class="transcript_line"> Some a bit longer.</div><div id="00:36:38.040" class="transcript_line"> So we must be doing something right to keep the custom and generally word of mouth.</div><div id="00:36:45.640" class="transcript_line"> But most of the horses we shoo are sort of riding horses now.</div><div id="00:36:49.240" class="transcript_line"> We did at one time shoo a couple of racing yards and there were a lot more point to pointers</div><div id="00:36:54.880" class="transcript_line"> trained locally back in the sort of 70s, 80s and 90s.</div><div id="00:36:59.880" class="transcript_line"> There aren&#039;t now.</div><div id="00:37:02.080" class="transcript_line"> So we used to have a lot of work from the point to pointers and race horses.</div><div id="00:37:06.080" class="transcript_line"> Why aren&#039;t there now?</div><div id="00:37:08.280" class="transcript_line"> A lot of farmers don&#039;t have point to pointers now.</div><div id="00:37:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Whereas it used to be that every farmer would have a point to pointer.</div><div id="00:37:15.780" class="transcript_line"> And there are fewer farmers here as well?</div><div id="00:37:17.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah definitely.</div><div id="00:37:20.180" class="transcript_line"> So when I think of horses and horse racing I always think of posh people.</div><div id="00:37:28.180" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:37:30.180" class="transcript_line"> So but...</div><div id="00:37:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Anyone can have a horse to go point to pointer.</div><div id="00:37:36.180" class="transcript_line"> Was it something that most farm sons did then?</div><div id="00:37:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a great deal of farmers had a point to pointer and their sons or daughters would</div><div id="00:37:45.780" class="transcript_line"> get involved with them.</div><div id="00:37:47.180" class="transcript_line"> So sons and daughters could race alongside each other?</div><div id="00:37:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but now the restrictions for riding in point to pointers become more difficult.</div><div id="00:37:57.180" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to pay to get a riding certificate.</div><div id="00:38:02.180" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t start until you&#039;re 16.</div><div id="00:38:06.180" class="transcript_line"> Whereas there was no age restriction years ago.</div><div id="00:38:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s become...</div><div id="00:38:15.180" class="transcript_line"> It has become more professional unfortunately.</div><div id="00:38:20.180" class="transcript_line"> So that it&#039;s sort of pushing the real amateur&#039;s fun lovers away from the sport a little.</div><div id="00:38:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Which is a shame.</div><div id="00:38:31.180" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the biggest horse you&#039;ve ever shooed?</div><div id="00:38:35.180" class="transcript_line"> Shooed.</div><div id="00:38:36.180" class="transcript_line"> Or shod.</div><div id="00:38:37.180" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the expression?</div><div id="00:38:38.180" class="transcript_line"> Biggest.</div><div id="00:38:39.180" class="transcript_line"> 18 hands.</div><div id="00:38:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Is that big?</div><div id="00:38:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:42.180" class="transcript_line"> Smallest?</div><div id="00:38:43.180" class="transcript_line"> 26 inches.</div><div id="00:38:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever been kicked or bitten or anything like that?</div><div id="00:38:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, loads of times.</div><div id="00:38:53.180" class="transcript_line"> Kick, bitten, broken bones, stitches.</div><div id="00:38:59.180" class="transcript_line"> All the fingers have been stitched together at one point or another.</div><div id="00:39:02.180" class="transcript_line"> So you were in your workshop before and it almost looks timeless.</div><div id="00:39:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Really.</div><div id="00:39:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t mean that to be an insult.</div><div id="00:39:11.180" class="transcript_line"> I think it looks gorgeous.</div><div id="00:39:13.180" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything about the craft of being a farrier?</div><div id="00:39:19.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, would you describe yourself as a farrier?</div><div id="00:39:21.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:39:23.180" class="transcript_line"> The tools that you can buy are a lot better now.</div><div id="00:39:28.180" class="transcript_line"> Precision tools are a lot better.</div><div id="00:39:31.180" class="transcript_line"> And obviously electric helped a great deal.</div><div id="00:39:37.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:39:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Because you have originally the old wind up forges.</div><div id="00:39:44.180" class="transcript_line"> That was the first sort of forge to take out.</div><div id="00:39:48.180" class="transcript_line"> And then gas forges became usable.</div><div id="00:39:53.180" class="transcript_line"> So then it was far easier to go out shooing horses.</div><div id="00:39:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Maybe more mobile.</div><div id="00:40:00.180" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:40:02.180" class="transcript_line"> But is there anything about your craft that is uniquely Welsh or of the levels?</div><div id="00:40:13.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, could you say that?</div><div id="00:40:15.180" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:40:16.180" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="00:40:17.180" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:40:19.180" class="transcript_line"> In a word.</div><div id="00:40:22.180" class="transcript_line"> Tipsy.</div><div id="00:40:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Hello, hello darling.</div><div id="00:40:26.180" class="transcript_line"> So do you know, I&#039;ll come back to the thought for a minute with me,</div><div id="00:40:31.180" class="transcript_line"> but do your fields have names?</div><div id="00:40:35.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:37.180" class="transcript_line"> The one across there that&#039;s got the bales in it is the Chapel Field,</div><div id="00:40:41.180" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s the closest one to the chapel.</div><div id="00:40:43.180" class="transcript_line"> This is the front field.</div><div id="00:40:45.180" class="transcript_line"> Field down there has always been known as the Field Beyond Goods,</div><div id="00:40:49.180" class="transcript_line"> because the cottage there was Bill Good and his wife,</div><div id="00:40:52.180" class="transcript_line"> and then Ron Good, their son.</div><div id="00:40:54.180" class="transcript_line"> And they were there for as long as ever I can remember.</div><div id="00:40:58.180" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:41:00.180" class="transcript_line"> Do you know there on any map?</div><div id="00:41:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Or is that just something you know?</div><div id="00:41:04.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s just our way of calling them.</div><div id="00:41:10.180" class="transcript_line"> So would you know the names of reams around here?</div><div id="00:41:14.180" class="transcript_line"> No, only the sort of main ream there, going down to the gout farm.</div><div id="00:41:20.180" class="transcript_line"> So the gout, forgive me for saying the ignorance,</div><div id="00:41:23.180" class="transcript_line"> the gout is, is that another name for ream?</div><div id="00:41:26.180" class="transcript_line"> No, there was a farm at the bottom of the Broadway.</div><div id="00:41:30.180" class="transcript_line"> That long...</div><div id="00:41:32.180" class="transcript_line"> The long wide ream, the very wide ream,</div><div id="00:41:34.180" class="transcript_line"> when you go past the Imiron now and over the railway bridge,</div><div id="00:41:38.180" class="transcript_line"> then you&#039;ve got the Broadway there, is a big main ream,</div><div id="00:41:42.180" class="transcript_line"> and when you get to the bottom of that,</div><div id="00:41:45.180" class="transcript_line"> the building on the right hand side now was the gout farm.</div><div id="00:41:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Is it still there?</div><div id="00:41:52.180" class="transcript_line"> The building is, the farm isn&#039;t, no, no.</div><div id="00:41:55.180" class="transcript_line"> The farm got sold, just across the way,</div><div id="00:41:58.180" class="transcript_line"> there was turned into a golf course,</div><div id="00:42:00.180" class="transcript_line"> but that&#039;s not, it&#039;s not a golf course anymore.</div><div id="00:42:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Quite a few golf courses around here, aren&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:42:04.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:42:06.180" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever have fish in the reams?</div><div id="00:42:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we used to catch fish.</div><div id="00:42:10.180" class="transcript_line"> What sort of fish?</div><div id="00:42:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, only little tiddlers, nothing very much, nothing substantial.</div><div id="00:42:16.180" class="transcript_line"> No eels or anything?</div><div id="00:42:18.180" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d see an odd eel, yeah, but not too many.</div><div id="00:42:21.180" class="transcript_line"> So, do you know when you were a child, a young boy, and now,</div><div id="00:42:24.180" class="transcript_line"> has anything changed in nature, has anything disappeared,</div><div id="00:42:28.180" class="transcript_line"> or anything returned, or anything like that?</div><div id="00:42:30.180" class="transcript_line"> Disappeared.</div><div id="00:42:38.180" class="transcript_line"> Any birds you used to see, or flowers you used to...</div><div id="00:42:41.180" class="transcript_line"> We hear the cuckoo now.</div><div id="00:42:45.180" class="transcript_line"> We hear the cuckoo every year.</div><div id="00:42:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Haven&#039;t heard a cuckoo down here for 20 years, I don&#039;t suppose.</div><div id="00:42:53.180" class="transcript_line"> So the cuckoo&#039;s gone.</div><div id="00:42:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Night jar, we don&#039;t hear a night jar now.</div><div id="00:43:04.180" class="transcript_line"> Get plenty of swallows, but they were late this year.</div><div id="00:43:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Probably not as many starlings as they used to be.</div><div id="00:43:15.180" class="transcript_line"> But apart from that, that would probably be all, as far as the birds are concerned.</div><div id="00:43:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Hairs?</div><div id="00:43:21.180" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t see any hairs now, used to see lots of hairs.</div><div id="00:43:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Otters?</div><div id="00:43:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Haven&#039;t seen an otter for a long time now, because they were mink that got loose,</div><div id="00:43:31.180" class="transcript_line"> and they basically chased the otters away, because they were more aggressive.</div><div id="00:43:38.180" class="transcript_line"> So did you have any unusual clients over the years?</div><div id="00:43:42.180" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t have to name them.</div><div id="00:43:44.180" class="transcript_line"> Any unusual clients?</div><div id="00:43:46.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, or ones that stand out in your memory?</div><div id="00:43:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Quite a few.</div><div id="00:43:55.180" class="transcript_line"> There used to be a very grand old gentleman by the name of Len Hayes,</div><div id="00:44:02.180" class="transcript_line"> who lived just off Wentlug Road in Rumney,</div><div id="00:44:07.180" class="transcript_line"> and he used to drive horses all the time.</div><div id="00:44:10.180" class="transcript_line"> Len was quite a character, always wore a grey bowler hat,</div><div id="00:44:14.180" class="transcript_line"> had one foot which was a bit gammy, so he never walked sound.</div><div id="00:44:20.180" class="transcript_line"> But he used to drive horses quite a lot.</div><div id="00:44:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Through choice, because he didn&#039;t have a car?</div><div id="00:44:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, through choice.</div><div id="00:44:28.180" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d drive the horses from Rumney to the Forge to get shod, and then drive them home again.</div><div id="00:44:33.180" class="transcript_line"> So was it just a little two-seater?</div><div id="00:44:36.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, he&#039;d drive a carriage, so he&#039;d be able to take four or five people in it.</div><div id="00:44:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, why?</div><div id="00:44:42.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, proper. He&#039;d two big grey horses.</div><div id="00:44:45.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how lovely.</div><div id="00:44:47.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a great old character, Len Hayes.</div><div id="00:44:50.180" class="transcript_line"> What was his background then?</div><div id="00:44:52.180" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d always been a coach in person, because he...</div><div id="00:44:59.180" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know when it was, but he drove a stagecoach from St Melan&#039;s to London,</div><div id="00:45:06.180" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t know how long ago.</div><div id="00:45:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Why? Just because he could?</div><div id="00:45:11.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. They had stop-off points on the way, because there were no motorways then.</div><div id="00:45:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, that&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:45:18.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, did he tell you that?</div><div id="00:45:20.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he told me that.</div><div id="00:45:21.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah? So he had a collection of carriages?</div><div id="00:45:25.180" class="transcript_line"> He did, yeah.</div><div id="00:45:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he used to have a little hackney pony that he&#039;d take in a small carriage,</div><div id="00:45:31.180" class="transcript_line"> a bit bigger than the silkies you see out here.</div><div id="00:45:34.180" class="transcript_line"> But then, as far as the bigger horses are concerned,</div><div id="00:45:37.180" class="transcript_line"> he had a couple of different carriages for them,</div><div id="00:45:39.180" class="transcript_line"> because he did weddings and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:45:42.180" class="transcript_line"> Gosh. And he lived near Rumley, that way?</div><div id="00:45:46.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was off Wendtlug Road.</div><div id="00:45:48.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Any other characters?</div><div id="00:45:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Erm, well, the original old Tom Price the Gypsy,</div><div id="00:45:58.180" class="transcript_line"> he came here one morning about half past six, I suppose, in a Morris 1000 van.</div><div id="00:46:05.180" class="transcript_line"> That would have been 1976, I suppose,</div><div id="00:46:11.180" class="transcript_line"> with a Shetland pony in the back, to be sure.</div><div id="00:46:18.180" class="transcript_line"> In the back of the van?</div><div id="00:46:19.180" class="transcript_line"> In the back of the van, back of a Morris 1000 van.</div><div id="00:46:22.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:24.180" class="transcript_line"> So was he quite a well-known character in the community?</div><div id="00:46:28.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was.</div><div id="00:46:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Why?</div><div id="00:46:30.180" class="transcript_line"> I think he was a bit of a fighter.</div><div id="00:46:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh!</div><div id="00:46:36.180" class="transcript_line"> He had about four sons and they&#039;re all erm...</div><div id="00:46:43.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve all had horses over the years.</div><div id="00:46:46.180" class="transcript_line"> Not nice.</div><div id="00:46:48.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a genuine chap.</div><div id="00:46:54.180" class="transcript_line"> Did he live in a roll-top or something?</div><div id="00:46:57.180" class="transcript_line"> No, he lived in a caravan.</div><div id="00:46:59.180" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:47:01.180" class="transcript_line"> Do you have erm... So your son, no, he was your apprentice?</div><div id="00:47:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Yep, he was.</div><div id="00:47:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s working with you? Yeah, what&#039;s his name?</div><div id="00:47:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Sam.</div><div id="00:47:13.180" class="transcript_line"> So, second generation. Yep.</div><div id="00:47:15.180" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re passing on skills that you learnt from your teacher?</div><div id="00:47:22.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:47:23.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:47:24.180" class="transcript_line"> And what I&#039;ve learnt from my apprentices over the years as well.</div><div id="00:47:27.180" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:47:28.180" class="transcript_line"> As you always learn stuff.</div><div id="00:47:30.180" class="transcript_line"> If they go off to competitions or shows and they come back with other ideas,</div><div id="00:47:35.180" class="transcript_line"> so you have to be open-minded.</div><div id="00:47:38.180" class="transcript_line"> Something that you&#039;d like to ask.</div><div id="00:47:39.180" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m quite intrigued by these, like the sort of world championships</div><div id="00:47:43.180" class="transcript_line"> and the Olympic events.</div><div id="00:47:45.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, yeah, well Billy Crothers, as I say, was from Maxwell Road in Romney</div><div id="00:47:50.180" class="transcript_line"> and he was always very keen on doing competitions</div><div id="00:47:55.180" class="transcript_line"> and he went off to America</div><div id="00:48:00.180" class="transcript_line"> and they had a competition,</div><div id="00:48:04.180" class="transcript_line"> they went to America</div><div id="00:48:07.180" class="transcript_line"> and they had world championships at the Calgary Stampede,</div><div id="00:48:11.180" class="transcript_line"> which is in July, beyond now I suppose, maybe it was last week,</div><div id="00:48:17.180" class="transcript_line"> and he won the world championships over there five times.</div><div id="00:48:21.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:48:22.180" class="transcript_line"> Another Welshman who did his apprenticeship in Cowbridge was Grant Moon</div><div id="00:48:27.180" class="transcript_line"> and he did his apprenticeship at the same time as Billy</div><div id="00:48:31.180" class="transcript_line"> and he won the world championship five times as well.</div><div id="00:48:34.180" class="transcript_line"> So how does it work?</div><div id="00:48:36.180" class="transcript_line"> How do they compete? How are they assessed?</div><div id="00:48:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, we went across, my wife and I went across to the Stampede about,</div><div id="00:48:45.180" class="transcript_line"> must be about 11 years ago I suppose,</div><div id="00:48:48.180" class="transcript_line"> and Billy and Andy were competing across there at the same time.</div><div id="00:48:55.180" class="transcript_line"> And what they do is they have to shoe a foot on a horse</div><div id="00:49:04.180" class="transcript_line"> by starting off with a piece of straight bar,</div><div id="00:49:08.180" class="transcript_line"> measure the horse&#039;s foot, cut the bar to the right size</div><div id="00:49:11.180" class="transcript_line"> and then trim the horse&#039;s foot in readiness for it,</div><div id="00:49:14.180" class="transcript_line"> make the shoe, fit it and apply it within a certain time.</div><div id="00:49:19.180" class="transcript_line"> And they have to do that over a period of a couple of days on different horses,</div><div id="00:49:23.180" class="transcript_line"> different types of horses, and always within a time limit.</div><div id="00:49:28.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s remarkable, things that you never even think about existing.</div><div id="00:49:32.180" class="transcript_line"> I know, I know.</div><div id="00:49:35.180" class="transcript_line"> It was like $10,000 to the winner.</div><div id="00:49:40.180" class="transcript_line"> So what makes one, I don&#039;t know how to phrase the question,</div><div id="00:49:46.180" class="transcript_line"> how would one person&#039;s work be judged as superior to another?</div><div id="00:49:50.180" class="transcript_line"> What are the criteria?</div><div id="00:49:53.180" class="transcript_line"> The quality of the work, the precision of the work,</div><div id="00:49:57.180" class="transcript_line"> the levelness of the foot, the symmetry of the foot when it&#039;s been trimmed</div><div id="00:50:03.180" class="transcript_line"> has to be very, very good, the levelness has to be good.</div><div id="00:50:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Then when the shoe is made, it has to fit that foot exactly,</div><div id="00:50:12.180" class="transcript_line"> and within a certain time.</div><div id="00:50:17.180" class="transcript_line"> Tipsy.</div><div id="00:50:22.180" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s bigger than you, Tips.</div><div id="00:50:29.180" class="transcript_line"> How old is she?</div><div id="00:50:31.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, she&#039;s only about 13 weeks now.</div><div id="00:50:36.180" class="transcript_line"> We went up to Mould in North Wales to get her when she was just coming up to 8 weeks old.</div><div id="00:50:42.180" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s been very brave.</div><div id="00:50:45.180" class="transcript_line"> Whether she&#039;d be that brave if there wasn&#039;t a fence there, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:50:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, I know I asked you this before, but I wasn&#039;t recording it.</div><div id="00:50:54.180" class="transcript_line"> What are the oldest tools in your workshop, and have any been passed on to you?</div><div id="00:50:59.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, there are some tongs in there, which I had off a couple of guys when I started out.</div><div id="00:51:08.180" class="transcript_line"> There would be a couple of shoeing tools that I had off an old gentleman</div><div id="00:51:12.180" class="transcript_line"> the other side of the village, Tom Meakin.</div><div id="00:51:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Who was he?</div><div id="00:51:17.180" class="transcript_line"> He lived on the Market Road, or Timoallayne, and he had a pigery there.</div><div id="00:51:25.180" class="transcript_line"> And when I started, he had done a little bit of shoeing at some point or another for himself many years before.</div><div id="00:51:35.180" class="transcript_line"> So he handed me a couple of tools.</div><div id="00:51:37.180" class="transcript_line"> Because he kept work horses, presumably?</div><div id="00:51:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:51:41.180" class="transcript_line"> And then, as I say, some tongs for making shoes to hold them.</div><div id="00:51:46.180" class="transcript_line"> I had those just after I started.</div><div id="00:51:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Then there was another guy who had been working up in the valleys, and he retired and had given up.</div><div id="00:52:00.180" class="transcript_line"> He was living across here in Dufferin, and he rang me up and said,</div><div id="00:52:05.180" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got some tools here if you want to come and buy them.</div><div id="00:52:08.180" class="transcript_line"> So I bought those tools off him.</div><div id="00:52:10.180" class="transcript_line"> And the anvils, a couple of anvils there that are quite old, which I bought.</div><div id="00:52:16.180" class="transcript_line"> I bought the one, I was given the other one.</div><div id="00:52:20.180" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d be pretty old, I suppose.</div><div id="00:52:23.180" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve talked a lot about being a farrier, but did you ever have much trade from farmers</div><div id="00:52:31.180" class="transcript_line"> wanting to use your forging skills?</div><div id="00:52:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, when I was doing my apprenticeship in Penhow,</div><div id="00:52:38.180" class="transcript_line"> what we used to have was that the council workers would come in then</div><div id="00:52:42.180" class="transcript_line"> and bring in, say, 20 picks to be sharpened.</div><div id="00:52:47.180" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t see council workers using picks now.</div><div id="00:52:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s all machined.</div><div id="00:52:53.180" class="transcript_line"> But they had picks that would get worn out or broken,</div><div id="00:52:57.180" class="transcript_line"> so they&#039;d bring them into the forge to be sharpened.</div><div id="00:53:00.180" class="transcript_line"> We did some work for Welsh Water Authority, making brackets and that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:53:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve done the same here.</div><div id="00:53:11.180" class="transcript_line"> When I first came here, I first started after finishing my apprenticeship,</div><div id="00:53:18.180" class="transcript_line"> putting handles in shovels and spades, forks, that sort of thing, or repairing them,</div><div id="00:53:27.180" class="transcript_line"> and sharpening tools.</div><div id="00:53:30.180" class="transcript_line"> Repairing shovels and forks?</div><div id="00:53:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Putting new handles in them.</div><div id="00:53:35.180" class="transcript_line"> And if they were bent or anything, then we&#039;d straighten them up and put them...</div><div id="00:53:39.180" class="transcript_line"> How much of that do you get now?</div><div id="00:53:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Not very much. People go and buy new instead.</div><div id="00:53:44.180" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that we&#039;re in a throwaway society.</div><div id="00:53:46.180" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t repair things, they just chuck it away and buy something new.</div><div id="00:53:51.180" class="transcript_line"> They can bring it to a farrier or a forge and they can source it for you.</div><div id="00:53:55.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:53:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Do you ever think that at high tide you&#039;re below sea level here?</div><div id="00:54:03.180" class="transcript_line"> No. I think we&#039;re 22 foot above sea level here.</div><div id="00:54:07.180" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re 22 foot above? Okay.</div><div id="00:54:10.180" class="transcript_line"> So this is where the land is beginning to rise again a bit here?</div><div id="00:54:13.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:54:14.180" class="transcript_line"> Have you ever been on the sea wall when it&#039;s at high tide?</div><div id="00:54:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:54:17.180" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that like?</div><div id="00:54:18.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s pretty impressive.</div><div id="00:54:21.180" class="transcript_line"> Especially when you get the spring and autumn tides, which are quite high.</div><div id="00:54:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:54:28.180" class="transcript_line"> And of course, they said about the great flood in the 15th century,</div><div id="00:54:33.180" class="transcript_line"> because there&#039;s a mark on Marshfield Church,</div><div id="00:54:37.180" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s a mark on Gethly Bear, where the tidal waters came up to.</div><div id="00:54:43.180" class="transcript_line"> But it was probably a tsunami, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:54:47.180" class="transcript_line"> We can&#039;t make the mine out, can we?</div><div id="00:54:51.180" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, the whole of the moors were flooded.</div><div id="00:54:55.180" class="transcript_line"> And at very low tide, you can see the remains of the old Peterston village out in the mudflats.</div><div id="00:55:02.180" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;ve been told that. Is that true?</div><div id="00:55:06.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:55:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Really? Have you seen it?</div><div id="00:55:09.180" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you see remains of buildings.</div><div id="00:55:14.180" class="transcript_line"> So what happened? Why is that out there? Is that because the sea&#039;s retreated or come back?</div><div id="00:55:20.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s where the village of Peterston was.</div><div id="00:55:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Where you stand on the sea wall, that&#039;s where the sea wall was built.</div><div id="00:55:31.180" class="transcript_line"> Wow. My goodness.</div><div id="00:55:35.180" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t tell you exactly when the sea wall was built,</div><div id="00:55:38.180" class="transcript_line"> but it was the sea wall defence to stop any more flooding.</div><div id="00:55:43.180" class="transcript_line"> My goodness, that&#039;s amazing.</div><div id="00:55:45.180" class="transcript_line"> So the villagers had to retreat back to what is higher ground.</div><div id="00:55:50.180" class="transcript_line"> I wonder when that was.</div><div id="00:55:52.180" class="transcript_line"> Is it before your lifetime? Before you were born?</div><div id="00:55:56.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah. I can&#039;t remember when it was.</div><div id="00:56:01.180" class="transcript_line"> Did you, um, did you have anything else you wanted to ask?</div><div id="00:56:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to add, Tim, that we haven&#039;t asked?</div><div id="00:56:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, nice. You&#039;ve been fairly thorough.</div><div id="00:56:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that makes a change.</div><div id="00:56:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Does it feel good that your son&#039;s carrying on?</div><div id="00:56:21.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:56:25.180" class="transcript_line"> So, sorry, have I asked this question about when you started off or when your father moved down here?</div><div id="00:56:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Would there have been any village ford? You haven&#039;t talked about it?</div><div id="00:56:37.180" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t a ford in Marshfield. There was a ford in Castleton.</div><div id="00:56:41.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:56:44.180" class="transcript_line"> And I believe the lady whose husband had the ford is still there.</div><div id="00:56:51.180" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s very elderly, but when you get to the top of Castleton</div><div id="00:56:56.180" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;ve got the old church on the right-hand side,</div><div id="00:56:59.180" class="transcript_line"> just next to it there was an old tiny ford there.</div><div id="00:57:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh really? So was that within your father&#039;s lifetime?</div><div id="00:57:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:57:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:57:09.180" class="transcript_line"> But Dad originally used to ride horses to St. Melons to get them shot.</div><div id="00:57:14.180" class="transcript_line"> Did he?</div><div id="00:57:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, before transporting horses.</div><div id="00:57:18.180" class="transcript_line"> I can only remember going to Penhow to get the horses shot.</div><div id="00:57:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Jack Jones had a forge in St. Melons.</div><div id="00:57:31.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re building some buildings there now.</div><div id="00:57:33.180" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a chip shop and it was just past that.</div><div id="00:57:35.180" class="transcript_line"> And the forge house is still there.</div><div id="00:57:38.180" class="transcript_line"> And he used to spend three days of the week there.</div><div id="00:57:41.180" class="transcript_line"> And he had another forge up in Rumney.</div><div id="00:57:45.180" class="transcript_line"> There was a pub which has been knocked down now called the Carpenter&#039;s Arms.</div><div id="00:57:49.180" class="transcript_line"> And his other forge was on the end of the Carpenter&#039;s Arms.</div><div id="00:57:52.180" class="transcript_line"> What, to maximise his business you mean?</div><div id="00:57:57.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:57:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously all the customers then would ride horses or lead horses to the forge.</div><div id="00:58:05.180" class="transcript_line"> So it was easier to lead them if they were closer to St. Melons or closer to Rumney.</div><div id="00:58:10.180" class="transcript_line"> So how would your father have got to St. Melons from here?</div><div id="00:58:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh from here to two miles.</div><div id="00:58:14.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:58:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, down the road here.</div><div id="00:58:17.180" class="transcript_line"> And you come out by, well you go to Cypress Drive but you didn&#039;t have to then.</div><div id="00:58:21.180" class="transcript_line"> It was just through the lanes.</div><div id="00:58:25.180" class="transcript_line"> But do you know, just the footpaths around here.</div><div id="00:58:28.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Do you know about all the footpaths?</div><div id="00:58:30.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh don&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:58:32.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re a bane of our life.</div><div id="00:58:34.180" class="transcript_line"> The footpath comes right through the middle of this yard.</div><div id="00:58:36.180" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a stoyle there.</div><div id="00:58:39.180" class="transcript_line"> And it goes right through the front field.</div><div id="00:58:41.180" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a stoyle at the bottom of the front field.</div><div id="00:58:43.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:44.180" class="transcript_line"> Well it&#039;s just a shortcut for kids now back and forth to the playing fields.</div><div id="00:58:48.180" class="transcript_line"> But originally footpaths were built to either go to church or go to a well.</div><div id="00:58:54.180" class="transcript_line"> So, sorry, are they still a public right of way?</div><div id="00:58:57.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:58:58.180" class="transcript_line"> Even though they&#039;re going through your land.</div><div id="00:59:00.180" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t have to just let anyone who wants to run through here.</div><div id="00:59:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but we do police them.</div><div id="00:59:04.180" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:59:05.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, because we&#039;ve got kids coming through, messing about and playing and jumping on fences and kicking a ball around.</div><div id="00:59:10.180" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s all the animals as well.</div><div id="00:59:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Smoking and drinking and so yeah, we keep a very close eye on them.</div><div id="00:59:16.180" class="transcript_line"> So was there a well up away somewhere?</div><div id="00:59:18.180" class="transcript_line"> There was a well.</div><div id="00:59:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Where those big trees are there, there was a well in there.</div><div id="00:59:23.180" class="transcript_line"> I can remember as a kid.</div><div id="00:59:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:59:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Hmm.</div><div id="00:59:27.180" class="transcript_line"> What do you remember about it?</div><div id="00:59:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Was it a functioning well?</div><div id="00:59:30.180" class="transcript_line"> There was water running there.</div><div id="00:59:32.180" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:59:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there was a big old slab of covering it basically.</div><div id="00:59:41.180" class="transcript_line"> So did your parents use that when they arrived here?</div><div id="00:59:44.180" class="transcript_line"> Nope.</div><div id="00:59:45.180" class="transcript_line"> No, no, they had water coming in on a tap.</div><div id="00:59:49.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s interesting, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:59:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Modern.</div><div id="00:59:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, that is modern for its time, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:59:54.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:59:55.180" class="transcript_line"> I was just talking to somebody this morning about the Bryn Ivar care home.</div><div id="01:00:01.180" class="transcript_line"> Bryn Ivar care, yep.</div><div id="01:00:02.180" class="transcript_line"> He was brought up in Castleton.</div><div id="01:00:04.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="01:00:05.180" class="transcript_line"> And he said their only water was from a spring.</div><div id="01:00:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Was it?</div><div id="01:00:10.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:11.180" class="transcript_line"> For the first ten years of his life.</div><div id="01:00:13.180" class="transcript_line"> Good Lord.</div><div id="01:00:14.180" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a bit 90, you know.</div><div id="01:00:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to ask him that we haven&#039;t asked?</div><div id="01:00:20.180" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="01:00:23.180" class="transcript_line"> Shall I switch it off then?</div><div id="01:00:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, kind of fine.</div><div id="01:00:26.180" class="transcript_line"> No problem.</div><div id="01:00:27.180" class="transcript_line"> I hope I haven&#039;t missed anything.</div><div id="01:00:28.180" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;ve got an opportunity to add stuff and take stuff away.</div><div id="01:00:31.180" class="transcript_line"> Sure, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="01:00:32.180" class="transcript_line"> Is that okay?</div><div id="01:00:33.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:00:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="01:00:35.180" class="transcript_line"> No trouble.</div><div id="01:00:36.180" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="01:00:37.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just bang on an hour.</div><div id="01:00:39.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="01:00:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div></div></p>
