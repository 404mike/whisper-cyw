    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, I&#039;m Peter Fullerton, the chair of Friends of Cardiff reservoirs, and I&#039;m sitting here</div><div id="00:00:07.680" class="transcript_line"> on a glorious, still sunny morning in November, interviewing Anne Barrett, who used to run</div><div id="00:00:14.760" class="transcript_line"> the sailing school here.</div><div id="00:00:16.400" class="transcript_line"> So, how did you first get involved with the reservoir and the sailing school?</div><div id="00:00:21.080" class="transcript_line"> I first got involved at the reservoir probably around 1979, where a friend of mine had done</div><div id="00:00:27.200" class="transcript_line"> some sailing and said, why don&#039;t you come up and just come out on the water?</div><div id="00:00:33.400" class="transcript_line"> So I did, and I have to admit, firstly, I really didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:00:37.040" class="transcript_line"> I came from a sports background.</div><div id="00:00:39.480" class="transcript_line"> I could do sports.</div><div id="00:00:41.440" class="transcript_line"> Sailing was one of these things.</div><div id="00:00:42.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you have to learn things.</div><div id="00:00:44.400" class="transcript_line"> But I persevered with some encouragement from the current principal at the time, a gentleman</div><div id="00:00:49.480" class="transcript_line"> called Jim Dunn and the then chief instructor, Francis Hurley, and basically did all my qualifications,</div><div id="00:00:57.560" class="transcript_line"> got involved with volunteering, and then sadly Jim Dunn, he died.</div><div id="00:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> Francis Hurley became the principal, and within quite a few, well, within a few years, I became</div><div id="00:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> the chief instructor.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So basically, I learned at Lanishen, I volunteered at Lanishen, I then worked at Lanishen, and</div><div id="00:01:19.760" class="transcript_line"> then in the end, I finally became the principal of Lanishen, and I then retired from the sport</div><div id="00:01:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Only a couple of years before then, the sailing centre moved to Cardiff Bay.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So how long were you here to recharge to the sailing centre?</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> I was here in all capacities for cool, 99, 2009, 35 years in all capacities.</div><div id="00:01:44.840" class="transcript_line"> I came back until the centre moved in 2010.</div><div id="00:01:50.400" class="transcript_line"> I on and off remained in contact with many people who learned to sail here, who became</div><div id="00:01:56.960" class="transcript_line"> friends, and also in contact with people who learned to sail and then went on to bigger</div><div id="00:02:03.800" class="transcript_line"> and better things around the world.</div><div id="00:02:05.600" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s quite interesting that a lot of sailors who started here are still involved in the</div><div id="00:02:11.920" class="transcript_line"> sport in various capacities, well, every corner of the world, really.</div><div id="00:02:17.520" class="transcript_line"> Any in particular you remember that went through the school?</div><div id="00:02:21.160" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s very difficult.</div><div id="00:02:23.880" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s been a lot of children who learned when they were little, in little oppies, who&#039;ve</div><div id="00:02:30.080" class="transcript_line"> gone on to great things.</div><div id="00:02:31.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, everyone mentions Hannah Mills, who I&#039;m still in contact with and has done great things,</div><div id="00:02:37.840" class="transcript_line"> double Olympic champion, world champion, flag bearer for Team GB at Tokyo, recently skipper</div><div id="00:02:45.840" class="transcript_line"> of the Athena Pathway America&#039;s Cup boat in the first ever women&#039;s America&#039;s Cup.</div><div id="00:02:53.200" class="transcript_line"> But there are a lot of other people.</div><div id="00:02:55.480" class="transcript_line"> Hannah is just the name that people possibly recognise.</div><div id="00:02:59.360" class="transcript_line"> But a lot of people are working in the business around the world and making a difference from</div><div id="00:03:04.400" class="transcript_line"> working on super yachts to running sailing schools in Greece to becoming quite high profile</div><div id="00:03:12.820" class="transcript_line"> environmentalists.</div><div id="00:03:13.820" class="transcript_line"> Emily Penn years ago was one of the first to introduce or make awareness of microplastics.</div><div id="00:03:22.820" class="transcript_line"> A guy called Rob Hobson is now quite a high profile nutritionalist.</div><div id="00:03:27.780" class="transcript_line"> So there are so many really that I admire for, I feel privileged that I taught them</div><div id="00:03:37.620" class="transcript_line"> and for the people that they&#039;ve become, many are in all sorts of quite high ranking jobs</div><div id="00:03:43.700" class="transcript_line"> around the world.</div><div id="00:03:44.700" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve said that learning to sail and becoming instructors played a part in allowing them</div><div id="00:03:51.340" class="transcript_line"> to pursue totally different careers.</div><div id="00:03:56.620" class="transcript_line"> And could you describe to me what a sort of typical day for you was like when you were</div><div id="00:04:00.540" class="transcript_line"> running the sailing school?</div><div id="00:04:02.140" class="transcript_line"> Because there was lots of boats here.</div><div id="00:04:04.420" class="transcript_line"> You meet people here who have been through the sailing school and they remember it quite</div><div id="00:04:07.700" class="transcript_line"> fondly.</div><div id="00:04:08.700" class="transcript_line"> But for you, what was a day like when you were running the school?</div><div id="00:04:13.260" class="transcript_line"> Every day was slightly different.</div><div id="00:04:15.180" class="transcript_line"> But if you look at, I don&#039;t know, let&#039;s pick a random day in July.</div><div id="00:04:22.020" class="transcript_line"> Still in term time, I would start work probably about 7.30, just walk around the site.</div><div id="00:04:29.060" class="transcript_line"> Again, I was very privileged at 7.30 in the morning.</div><div id="00:04:32.260" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the only one here apart from maybe the occasional kingfisher and the swans who regularly</div><div id="00:04:37.900" class="transcript_line"> visited on the little pond we had for our environmental studies group.</div><div id="00:04:42.540" class="transcript_line"> So I would come in at 7.30, the staff would come in at 8.30.</div><div id="00:04:46.620" class="transcript_line"> All the boats would be prepared then for whatever classes would come up.</div><div id="00:04:50.740" class="transcript_line"> Invariably in term time, that would be schools groups.</div><div id="00:04:54.180" class="transcript_line"> We taught a lot of primary schools.</div><div id="00:04:56.340" class="transcript_line"> We ran an oppie roadshow program which taught 1500 children in a month, two hour sessions,</div><div id="00:05:03.460" class="transcript_line"> learning to rig oppies, learn about knots, water safety, have a session on the water.</div><div id="00:05:11.740" class="transcript_line"> So you would do that for most of the day.</div><div id="00:05:13.700" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;d be a slight break and then evening classes would come in depending on what day</div><div id="00:05:17.100" class="transcript_line"> of the week it was.</div><div id="00:05:18.100" class="transcript_line"> There would be adult courses running.</div><div id="00:05:20.740" class="transcript_line"> The day would then sail in toppers, lasers, wayfarers.</div><div id="00:05:26.780" class="transcript_line"> And that would then run until nine.</div><div id="00:05:28.060" class="transcript_line"> So my average day would be a 7.30 till about quarter past nine.</div><div id="00:05:31.740" class="transcript_line"> And then if it was an adult group, you have to do forced to do the social thing of go</div><div id="00:05:36.700" class="transcript_line"> to the pub for a few beers and discuss in great detail the session on the water.</div><div id="00:05:42.020" class="transcript_line"> So it was just a debrief session.</div><div id="00:05:44.500" class="transcript_line"> We ran children&#039;s groups, which was mainly in the days and on Saturdays and Sundays.</div><div id="00:05:54.260" class="transcript_line"> Then they were fantastically successful.</div><div id="00:05:56.860" class="transcript_line"> And my favorite session was a Saturday morning where kids had learned to sail and then they</div><div id="00:06:01.460" class="transcript_line"> just wanted to improve.</div><div id="00:06:02.980" class="transcript_line"> And we were lucky that we had a big, big fleet of boats that really could cater for from</div><div id="00:06:09.460" class="transcript_line"> eight year olds to senior adults.</div><div id="00:06:14.020" class="transcript_line"> Although we didn&#039;t have specifically disabled boats, we jury rigged up something and make</div><div id="00:06:20.260" class="transcript_line"> it work.</div><div id="00:06:21.260" class="transcript_line"> And that was one of the best things that we ever did here was that we were very, very</div><div id="00:06:26.580" class="transcript_line"> inclusive before it became the thing to do and tick a box.</div><div id="00:06:31.700" class="transcript_line"> We never tick boxes.</div><div id="00:06:33.060" class="transcript_line"> We wanted to be totally inclusive.</div><div id="00:06:34.820" class="transcript_line"> If you wanted to get on the water by hook or by crook and sometimes by breaking rules,</div><div id="00:06:40.300" class="transcript_line"> we got you out there.</div><div id="00:06:42.500" class="transcript_line"> It was one of the greatest things and one of my proudest things to have achieved, to</div><div id="00:06:48.060" class="transcript_line"> make it as accessible as it could.</div><div id="00:06:51.300" class="transcript_line"> And that was probably at one point we were teaching almost every school in Cardiff at</div><div id="00:06:57.420" class="transcript_line"> one point in my tenure here came to sail at Anshan.</div><div id="00:07:03.060" class="transcript_line"> When you see it now, it&#039;s open to the public and some water sport activities happening.</div><div id="00:07:07.140" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about the reservoir now coming back?</div><div id="00:07:10.340" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very difficult.</div><div id="00:07:11.700" class="transcript_line"> It was a difficult time when the sailing centre moved to the bay.</div><div id="00:07:16.620" class="transcript_line"> For me, Anshan, its location, the water quality was perfect.</div><div id="00:07:25.500" class="transcript_line"> When coming back to the reservoir now, it&#039;s open to the public.</div><div id="00:07:28.620" class="transcript_line"> What are your feelings about it now?</div><div id="00:07:31.100" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really difficult.</div><div id="00:07:32.100" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, it was a sad time when the sailing centre had to move to Cardiff Bay because</div><div id="00:07:38.740" class="transcript_line"> of the possibility of development.</div><div id="00:07:42.500" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no doubt it&#039;s still in my mind, clinician, is one of the best locations certainly</div><div id="00:07:48.300" class="transcript_line"> anywhere in Wales for people to come and live water sports.</div><div id="00:07:53.580" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s twofold.</div><div id="00:07:54.580" class="transcript_line"> The site has been developed remarkably well.</div><div id="00:07:56.340" class="transcript_line"> I could never have imagined having worked for all those years in a couple of pre-First</div><div id="00:08:02.980" class="transcript_line"> World War huts with no money to see the facilities that are available now.</div><div id="00:08:09.940" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s magnificent to be able to walk around there if you want to get a cup of coffee.</div><div id="00:08:15.860" class="transcript_line"> So the facilities are absolutely fabulous.</div><div id="00:08:18.580" class="transcript_line"> I think if I look at it with my principal hat on, then I think there&#039;s a lot of work</div><div id="00:08:26.060" class="transcript_line"> to be done as far as making it a highly successful water sports facility.</div><div id="00:08:35.740" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a lot of work, I think, to be done there to make it anywhere near the centre</div><div id="00:08:42.180" class="transcript_line"> that it was when I was there.</div><div id="00:08:45.140" class="transcript_line"> Blowing my own trumpet a little bit, at one time we were undoubtedly the most successful</div><div id="00:08:52.300" class="transcript_line"> sailing centre anywhere in the country, and that&#039;s the UK.</div><div id="00:08:56.900" class="transcript_line"> No one could compete with what we were doing, the numbers that we had in attendance and</div><div id="00:09:02.780" class="transcript_line"> the success rate.</div><div id="00:09:03.860" class="transcript_line"> And that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean Olympic success.</div><div id="00:09:10.740" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a one-off.</div><div id="00:09:11.740" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s luck and down to the individual, not down to the centre.</div><div id="00:09:17.820" class="transcript_line"> So I think if they work hard at it, then it could be something special, but I think</div><div id="00:09:25.100" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a long way to go.</div><div id="00:09:26.900" class="transcript_line"> But as someone who comes and walks, it&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:09:29.900" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:09:30.900" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you very much.</div><div id="00:09:31.900" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pleased to be sharing this.</div><div id="00:09:32.900" class="transcript_line"> My pleasure.</div><div id="00:09:33.900" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
