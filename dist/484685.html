    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Steve stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swickr Carnival</div><div id="00:00:07.600" class="transcript_line"> who have organized Cardiff Carnival ever since.</div><div id="00:00:11.660" class="transcript_line"> Steve stories number one. Swickr Carnival begins. My working life in the arts and</div><div id="00:00:20.480" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff Carnival are closely linked. I started Swickr Carnival in 1990 over 25</div><div id="00:00:26.840" class="transcript_line"> years ago but the idea of an ongoing carnival arts organization covering</div><div id="00:00:31.520" class="transcript_line"> South Wales to deliver large-scale community participation and celebration</div><div id="00:00:36.160" class="transcript_line"> crystallized the year before in 1989. In that year I was working with a</div><div id="00:00:42.880" class="transcript_line"> groundbreaking theatre company based in Cardiff called Theatre Taliesin Wales</div><div id="00:00:47.120" class="transcript_line"> who I helped produce a trilogy of Indo-Celtic community plays. The</div><div id="00:00:52.480" class="transcript_line"> community plays used parallels between stories and art forms from India and</div><div id="00:00:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Wales and brought together hundreds of community performers and were enjoyed by</div><div id="00:01:01.440" class="transcript_line"> large family audiences. All the community plays were based at the Gujarati</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Samaj Centre in Grangetown in Cardiff and part of my job was to publicize and</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> recruit community performers many of whom had no previous experience in the</div><div id="00:01:17.480" class="transcript_line"> arts and once they were on board to try to ensure they enjoyed the opportunity</div><div id="00:01:22.280" class="transcript_line"> to the max. The community plays were very successful short-term projects</div><div id="00:01:28.360" class="transcript_line"> however after three years it was quite clear to me that Theatre Taliesin Wales</div><div id="00:01:33.360" class="transcript_line"> had helped create a huge wellspring of enthusiasm and interest from people from</div><div id="00:01:38.800" class="transcript_line"> different backgrounds coming together using intercultural arts to create</div><div id="00:01:43.760" class="transcript_line"> something fabulous and enjoyable for all to view. So in 1990 when Glasgow was</div><div id="00:01:51.240" class="transcript_line"> appointed European City of Culture I set up an intercultural project for that</div><div id="00:01:55.640" class="transcript_line"> company in Glasgow. This meant that the head of steam built up by their work in</div><div id="00:02:00.680" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff had come to an end and many would-be participants and future</div><div id="00:02:05.680" class="transcript_line"> audiences in Cardiff were doomed to disappointment. So the stage was set for</div><div id="00:02:12.320" class="transcript_line"> a new ongoing arts organization to be based in Cardiff to expand upon</div><div id="00:02:17.360" class="transcript_line"> Taliesin&#039;s earlier successes and so South Wales Intercultural Community Arts</div><div id="00:02:23.960" class="transcript_line"> better known as SWCCA was born. SWCCA officially started in April 1990 and our</div><div id="00:02:31.840" class="transcript_line"> first two workshops in that month involved samba drumming and carnival</div><div id="00:02:35.920" class="transcript_line"> arts. The samba drumming workshop took place at the City Centre Youth Project</div><div id="00:02:40.640" class="transcript_line"> in Charles Street, Cardiff and was the first ever of its sort in Wales. It was</div><div id="00:02:46.840" class="transcript_line"> so successful that SWCCA Carnival started Samba Galaise, the Cardiff School of</div><div id="00:02:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Samba which continued to this very day as a successful community percussion</div><div id="00:02:56.240" class="transcript_line"> group and in turn has inspired several more ongoing samba drumming groups right</div><div id="00:03:01.640" class="transcript_line"> across Wales. The second workshop in April 1990 involved introducing carnival</div><div id="00:03:07.960" class="transcript_line"> arts to Cardiff and my point of inspiration was the wonderfully</div><div id="00:03:11.740" class="transcript_line"> flamboyant carnival form found in Trinidad and across the Caribbean. This</div><div id="00:03:16.480" class="transcript_line"> carnival tradition is known as the M.A.S.S. M.A.S.S. is short for the word</div><div id="00:03:21.760" class="transcript_line"> masquerade. SWCCA Carnival brought Catherine Chan, carnival designer and</div><div id="00:03:28.200" class="transcript_line"> M.A.S.S. maker from Trinidad to Cardiff and the first carnival arts workshops</div><div id="00:03:33.080" class="transcript_line"> took place in Mount Stewart Junior School in Cardiff Bay which was then the</div><div id="00:03:37.640" class="transcript_line"> most culturally diverse school in the whole of Wales and also on an open</div><div id="00:03:44.040" class="transcript_line"> access basis at the family-friendly Cardiff City Farm on Sloper Road which has</div><div id="00:03:49.580" class="transcript_line"> now sadly been replaced by commercial development.</div></div></p>
