    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> rugby in the 1970s. Can you tell me a little bit about where you would usually watch the</div><div id="00:00:05.760" class="transcript_line"> games and with who?</div><div id="00:00:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, still living in London at the time, my husband and I were members of London Wash</div><div id="00:00:16.040" class="transcript_line"> Rugby where they played Oldeo Park and we used to go there on a regular basis at home</div><div id="00:00:22.640" class="transcript_line"> matches and we used to follow the international matches where we were playing. And it was</div><div id="00:00:28.760" class="transcript_line"> with a group of friends that we had great times watching the JPRs and the John Taylors</div><div id="00:00:39.560" class="transcript_line"> and the boys in the 70s playing. It was a wonderful period for Wash Rugby.</div><div id="00:00:46.600" class="transcript_line"> Does any game stand out?</div><div id="00:00:52.240" class="transcript_line"> One game stands out, it was in Scotland when Wales were playing Scotland when John Taylor</div><div id="00:00:59.800" class="transcript_line"> scored a try in the last minute of the game giving Wales victory. That to my mind has</div><div id="00:01:07.320" class="transcript_line"> always stood out as a special moment. And the other one, going back even further, was</div><div id="00:01:14.640" class="transcript_line"> at Cardiff when the, I think it must have been the original stadium was there, which</div><div id="00:01:22.160" class="transcript_line"> is going back a long time, where Gareth Edwards scored a try and slid yards into mud to do</div><div id="00:01:34.480" class="transcript_line"> so. That is also one of the memories that I have of Great Rugby.</div><div id="00:01:42.880" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel watching Wales play and win?</div><div id="00:01:47.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh I always enjoy watching that and I have always shouted. I mean when I watch it on</div><div id="00:01:51.760" class="transcript_line"> television now you could probably hear me shouting from cricket. I still follow the</div><div id="00:02:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Welsh players, yes.</div><div id="00:02:02.280" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel watching it on television compared with being there at the match?</div><div id="00:02:07.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh there is no comparison really. You don&#039;t get that atmosphere that you do. No, it was</div><div id="00:02:13.720" class="transcript_line"> wonderful to be there. We used to enjoy it very much. That&#039;s in love going there now,</div><div id="00:02:21.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s probably warmer and more comfortable watching it from here. But the atmosphere</div><div id="00:02:28.920" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t quite the same. Because nobody can hear me shouting.</div></div></p>
