    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Jewel Willie. It&#039;s the 12th of March 2024 and I&#039;m at the home of Mr. Ron Stokes,</div><div id="00:00:09.920" class="transcript_line"> where he lives near Howey. So Ron, thanks very much for agreeing to have a chat with</div><div id="00:00:14.720" class="transcript_line"> me. First of all, Ron, I&#039;ve got to ask you this question. What&#039;s your year of birth?</div><div id="00:00:21.160" class="transcript_line"> My year of birth is 4th of the 6th, 1924.</div><div id="00:00:27.600" class="transcript_line"> My word. We&#039;ll work it out from there then. And where were you born, Ron?</div><div id="00:00:33.040" class="transcript_line"> I was born near St. DeWolder in a little place called Cap-a-Lon.</div><div id="00:00:37.520" class="transcript_line"> So would that be Shropshire?</div><div id="00:00:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Shropshire, yeah.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do you remember of your early years? Were you born on a farm?</div><div id="00:00:46.920" class="transcript_line"> No, I was born in a little cottage, you know, where my father was employed by the owner of the</div><div id="00:00:54.640" class="transcript_line"> farm. I see. And what do you remember of your early years growing up in the cottage?</div><div id="00:01:00.400" class="transcript_line"> I remember quite a lot really. I remember having pneumonia when I was about 3 to 4.</div><div id="00:01:09.840" class="transcript_line"> I can remember in those days the horses and wagons going down to the harvest,</div><div id="00:01:16.640" class="transcript_line"> collecting the harvest. And because my father was a wagoner, I thought, well, unlucky I was to be</div><div id="00:01:25.760" class="transcript_line"> laying in bed, you know, not able to enjoy myself riding on one of the wagons, you know.</div><div id="00:01:35.360" class="transcript_line"> I see. And what do you remember about the cottage itself, where you were born and grew up?</div><div id="00:01:42.320" class="transcript_line"> It was a very small cottage, you know, just about one room and a big landing up and that was it.</div><div id="00:01:56.400" class="transcript_line"> And did you have many friends in Shropshire? Was it a village, a small village?</div><div id="00:02:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a small village, yes.</div><div id="00:02:04.080" class="transcript_line"> I see. So where would the nearest place be?</div><div id="00:02:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Nearest place would be Knighton or Bucknell or Llan.</div><div id="00:02:11.360" class="transcript_line"> You know, either of those were about almost equal distances apart, you know.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was it like growing up in a fairly rural area like that? What sort of things did you do</div><div id="00:02:24.400" class="transcript_line"> when you were a young boy? In those days, there were very few.</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> I grew up in a car to the village. We grew up in French, played games like hounds and heirs and</div><div id="00:02:38.560" class="transcript_line"> things like that, you know. And generally played in the big thing with a football match between</div><div id="00:02:48.080" class="transcript_line"> our school and the next school down from Bucknell down. And we took part in that like.</div><div id="00:02:57.360" class="transcript_line"> And what about school days? Did you have a school in the village?</div><div id="00:03:01.280" class="transcript_line"> A school in the village was a Church of England school. It was a teacher for two sisters</div><div id="00:03:10.320" class="transcript_line"> from Upper Chapel in Breconwy. And they were very good teachers</div><div id="00:03:17.920" class="transcript_line"> and interested in anything you were. And if you were good, they really had it most things like,</div><div id="00:03:26.480" class="transcript_line"> you know, they were quite helpful, crowded indeed.</div><div id="00:03:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that sounds good. And then when you moved on, say, to secondary school,</div><div id="00:03:36.160" class="transcript_line"> did you go to a secondary school in the area? No, I didn&#039;t go to secondary school.</div><div id="00:03:39.600" class="transcript_line"> I see. We moved from Chapelona up to Dulley, which is</div><div id="00:03:47.440" class="transcript_line"> and Benny born to Blenver. And the other schoolmaster was very strict and kept us in order.</div><div id="00:03:56.560" class="transcript_line"> So you went to school in Dulley, did you? Yeah, the one which is now the little old one,</div><div id="00:04:04.640" class="transcript_line"> which I think is a converted house. We came up when I was aged 11, you know, and</div><div id="00:04:11.120" class="transcript_line"> and that was I took 11 plus and I passed, but I didn&#039;t go to school because in those days from</div><div id="00:04:21.280" class="transcript_line"> there, you had to go to Bishop&#039;s Castle to the school there, like, you know, and anyway, that was it.</div><div id="00:04:31.440" class="transcript_line"> How are we doing? We&#039;re doing fine. And did your people move onto a farm? Did they? In Dulley?</div><div id="00:04:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Did you move to live in a farm in Dulley? We moved to live with my parents on a small farm, you know,</div><div id="00:04:49.280" class="transcript_line"> and I spent all my school days in Dulley and that was it. I see. And what sort of a farm was it?</div><div id="00:04:59.040" class="transcript_line"> A sheep farm? A small farm. During wartime, of course, you had to sew crops that, you know,</div><div id="00:05:09.840" class="transcript_line"> you would normally look at everybody had to grow so many much more acreage of potatoes, for example,</div><div id="00:05:18.480" class="transcript_line"> you know, and things like that and cereal crops, you know, so that they could feed</div><div id="00:05:27.200" class="transcript_line"> animals with it rather than depend on imported stuff. So what was life on the farm like for you,</div><div id="00:05:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Ron? Did you have your jobs? Did you have your chores? Is that where you worked?</div><div id="00:05:42.720" class="transcript_line"> Did you have your jobs and your chores? Oh, yeah. Water was fetched from a well, you know,</div><div id="00:05:49.840" class="transcript_line"> for household use, you know, things like that. We all had to help, you know, and do a bit</div><div id="00:05:56.560" class="transcript_line"> where we could, you know. What was the name of the farm? The Mountain Farm.</div><div id="00:06:02.320" class="transcript_line"> The Humminest Farm.</div><div id="00:06:04.240" class="transcript_line"> The Mountain Farm. Right, right. What else did you have to do on the farm then? Were you busy</div><div id="00:06:12.320" class="transcript_line"> with the animals? We took part in most things like harvesting, you know, and everything involved with</div><div id="00:06:20.560" class="transcript_line"> the farm, you know. Children who grew up on a farm were usually involved in this quite a bit.</div><div id="00:06:27.440" class="transcript_line"> And most things like that.</div><div id="00:06:31.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. And the community of Dali itself, was it quite a close community? Did you have many</div><div id="00:06:36.960" class="transcript_line"> friends? Well, they were scattered in those days. Of course, everybody had to travel by a cycle,</div><div id="00:06:44.320" class="transcript_line"> you know, and that sort of thing. And they didn&#039;t get together as they could have done. In the</div><div id="00:06:52.400" class="transcript_line"> summertime, the lads used to gather at the local village hall and they played arts or something</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> like that. I see. Right. Did you ever go into any other bigger towns for entertainment and fun?</div><div id="00:07:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Not in those days, no. Entertainment was nothing until I was a teenager and, you know, I&#039;d go to</div><div id="00:07:17.520" class="transcript_line"> cinema at Lendard and also the playhouse at Lendard, which was run by a company that was</div><div id="00:07:27.680" class="transcript_line"> sort of organised by a local cross-gate man. He had property in Cross-Gate, I should say.</div><div id="00:07:37.680" class="transcript_line"> That sounds a bit of fun. And then, when did you, I understand you were an AA</div><div id="00:07:45.040" class="transcript_line"> person. Yeah. When did you join the AA? Before I left school.</div><div id="00:08:00.160" class="transcript_line"> Hi. Sorry about that. That&#039;s all right. Sorry about that. Right, we&#039;ll start again.</div><div id="00:08:05.280" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re fine. But when you left school? When I left school, yes. I went to work on a farm,</div><div id="00:08:12.800" class="transcript_line"> you know, and I could work it over as well, you know, to help with the farm. And</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I left school when I was fourteen and I went to the farm and I was there for thirteen years</div><div id="00:08:29.440" class="transcript_line"> working on that, you know. And I progressed from sort of the smaller young, the jobs they give to</div><div id="00:08:37.680" class="transcript_line"> the younger lads and to the, then I finished up driving the tractors and the caterpillar,</div><div id="00:08:47.280" class="transcript_line"> caterpillar tractor.</div><div id="00:08:48.960" class="transcript_line"> You were talking about tractors, I believe, Ron. Perhaps you could embellish on that a little bit.</div><div id="00:08:53.760" class="transcript_line"> I finished up there at the farm, you know, for the last three or four years driving the caterpillar</div><div id="00:09:01.040" class="transcript_line"> tractors, which were working on what they called reclaimed ground, you know, mountain sides ploughed</div><div id="00:09:07.840" class="transcript_line"> up, you know, and kind of the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,</div><div id="00:09:15.440" class="transcript_line"> mountain sides ploughed up, you know, and cultivated and new seeded grass was on them</div><div id="00:09:24.320" class="transcript_line"> and of course more productive than the old firner, brecon and that, you know, so. And at</div><div id="00:09:32.960" class="transcript_line"> the end of 1958 I thought I&#039;d try another job. I joined the AA in that period and I went to</div><div id="00:09:47.120" class="transcript_line"> nothing more than a training course and three weeks and I came, I served with the AA then for</div><div id="00:09:56.960" class="transcript_line"> 37 years, a correction, 35 years and seven months.</div><div id="00:10:04.880" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got that exactly, haven&#039;t you? Yes. And where were you based? Were you just based locally?</div><div id="00:10:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Home based, from my home, you know, and just in the, Pennybunk when I started,</div><div id="00:10:19.520" class="transcript_line"> first road I went over was the Reader to Kington Road and then of course I went on</div><div id="00:10:26.400" class="transcript_line"> St. Paul&#039;s in there and I went on to recovery business in 1974 and I shut the door.</div><div id="00:10:40.640" class="transcript_line"> Right, when you first started, Ron, can you remember when you first started in the AA?</div><div id="00:10:45.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure it was very different then from how it is now. Were you patrolling on a motorbike then?</div><div id="00:10:51.520" class="transcript_line"> On a motorbike in St. Charles, yeah. That was what they called the road service outfit in those days.</div><div id="00:11:00.320" class="transcript_line"> Then, you know, through the bad winters over the random forests, you know, when</div><div id="00:11:05.440" class="transcript_line"> drifts of snow could be, they were one year 18 feet deep, which takes a bit of following today.</div><div id="00:11:14.320" class="transcript_line"> And you had to patrol the roads and be out and about and give a road weather report</div><div id="00:11:21.600" class="transcript_line"> by eight o&#039;clock in the morning, get it into the car, they put it in like so. You had to keep moving.</div><div id="00:11:27.920" class="transcript_line"> And these reports, Ron, were they done by radio or by telephone?</div><div id="00:11:32.560" class="transcript_line"> No, they had to be done by telephone, you know, in the early days, like, you know, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:37.600" class="transcript_line"> So what was your job then to patrol and see, you know?</div><div id="00:11:43.200" class="transcript_line"> You had to, first of all, road conditions, you know. The main job of a patrol was,</div><div id="00:11:51.520" class="transcript_line"> looking after the association&#039;s members who were, and if they were broken down, you did your best to</div><div id="00:11:57.680" class="transcript_line"> help them and get them back on the road again and that was it.</div><div id="00:12:04.720" class="transcript_line"> And how did you know if they were actually broken down? What communication was there?</div><div id="00:12:11.600" class="transcript_line"> In the early days, it was by chance or somebody would come along and say,</div><div id="00:12:16.960" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s somebody broken down along the area, you know, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:12:21.680" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:12:24.160" class="transcript_line"> And in the case of perhaps a serious mishap, presumably you had to work then with the other</div><div id="00:12:31.200" class="transcript_line"> emergency services, did you?</div><div id="00:12:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Any serious mishap happened over the days. You know, you combined with the,</div><div id="00:12:41.120" class="transcript_line"> you assisted the police, you know, fire brigade, everything like that.</div><div id="00:12:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was just like, you know, and then of course, the years went by that service</div><div id="00:13:00.400" class="transcript_line"> improved and progressed, you know, and you were doing recovery jobs.</div><div id="00:13:09.520" class="transcript_line"> They introduced this service, which when a member was broken down, if he couldn&#039;t get him going,</div><div id="00:13:16.800" class="transcript_line"> he was relayed or recovered to his home address or, you know, or a garage, wherever he went, he&#039;d go.</div><div id="00:13:26.720" class="transcript_line"> So in the early days, Ron, he really had no immediate contact, did you? I mean,</div><div id="00:13:31.680" class="transcript_line"> there were no such things as mobile phones.</div><div id="00:13:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Not in those days, no. Later on, as the years went by, we went on to radios, you know,</div><div id="00:13:43.840" class="transcript_line"> but in any area such as this, the reception was pretty good, but, you know, we had to put our own</div><div id="00:13:51.200" class="transcript_line"> mast up for it, you know, and do it that way. Where was the mast? On the Radnor Forest?</div><div id="00:13:56.960" class="transcript_line"> No, the mast was on Babur Wood at Leneglus, over that way.</div><div id="00:14:04.480" class="transcript_line"> I see. And occasionally we&#039;ll see an old AA box, as we call them. Now, they used to be very prolific,</div><div id="00:14:13.120" class="transcript_line"> I remember, when I was younger. What function exactly did they have?</div><div id="00:14:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, that was a function. They had a telephone in it, and there was a list of all places of the assistance they could get,</div><div id="00:14:27.840" class="transcript_line"> and it was lit up at night by the old Tilly or Aladdin lamps, you know, and they were the</div><div id="00:14:36.480" class="transcript_line"> responsibility of the patrol on the road to make sure that lamp was lit, so if a member broke down</div><div id="00:14:43.760" class="transcript_line"> in that area, you know, and there was something there he could walk to, and the phone, of course,</div><div id="00:14:51.040" class="transcript_line"> where he could contact and get further out. And was this service available 24 hours?</div><div id="00:14:58.560" class="transcript_line"> 24 hours of service to all its members, you know. So when you went to somebody&#039;s assistance, you had to</div><div id="00:15:09.040" class="transcript_line"> carry all your tools, presumably, with you? When we went to somebody&#039;s assistance, we had the tools in</div><div id="00:15:16.880" class="transcript_line"> this headcar portion, box portion, and that&#039;s all the tools in there, and that was it, like, you know.</div><div id="00:15:25.280" class="transcript_line"> I see. And can you recall any particular incidences? Do any incidences stand out in your mind</div><div id="00:15:33.840" class="transcript_line"> that you had to attend? Well, I remember being on a job in Merthyr</div><div id="00:15:40.720" class="transcript_line"> and doing the work there, and I stripped the carburettor down on the roadside, and, you know,</div><div id="00:15:49.120" class="transcript_line"> just in the back of my van, and I was getting all spread out there, and, you know, seeing this carburettor,</div><div id="00:15:58.880" class="transcript_line"> there was a blockage tucked away in one of the little ports of the carb, and then to my order,</div><div id="00:16:08.640" class="transcript_line"> a mass of people came out, the bingo had finished up the road, and they came and they were</div><div id="00:16:17.200" class="transcript_line"> streaming down into town, and they were going, and I thought, heavens above, they were dodging down</div><div id="00:16:22.880" class="transcript_line"> the side of my van, and I thought, I&#039;m gonna be lucky if I have half the parts to complete this job.</div><div id="00:16:30.480" class="transcript_line"> And did you manage? Oh, I could have started out, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:35.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, with the job of being, when you had to, you know, improvise and, you know, make do,</div><div id="00:16:42.640" class="transcript_line"> you know, with what you could find to fix it, you know, all sorts of things like you do, you know,</div><div id="00:16:51.200" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;d use a prep, you know, if you wanted a clip or anything, you know,</div><div id="00:16:59.280" class="transcript_line"> and I know there&#039;s lots of things you could do, like, and, like, if you were to leak in petrol tank,</div><div id="00:17:08.640" class="transcript_line"> you know, you&#039;d get it in, the petrol would be pouring out, but you&#039;d have to</div><div id="00:17:17.200" class="transcript_line"> jack the vehicle up as high as you could to send the petrol, the fluid that was in the tank</div><div id="00:17:24.240" class="transcript_line"> to the front of the tank, and then I&#039;d get a self-tapping screw with fiber water and a cement,</div><div id="00:17:33.360" class="transcript_line"> you know, and tighten that into the tank, and it stopped leaking, and they could go on their way up</div><div id="00:17:40.960" class="transcript_line"> and get seen to it for opportunity. So, above all, you had to be versatile, I&#039;m sure.</div><div id="00:17:49.520" class="transcript_line"> You were, okay, you mentioned Mirth at Sidville now, you were obviously sent further afield.</div><div id="00:17:57.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, but when the service was better known and people used to use it, you could find yourself</div><div id="00:18:09.520" class="transcript_line"> anywhere, you know. I&#039;d be around at night, you know, on an evening shift, and then there were</div><div id="00:18:17.680" class="transcript_line"> night jobs in the evening, you know, and you&#039;d be running late, and we&#039;d get to some people&#039;s houses,</div><div id="00:18:26.720" class="transcript_line"> and they would insist that you have a coming in every couple of days, and, you know, and they would</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> say to me, how far are you going to go home? And I would mention my own town of Landon, where I&#039;d</div><div id="00:18:39.680" class="transcript_line"> moved to, and then, and I&#039;d say, they&#039;d say, you poor lad, you&#039;re going to go all that way home,</div><div id="00:18:47.040" class="transcript_line"> surely you could stay down here for the night. And did you, did you often stay? No, I never stayed,</div><div id="00:18:55.360" class="transcript_line"> I always went back home, in many cases, yeah, and in the recovery business, when we were in the</div><div id="00:19:02.480" class="transcript_line"> Lourdes, you know, we&#039;d get Lourdes, and, you know, and we went from the motorcycle accommodations to</div><div id="00:19:10.560" class="transcript_line"> minivans, then on to, to bigger vans like Transits, and then, of course, we went, with the recovery</div><div id="00:19:24.000" class="transcript_line"> service, we had Land Rovers, and the Transit, the one in 19th, you know, which were a bigger van,</div><div id="00:19:31.680" class="transcript_line"> and also Lourdes, you know, Ford, Transit, Traders, and that sort of thing, you know,</div><div id="00:19:40.320" class="transcript_line"> and Bedford, and you&#039;d land up, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, things certainly moved on, and do you remember anything else that happened of note,</div><div id="00:19:51.360" class="transcript_line"> any other jobs? Again, you&#039;ve mentioned the Merther one, you know, there must be a few more.</div><div id="00:19:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember starting from Beulah, with a vehicle on board, a lady wanted to go to a gold</div><div id="00:20:05.760" class="transcript_line"> and wedding anniversary celebration in Manchester, you know, she&#039;d broken down, and</div><div id="00:20:13.280" class="transcript_line"> I started off from Beulah, went all the way to Clowes Top, which is the Kidderminster,</div><div id="00:20:20.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, Budely Road, like that, and I found myself suddenly in snow, and here it covered the</div><div id="00:20:29.760" class="transcript_line"> clentils, and there were drifts up to two and a half to three foot deep in places, and I went over</div><div id="00:20:37.280" class="transcript_line"> the top, and knowing what could be any of me, and it was, you know, the road completely blocked with</div><div id="00:20:44.960" class="transcript_line"> traffic, six cars, either over the edge or on top of the edge between there,</div><div id="00:20:52.480" class="transcript_line"> and Budely, sort of a distance of three miles, and I landed up in Birmingham, all right,</div><div id="00:20:59.040" class="transcript_line"> I got there, and that&#039;s what it&#039;s like. I got into Birmingham, and the superintendent in charge of</div><div id="00:21:06.960" class="transcript_line"> the district had shut the Birmingham depot down completely, because he considered it was</div><div id="00:21:14.880" class="transcript_line"> hazardous, you know, to go outside, and he offered to put me up in a hotel for the night, and I said,</div><div id="00:21:22.960" class="transcript_line"> well, I said, you know, I would like to try and get back home, because my colleague who was doing</div><div id="00:21:28.240" class="transcript_line"> the night shift was coming on, who&#039;d worked the lorry, and he said, well, I&#039;ll leave it entirely</div><div id="00:21:33.760" class="transcript_line"> after you, and so off I went, and joined the motorway, and driving blizzard, there was snow,</div><div id="00:21:42.560" class="transcript_line"> went down there so far, beginning to think I&#039;ve made a mistake here,</div><div id="00:21:48.400" class="transcript_line"> but I went on down, came off at Worcester, and went through Worcester to go over Bromir Downs,</div><div id="00:21:56.720" class="transcript_line"> and then I ran into the snow, well, not the snow so much, it was the vehicles were all</div><div id="00:22:06.240" class="transcript_line"> parked up, couldn&#039;t make it over there, that&#039;s what it stopped, I could have gone over there,</div><div id="00:22:11.520" class="transcript_line"> and anyway, halfway through the evening, we were standing around waiting for the</div><div id="00:22:19.840" class="transcript_line"> ploughs to come and open it up, a fellow in the lorry said to me, I could get over there, he said,</div><div id="00:22:26.560" class="transcript_line"> I know if it&#039;s a road, it&#039;ll remain clear, but I said, well, if you won&#039;t have a go, I said,</div><div id="00:22:34.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll come behind you, I said, but I&#039;ll leave you plenty of distance, I said, you know,</div><div id="00:22:41.440" class="transcript_line"> he got to the very top, just about another 20 yards to go, and a car that was parked after</div><div id="00:22:48.000" class="transcript_line"> pulled out in front of him, and stopped him straight away, we all had to reverse</div><div id="00:22:54.880" class="transcript_line"> back to the end of the queue, and we reversed down there, and I thought, well, this is no use,</div><div id="00:23:03.040" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re not going to be here clear for another two or two and a half hours by what the news was, so</div><div id="00:23:08.960" class="transcript_line"> anyway, I knew the area well, I knew there was a farmhouse, I thought, if I have a word with</div><div id="00:23:18.640" class="transcript_line"> somebody who could point me where the driveway to the, across common wet ground is, could point me</div><div id="00:23:26.880" class="transcript_line"> to that, I said, I could reverse into it, and turn around and go back to Worcester, and come down to</div><div id="00:23:33.280" class="transcript_line"> Ledbury, turn off your strength, and turn there, which I did, and anyway, I met the old farmer, and</div><div id="00:23:43.280" class="transcript_line"> he said, you aim for between those two rush, rush bushes, you know, and he said, that&#039;s the road</div><div id="00:23:50.880" class="transcript_line"> comes between those, so I did that, and it was a wave, but it was pretty hard going there, but</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> once I got to Ledbury, it was clear, yeah. Well, you&#039;ve certainly had some interesting</div><div id="00:24:03.760" class="transcript_line"> experiences, a bit hairy. Oh, I have a few. You have. You must, during your career there, you must have met some</div><div id="00:24:12.000" class="transcript_line"> interesting characters. Are there any people who sort of stand out, people that you dealt with, helped, etc.?</div><div id="00:24:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Well, I dealt with one or two. I met with the Russell Grant once, and then I met with Philip Maddock,</div><div id="00:24:30.240" class="transcript_line"> you know, and he, I told him, and he drove, he steered his wife&#039;s car to a garage in</div><div id="00:24:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Abergavenny, so that, you know, they&#039;d do what was necessary in a few days. Next,</div><div id="00:24:47.600" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a Gilbert show, it was from, you know, so, oh, but, you know,</div><div id="00:24:55.680" class="transcript_line"> the two runnies used to be about years ago, Coedians, remember those? I did. And I met the,</div><div id="00:25:04.240" class="transcript_line"> the more serious one, the younger one, and he had a truck problem with his car, and I fixed that for him,</div><div id="00:25:15.520" class="transcript_line"> so, you&#039;ll bet I&#039;ve got a few. Well, you certainly have. You&#039;ve met up with quite a few famous,</div><div id="00:25:21.840" class="transcript_line"> well-known people, haven&#039;t you? Yes. And you always tried to get home to, to Llandrindod, whenever</div><div id="00:25:29.200" class="transcript_line"> you caught. Oh, yeah, I would. I&#039;d always get back, give the way for about two hours out, you know,</div><div id="00:25:35.120" class="transcript_line"> and say, well, look, I&#039;ve eaten, and, or you look, where is it? Yes, where are you now?</div><div id="00:25:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;ve certainly been very, very well travelled. You&#039;ve mentioned Manchester and</div><div id="00:25:46.160" class="transcript_line"> Merthyr. Where&#039;s the furthest you ever had to go to, to assist? Well, the furthest that I</div><div id="00:25:55.120" class="transcript_line"> think I ever to any cooking miles was during the fuel shortage when the Cuba crisis was on.</div><div id="00:26:03.840" class="transcript_line"> That was the, because I couldn&#039;t get fuel around Bristol area, the Bristol depot was almost,</div><div id="00:26:12.720" class="transcript_line"> had a standstill, you know, but because I got petrol on board, it wanted me to go to pick up a</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> vehicle on a very cold freezing night, and it was between, supposed to be between Gloucester</div><div id="00:26:30.160" class="transcript_line"> and, you know, at the Tembury Wells. It was a place, anyway, I went there,</div><div id="00:26:44.240" class="transcript_line"> and I kept going, I couldn&#039;t find this vehicle anywhere. And we were all in our areas,</div><div id="00:26:51.680" class="transcript_line"> regardless of snow conditions, but round the area, and the black mountains, they had quite a bit of</div><div id="00:26:58.960" class="transcript_line"> snow. And I landed up near enough in Oxford, you know, along the old A40, trying to find this person</div><div id="00:27:13.680" class="transcript_line"> and I finally found them on the return trip, and they were tucked away around, they found a narrow</div><div id="00:27:20.400" class="transcript_line"> road and got down, it was a bit of a waste ground on the side of the road, a way up the road,</div><div id="00:27:26.400" class="transcript_line"> completely, but that was it, like, I got them and we had to boil water on East Amphur Band,</div><div id="00:27:35.680" class="transcript_line"> which I went out to it then to free my wraps, which were frozen solid on the vehicle.</div><div id="00:27:47.200" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;ve certainly had a lot of adventures, haven&#039;t you, or perhaps misadventures,</div><div id="00:27:52.640" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve mixed with the rich and famous, you&#039;ve been all over the place. Did you enjoy your</div><div id="00:27:58.880" class="transcript_line"> retirement in Llandrindod? Did you? You retired to Llandrindod?</div><div id="00:28:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Sure, I retired in 1994, and I enjoyed my retirement, I spent it going on holidays,</div><div id="00:28:14.400" class="transcript_line"> quite a lot, although I&#039;d done a fair bit before, I think I&#039;d covered most areas of the British</div><div id="00:28:22.400" class="transcript_line"> House, including the Sillies, you know, and the Arctic and Shetland and those like, and</div><div id="00:28:29.360" class="transcript_line"> so I&#039;ve enjoyed my retirement. Well, that&#039;s absolutely fine.</div><div id="00:28:40.720" class="transcript_line"> Now, I believe, Ron, you started saying something about two damsels in distress,</div><div id="00:28:45.280" class="transcript_line"> would you like to enlarge on that, when they lost something?</div><div id="00:28:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s a bit of a funny subject, really.</div><div id="00:28:57.040" class="transcript_line"> These two damsels, we had to call late in the afternoon to go to a course that the keys had</div><div id="00:29:05.440" class="transcript_line"> been lost, and I decided to go myself out to the job, because I thought I was a bit more able to</div><div id="00:29:17.600" class="transcript_line"> deal with it than the Llandrindod available, and I went out to it, and I went and I published two</div><div id="00:29:27.120" class="transcript_line"> young ladies, very attractive ladies, very smartly dressed, you know, and a course, 911, you know,</div><div id="00:29:34.800" class="transcript_line"> and which is a sports car, you know, and which to my surprise contained a radio and all in,</div><div id="00:29:42.080" class="transcript_line"> you know, radio communication. I don&#039;t know what job they did, you know, and I said,</div><div id="00:29:49.440" class="transcript_line"> tell me what, I always like to cover what happened before they found it, you know, when they&#039;ve been,</div><div id="00:29:56.640" class="transcript_line"> she said, well, they&#039;ve been out with two fellows to a pub in Llandr, and they were coming back with</div><div id="00:30:07.040" class="transcript_line"> a carafal vine, trying to keep it from spilling, and anyway it fell and it broke,</div><div id="00:30:16.080" class="transcript_line"> and they disposed of the glass over the edge, right, well that&#039;s not a very good thing to do,</div><div id="00:30:22.960" class="transcript_line"> like with animals, you know, but she said they&#039;re there, and they had the place, they had the local</div><div id="00:30:30.640" class="transcript_line"> garage, you know, Lenovo, you know, Robin, the boy&#039;s name, I forget his name now, but</div><div id="00:30:44.800" class="transcript_line"> Falconers, they were, do you remember him?

And they&#039;d been out to them, they couldn&#039;t do</div><div id="00:30:51.040" class="transcript_line"> anything except smash the window, they said, you know, a poor sport car, they didn&#039;t want to do that,</div><div id="00:30:57.920" class="transcript_line"> you know, but they wanted to get home, and I, if I remember rightly, I said to them, well,</div><div id="00:31:08.000" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s get them over, I said, what about these two fellows, I said, where are they now?</div><div id="00:31:15.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they&#039;d gone early that morning back home, I said, have you been in contact with them, you know,</div><div id="00:31:22.400" class="transcript_line"> got the keys off them, got the knowledge of where they think the keys were, and they got them with</div><div id="00:31:30.560" class="transcript_line"> them, you know, no, they&#039;d got them with them, they didn&#039;t know, anyway, I said to them, well,</div><div id="00:31:40.800" class="transcript_line"> I said, they were staying in a little tiny building alongside the old mill, like,</div><div id="00:31:47.680" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t know it did, and they were there, and they,</div><div id="00:31:58.000" class="transcript_line"> said, and it contained one room up, and just the landing upstairs, like,</div><div id="00:32:05.360" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, the first thing I did, we searched from the car and all around the ground,</div><div id="00:32:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I said, have you searched upstairs, like, no, we didn&#039;t, no, downstairs we searched, no, nothing</div><div id="00:32:19.520" class="transcript_line"> there, and anyway, I said, well, let&#039;s go upstairs, well, there&#039;s nothing up there, she said, there&#039;s</div><div id="00:32:26.320" class="transcript_line"> only like a flat landing, and then, you know, and then nothing there, and I said, well, let&#039;s have</div><div id="00:32:33.760" class="transcript_line"> a look anyway, and I was going around from corner to corner to check in, and I picked</div><div id="00:32:39.600" class="transcript_line"> all the way with an old rusty tin, you know, and I knew straight away that there was something heavier</div><div id="00:32:47.520" class="transcript_line"> than what should normally be in that tin, and I said, hang on, I said, oh, she said, don&#039;t touch</div><div id="00:32:53.120" class="transcript_line"> that, there&#039;s a rat poison in there, rat poison in there, I said, well, is there something else here as</div><div id="00:32:59.440" class="transcript_line"> well, and we moved to the window, and I said, look, I opened it, and there were the keys inside.</div><div id="00:33:07.200" class="transcript_line"> So, Ron, you turned detective as well. So, we went over there, and I tried to get a fast</div><div id="00:33:15.840" class="transcript_line"> search of keys from Port in London in between that, you know, to send them down, and, but no joy,</div><div id="00:33:23.120" class="transcript_line"> nothing under three days before it would get to that awful, and I was there, she said, oh,</div><div id="00:33:30.880" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s a blingin&#039; blow, boy, she said, did that, and she said to her friend, they ratted on us,</div><div id="00:33:41.440" class="transcript_line"> they said, last night, something, they did this bit of a hapset over, and so she got on the phone,</div><div id="00:33:49.840" class="transcript_line"> she didn&#039;t have to strip off. She said, I think, she said, you&#039;ll be having bills from the police,</div><div id="00:34:00.240" class="transcript_line"> she said, we&#039;re wasting time, and also the garage, we&#039;re wasting time, and she said, I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:34:07.680" class="transcript_line"> what they&#039;re gonna charge us, but they were glad to, and I saw them safely on their way, and that was it,</div><div id="00:34:16.480" class="transcript_line"> but over there&#039;s so many things you could tell, like, you know, I&#039;m sure, yes,</div><div id="00:34:22.640" class="transcript_line"> you could write a book on it, indeed, it would be a very interesting book as well,</div><div id="00:34:27.120" class="transcript_line"> my word, my word, and how many AA men were actually based where you were in your section?</div><div id="00:34:35.120" class="transcript_line"> In this area of London as well, we had an inspector, and he had one man in Llandud,</div><div id="00:34:46.160" class="transcript_line"> myself, out of Dolly to start, and another boy up at London, Badron, one in Bill, sorry,</div><div id="00:34:55.600" class="transcript_line"> and then there&#039;s one in Reader as well, and that was more or less it, for this particular area,</div><div id="00:35:06.640" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s a part of an area of Aberystwyth where they got eight patrols over there, and there were</div><div id="00:35:16.400" class="transcript_line"> six in Newtown area, which weren&#039;t for us to start, but joined us later on,</div><div id="00:35:27.920" class="transcript_line"> yeah, so they got a lot of patrols in those days, you know, and we always think what we did to the</div><div id="00:35:33.840" class="transcript_line"> others did to Badron.
