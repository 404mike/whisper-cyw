    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I left school when I was 15 and I started working in the pit when I was, you know, in September.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I was 15 in June, I went to the pit.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> September, because you know, you want to space the time when you want to apply to go in the pits.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> My class to go down the pit.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I went in when I was 15, I went in a couple of months.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Then my training in Boggard, or gallery it was called, and we had blocks there, you know,</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> learning us what was going to happen when you go down the pit, eventually get down the pit.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> We done a bit of parking and we done road work and things like all the rails and different things</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> before we actually went underground.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they teach you a lot of health and safety things?</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, they did in a way, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of, well, because we was young, you know, you had a lot of young boys with us,</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t want to know, but they were saying we had to rely on each other, you know,</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> to get on with it because otherwise if you didn&#039;t, you could have an accident, you know,</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> which I remember one time he was doing a thing and this boy was just throwing material about</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> which he should have been doing, you know, and when he was told he wouldn&#039;t listen,</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> so they sucked, they were like, you know.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you agree with that?</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to listen to what you were told otherwise, like when we eventually went underground,</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> it would be too dangerous to do things like that.</div><div id="00:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I went then underground and in the old school and it was called in Bargur itself,</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> like and he started to work and they had two different things like again,</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> like learning about safety and all and, you know, and that&#039;s how we went,</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> we went from there then, we did 16 weeks in there, we also went to college in Aswad Manak,</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> at the time he was the first, not the trainee, to go to Aswad Manak College.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course because we were to do with the mines, people in Aswad, the other students,</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> they would want to do different things, like someone&#039;s going in for lawyers,</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> someone&#039;s going in for to be a doctor and things like that, but because we were miners,</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> the teachers didn&#039;t like us a lot, to be honest.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it because you were miners or because you were disruptive?</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think it&#039;s because we were miners, to be honest, and you know.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they not think that, you know, you should be in college?</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They more or less favored the other people rather than ourselves, like you know.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you manage to pass the college course?</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, what it was, we wouldn&#039;t, like we had boys with us, and it was from the other valleys,</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and all, they couldn&#039;t even sign their alphabet and all that, they didn&#039;t know it, to be honest.</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t call them dull, but they didn&#039;t care because they didn&#039;t want to learn like, you know.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course they learned their math when we were in college, we didn&#039;t do such a thing as,</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> like we wouldn&#039;t have to be educated as such, like, you know, with them, like to their standards,</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> like we were just there as miners because we have to go there and learn a little bit, like you know.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And, well, we went from there then, I went early in scholarly, went down to get there,</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> went into training phase, got on with it there, like you know, and working with this bloke,</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> like you know, and he said, you know, he&#039;s good fun, like you know, in the long times, like,</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> but he was a bit strict, like, and he said, you get him with it one day, and of course,</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> like he had his accident on his foot, I had an accident on my arm, like, you know, a stone fell and stuck in my arm.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, it was a bit deep, like, and then this fellow come, the other miner come up,</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and he had a chewbacca in his mouth, and just spit on it, like, he said, I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in, like, you know, I was in, like, you know, but he just laughed it off, like,</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> but I had to be able to work for a couple of days, like, because I was young, like, I was only 15 at the time,</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and he said, you know, you&#039;ve got to stay home, like, for a couple of days, like, you know.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you get paid?</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, you get paid, you know, compensation, no compensation, but...</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Sick pay.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Sick pay, yeah, I said, yeah, and, you know.</div><div id="00:05:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So did it heal completely?</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was alright after a day or two, like, but there was a funny part, like, when he spit the bacca on it,</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, and just look at it, oh, it did get better, you know, I take the thing, like,</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and he just laughed it off, like, you know.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But I went from there then to the face, and I ended up as what he called a pick-boy, like, you know,</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but I was there, punches in the ground, like, and I was, my job then was to look after him, maintain him,</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> fix him up for the man that was actually on the call in the face to use, like, alright.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, that was my first job, and when I come out the train and face, I was a pick-boy, like, you know.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you enjoy it?</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it, like, you know, but then you go, well, I went from there then,</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I went on the timber for a couple of years because, to be honest, because I was good on the timber,</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> they kept me on the timber, right?</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I could have had a job, say, in the face, but they said no, because, like, I just do,</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> they said to get the timber what I wanted, I just go and do it and make sure they had the supplies to do it,</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, and they paid me the great end, the great end for great ones,</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> they could do a not job, you know, because they didn&#039;t want to get rid of me as a timber boy,</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> like, I didn&#039;t like it, but they didn&#039;t want me to, you know, go into the face, like, because...</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you were too good at your job.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and of course I was in it, and then I actually went into the face, and I, you know,</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and Doubtedheazen bars they was calling, you know, Meetebars and Doubtedheazen, you know,</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> they had machine cutting all the coal in, I didn&#039;t have to actually dig one of them,</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> because stents as they used to call them, you&#039;d say a 12 foot or 18 foot or 24 foot stents as they did on,</div><div id="00:07:16.000" class="transcript_line"> the better he was, the more you could do, like, and then so they would pay,</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> but he was on it, but the machine was cutting the coal, and we&#039;d just put them bars and Doubtedheazen up,</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> like, you know, and we had pushers, and he was calling, and he just pushed the machine over,</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> it was a lot easier, you know.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you...</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was years before, like, you know, I was lucky I got in at the right time,</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> when you did have to really work hard, like, on the coal, see.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I went from there then into the road work, like, you know.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was harder than what I was doing on the Doubtedheazen bars, like,</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> because you had to use a shovel and you had to pack four things,</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and things like that, put the rings up, lock them and things like that.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> This sounds like a hard job in the minefield.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I enjoyed doing it, like, you know.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, of course, we had different grades, and he&#039;d come in,</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and when you had different grades, and he&#039;d come in, grade one was 22 pounds,</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> grade two was 18 pounds, and you&#039;d have a bit less if it was a grade three in the road,</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> which I didn&#039;t agree with, because we still all had to do the same amount of work, really.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And they changed it in the end, and then you all had the same amount of money, like.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But we were doing different things, like, like, I was in the road,</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and then we were doing different jobs, like.</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, Dr. Cooley was in the team, and they&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> oh, come up the road today, you know, we&#039;re going to the face, and then from there,</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> then you&#039;re going to do other things, like, even sometimes they tell you to go</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> park out and drive things, and things like that, you know,</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> when anything keeps the cold coming out, you know, and that.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you know of any people with any kind of disabilities,</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> whether it was a learning disability, a physical disability working in the mines,</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> or had a disability from an accident?</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew some I couldn&#039;t read and write, you know, but they got on with the job,</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> as long as they could do the work, they didn&#039;t care about the education side of it, you know.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I had buddies that couldn&#039;t read and write, they didn&#039;t care.</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I wasn&#039;t too clever myself, you know, but they got on with the job, like, you know.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> As long as they could do the work, they didn&#039;t mind, you know,</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t worry about whether they was educated or not, really, like, you know.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I knew people, like my friend, he had polio when he was young,</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and he came into the pit to work, like, you know, and we used to limp a lot,</div><div id="00:09:59.000" class="transcript_line"> like, they gave him a good job, like, you know, he just got on with it and all.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they make any allowances? Did you have anything to help him?</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, they allowed him to work at the ground with us, like, you know,</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> and we had had polio, like, and his one leg wasn&#039;t, you know, right,</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> he was limping all the time, like, and as long as he could get on with the work,</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t mind, like, you know, like he did do.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Was there any kind of discrimination against people who did it?</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> No, not really, no. We didn&#039;t discriminate things from people.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The thing is that, as long as they could do the work, and, you know,</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> they just got on with it, like, you know, they didn&#039;t bother about anything,</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> as long as you&#039;ve done your work.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It does sound very... Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> ...equalities, you know, everybody&#039;s equal when you&#039;re down the pit.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The only thing is, like you&#039;re saying about different things that happened</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> when I was here, like, one of my friends got killed in the pit, like, you know,</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> he got buried and he died like a stick.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> How did he die? He was not killed. He was winning.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a measuring boy, like, he went into measure,</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and the men was having their food outside,</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and he went out, and we got all the way, he got tied up in the air,</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and they just clapped, you know, and he got killed that way.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> The friend of mine, he lived in the same street as him, and all that, like, you know, and...</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And was his family compensated?</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t know why, but we never went into it.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I know what I mean in them days, like, they did,</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but money meant nothing, like, our compensation really did it, one.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They lost their son, like, and we lost a friend.</div><div id="00:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And then another friend, then he got killed in there.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> One time, like, we played and all that, and he got killed in a nasty way, like, you know.</div><div id="00:11:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He was dragging rings, he was working on, and he&#039;d been on the electrician</div><div id="00:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> with the outside doing something to the parlance for the, like, cut down his big wheel</div><div id="00:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> with the cutter, like, and he&#039;d run down the parlance, and then chopped him up, like.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, well, you know about that now.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I had another friend, then, he was the one of me, got killed with the cutter and all that, you know.</div><div id="00:12:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was all in Elliot&#039;s pit, like, you know.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And were things changed after these terrible accidents?</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.

Elliot&#039;s Pit was more like a big family, because we were all, when we went to Bedford&#039;s Pit there was a lot of foreigners working, like Poles and Missouanians.</div><div id="00:15:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They were like, oh, he wasn&#039;t the same as us, some of them, you know, because they were more selfish than us in a way, like, you know, like, where we&#039;d say, be doing a job, we&#039;d say, oh, I&#039;m having so much.</div><div id="00:15:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and I am, but they wouldn&#039;t tell us how much he was earning, see, you know what I mean? That type of thing, like, you know.</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But if there was an accident, would everybody...</div><div id="00:15:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, if it was an accident, we&#039;d be all together like that then.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, good, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But, like, they&#039;d be selfish, where they wouldn&#039;t tell you how much you were earning, like, you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Why not tell us, like, you know, they&#039;d give them rates, they&#039;d get all the work.</div><div id="00:15:40.000" class="transcript_line"> When I went to Bedford&#039;s Pit, I suppose they didn&#039;t include one turn at a later point, like belt turning and all that.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know nothing about that, because we had to learn on the spot, like, you know, went there, we managed with work, and I like, you know, some of the foreigners, they had to show us what to do, because we&#039;d never seen, like, the other, like, the Kunchum walker machine, it was called.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a jigger, you know. I&#039;d never even seen one, I know, I know, tuned it.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d have to learn us what to do. And they had to learn on the spot, like, when they would tell us how to do it, they could work on it.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would do, in fact, they&#039;d say, like, well, they wouldn&#039;t finish the job, we had to do other jobs before we turned out, like, get an extra call-off to make sure we could get the machine opening things.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, that meant then we&#039;d be late doing it.</div><div id="00:16:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, these folks didn&#039;t mind, because they knew they could work on, we couldn&#039;t work on, because we had to catch a bus to get open up.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But they were local, most of them, like, you know, and we didn&#039;t mind, like, we still got on with the job, still got on together, like, you know, they were doing all right.</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was good days, like, a bad day, you know what I mean, like, you know.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Your whole experience, would you say, was enjoyable?</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fantastic, I wouldn&#039;t change it, but, you know, it was just things that were happening, like, you know, in it.</div><div id="00:17:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And, like, I had another friend, and he just dropped dead in the ground, like, because I was in his old man to me, like, you know what I mean, and he was just on a switch, as they&#039;d call it, and we went to catch a bus, and he said, oh, where&#039;s he gone, and he wouldn&#039;t tell us what happened.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, by the time he got on, he said, oh, he must be working on, like, you know, and he must have had a lift home, but he had died, like, and he wouldn&#039;t tell us.</div><div id="00:17:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So, of course, my friend then, like, he said, oh, I&#039;ve got to go past his house, and his wife every morning used to be on the door, and we found out in the end, like, that he had died, and they wouldn&#039;t tell us anything, you know, before we went.</div><div id="00:18:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, the bus started, like, someone slipped up, and oh, he died, you know. He didn&#039;t know what to say to his wife.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So, one thing, like, I like, you know, it&#039;s sad, but, you know, but they get on with it, and then you do different jobs, and, like, you know, you just go back to work the same day, and all, and get on.</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to like it. You can have fun to say, oh, well, he died, so he can&#039;t go to work, and you&#039;re into the funeral, and things like that, but, no, he don&#039;t say, I will offer some of the mine, the pit might turn out in the morning, and say, oh, you can have a day off.</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes they turn out and say, oh, you bet you&#039;re going to make out, I want to, or whatever, like, you know what I mean. So.</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you very much.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, when the pit finished, then, like, and then started off, and we started off with this, he was saying, oh, do you want to come in business with me? He said, what are we doing, Billy? He said, putting toilets down the pit.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, when we were done with the job, and the bed was picked after the strike in the 1950s, about 55 strike, and we were the first pit to close, and we got a super idea, this was a job anyway, you know.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So, we had done a lot of work before we went back into the pits, like, carry on with it, putting toilets down the pit, but they come out there and help in safety, so some pits are to have them put in, you know, you know, you went up to Yorkshire and you said, I don&#039;t have them.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So, we also worked in private mines and all, adrift mines and all that, you know what I mean. When it was for mines, it didn&#039;t just in coal, it was the coal, but it was various mines, you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:20:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And, well, we had the money for it, you know, but the pits closed so quickly, so we had to go into, we were with film companies and stuff like that, you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:20:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were saying, oh, do all the money, but they didn&#039;t give us money to do it, we had to pay all the money we borrowed and off of board and all to set it up and all that, we had to pay it all back, they didn&#039;t give it to us.</div><div id="00:20:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So, which, well, you know, money to do it like that and different things like that.</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thank you very much. Glen, have you got anything to add?</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The man he was saying about foreigners, Poles and Lithuanians mostly worked for Tysons, which were contractors to the coal board.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why they were on different rates of money to us. They were on better money, a lot better money, because, yeah, a lot better money than we were on, but they worked the downside out of it too.</div><div id="00:21:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They worked, they would do anything, they would do anything, you know, and they worked, like, long hours, but they were, you know, Tysons were...</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No, when I done it, when I&#039;m saying this, when we went from Elliot&#039;s pit to Bedford&#039;s pit, they were supposed to be the same as us.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They wasn&#039;t working, they was working for the board, they wasn&#039;t working for Tysons.</div><div id="00:21:39.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They was working for us, for the board, you know, the ones we were, I&#039;m on about that, you know.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, like we&#039;re saying Tysons or other, they was hard working and they did do, they deserved their money, because they would do anything, you know.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a woman, they say they&#039;d be one in junctions and saying, like, which big curders and all that.</div><div id="00:22:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They knew the work and they knew how to do it, they was working like Tysons and all that, which they did deserve their money for it, you know, and I&#039;m not saying they didn&#039;t deserve it.</div><div id="00:22:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I&#039;m saying is, when we was there, when we went from Elliot&#039;s to Bedford&#039;s, it was a different thing, you know.</div></div></p>
