    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Firstly on behalf of HDA let me say thank you to Heritage Lottery for giving us the</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> support we needed to deliver this series of podcasts about Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:00:16.720" class="transcript_line"> And let me also say anything we say on here is not the responsibility or the opinion of</div><div id="00:00:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Heritage Lottery.</div><div id="00:00:28.600" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a community project and the community has a right to a voice and that is hopefully</div><div id="00:00:35.520" class="transcript_line"> what we&#039;re capturing.</div><div id="00:00:41.400" class="transcript_line"> But all of the podcasts will remain and we&#039;ll move to the People&#039;s Collection for Wales</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> at the end of this work.</div><div id="00:00:50.360" class="transcript_line"> They will remain live on the podcast for at least another nine months.</div><div id="00:00:55.200" class="transcript_line"> But the podcasts are intended to give you an idea of the people, the community, the</div><div id="00:01:00.600" class="transcript_line"> village that was Tiger Bay, Butetown, whatever you wanted to call it.</div><div id="00:01:07.480" class="transcript_line"> But it was a village of real people who worked really hard, who lived and died for Wales</div><div id="00:01:18.520" class="transcript_line"> in many, many regards.</div><div id="00:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> They were all races, they were all faiths, they were all languages.</div><div id="00:01:25.520" class="transcript_line"> And any of the stories or any of the oral histories you&#039;ve heard on here will continually</div><div id="00:01:32.200" class="transcript_line"> say about how they lived together in unity, shared each other&#039;s religious festivals,</div><div id="00:01:42.480" class="transcript_line"> each other&#039;s homes, each other&#039;s food.</div><div id="00:01:47.320" class="transcript_line"> However, that wasn&#039;t the case outside of the bay.</div><div id="00:01:55.160" class="transcript_line"> The rest of society, despite the contribution made in the First World War, which of course</div><div id="00:02:01.720" class="transcript_line"> as we said was followed by race riots against the people and later race riots against the</div><div id="00:02:07.880" class="transcript_line"> Chinese, despite that.</div><div id="00:02:12.440" class="transcript_line"> In the wars, people experienced overt racism and a policy that was never totally encapsulated</div><div id="00:02:22.160" class="transcript_line"> in law but became a reality.</div><div id="00:02:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m going to read you a few passages from a book by a man who I really wish we&#039;d been</div><div id="00:02:37.920" class="transcript_line"> able to include in these podcasts.</div><div id="00:02:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Not simply because he was one of the few people who put pen to paper and put it in a couple</div><div id="00:02:50.840" class="transcript_line"> of really good books about Tiger Bay, but also because it&#039;s a terrible shame that he&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:59.720" class="transcript_line"> not with us anymore.</div><div id="00:03:01.760" class="transcript_line"> That man was Neil M.C. Sinclair who wrote the Tiger Bay story and a follow-up book called</div><div id="00:03:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Endangered Tiger, a Community Under Threat.</div><div id="00:03:20.040" class="transcript_line"> And few people knew more about the bay than Neil Sinclair.</div><div id="00:03:28.640" class="transcript_line"> Now the press attacked the people of Tiger Bay, generally with things they made up about</div><div id="00:03:38.040" class="transcript_line"> prostitution, about crimes, none of which was supported by any evidence.</div><div id="00:03:46.400" class="transcript_line"> But there wasn&#039;t, as far as I&#039;m aware, a press complaints body then and anyway who would</div><div id="00:03:51.760" class="transcript_line"> have listened to the complaints from the residents of Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:03:58.560" class="transcript_line"> But there was also a colour bar.</div><div id="00:04:00.600" class="transcript_line"> Now that&#039;s not mentioned much and you certainly won&#039;t see people talking about it generally</div><div id="00:04:08.120" class="transcript_line"> within society now, however it existed.</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> So let me read you an excerpt from someone who knew and who&#039;s, well, I value his opinion</div><div id="00:04:23.760" class="transcript_line"> immensely.</div><div id="00:04:25.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s Neil Sinclair and this is from the Tiger Bay story.</div><div id="00:04:29.360" class="transcript_line"> In July of 1935 the following was published in the Western Mail.</div><div id="00:04:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Quote, hundreds of Arab and coloured seamen have settled in the city.</div><div id="00:04:41.040" class="transcript_line"> They construct their own places of worship.</div><div id="00:04:44.360" class="transcript_line"> They mate with the type of women who are willing to accept them because there are none of their</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> own kind to be hailed.</div><div id="00:04:55.840" class="transcript_line"> The coloured men who have come to dwell in our cities are being made to adopt the standards</div><div id="00:05:01.040" class="transcript_line"> civilisation they cannot be expected to understand.</div><div id="00:05:06.360" class="transcript_line"> There is no reason for sentimentality in this matter.</div><div id="00:05:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Let him who pleads the justice of the coloured man&#039;s settlement among us read the report&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:15.520" class="transcript_line"> references to venereal disease and the heavy toll of tuberculosis among our guests.</div><div id="00:05:23.800" class="transcript_line"> Many of them are citizens of the British Empire.</div><div id="00:05:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Many did fine work in the war.</div><div id="00:05:28.920" class="transcript_line"> Neither of these considerations should blind us to the plain fact they do not belong to</div><div id="00:05:35.720" class="transcript_line"> the social system we have evolved in these islands.</div><div id="00:05:43.400" class="transcript_line"> Despite the work of my grandmother, that&#039;s Neil Sinclair&#039;s grandmother, Agnes Headley,</div><div id="00:05:50.840" class="transcript_line"> she was merely one of the type of women who were willing to accept a black man and in</div><div id="00:05:56.760" class="transcript_line"> that system her daughter Beatrice was referred to as a, in quotes, half-caste.</div><div id="00:06:05.200" class="transcript_line"> Now at a time before my brother Leonard died, Beatrice and her best friend Katie Nathan,</div><div id="00:06:11.240" class="transcript_line"> two in quotes half-caste girls, decided on a day out uptown.</div><div id="00:06:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Let me explain here, uptown is outside the bay.</div><div id="00:06:24.880" class="transcript_line"> They put on their best clothes to go.</div><div id="00:06:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Of course Leonard, who wasn&#039;t quite two, had to be taken along.</div><div id="00:06:31.440" class="transcript_line"> There was rarely the convenience of babysitters back then in the 1930s, so babies were dressed</div><div id="00:06:37.080" class="transcript_line"> up and taken too.</div><div id="00:06:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Having spent a busy afternoon window shopping and otherwise enjoying themselves, the thought</div><div id="00:06:44.700" class="transcript_line"> of a nice cup of tea easily sprang to mind.</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> So they stopped at an Italian cafe in St Mary Street called Rabiotti.</div><div id="00:06:54.360" class="transcript_line"> They sat and they sat as waitresses continued to serve other customers who came in after</div><div id="00:07:00.880" class="transcript_line"> them so Beatrice called for the manager who promptly informed them that people like them</div><div id="00:07:07.040" class="transcript_line"> could not be served there.</div><div id="00:07:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Beatrice protested.</div><div id="00:07:11.120" class="transcript_line"> She and her friends were tired and not leaving until they were served.</div><div id="00:07:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Here we have a mother, a child and a friend, all born in Wales, being made to adopt a standard</div><div id="00:07:26.320" class="transcript_line"> of civilisation they cannot be expected to understand.</div><div id="00:07:31.400" class="transcript_line"> They were politely escorted from the premises by a policeman the manager had contacted outside</div><div id="00:07:37.880" class="transcript_line"> in St Mary Street.</div><div id="00:07:40.720" class="transcript_line"> The policeman explained it was the proprietor&#039;s prerogative if he chose not to serve them.</div><div id="00:07:48.480" class="transcript_line"> So in disgrace and indignation they went without their tea.</div><div id="00:07:53.520" class="transcript_line"> This apparently was the enforcement of the policy that declared that people like Beatrice,</div><div id="00:07:58.920" class="transcript_line"> Katie and poor little Leonard did not belong to the social system we have evolved in these</div><div id="00:08:06.240" class="transcript_line"> islands.</div><div id="00:08:08.320" class="transcript_line"> To maintain its barriers the aforementioned social system forged a nomenclature half-caste</div><div id="00:08:16.440" class="transcript_line"> out of British experience as a dominating empire with its attendant colonial regime.</div><div id="00:08:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Here we have a standard of civilisation that refuses to accept the children it has made.</div><div id="00:08:31.560" class="transcript_line"> The term half-caste is still used today in the media but it is not heard so much in Tiger</div><div id="00:08:37.400" class="transcript_line"> Bay as it was up to the black conscious movement of the 1960s.</div><div id="00:08:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Half-caste was a word I tended to hear more when I left the bay to go to school in Bute</div><div id="00:08:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Terrace.</div><div id="00:08:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Pupils there from other parts of Cardiff more than once said to me, you&#039;re half-caste,</div><div id="00:08:54.760" class="transcript_line"> ain&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:08:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Causually I say, yeah, like after all what is it to you?</div><div id="00:09:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Then with my admission would come, well is your mother white?</div><div id="00:09:03.680" class="transcript_line"> No, I say.</div><div id="00:09:05.420" class="transcript_line"> So your father&#039;s white then?</div><div id="00:09:07.500" class="transcript_line"> No, again was the reply.</div><div id="00:09:10.540" class="transcript_line"> Both my parents are half-caste.</div><div id="00:09:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Naturally, I personally could not feel comfortable with such a designation.</div><div id="00:09:18.500" class="transcript_line"> After all, who is cast into this world?</div><div id="00:09:21.580" class="transcript_line"> I was born, my parents were born, if labels must be placed, why half-caste that reached?</div><div id="00:09:28.820" class="transcript_line"> That rather oddball term derived from a European colonialism and misguiding antiquated racialist</div><div id="00:09:35.220" class="transcript_line"> philosophy about the alleged division of humanity.</div><div id="00:09:39.500" class="transcript_line"> There is no need for the continued usage of such an undignified term as half-caste.</div><div id="00:09:45.140" class="transcript_line"> It should be replaced by the complementary terms of Afro-Celtic, Afro-Saxon, Indio-Cumric.</div><div id="00:09:52.540" class="transcript_line"> These terms better represent our place in the capital city of modern Wales.</div><div id="00:09:58.060" class="transcript_line"> Which is why I began this story by praising the land of my mothers rather than with the</div><div id="00:10:03.020" class="transcript_line"> land of my fathers to traditional opening line of the Welsh National Anthem.</div><div id="00:10:08.700" class="transcript_line"> Evidence exists to indicate this is not the first time we graced these shores.</div><div id="00:10:18.860" class="transcript_line"> Celtic heritage aside, when a person from Tiger Bay fills out an application for a job</div><div id="00:10:24.780" class="transcript_line"> that includes an ethnic breakdown, he or she can, for all intents and purposes, practically</div><div id="00:10:30.980" class="transcript_line"> say yes to every designated group.</div><div id="00:10:33.860" class="transcript_line"> This phenomenon indicates that time is long overdue for those born in Wales and with a</div><div id="00:10:39.900" class="transcript_line"> Welsh matriarchal lineage to be recognised as Celtic and for those with obvious African</div><div id="00:10:45.220" class="transcript_line"> features to be recognised as Afro-Celtic.</div><div id="00:10:48.400" class="transcript_line"> This determination could go without saying for the Indians, Malays, Arabs and all the</div><div id="00:10:53.300" class="transcript_line"> different nationalities that settled old Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:10:56.860" class="transcript_line"> And of course by extension for all ethnically intermixed communities throughout the rest</div><div id="00:11:02.420" class="transcript_line"> of Britain, more assuredly for those of second and third generation.</div><div id="00:11:09.260" class="transcript_line"> An end must be brought once and for all to the lack of acceptance implied in the term</div><div id="00:11:13.620" class="transcript_line"> half-caste.</div><div id="00:11:14.660" class="transcript_line"> We are Welsh.</div><div id="00:11:16.380" class="transcript_line"> Everything that happened to us prior to and throughout this century occurred in Wales.</div><div id="00:11:21.660" class="transcript_line"> We are an indelible and recognisable part of Welsh history.</div><div id="00:11:29.340" class="transcript_line"> With what had been said before, St Mary Street was becoming off limits to people of colour,</div><div id="00:11:34.260" class="transcript_line"> despite its close proximity to target Tiger Bay and the fact that at the time the statue</div><div id="00:11:39.700" class="transcript_line"> of Marquis Bute facing the direction of his beloved Docs, it&#039;s now located in Callaghan</div><div id="00:11:48.220" class="transcript_line"> Street, Callaghan Square.</div><div id="00:11:51.180" class="transcript_line"> Opposite the Italian cafe in St Mary Street, which denied service to people of colour,</div><div id="00:11:56.220" class="transcript_line"> was the Pavilion Cinema, where Black Bow and their white lady friends spent many an evening</div><div id="00:12:02.580" class="transcript_line"> at the pictures.</div><div id="00:12:03.580" class="transcript_line"> However, this story isn&#039;t all one-sided.</div><div id="00:12:06.780" class="transcript_line"> White gents escorted their brown maidens too.</div><div id="00:12:11.900" class="transcript_line"> It must be recalled Mr Blackman, a not so tall white gentleman, came down to Moriah</div><div id="00:12:16.220" class="transcript_line"> Street, smartly dressed, with his raincoat neatly placed over his right arm to call upon</div><div id="00:12:20.820" class="transcript_line"> his dark Venus.</div><div id="00:12:22.500" class="transcript_line"> He stood in front of the door and knocked, and when Lydia Hopkins opened the door, there</div><div id="00:12:26.700" class="transcript_line"> he stood ready to take her to the pavilion.</div><div id="00:12:29.460" class="transcript_line"> We can&#039;t go there, she said.</div><div id="00:12:30.940" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not letting black folks in any more.</div><div id="00:12:35.500" class="transcript_line"> Auntie Annie Gordon couldn&#039;t go there with her black bloat either, which what was there</div><div id="00:12:42.420" class="transcript_line"> to do?</div><div id="00:12:43.720" class="transcript_line"> It was then, during the 1930s, that everyone down the bay began to go to the Central Cinema</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> on the Hayes, starting a tradition that was to continue until the 50s.</div><div id="00:12:58.520" class="transcript_line"> The Pavilion Cinema, which once banned interracial couples in the 1930s, in the 1950s, was now</div><div id="00:13:08.720" class="transcript_line"> to be shook, rattled and rolled by the black American music of Joe Turner, who appeared</div><div id="00:13:15.520" class="transcript_line"> in the movie Rock Around the Clock, singing the original version of Shake, Rattle and</div><div id="00:13:20.160" class="transcript_line"> Roll, a song which was sung subsequently by Bill Haley and the Comets and various other</div><div id="00:13:27.040" class="transcript_line"> white American and British artists.</div><div id="00:13:30.280" class="transcript_line"> The invasion of rhythm and blues and rock and roll were taking place as Cardiff Planets</div><div id="00:13:36.240" class="transcript_line"> were planning the destruction and uprooting of Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:13:39.800" class="transcript_line"> As I&#039;ve said, that was an extract from a book I recommend, The Tiger Bay Story by Neil Sinclair.</div><div id="00:13:49.720" class="transcript_line"> So the Colour Bar, as we know, as everybody knows, existed.</div><div id="00:13:55.480" class="transcript_line"> I say everybody, I mean everybody who&#039;s black, mixed-raced or of a generation, let&#039;s say.</div><div id="00:14:03.720" class="transcript_line"> May not be in the minds of an 18 or 30 year old, but it&#039;s certainly in the minds of those</div><div id="00:14:08.920" class="transcript_line"> who are much older.</div><div id="00:14:10.760" class="transcript_line"> So in the 1930s, the people were good enough to crew the merchant ships, work the docks,</div><div id="00:14:23.960" class="transcript_line"> be visited by the people of uptown, white people.</div><div id="00:14:34.120" class="transcript_line"> They could visit the docks, but the docks were not allowed to visit them.</div><div id="00:14:40.120" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s important to understand why people might feel resentment, but it&#039;s important</div><div id="00:14:47.640" class="transcript_line"> to understand too that the Second World War started in the 1930s and it didn&#039;t stop those</div><div id="00:15:00.200" class="transcript_line"> in quotes, half-caste people for joining the ships, joining the army, being a part of that</div><div id="00:15:10.760" class="transcript_line"> war for a country that they were born in and yet would not even allow them a cup of tea</div><div id="00:15:23.320" class="transcript_line"> in its tea bars or restaurants, or allow them to go to some of its cinemas.</div><div id="00:15:34.120" class="transcript_line"> So all I would say here is this is history, this is reality, the experience of people</div><div id="00:15:45.160" class="transcript_line"> from Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:15:46.680" class="transcript_line"> What is important is how they handled that experience, what it meant to them in the long</div><div id="00:15:55.720" class="transcript_line"> run.</div><div id="00:15:57.720" class="transcript_line"> And in the long run, despite attempted repatriation after World War I and after World War II,</div><div id="00:16:05.960" class="transcript_line"> despite not being able to be considered or seen as equal citizens in between the wars,</div><div id="00:16:15.160" class="transcript_line"> despite having their homes destroyed and their community ripped apart in the 60s,</div><div id="00:16:22.280" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re still here.</div><div id="00:16:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Their children are still representing Wales at rugby and football and boxing for Wales and</div><div id="00:16:36.840" class="transcript_line"> competing in athletics for Wales.</div><div id="00:16:40.280" class="transcript_line"> So I guess the comment made by my uncle when I was a child actually has more meaning now.</div><div id="00:16:55.160" class="transcript_line"> And it is we came here, we stayed here, we&#039;re not going anywhere.</div><div id="00:17:05.320" class="transcript_line"> This is our country.</div><div id="00:17:07.480" class="transcript_line"> Now this is merely other than the reading from Neil Sinclair, it&#039;s merely my opinion,</div><div id="00:17:14.840" class="transcript_line"> not HDAs, but I think it&#039;s important to actually understand people.</div><div id="00:17:28.440" class="transcript_line"> You might say quite reasonably that history, and it was terrible that that history</div><div id="00:17:35.800" class="transcript_line"> made people of an older generation feel like that.</div><div id="00:17:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, HDA conducted a piece of research recently, very recently, we&#039;re talking last few months,</div><div id="00:17:51.000" class="transcript_line"> for the Welsh Government.</div><div id="00:17:53.880" class="transcript_line"> And these are a couple of the, a few of the headlines from that research.</div><div id="00:17:57.880" class="transcript_line"> Research.</div><div id="00:18:00.440" class="transcript_line"> People felt discrimination was the most significant factor about being unemployed</div><div id="00:18:05.640" class="transcript_line"> and their treatment when employed.</div><div id="00:18:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Let me say this was targeted towards Butetown and those of mixed race or their white parents.</div><div id="00:18:22.120" class="transcript_line"> Most respondents, whether born in Wales or not, saw themselves as Welsh.</div><div id="00:18:28.840" class="transcript_line"> However, half of them, very nearly 50%, I should
