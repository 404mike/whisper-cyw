didn&#039;t have a stroke.</div><div id="00:42:37.560" class="transcript_line"> So, that must have been quite hard.</div><div id="00:42:40.560" class="transcript_line"> It was hard.</div><div id="00:42:43.560" class="transcript_line"> But I think it was good it happened at that time.</div><div id="00:42:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Because there were many facilities.</div><div id="00:42:49.560" class="transcript_line"> There were many facilities in the hospital.</div><div id="00:42:52.560" class="transcript_line"> If you see people coming and going, they would help.</div><div id="00:42:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But then it&#039;s all gone.</div><div id="00:42:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all gone.</div><div id="00:43:01.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not like there were any facilities.</div><div id="00:43:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Social services.</div><div id="00:43:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Social

class="transcript_line"> So, what did you say at that time?</div><div id="00:43:19.560" class="transcript_line"> When your husband had a stroke,</div><div id="00:43:22.560" class="transcript_line"> was it according to the condition of the local authority?</div><div id="00:43:25.560" class="transcript_line"> It was according to the condition of the local authority.</div><div id="00:43:28.560" class="transcript_line"> That you were getting enough support.</div><div id="00:43:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Now you are a bit elderly.</div><div id="00:43:34.560" class="transcript_line"> So, it&#039;s not a very good situation.</div><div id="00:43:37.560" class="transcript_line"> If there was any support, it&#039;s not that easy.</div><div id="00:43:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Giving
