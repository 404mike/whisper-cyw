    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Marlee, you really told us your memories, early memories of childhood, the colourful memories,</div><div id="00:00:08.000" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;ve taken us through the journey of trauma to actually being where you are in Wales</div><div id="00:00:15.500" class="transcript_line"> and how you came to be in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:17.500" class="transcript_line"> So when you look back at your life now, what does resilience mean for you as a woman?</div><div id="00:00:24.500" class="transcript_line"> I think for me, coming to Wales, it was like coming home, honestly,</div><div id="00:00:29.500" class="transcript_line"> and I mean that, and I&#039;ve never felt so at home as I do in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:34.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve met some amazing friends. I&#039;ve got friends in England as well, who I am in touch with,</div><div id="00:00:40.500" class="transcript_line"> because they were my friends from college days, so I&#039;m still in touch with them.</div><div id="00:00:45.500" class="transcript_line"> One of the nurses I shared accommodation with, Carol Dodgson, and Ruth I shared a house with in Swansea.</div><div id="00:00:55.500" class="transcript_line"> But Wales to me has been home. It has been the best thing I ever did.</div><div id="00:01:03.500" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a cosiness about Wales that I think you don&#039;t find in England, and the people are friendly,</div><div id="00:01:10.500" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s very much like people looking after their own family. I see a lot of that in Wales,</div><div id="00:01:16.500" class="transcript_line"> more so than I&#039;ve seen in communities in England even, but I don&#039;t know whether that&#039;s just my biasness,</div><div id="00:01:24.500" class="transcript_line"> but I think it&#039;s just meant everything, and I work at the university now, and to me that&#039;s like a community in itself,</div><div id="00:01:33.500" class="transcript_line"> and most people in the university, you know, we all look out for each other.</div><div id="00:01:38.500" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of kindness, people will help each other out, so I&#039;ve helped people out and took on their lecturing,</div><div id="00:01:46.500" class="transcript_line"> if, for example, I&#039;ve been needed to lecture and somebody&#039;s fallen ill or whatever,</div><div id="00:01:52.500" class="transcript_line"> and I find I just love learning as well, and I&#039;ve worked in research, and with research you just never stop learning,</div><div id="00:02:01.500" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve always had this passion about education, and that comes from mum and dad both saying,</div><div id="00:02:07.500" class="transcript_line"> dad&#039;s saying girls have to be educated as well as boys, and mum always said, mum never had a chance for an education,</div><div id="00:02:14.500" class="transcript_line"> she always wanted to do that, but of course as a teenager she had to stop to get married,</div><div id="00:02:19.500" class="transcript_line"> but she learned to read and write Gujarati, which was a total blessing, because without that she would have been lost,</div><div id="00:02:27.500" class="transcript_line"> so she found solace in prayers and the Bhagavad Gita and the faith books, and I just never really stopped learning,</div><div id="00:02:38.500" class="transcript_line"> so I studied a bit of Egyptology, I went to Spanish class, I learned a bit of Spanish,</div><div id="00:02:46.500" class="transcript_line"> my Hindi is not perfect but I can manage, I understand everything, but my expression, my Hindu friends would say to me,</div><div id="00:02:55.500" class="transcript_line"> oh your Hindi is very sweet, which means it&#039;s a bit sort of broken probably, but I&#039;ve got Punjabi friends,</div><div id="00:03:06.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got Hindi friends, I&#039;ve got all sorts of friends, English friends, Welsh friends, and Wales to me is just magnificent in its beauty and the beaches,</div><div id="00:03:19.500" class="transcript_line"> I found my solace through all this trauma in the fact that nature, you know, the sea is literally ten minutes away from here,</div><div id="00:03:32.500" class="transcript_line"> and I find the sea has all the answers, walks, woodlands, so many walks around here, Klein Gardens, the Gowers not far,</div><div id="00:03:43.500" class="transcript_line"> I just find it such a stunning beautiful area, North Wales as well, but I don&#039;t know North Wales as well as I do South Wales,</div><div id="00:03:52.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve tried to do everything that I was told I shouldn&#039;t do, like I&#039;ve always been frightened of water,</div><div id="00:04:00.500" class="transcript_line"> so I overcame that fear and I trained as a scuba diver, and I also lectured and taught sports diving because I&#039;ve always been quite defiant as well,</div><div id="00:04:12.500" class="transcript_line"> well why can&#039;t I do it, if I&#039;m a girl why can&#039;t I do this, why can&#039;t I do that, you know I&#039;ve been to Antarctica on a holiday,</div><div id="00:04:23.500" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve tried to do extreme types holidays, I&#039;ve cycled a lot of the Gower, and I&#039;ve pushed myself physically,</div><div id="00:04:31.500" class="transcript_line"> and I think that&#039;s the way I&#039;ve overcome things, trauma by actually working my body physically, pushing myself,</div><div id="00:04:39.500" class="transcript_line"> and overall I have a lot of empathy for people who&#039;ve suffered, I also have sensitivity, but I also need time for calmness and peace,</div><div id="00:04:50.500" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t be with people all the time, because I find I can take on other people&#039;s feelings, but I recognise that as a child carer literally,</div><div id="00:05:01.500" class="transcript_line"> so I know I&#039;m quite sensitive like that, and I do really feel for people who&#039;ve been widowed in Asian Indian communities,</div><div id="00:05:12.500" class="transcript_line"> because I know what that means, and it&#039;s sad to say that I also accept that there&#039;s assaults and abuses as a common place,</div><div id="00:05:23.500" class="transcript_line"> which is also sad to say, but I just found my home here, and also I&#039;ve done things like mindfulness, I&#039;ve done aromatherapy,</div><div id="00:05:32.500" class="transcript_line"> I think without even knowing it, and I&#039;ve journaled, written a lot, I&#039;ve done creative art, but I think without knowing what I was actually really doing,</div><div id="00:05:42.500" class="transcript_line"> I sort of somehow have found solace in all these things, and I think in a way without even analysing it,</div><div id="00:05:50.500" class="transcript_line"> I was just always busy, busy running, or busy cycling, or busy doing this, and I think training, because when you&#039;re underwater,</div><div id="00:06:00.500" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re scuba diving, you can&#039;t think of other things, you&#039;ve literally got to concentrate on what you&#039;re doing, because it could make a big difference,</div><div id="00:06:08.500" class="transcript_line"> so there&#039;s no wondering, because in normal everyday life your mind can wander back to that,</div><div id="00:06:17.500" class="transcript_line"> and to me it&#039;s not about the story, I think the story is more important than me, that&#039;s what I think, and I think it&#039;s a case of what can I do with the story,</div><div id="00:06:26.500" class="transcript_line"> and I think you can do a lot with it, because I think you can understand, because women in India for example can&#039;t talk about trauma,</div><div id="00:06:37.500" class="transcript_line"> divorce is a big no, no, and it&#039;s always a woman&#039;s fault, with any divorce, it&#039;s never the man&#039;s fault,</div><div id="00:06:43.500" class="transcript_line"> a woman should always try to make things work, and I think I can bring understanding, because women are just being assaulted, abused,</div><div id="00:06:52.500" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re just so petrified of a divorce, and even a son whose mother gets divorced, even the son could turn against the mother and say,</div><div id="00:07:04.500" class="transcript_line"> you know, you got divorced and it&#039;s your fault, so I just feel bringing a voice is so much to people who don&#039;t have a voice, who can&#039;t speak,</div><div id="00:07:16.500" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s lots of women in India who will put up with beatings, regularly domestic violence, because they&#039;re not able to speak, they&#039;re not allowed to speak,</div><div id="00:07:25.500" class="transcript_line"> so I think giving voice is what I would bring with this story, and it&#039;s not really about me as such, I&#039;m just the vehicle, the vessel if you like,</div><div id="00:07:35.500" class="transcript_line"> and I think for me resilience is all about, in part, defiance as well, why shouldn&#039;t we, why shouldn&#039;t we do all these things, why shouldn&#039;t we scuba dive,</div><div id="00:07:46.500" class="transcript_line"> why shouldn&#039;t we do this, why do we have to have defined roles as a woman, and yes, I still like my cooking and I still enjoy all those sorts of things,</div><div id="00:07:58.500" class="transcript_line"> but I think to be who you are and to reach your fullest potential, I think you also have to let go of who you were and what you were,</div><div id="00:08:08.500" class="transcript_line"> and that doesn&#039;t define me anymore, I&#039;m not defined by what happened to me, it&#039;s just part of the story, but it&#039;s made me a person who I wouldn&#039;t have been had I have had a nicey-nicey upbringing with my father alive,</div><div id="00:08:24.500" class="transcript_line"> I would never have believed anybody who would tell me these sorts of things that I&#039;ve just said, I would never have believed it, so I think that is the gift, I think it&#039;s the voice,</div><div id="00:08:35.500" class="transcript_line"> and voice for other people, not just for me, that&#039;s what I would like to bring.</div><div id="00:08:40.500" class="transcript_line"> So what I would say, the last thing I would say to my mother, if I could say it to her, I would be, it would be that we are both alright, you both, you wanted both of us to have an education,</div><div id="00:08:56.500" class="transcript_line"> stand on our two feet, she always used to say stand on your two feet, and here we are, we are standing, and it&#039;s a credit to her, and considering what we went through, we&#039;ve both done well academically and in other ways, we&#039;ve come to be our own fullest people.</div><div id="00:09:19.500" class="transcript_line"> And what would you say to all the male members who turned away from you at a time that your mother needed them the most?</div><div id="00:09:29.500" class="transcript_line"> I would say that I think forgiveness is very hard, but I would hope that they would reflect, and I&#039;m no longer driven by vengeance and hatred as I was in my younger years and my teenage years,</div><div id="00:09:51.500" class="transcript_line"> and I would just say try and find compassion in your heart somewhere, there must be some somewhere, that&#039;s all I can say.</div></div></p>
