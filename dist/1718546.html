    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And okay, things were changing all the time.</div><div id="00:00:03.600" class="transcript_line"> It was quite busy where we were up</div><div id="00:00:05.520" class="transcript_line"> because where the Forest College house is now</div><div id="00:00:09.560" class="transcript_line"> and things like that,</div><div id="00:00:10.400" class="transcript_line"> that was the hub of what Quinceana Forest was doing.</div><div id="00:00:13.920" class="transcript_line"> It was all the machinery, they had lorries,</div><div id="00:00:18.080" class="transcript_line"> they had vans and things like that.</div><div id="00:00:20.240" class="transcript_line"> They had a little field where the house next door</div><div id="00:00:24.520" class="transcript_line"> is built on now.</div><div id="00:00:25.880" class="transcript_line"> At the very top of that,</div><div id="00:00:26.720" class="transcript_line"> you can see like an old garage shed there at the top.</div><div id="00:00:30.680" class="transcript_line"> That used to be the garage for the Forest Commission&#039;s lorry</div><div id="00:00:34.080" class="transcript_line"> that they used to carry people</div><div id="00:00:35.400" class="transcript_line"> and the materials around all over the place.</div><div id="00:00:39.880" class="transcript_line"> And then down below that, there was a petrol pump.</div><div id="00:00:44.680" class="transcript_line"> There was various sheds and things like that</div><div id="00:00:47.120" class="transcript_line"> where they kept all the materials and things.</div><div id="00:00:49.960" class="transcript_line"> And eventually they built,</div><div id="00:00:51.200" class="transcript_line"> in addition to the office that was next to the house,</div><div id="00:00:53.880" class="transcript_line"> they built an office in the field</div><div id="00:00:56.120" class="transcript_line"> where the Chalet house is now.</div><div id="00:00:59.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a decent sized office there</div><div id="00:01:01.880" class="transcript_line"> and there was a secretary, I think,</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> who worked in there as well.</div><div id="00:01:10.400" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where it was run from.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And below the house,</div><div id="00:01:14.400" class="transcript_line"> further down the road towards the Wayland Cottages</div><div id="00:01:17.440" class="transcript_line"> and things like that, there was a field down there.</div><div id="00:01:19.080" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t notice it now because it&#039;s all wood.</div><div id="00:01:21.600" class="transcript_line"> But there was a field there, which was the nursery.</div><div id="00:01:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And there was some sheds down there</div><div id="00:01:26.280" class="transcript_line"> and they had at one stage, initially they didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:30.560" class="transcript_line"> because they bought seedlings in,</div><div id="00:01:32.680" class="transcript_line"> but they actually, after a while,</div><div id="00:01:34.240" class="transcript_line"> they grew seed beds there.</div><div id="00:01:35.600" class="transcript_line"> They were like big raised beds,</div><div id="00:01:37.240" class="transcript_line"> great big long raised beds as long as a cricket pitch.</div><div id="00:01:40.840" class="transcript_line"> And they grew the trees</div><div id="00:01:45.280" class="transcript_line"> that they were gonna plant from seed there.</div><div id="00:01:48.040" class="transcript_line"> So they grew them in the seed bed</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> and then the rest of the field all the way down</div><div id="00:01:52.200" class="transcript_line"> was rotivated and made into sections.</div><div id="00:01:55.280" class="transcript_line"> And they planted out each of the seedlings</div><div id="00:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> into the nursery area before,</div><div id="00:02:01.040" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d been living there for a couple of years</div><div id="00:02:02.600" class="transcript_line"> to get big enough to be able to be planted on the hills.</div><div id="00:02:06.200" class="transcript_line"> But the interesting thing was they got,</div><div id="00:02:09.360" class="transcript_line"> it was real, I suppose, post-war</div><div id="00:02:15.040" class="transcript_line"> where a lot of people had come out of the army,</div><div id="00:02:17.320" class="transcript_line"> a lot of military guys</div><div id="00:02:18.800" class="transcript_line"> who got very good procedures for doing things.</div><div id="00:02:21.320" class="transcript_line"> There was a procedure for doing everything,</div><div id="00:02:22.760" class="transcript_line"> but it was in the grocery commission.</div><div id="00:02:25.600" class="transcript_line"> They got these designs of A-frames,</div><div id="00:02:27.920" class="transcript_line"> and little frames with a bar across the top</div><div id="00:02:30.960" class="transcript_line"> and an A-frame coming down.</div><div id="00:02:32.680" class="transcript_line"> And what they&#039;d do is they&#039;d collect the seeds</div><div id="00:02:34.480" class="transcript_line"> from where they grew the seeds in the beds.</div><div id="00:02:40.480" class="transcript_line"> And then they&#039;d split them out</div><div id="00:02:42.280" class="transcript_line"> and they had a special frame</div><div id="00:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> with a V-shape cut in it like that.</div><div id="00:02:47.720" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d drop a little seedling in each one of those Vs.</div><div id="00:02:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And there was a clamp mechanism that clamped that shut</div><div id="00:02:53.240" class="transcript_line"> and they could hold a whole row of plants up in Longo.</div><div id="00:02:57.200" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d get away of actually cutting,</div><div id="00:03:00.720" class="transcript_line"> again, everything was measured carefully.</div><div id="00:03:02.760" class="transcript_line"> So all the plants were exactly the same distance apart.</div><div id="00:03:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And then there was a mechanism on the board as well</div><div id="00:03:08.440" class="transcript_line"> that when they put it down onto the soil,</div><div id="00:03:11.120" class="transcript_line"> that it was the right distance away from the plant,</div><div id="00:03:13.120" class="transcript_line"> the other side.</div><div id="00:03:14.200" class="transcript_line"> And very quickly, they could just push all the soil together</div><div id="00:03:17.200" class="transcript_line"> on that, lift the frame out,</div><div id="00:03:18.400" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d got a big row,</div><div id="00:03:19.560" class="transcript_line"> a full row of seedlings planted</div><div id="00:03:21.600" class="transcript_line"> without hardly damaging or touching.</div><div id="00:03:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Then immediately they&#039;d put it back on,</div><div id="00:03:24.920" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d do the same thing</div><div id="00:03:25.960" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d work their way down the field</div><div id="00:03:28.400" class="transcript_line"> and fill the whole field up with plants</div><div id="00:03:32.360" class="transcript_line"> leaving there for a couple of years</div><div id="00:03:33.520" class="transcript_line"> to be ready to be put out.</div><div id="00:03:36.480" class="transcript_line"> And the thing I think that you can lose sight of sometimes</div><div id="00:03:40.320" class="transcript_line"> is that when you look in the forest,</div><div id="00:03:42.360" class="transcript_line"> all the way over those hills,</div><div id="00:03:43.640" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t realize that every one of those trees</div><div id="00:03:45.720" class="transcript_line"> was planted by a man with a mattock,</div><div id="00:03:48.280" class="transcript_line"> dug a hole, pulled a chunk of soil forward or clod forward,</div><div id="00:03:52.800" class="transcript_line"> put the plant into it,</div><div id="00:03:54.200" class="transcript_line"> clod it his way through under the next one.</div><div id="00:03:56.120" class="transcript_line"> And when you look through it,</div><div id="00:03:57.360" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s hard to believe the amount of effort that they took.</div><div id="00:04:01.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay, and some of the hill tops up behind the whennest hill</div><div id="00:04:04.480" class="transcript_line"> up behind you there,</div><div id="00:04:07.600" class="transcript_line"> it was wet on the top there.</div><div id="00:04:08.880" class="transcript_line"> And what they did there was they&#039;d actually use a big plow</div><div id="00:04:12.320" class="transcript_line"> on a caterpillar and they&#039;d make a long turf</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> when they throw the soil over</div><div id="00:04:16.640" class="transcript_line"> and they plant the trees on that.</div><div id="00:04:20.120" class="transcript_line"> That was quite interesting.</div><div id="00:04:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go out from,</div><div id="00:04:23.640" class="transcript_line"> when for example, when they were plowing on the top,</div><div id="00:04:25.560" class="transcript_line"> we used to have a ride on the caterpillar with,</div><div id="00:04:27.640" class="transcript_line"> I think it was Reg Hope from his to live in St. Harman,</div><div id="00:04:31.800" class="transcript_line"> he used to drive it.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I know that was a beast in itself.</div><div id="00:04:36.800" class="transcript_line"> The caterpillar was, I think some had been regenerated</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> from some ex-army engine or something like that.</div><div id="00:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> It was called a Fowler.</div><div id="00:04:46.240" class="transcript_line"> And to start it, there was no batteries or anything like that.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It had a little donkey engine,</div><div id="00:04:51.960" class="transcript_line"> that you&#039;d put a cartridge in and you locked it up</div><div id="00:04:54.640" class="transcript_line"> and then you struck the cartridge</div><div id="00:04:56.080" class="transcript_line"> and then you shot a charge into it.</div><div id="00:04:59.200" class="transcript_line"> That threw the engine over</div><div id="00:05:00.200" class="transcript_line"> and hopefully would start the engine.</div><div id="00:05:02.160" class="transcript_line"> It was a remarkable machine.</div><div id="00:05:04.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if there are any of those around now,</div><div id="00:05:07.200" class="transcript_line"> but we used to mess around with those.</div><div id="00:05:08.960" class="transcript_line"> And when we were young, for example,</div><div id="00:05:10.680" class="transcript_line"> when they, before they planted the trees</div><div id="00:05:13.520" class="transcript_line"> in front on the bottom of the slope coming down there,</div><div id="00:05:19.200" class="transcript_line"> they removed a lot of the oak trees that were there.</div><div id="00:05:24.040" class="transcript_line"> And the forest commission guys were split the logs,</div><div id="00:05:26.800" class="transcript_line"> they cut them into logs,</div><div id="00:05:27.640" class="transcript_line"> split the logs into with big wedges and sledgehammers</div><div id="00:05:33.520" class="transcript_line"> to make the posts that they&#039;d need to go all the way</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> around the perimeter of all the fences</div><div id="00:05:37.560" class="transcript_line"> that the forest commission was putting up around the land</div><div id="00:05:40.240" class="transcript_line"> that they&#039;d either acquired by compulsory purchase</div><div id="00:05:43.080" class="transcript_line"> or normal purchase.</div><div id="00:05:45.640" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it was some, you know,</div><div id="00:05:47.880" class="transcript_line"> quite often we&#039;d be out there.</div><div id="00:05:49.480" class="transcript_line"> At the time as well,</div><div id="00:05:50.480" class="transcript_line"> the forest commission were building roads everywhere.</div><div id="00:05:52.840" class="transcript_line"> All those roads they put in that you see around,</div><div id="00:05:56.200" class="transcript_line"> most of the original ones are those,</div><div id="00:05:58.320" class="transcript_line"> not the ones that the extractors,</div><div id="00:06:00.040" class="transcript_line"> the people taking timber out were doing.</div><div id="00:06:01.960" class="transcript_line"> They just ripped through the soil and made a right mess.</div><div id="00:06:04.920" class="transcript_line"> But they put those roads in</div><div id="00:06:06.720" class="transcript_line"> before they put a lot of the trees in.</div><div id="00:06:08.280" class="transcript_line"> So they were prepared, everything was prepared.</div><div id="00:06:10.720" class="transcript_line"> They needed to have the road infrastructure in there.</div><div id="00:06:13.160" class="transcript_line"> They needed to have,</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I assume they had to make sure they got the plans.</div><div id="00:06:17.120" class="transcript_line"> And so there were teams of people kind of building the roads</div><div id="00:06:20.840" class="transcript_line"> going with graders and caterpillars and things.</div><div id="00:06:23.040" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;ve quite a lot of work there.</div><div id="00:06:24.880" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d be blasting through the rocks</div><div id="00:06:26.520" class="transcript_line"> as they were going in front of our house.</div><div id="00:06:28.240" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d be blowing the whistle</div><div id="00:06:30.120" class="transcript_line"> to tell people to be aware they were just about to blast.</div><div id="00:06:33.520" class="transcript_line"> And there were occasions when stones were falling</div><div id="00:06:35.440" class="transcript_line"> in the fields just across the road from us,</div><div id="00:06:37.040" class="transcript_line"> from the top of the hill down.</div><div id="00:06:39.360" class="transcript_line"> It was quite an operation.</div><div id="00:06:42.920" class="transcript_line"> As well as that, there was a lot of work for people</div><div id="00:06:47.280" class="transcript_line"> during that time.</div><div id="00:06:48.120" class="transcript_line"> It seems, I don&#039;t know where they came from, all of them.</div><div id="00:06:50.280" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t all immediately from the Abbey.</div><div id="00:06:52.560" class="transcript_line"> They were from where they had a planter door</div><div id="00:06:54.520" class="transcript_line"> and places like that and places around.</div><div id="00:06:56.320" class="transcript_line"> But in addition to planting the trees,</div><div id="00:06:59.200" class="transcript_line"> obviously you had to prepare the land.</div><div id="00:07:00.760" class="transcript_line"> They were planted in, I think,</div><div id="00:07:04.680" class="transcript_line"> what do they call them, compartments.</div><div id="00:07:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I think the trees were planted in a ridge</div><div id="00:07:08.320" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d leave a ride or a fire break between them.</div><div id="00:07:11.760" class="transcript_line"> And the fire break, somebody would have to plow</div><div id="00:07:13.960" class="transcript_line"> the fire break or make that such that it wasn&#039;t good</div><div id="00:07:19.040" class="transcript_line"> for a fire to leap across and things.</div><div id="00:07:21.760" class="transcript_line"> So there was a lot of work going on.</div><div id="00:07:24.280" class="transcript_line"> And then they had to weed the trees.</div><div id="00:07:25.560" class="transcript_line"> When they planted them, when they were very small,</div><div id="00:07:27.840" class="transcript_line"> there were teams of people who&#039;d be going around</div><div id="00:07:29.360" class="transcript_line"> spending weeks and weeks and weeks</div><div id="00:07:31.040" class="transcript_line"> kind of weeding sections and things like that</div><div id="00:07:33.280" class="transcript_line"> on the trees that were young.</div><div id="00:07:34.880" class="transcript_line"> And once they got up a certain height as well,</div><div id="00:07:37.080" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;d be teams going out to brush them</div><div id="00:07:38.640" class="transcript_line"> where you&#039;d cut the lower branches off</div><div id="00:07:41.160" class="transcript_line"> before you get to the point when it started,</div><div id="00:07:43.280" class="transcript_line"> when they started getting bigger,</div><div id="00:07:44.480" class="transcript_line"> before they get to the stage where they were,</div><div id="00:07:46.880" class="transcript_line"> I suppose, 15, 20 years old,</div><div id="00:07:48.400" class="transcript_line"> where they were starting to take the first thinning.</div><div id="00:07:50.880" class="transcript_line"> So there was a lot of effort there.</div><div id="00:07:52.280" class="transcript_line"> There must have been 40 plus people</div><div id="00:07:54.240" class="transcript_line"> working for the forestry at that time.</div></div></p>
