    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the first memory I have really is of watching the coronation.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember very much before that, but I do remember watching the coronation.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d been looking forward to it for a long time.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> As you say, it was a period of austerity and it seemed a bit exciting.</div><div id="00:00:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a glimpse of a world that was probably alien to lots of people in an area like this.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And to see the aristocracy in all their glory, although we didn&#039;t see the colour then, it was all black and white,</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but we could get a good idea of the pomp and the circumstance that surrounded it.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we became conscious of the fact that we were a nation probably different from other nations.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Not many nations had coronations, but we had one.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were proud of that fact and we were interested.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we were invited to watch, we all went and sat and had a lovely tea party afterwards.</div><div id="00:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we thought, well, perhaps it might be a good idea to either save up and buy one or to rent one and see how we would go.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And here in this house we debated and we finally decided to venture to rent one.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a bit of a fast-in-combotion putting in aerials and one thing, and my father was fascinated</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was sort of an interest in him. So we had one and then eventually we bought one.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So that by the time we came to the royal wedding, we were well and truly in the swim, as it were,</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and we could invite people to come here and watch it. Because by now we had a coloured one and that was important.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> First of all, we&#039;d had a black and white one. But by the time we got to the royal wedding, we&#039;d advanced.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d gone off to colour and that made a difference, a vast difference.</div></div></p>
