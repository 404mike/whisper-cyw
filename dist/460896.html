I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was always a kind of old Labour Party, certainly since the debates with George and so on.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And the whole discussion about what you do about trying to realise some aspirations that aren&#039;t shared in other parts of the United Kingdom.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that becomes something quite special.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember those debates, really, in the 1970s.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a very different kind of campaign.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And also, by the way, it was one that I was very much at arm&#039;s length from, just because of personal circumstances.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I think if I&#039;d have been living here, I&#039;d be much more involved in it than I was.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t very important to me, really.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But I do remember it, and I do remember making some speeches in favour of devolution.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I still harboured suspicions about the British state and about the strange reaction to the bombers during the investiture campaign.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And the worries that there was going to be another Northern Ireland and all of this stuff.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve never really resolved that in my own mind.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure if the British state, such as it is, are knowing it a bit better than I did then.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure that there is such a thing as the British state.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But that established government was particularly worried about what was going on in Wales during the investiture.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And worried about it enough to think, well, we&#039;d better give them something during the debate on devolution in the 70s.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess my argument is a pretty crude one, really, which is you can never out-nationalists.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it doesn&#039;t matter what interim measure you give them, they&#039;ll always want independence.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s as simple as that. And I think it&#039;s a very honest position, actually.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never really been able to get beneath the logic of what the Scottish nationalists had done.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And my old buddy David Ellis Thomas has tried time and again to explain to me what his position is on this.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m not sure if I understand it.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I love him dearly, though I do.</div></div></p>
