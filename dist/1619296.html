    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, I was now president now and we had a bill that came.</div><div id="00:00:05.640" class="transcript_line"> There were two things.</div><div id="00:00:06.640" class="transcript_line"> A, we had increasing maintenance costs.</div><div id="00:00:09.280" class="transcript_line"> This is a brand of throat.</div><div id="00:00:10.280" class="transcript_line"> A brand of throat, yeah.</div><div id="00:00:11.960" class="transcript_line"> And also the whole place needed rewiring and other things doing.</div><div id="00:00:17.580" class="transcript_line"> And it was costed out at quite a few hundred pounds.</div><div id="00:00:21.240" class="transcript_line"> We had the 400,000 which we could have paid for but the 400,000 was giving us interest,</div><div id="00:00:26.880" class="transcript_line"> etc.</div><div id="00:00:27.880" class="transcript_line"> So then we had a guy came, I can&#039;t remember his name now, with an offer that he would</div><div id="00:00:34.760" class="transcript_line"> build us a new synagogue if he could buy the property.</div><div id="00:00:39.600" class="transcript_line"> And I did a deal with him that it would be a straight swap.</div><div id="00:00:44.480" class="transcript_line"> You get permission to build a synagogue.</div><div id="00:00:47.720" class="transcript_line"> You get permission to knock this synagogue down.</div><div id="00:00:51.600" class="transcript_line"> And you build us a synagogue so that when you knock down this one, or going to knock</div><div id="00:00:58.480" class="transcript_line"> it down, the following week we can move into the other one.</div><div id="00:01:02.160" class="transcript_line"> So there was no stop in services.</div><div id="00:01:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Continuity.</div><div id="00:01:05.520" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the word, yeah.</div><div id="00:01:07.280" class="transcript_line"> And here the builder agreed to this but of course the members of the community, significant</div><div id="00:01:13.880" class="transcript_line"> now, quite a number, objected.</div><div id="00:01:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Now by then the community in Pennyland was decreasing.</div><div id="00:01:21.260" class="transcript_line"> If you knew it, it had a magnificent, the Sherman Hall was wonderful.</div><div id="00:01:23.980" class="transcript_line"> It was one of the best halls I&#039;ve ever been to, attached to a synagogue.</div><div id="00:01:28.660" class="transcript_line"> That would take, you could have a function for about 200 people with ease in the Sherman</div><div id="00:01:35.080" class="transcript_line"> Hall.</div><div id="00:01:36.080" class="transcript_line"> But the synagogue, which would take about 500 people I suppose, maybe more, they&#039;re</div><div id="00:01:42.900" class="transcript_line"> getting about 20 people on a Saturday and about 20, maybe 30 in total.</div><div id="00:01:50.180" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, it was just about running.</div><div id="00:01:52.980" class="transcript_line"> So I decided in my wisdom that if they could get a purpose-built, smaller synagogue for</div><div id="00:02:03.220" class="transcript_line"> the community as the size is run, you see now we&#039;ve become too big for the community</div><div id="00:02:07.940" class="transcript_line"> now, we wouldn&#039;t have the upkeep.</div><div id="00:02:09.940" class="transcript_line"> It would be under guarantee.</div><div id="00:02:11.820" class="transcript_line"> And also the other thing is, in order to get a rabbi to come to Cardiff, you have to have</div><div id="00:02:16.980" class="transcript_line"> a ritual bath called a mikvah.</div><div id="00:02:19.780" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, we can build a mikvah in the shul.</div><div id="00:02:23.920" class="transcript_line"> We built one in the shul for one Pennyland for the rabbi.</div><div id="00:02:27.140" class="transcript_line"> I thought, well, this time we could do it from scratch and have it integrated beautifully.</div><div id="00:02:32.300" class="transcript_line"> So I did the deal with the builder and took it to there that he should knock one down,</div><div id="00:02:38.020" class="transcript_line"> build the other one, build a mikvah, also organize that we could sell kosher food there</div><div id="00:02:43.180" class="transcript_line"> because now all the kosher shops in Cardiff had closed and we made an organization for</div><div id="00:02:49.100" class="transcript_line"> Also, we wanted a room before burial, you know, bodies where the bodies are kept and</div><div id="00:02:54.740" class="transcript_line"> prepared for burial.</div><div id="00:02:56.380" class="transcript_line"> That could all be on one site.</div><div id="00:02:59.140" class="transcript_line"> And I got that through the council.</div><div id="00:03:01.280" class="transcript_line"> So the next thing was to get an architect to do it, which I did.</div><div id="00:03:05.540" class="transcript_line"> A fellow gave me a book as a present from him, which he&#039;d written.</div><div id="00:03:10.660" class="transcript_line"> But he was a shul architect.</div><div id="00:03:13.900" class="transcript_line"> He designed and that synagogue they got now won a prize, you know, when it was built as</div><div id="00:03:19.140" class="transcript_line"> the best religious building built in 2002 or something like that.</div><div id="00:03:23.660" class="transcript_line"> And he arranged it that there should be, if you go there, no windows.</div><div id="00:03:27.740" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s just, have you been in there?</div><div id="00:03:29.620" class="transcript_line"> You probably didn&#039;t notice, but there are no windows.</div><div id="00:03:31.300" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s an atrium in the middle.</div><div id="00:03:33.580" class="transcript_line"> But those along the side, they are from the old synagogue, the windows, they&#039;re in a case</div><div id="00:03:40.140" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re lit.</div><div id="00:03:41.140" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s lamps behind them.</div><div id="00:03:43.100" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;re lit up.</div><div id="00:03:44.260" class="transcript_line"> But of course, one of the main people&#039;s objections to building the new synagogue is what about</div><div id="00:03:50.700" class="transcript_line"> our stained glass windows?</div><div id="00:03:52.340" class="transcript_line"> And I said, but what about the community?</div><div id="00:03:56.480" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t have a community with stained glass windows.</div><div id="00:03:59.620" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to have a decent synagogue where you could go and pray and not feel that you&#039;re</div><div id="00:04:04.860" class="transcript_line"> in a mausoleum, which is so big.</div><div id="00:04:07.300" class="transcript_line"> See, and when that&#039;s so, I used to go, I came up to London, had meetings with the architect.</div><div id="00:04:12.980" class="transcript_line"> And we had arranged meetings with the builder and the architect down here.</div><div id="00:04:18.260" class="transcript_line"> And I had to do all that on my own because everyone else was either not keen or too busy.</div><div id="00:04:26.140" class="transcript_line"> But even then, having done the deal, people then said, he&#039;s making too much money because</div><div id="00:04:33.220" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s having property.</div><div id="00:04:35.340" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s going to set build houses.</div><div id="00:04:37.260" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s going to build houses that cost so many hundreds of thousands.</div><div id="00:04:41.140" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s going to make hundreds of thousands of pounds.</div><div id="00:04:44.540" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;re just going to have a little synagogue.</div><div id="00:04:47.740" class="transcript_line"> And I got it through on a casting vote.</div><div id="00:04:50.620" class="transcript_line"> And now, of course, they all say, it&#039;s wonderful.</div><div id="00:04:53.340" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:54.340" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how, but there we are.</div><div id="00:04:57.260" class="transcript_line"> Now you know the story of the synagogue.</div></div></p>
