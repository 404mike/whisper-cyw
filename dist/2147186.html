    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So first things first, can you tell me what are your names, you already have said, where</div><div id="00:00:06.400" class="transcript_line"> you were born but then where your parents were also then born? And if you start there,</div><div id="00:00:11.960" class="transcript_line"> so your names, where you were born and then actually where were your parents born?</div><div id="00:00:17.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;re sisters. My name&#039;s Naheed Ashraf. I&#039;m Asra Syed. We were both born in a hospital</div><div id="00:00:26.240" class="transcript_line"> called Lydia Bainan by the Celtic manner, which doesn&#039;t exist anymore. So born in a</div><div id="00:00:33.240" class="transcript_line"> court. Our parents were from the original India, which then partitioned in 1947. And</div><div id="00:00:44.040" class="transcript_line"> we are from Pakistan, so there was a lot of movement around where mum and dad were actually</div><div id="00:00:51.240" class="transcript_line"> Dad was originally from a place called Jumshir and then moved to Bihari and then mum was</div><div id="00:00:58.040" class="transcript_line"> from a place called Jherawala near Feslabad in Pakistan.</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> What do you know of these areas your parents were born?</div><div id="00:01:08.440" class="transcript_line"> I visited quite a few times and had a look at the land that we used to own and where</div><div id="00:01:18.640" class="transcript_line"> my father used to work on the land. We have a family, our extended family is out there,</div><div id="00:01:25.640" class="transcript_line"> our uncles and cousins and have been out there a number of times on both sides of the family,</div><div id="00:01:31.240" class="transcript_line"> my father&#039;s side and my mother&#039;s side.</div><div id="00:01:33.540" class="transcript_line"> So when people came from India during the, after the partition, most of them, majority,</div><div id="00:01:39.040" class="transcript_line"> 99% settled as landowners. So everyone owned a piece of land and they had to fend for themselves</div><div id="00:01:46.240" class="transcript_line"> from that land and that&#039;s how it worked. So mum and dad weren&#039;t related as such,</div><div id="00:01:51.440" class="transcript_line"> they sort of only through marriage they became related. They weren&#039;t sort of cousins or</div><div id="00:01:55.540" class="transcript_line"> anything like that that you sometimes find. So yeah, my nanny and my nanna and everybody</div><div id="00:02:04.540" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve all sort of brought up. Their mum came from a very, very large family. They</div><div id="00:02:09.640" class="transcript_line"> were nine brothers and sisters and they all came over, they were very lucky actually as</div><div id="00:02:15.640" class="transcript_line"> they came over as a family and that included my dad&#039;s family as well where during the</div><div id="00:02:21.440" class="transcript_line"> partition a lot of people lost a lot of family members due to what happened but they were</div><div id="00:02:29.440" class="transcript_line"> the lucky ones.</div><div id="00:02:30.440" class="transcript_line"> With the partition our mum tells us that a lot of people of the family, the elderly,</div><div id="00:02:37.440" class="transcript_line"> died on the way as they were partitioning into Pakistan and are buried somewhere in</div><div id="00:02:43.440" class="transcript_line"> Pakistan but their graves were never marked so we will never know en route from India</div><div id="00:02:48.240" class="transcript_line"> to Pakistan where our ancestors are buried en route when they were making their way into</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Pakistan which is really sad. But we know that the land that they had in Pakistan they</div><div id="00:03:04.240" class="transcript_line"> grew corn, sugarcane and wheat and then they grew vegetables and the vegetables were used</div><div id="00:03:09.840" class="transcript_line"> then for cooking for food for the family.</div><div id="00:03:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know about the social life back there? What games they played, what activities culturally?</div><div id="00:03:21.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you have any details on that?</div><div id="00:03:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Well I think with dad it was mainly being thrown into work from a very, very young age</div><div id="00:03:30.840" class="transcript_line"> and I think that happened with a lot of the men. Women on the other hand used to make</div><div id="00:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> up their own games. Mum tells us quite often as a little girl when they were very young</div><div id="00:03:41.840" class="transcript_line"> her and her friends would get together and they would make dolls and get them married</div><div id="00:03:46.840" class="transcript_line"> but they would actually carry out the whole wedding ceremony, make rice and make all the</div><div id="00:03:50.840" class="transcript_line"> food and they would actually have a wedding for the two dolls and those sort of things</div><div id="00:03:55.840" class="transcript_line"> or play Ludo. Ludo was a very popular game then so it wasn&#039;t like sort of, there were</div><div id="00:04:00.840" class="transcript_line"> no phones or nothing then or you know Xbox or anything like that so it was you had to</div><div id="00:04:05.840" class="transcript_line"> make up things yourself. So yeah and we found that a lot of the men went to school but a</div><div id="00:04:14.840" class="transcript_line"> lot of the girls didn&#039;t go to school. They went to Islamic classes to learn the Quran</div><div id="00:04:19.840" class="transcript_line"> but they didn&#039;t all get taught in schools which was quite sad not as it is now.</div><div id="00:04:24.840" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s explore that then a little bit. So that&#039;s my next question about schooling.</div><div id="00:04:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what kind of education they had?</div><div id="00:04:33.840" class="transcript_line"> The education system is very different to what we have here. So it was more like if</div><div id="00:04:41.840" class="transcript_line"> you got to a certain level in school, so they had one, two, three, four, five, if you got</div><div id="00:04:45.840" class="transcript_line"> to sort of like the fifth Jama&#039;at, that was amazing, you know, you could go on to do big</div><div id="00:04:51.840" class="transcript_line"> things. So you know as long as you sort of got the basics of everything, that was, you</div><div id="00:04:57.840" class="transcript_line"> know, you were good to go. But it was, you can imagine coming over from another country</div><div id="00:05:02.840" class="transcript_line"> settling somewhere else, teachers had to be found, schools had to be set up, it was a</div><div id="00:05:08.840" class="transcript_line"> big thing.</div><div id="00:05:09.840" class="transcript_line"> They had no belongings because when they came from, when it partitions because there were</div><div id="00:05:16.840" class="transcript_line"> riots between both religions at that time, that they described, my mum describes her</div><div id="00:05:24.840" class="transcript_line"> siblings being thrown into the water with a view of them rescuing them from the water</div><div id="00:05:30.840" class="transcript_line"> to reunite. And then they came with basically what they were wearing, you know, they had</div><div id="00:05:36.840" class="transcript_line"> no belongings. So their main focus was to find land, farm, look after the family and</div><div id="00:05:43.840" class="transcript_line"> find a way to survive, to eat.</div><div id="00:05:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they also, I remember mum and dad telling me that because they had sisters,</div><div id="00:05:52.840" class="transcript_line"> mum had sisters, you know, and because they were girls, they would travel through the</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> night rather than the day so they wouldn&#039;t get kidnapped and raped and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:06:02.840" class="transcript_line"> So they had to travel through the night, sort of like, you know, through the grasslands</div><div id="00:06:06.840" class="transcript_line"> and everything, very, very quietly. And that&#039;s how they came across, otherwise they would</div><div id="00:06:12.840" class="transcript_line"> be captured and, you know, killed and things. And that happened to many, many families.</div><div id="00:06:18.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, let&#039;s bring that back to yourself then. What was life like for you growing up</div><div id="00:06:23.840" class="transcript_line"> here in Newport and your schooling? You talked about your parents, that is not what you&#039;re</div><div id="00:06:30.840" class="transcript_line"> old.</div><div id="00:06:31.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we were the first generation, yeah, first generation Muslims to start schooling.</div><div id="00:06:37.840" class="transcript_line"> So I remember right from the primary age, I think there was only one other person in</div><div id="00:06:42.840" class="transcript_line"> the class that was of any colour. And you were very alien to people and I think teachers</div><div id="00:06:51.840" class="transcript_line"> had quite low expectations of you. Even though you were born in this country, you spoke English,</div><div id="00:06:59.840" class="transcript_line"> many without an accent, you were still seen as somehow inferior. I always felt that it&#039;s</div><div id="00:07:10.840" class="transcript_line"> almost like your colour disqualified you from being British.</div><div id="00:07:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you had to work really hard to get accepted and even then you weren&#039;t really accepted.</div><div id="00:07:22.840" class="transcript_line"> So through school I didn&#039;t really experience any racism as such, but you still get the</div><div id="00:07:30.840" class="transcript_line"> comments, the odd comments and, you know...</div><div id="00:07:33.840" class="transcript_line"> People would say racist slurred and saying, but not you.</div><div id="00:07:36.840" class="transcript_line"> But not you, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;re not like that, because they would be in the gang of friends that you had</div><div id="00:07:41.840" class="transcript_line"> made. But they would still then say it to other people, it&#039;s not like you, that you&#039;re</div><div id="00:07:46.840" class="transcript_line"> different. Well, no, I&#039;m not. I&#039;m the same. They&#039;d question you about your food as well,</div><div id="00:07:51.840" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:07:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely all the time.</div><div id="00:07:53.840" class="transcript_line"> What do you eat and the way you dress? It was a struggle and I think, you know, very</div><div id="00:08:01.840" class="transcript_line"> much like when parents came over, they didn&#039;t have the welcome that was promised. It wasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:08:06.840" class="transcript_line"> the land of milk and honey that was promised to them. And I think that it&#039;s not far</div><div id="00:08:16.840" class="transcript_line"> from that today when you look at education opportunities, when you look at how far people</div><div id="00:08:21.840" class="transcript_line"> have come. It&#039;s almost like you have to be, you have to act white to be able to progress.</div><div id="00:08:29.840" class="transcript_line"> And that was exactly what they had to do to try and integrate into the community. And</div><div id="00:08:36.840" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s been very challenging, I would say.</div><div id="00:08:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s been challenging, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:40.840" class="transcript_line"> What family traditions or celebrations do you remember from a young age that your parents</div><div id="00:08:44.840" class="transcript_line"> kind of did with you, by you and for you? And so how, I mean, when did they arrive</div><div id="00:08:53.840" class="transcript_line"> in the UK as well?</div><div id="00:08:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, Mum arrived in the 19...</div><div id="00:08:57.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a whole section on that, but we can just get context.</div><div id="00:09:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so Mum came over around 1967. Her dad came and told us.</div><div id="00:09:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Dad was here for five years, so he came in the 60s when they were asking for the labour</div><div id="00:09:13.840" class="transcript_line"> force to come over here. And then Mum arrived, then he went back to Pakistan after five years</div><div id="00:09:19.840" class="transcript_line"> and then married my Mum. And then they came over here.</div><div id="00:09:24.840" class="transcript_line"> And how long until you guys were born?</div><div id="00:09:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I was born the year after.</div><div id="00:09:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Okay, that&#039;s a good time to start then. Back to that question, when they arrived, you guys</div><div id="00:09:34.840" class="transcript_line"> started to appear. What traditions start do you remember from a very young age then? And</div><div id="00:09:40.840" class="transcript_line"> cultural practices that were instilled upon you and around you?</div><div id="00:09:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:45.840" class="transcript_line"> More as you remember?</div><div id="00:09:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, obviously the obvious ones like Eid and everything. Well, that was a big thing.</div><div id="00:09:51.840" class="transcript_line"> Massive family get-togethers, because by then my uncles and aunts had arrived. My uncles</div><div id="00:09:57.840" class="transcript_line"> had got married and, you know, so they were older than Mum, so they had already started</div><div id="00:10:03.840" class="transcript_line"> their families. So they were slightly older than us. I think between our cousins, there&#039;s</div><div id="00:10:08.840" class="transcript_line"> about ten years before we started to be a ring. But they settled in Scotland, not here,</div><div id="00:10:14.840" class="transcript_line"> so we didn&#039;t see them very often. It wasn&#039;t until they came over a few years later than</div><div id="00:10:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Serpentine Cardiff, which is when we started big family gatherings. But it was mainly sort</div><div id="00:10:24.840" class="transcript_line"> of the Muslim sort of traditions, I would say.</div><div id="00:10:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so obviously we&#039;d been brought up in a culture where we were toying with two cultures.</div><div id="00:10:33.840" class="transcript_line"> So when we were in school, we&#039;d remember coming home and saying, it&#039;s Christmas in</div><div id="00:10:38.840" class="transcript_line"> school, and then having to say to, you know, parents sort of trying to explain that that</div><div id="00:10:44.840" class="transcript_line"> festival was a Christian festival and what have you. But Dad was really keen for us to</div><div id="00:10:51.840" class="transcript_line"> mix with different cultures and different religions and learn about each other. He really,</div><div id="00:10:55.840" class="transcript_line"> really wanted to integrate into Britain. And Eid was lovely, especially, you know, the</div><div id="00:11:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Ramadan was lovely, you know, the abundance of food, you know, we didn&#039;t really understand</div><div id="00:11:08.840" class="transcript_line"> it. You know, trying to fit into this society. My mum used to make us keep half a fast. She</div><div id="00:11:14.840" class="transcript_line"> used to say we could eat at 12 o&#039;clock. And so we used to keep a fast and then wake up</div><div id="00:11:18.840" class="transcript_line"> and then eat at 12 o&#039;clock and then think that we did something really amazing. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:22.840" class="transcript_line"> only until we grew up we realised that Mum was trying to sort of keep our religion intact</div><div id="00:11:28.840" class="transcript_line"> and keep our cultures intact. And every weekend we had people in our house. Our house was</div><div id="00:11:35.840" class="transcript_line"> always full of people. So our parents progressed, you know, after working really hard, we ended</div><div id="00:11:42.840" class="transcript_line"> up having businesses. And when we had businesses, our networks became even more bigger and bigger.</div><div id="00:11:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And all I can remember is our house being full of people, us being in the kitchen just</div><div id="00:11:54.840" class="transcript_line"> making teas and samosas. But it was lovely. Everybody had time for one another.</div><div id="00:12:01.840" class="transcript_line"> But I do remember though, because we had a lot of English families in our streets, at</div><div id="00:12:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Christmas, Mum and Dad would make a sort of like, give them presents, maybe just chocolates</div><div id="00:12:14.840" class="transcript_line"> or something. They would always make an effort to go and give their families a gift at Christmas,</div><div id="00:12:19.840" class="transcript_line"> even though it wasn&#039;t anything to do with us. So we felt sort of all together because</div><div id="00:12:24.840" class="transcript_line"> we had lovely neighbours in that street and they were very, very helpful. They weren&#039;t</div><div id="00:12:29.840" class="transcript_line"> sort of, you know, if Mum and Dad weren&#039;t home they would say, you know, come to our</div><div id="00:12:33.840" class="transcript_line"> house after school, have some tea and then we&#039;ll drop you back off and things like that.</div><div id="00:12:38.840" class="transcript_line"> They were very, very sort of, it was a lovely little community we lived in. It was really</div><div id="00:12:42.840" class="transcript_line"> nice in those days. But it wasn&#039;t always like that. So when we were very, very little</div><div id="00:12:46.840" class="transcript_line"> we had some neighbours who were very racist and they would throw things into our garden.</div><div id="00:12:52.840" class="transcript_line"> They would put the music on really loud. And, you know, Mum and Dad kind of felt like if</div><div id="00:13:01.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d said something then it would only be worse. So they tolerated it for a while.</div><div id="00:13:07.840" class="transcript_line"> And then after a while then whatever they threw over was being thrown back. Eventually,</div><div id="00:13:13.840" class="transcript_line"> luckily for us they moved and a good family moved in. But Dad was always protective of</div><div id="00:13:20.840" class="transcript_line"> us as well. I mean those social occasions we would always drive up to Rochdale where</div><div id="00:13:26.840" class="transcript_line"> we had family and spend, you know, holidays would be there. They wouldn&#039;t be holidays</div><div id="00:13:33.840" class="transcript_line"> abroad or they would be going to Pakistan. We wouldn&#039;t have the holidays abroad as such</div><div id="00:13:40.840" class="transcript_line"> as we do now. But it did make you think back when Dad started working here on the railways</div><div id="00:13:47.840" class="transcript_line"> when he first came after he, when he was working in the factories first he went on to work</div><div id="00:13:51.840" class="transcript_line"> in the railways and they gave him an English name. Yeah. And that always has stuck in my</div><div id="00:13:58.840" class="transcript_line"> mind. Like he has a name which you can say quite perfectly why. Or you could have shortened</div><div id="00:14:04.840" class="transcript_line"> his name. You could have shortened his name. So his name was Ashraf, Mohammed Ashraf and</div><div id="00:14:08.840" class="transcript_line"> they gave him an English name on the railways as Sam. So he was always known as Sam. Everyone</div><div id="00:14:13.840" class="transcript_line"> knew him as Sam and that&#039;s what they called him. And I always quite often thought like</div><div id="00:14:18.840" class="transcript_line"> why, why did they have the need to do that? And I would, you know, quite often I&#039;d always</div><div id="00:14:23.840" class="transcript_line"> thought even now it really bothers me. I always think I want to go back to all the people</div><div id="00:14:28.840" class="transcript_line"> who were working with him and ask them, you know, why, why did you do that? But in our</div><div id="00:14:35.840" class="transcript_line"> generation, I know people even in our generation today that have English names at work because</div><div id="00:14:42.840" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re trying to fit in. What would, do you know what was the reasoning for them to</div><div id="00:14:48.840" class="transcript_line"> arrive when you came? What was the motivations and reasoning? It came for work. It came to</div><div id="00:14:53.840" class="transcript_line"> help rebuild Britain. They came because, well my dad used to say, obviously I&#039;m here</div><div id="00:15:04.840" class="transcript_line"> because they were there, but one day they will tell us to go back. Yeah, he did always</div><div id="00:15:11.840" class="transcript_line"> use to say that. And he always used to say we have to build something there. One day</div><div id="00:15:13.840" class="transcript_line"> they will always tell us to go back because, you know, they just want us to do the work</div><div id="00:15:19.840" class="transcript_line"> that the white people don&#039;t want to do. So he came to help rebuild Britain after the</div><div id="00:15:23.840" class="transcript_line"> war. Yeah, they suffered quite a lot with us growing up and the fact that, you know,</div><div id="00:15:28.840" class="transcript_line"> most, half of, more than half of their earnings were sent back to help with the families back</div><div id="00:15:33.840" class="transcript_line"> there so they could build something there. So there was always something there to go</div><div id="00:15:37.840" class="transcript_line"> back to. And I think that was, we don&#039;t think like that now, but in that generation I think</div><div id="00:15:42.840" class="transcript_line"> most parents did that, built something back home in the fear that they might say, well,</div><div id="00:15:47.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, you can go now. You know, because of what they experienced in India, I think</div><div id="00:15:53.840" class="transcript_line"> it was always there that that might happen again. So when dad was earning, mum had to</div><div id="00:16:01.840" class="transcript_line"> cope with, you know, those shillings that my dad was bringing home. Part of that had</div><div id="00:16:05.840" class="transcript_line"> to be put away so they could send back. And so even mum started work then. So she started</div><div id="00:16:12.840" class="transcript_line"> working from home as a lot of the women did, where you&#039;re used to sew clothes at home.</div><div id="00:16:17.840" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;d be factories like for dresses or hospital wear or whatever. And they would</div><div id="00:16:22.840" class="transcript_line"> come and give you a bundle as they called them then. And it depended on you how many</div><div id="00:16:27.840" class="transcript_line"> bundles you wanted that week. You&#039;d sew them, maybe put in zips and buttons and whatever</div><div id="00:16:31.840" class="transcript_line"> on them. And then they would pay you, pay mum for that. And that happened a lot with</div><div id="00:16:35.840" class="transcript_line"> all the, just so they were earning something to help, you know, help bring the children</div><div id="00:16:39.840" class="transcript_line"> up and help with bills and things. I remember it being quite...</div><div id="00:16:43.840" class="transcript_line"> But dad was earning £12 a week, you know. And they were renting a room when they first</div><div id="00:16:50.840" class="transcript_line"> came here. And then mum wanted to have her own house. So they saved and saved and saved</div><div id="00:16:55.840" class="transcript_line"> and then bought a house. So it was £1,100 that they paid for the first house. But in</div><div id="00:17:02.840" class="transcript_line"> those days, the community would get together. So if you were going to buy a house, all the</div><div id="00:17:08.840" class="transcript_line"> community would put their savings into your deposit to get the house and help you get</div><div id="00:17:14.840" class="transcript_line"> on their housing ladder. And then when it came to their turn, you would do the same</div><div id="00:17:18.840" class="transcript_line"> for them. And that&#039;s how it worked. And that&#039;s why a lot of the families ended up with homes,</div><div id="00:17:22.840" class="transcript_line"> not just renting. And that&#039;s how it worked then.</div><div id="00:17:25.840" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:17:26.840" class="transcript_line"> What do you know about the work situation? You said where he worked, where your father</div><div id="00:17:32.840" class="transcript_line"> and your mother worked, you can briefly explain that. What do you know about those working</div><div id="00:17:36.840" class="transcript_line"> situations and do you have any stories to tell them that?</div><div id="00:17:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, dad was quite lucky because he got to grips with the language quite quickly. And</div><div id="00:17:46.840" class="transcript_line"> because of that, he made a few friends along the way. And because he just got on with things,</div><div id="00:17:51.840" class="transcript_line"> although my dad was quite vocal, he still just got on with things. To him it was a job.</div><div id="00:17:55.840" class="transcript_line"> He was earning money to provide for his family. He sort of got promoted quite quickly.</div><div id="00:18:02.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so he was with the railway industry and it was the shunt in the coal. So it was</div><div id="00:18:07.840" class="transcript_line"> basically the coal, the trunks that came along with the coal in them, making sure that they</div><div id="00:18:13.840" class="transcript_line"> were going to the right place. We didn&#039;t have to go into the coal mines because he was part</div><div id="00:18:16.840" class="transcript_line"> of the railways. And that was in Barry, Barryport there. That&#039;s how it started. That&#039;s where</div><div id="00:18:22.840" class="transcript_line"> he used to work. So when an opening came in Newport, they offered it to my dad, which</div><div id="00:18:29.840" class="transcript_line"> was great, with a pay rise. So it sort of fell into place.</div><div id="00:18:34.840" class="transcript_line"> They were long hours.</div><div id="00:18:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, very long hours.</div><div id="00:18:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Really long hours. And do you remember, dad used to say, when he first came here, before</div><div id="00:18:43.840" class="transcript_line"> he married mum, there were lots of Pakistani men living in the same room even. And they</div><div id="00:18:50.840" class="transcript_line"> used to take it in turns to cook. And it&#039;s almost like, because they worked shifts, there</div><div id="00:18:55.840" class="transcript_line"> was never a bed empty. So the ones who would go in the daytime would give the night men</div><div id="00:18:58.840" class="transcript_line"> the bed. And the bed was never empty because they would just kind of swap.</div><div id="00:19:03.840" class="transcript_line"> And food was very scarce as well. So one of them would have to make the flour for the</div><div id="00:19:12.840" class="transcript_line"> roti. The other one would make the curry. And they didn&#039;t have fridges in those days,</div><div id="00:19:17.840" class="transcript_line"> so they had to cover it up and hide it somewhere cool. And then it was portioned for each</div><div id="00:19:21.840" class="transcript_line"> of them. So whoever came home took their portion and that was it. That&#039;s all you had for the</div><div id="00:19:26.840" class="transcript_line"> day. You know, it was very, very tough times. They were really tough times. I remember dad</div><div id="00:19:31.840" class="transcript_line"> saying, and sometimes you would go sort of hungry, you know. But yeah, like you said,</div><div id="00:19:36.840" class="transcript_line"> they used to have to share beds. So one would do a day shift, one would do a night, and</div><div id="00:19:40.840" class="transcript_line"> they would swap with each other. And that&#039;s how they made it work. So until my granddad</div><div id="00:19:45.840" class="transcript_line"> said, you need to come home and get married, you need a wife.</div><div id="00:19:50.840" class="transcript_line"> But then when they saved their money, he ended up buying, we ended up owning, going</div><div id="00:19:56.840" class="transcript_line"> into the rag trade. So it was fashion in Kingsway Centre. And it was in the 80s and business</div><div id="00:20:03.840" class="transcript_line"> was thriving. We had a really, really good business. It made mum then gave up work of</div><div id="00:20:11.840" class="transcript_line"> what she was doing. All the efforts were put into the shop. And in those days, the whole</div><div id="00:20:17.840" class="transcript_line"> family would be there. So children used to even go into the shops then to be part of,</div><div id="00:20:21.840" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t see that these days, but be part of the people that serve the weekends on a</div><div id="00:20:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Saturday or after school. And life changed when dad had his own business. Because that</div><div id="00:20:36.840" class="transcript_line"> was what was going to make him enough money to be able to support his family here and</div><div id="00:20:40.840" class="transcript_line"> to support the family there in a good way.</div><div id="00:20:46.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean during those times, what did they speak of back home? What was their connection</div><div id="00:20:50.840" class="transcript_line"> back home and how often did they go back and do they make any efforts to sound like they</div><div id="00:20:56.840" class="transcript_line"> were at that point focusing a lot of energies here?</div><div id="00:20:59.840" class="transcript_line"> Well the form of communication was telegrams first. So that&#039;s how they communicated. You&#039;d</div><div id="00:21:06.840" class="transcript_line"> send something and it wouldn&#039;t get there until about six to eight weeks later. And</div><div id="00:21:12.840" class="transcript_line"> the same from them. Unless somebody was travelling, then they would give them a letter and say</div><div id="00:21:17.840" class="transcript_line"> can you give this to my son or my daughter? And you were from the same village. But if</div><div id="00:21:21.840" class="transcript_line"> not, then that&#039;s how they communicated through telegram. There was quite often somebody had</div><div id="00:21:27.840" class="transcript_line"> been born or somebody had passed away and you wouldn&#039;t find out until about two months</div><div id="00:21:32.840" class="transcript_line"> later because of the telegram. So that was very, very hard. And I know my dad really</div><div id="00:21:38.840" class="transcript_line"> missed his mum and dad.</div><div id="00:21:41.840" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the first time I ever saw dad cry is when we had the telegram that his mum had</div><div id="00:21:46.840" class="transcript_line"> died. The first and probably last time that I ever saw him.</div><div id="00:21:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:51.840" class="transcript_line"> That was heartbreaking. That was really hard.</div><div id="00:21:54.840" class="transcript_line"> But he was lucky enough to bring them over here and take them to Hatch as well. So when</div><div id="00:22:02.840" class="transcript_line"> he had the opportunity and the funds, he did call my grandparents here and they stayed</div><div id="00:22:06.840" class="transcript_line"> a while. So I think that was something he felt like such a big achievement there, didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:22:13.840" class="transcript_line"> he? That he was managed to get them here and then take them to Mecca.</div><div id="00:22:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they used to go together and it was a bit more difficult for us with being</div><div id="00:22:21.840" class="transcript_line"> in school and whatever. And sometimes they would take it in turns to go. So they always</div><div id="00:22:26.840" class="transcript_line"> kept that connection with Pakistan.</div><div id="00:22:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So every few years. It wouldn&#039;t be every year. For every few years one of them</div><div id="00:22:32.840" class="transcript_line"> or both would go.</div><div id="00:22:34.840" class="transcript_line"> What did they speak of as their early experiences in the UK?</div><div id="00:22:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Cold. Wet. Food was different. They felt isolated. That&#039;s why you find within our communities</div><div id="00:22:55.840" class="transcript_line"> why they&#039;re all so together. So you go down the street and it&#039;s mainly Asian because</div><div id="00:23:02.840" class="transcript_line"> in those days you couldn&#039;t fit anywhere else where you were supposed to go.</div><div id="00:23:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Everybody became everyone&#039;s support network from your own communities which is why they</div><div id="00:23:13.840" class="transcript_line"> all tried to live together.</div><div id="00:23:14.840" class="transcript_line"> To keep near each other, yeah. So they always had that there.</div><div id="00:23:19.840" class="transcript_line"> And you didn&#039;t have a car. So anything you wanted to go to get, like Mum would have to</div><div id="00:23:27.840" class="transcript_line"> take us all with her to go to the Saturday market, get all the fruits and the veg or</div><div id="00:23:32.840" class="transcript_line"> any groceries that they needed and then she&#039;d walk there and walk back again because she</div><div id="00:23:35.840" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t have any other form of transport then. So that was difficult. She said it was really,</div><div id="00:23:42.840" class="transcript_line"> really hard whether it was snowing or we used to have a lot of snow and we used to have</div><div id="00:23:46.840" class="transcript_line"> a lot of rain but in those days we had to have really heavy snow. And she said she still</div><div id="00:23:51.840" class="transcript_line"> had to go out so she&#039;d sometimes leave us at home. Don&#039;t move, you&#039;re in one room.</div><div id="00:23:56.840" class="transcript_line"> That sort of thing because in those days it wasn&#039;t as strict as it is now. And she would</div><div id="00:24:01.840" class="transcript_line"> have to quickly go early in the morning, get her shop and get back again to us and you</div><div id="00:24:06.840" class="transcript_line"> know, with a heart all over the place thinking that she&#039;s left us, you know. And it was</div><div id="00:24:10.840" class="transcript_line"> really, really difficult times. You couldn&#039;t get halal food. So I remember one day my dad</div><div id="00:24:17.840" class="transcript_line"> bringing home some chickens. They were live chickens running around the room and he took</div><div id="00:24:22.840" class="transcript_line"> them out to halal them just so we could have chicken. And so, you know, it&#039;s not like it</div><div id="00:24:30.840" class="transcript_line"> was then. But even then it wasn&#039;t like you&#039;d get halal restaurants and stuff. Even going</div><div id="00:24:34.840" class="transcript_line"> out was really hard, wasn&#039;t it? You couldn&#039;t sit somewhere and eat. There was nowhere for</div><div id="00:24:39.840" class="transcript_line"> you to go. So you were restricted in a lot of ways in integrating. There was no mosque.</div><div id="00:24:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So my father was one of the founders of the Jamiah Mosque in Commercial Road in Newport</div><div id="00:24:53.840" class="transcript_line"> and helped build obviously the foundations of the structure. So just before he died he</div><div id="00:24:57.840" class="transcript_line"> managed to get the structure ready there. And it was like that for years afterwards</div><div id="00:25:03.840" class="transcript_line"> then because obviously the committee had disbanded at that time after that. And so people who</div><div id="00:25:09.840" class="transcript_line"> are from Newport remember a metal structure of foundations, steel structure still being</div><div id="00:25:14.840" class="transcript_line"> there for years and years and years until it&#039;s now built into the rest of the mosque.</div><div id="00:25:19.840" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, he was very, he was really active in that, wasn&#039;t he? He was a businessman</div><div id="00:25:26.840" class="transcript_line"> and he used that to his advantage in the sense of creating that cohesion. He was involved</div><div id="00:25:32.840" class="transcript_line"> in so many things. He was involved in magistrates, home safety committees. He introduced halal</div><div id="00:25:37.840" class="transcript_line"> food to our health boards in Newport. He was on so many different committees and all sorts</div><div id="00:25:47.840" class="transcript_line"> because he really believed that despite what colour, race, religion you were, whatever</div><div id="00:25:54.840" class="transcript_line"> your background was, everybody should be living in harmony. He really believed that</div><div id="00:25:59.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s what we could do and that&#039;s what we could achieve if we just all tolerated</div><div id="00:26:04.840" class="transcript_line"> each other&#039;s religions.</div><div id="00:26:16.840" class="transcript_line"> Customs and traditions. As you guys have gone older, what customs and traditions have you</div><div id="00:26:23.840" class="transcript_line"> retained that your family has offered you at a young age?</div><div id="00:26:30.840" class="transcript_line"> We still, the children in the family have been brought up in the same way. They still</div><div id="00:26:36.840" class="transcript_line"> go to mosque when they&#039;re small, you know, to learn about the religion. We still have,</div><div id="00:26:43.840" class="transcript_line"> we still do Ramadan, we still do our Eids. So we&#039;ve kept united as a family in terms</div><div id="00:26:53.840" class="transcript_line"> of the extended family. My brothers still live with my mum and their families so they</div><div id="00:26:58.840" class="transcript_line"> still live in an extended family because they are our support networks, you know, having</div><div id="00:27:05.840" class="transcript_line"> that so...</div><div id="00:27:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Why? Why have you preserved these particular traditions and customs? Why are they meaningful</div><div id="00:27:13.840" class="transcript_line"> to you?</div><div id="00:27:14.840" class="transcript_line"> I think mainly because mum was left on her own, she was quite young. We don&#039;t. She was</div><div id="00:27:21.840" class="transcript_line"> quite young. So we felt very protective of her. My brothers felt very protective of her.</div><div id="00:27:27.840" class="transcript_line"> So there will come a time when obviously as their families grow things will change and</div><div id="00:27:32.840" class="transcript_line"> mum or none of us have a problem with that. But at the moment, we all feel mum needs to</div><div id="00:27:40.840" class="transcript_line"> be surrounded by that. She&#039;s done so much for us and it&#039;s our only way to give back.</div><div id="00:27:47.840" class="transcript_line"> We see mum all the time, my brothers live there. So she&#039;s always, always looked after</div><div id="00:27:51.840" class="transcript_line"> and I think it just became a priority within the family. Yeah, you know.</div><div id="00:27:56.840" class="transcript_line"> As well I think is to maintain our sense of identity as well because I, for example, never</div><div id="00:28:05.840" class="transcript_line"> used to wear... I&#039;ve been to Uomra twice and you know, on and off I wore a scarf but I</div><div id="00:28:13.840" class="transcript_line"> never really did at work because I felt like I should be trying to fit in. And one day</div><div id="00:28:21.840" class="transcript_line"> I thought, no, I&#039;ve lost my identity trying to fit in with this society. I&#039;m not going</div><div id="00:28:29.840" class="transcript_line"> to do that anymore. And I started wearing a scarf to work and was very surprised by</div><div id="00:28:35.840" class="transcript_line"> that reaction from a lot of people. People were almost not able to speak to me even until</div><div id="00:28:43.840" class="transcript_line"> I had to say my brain hasn&#039;t changed because I have a scarf on my head. And I found that</div><div id="00:28:50.840" class="transcript_line"> quite eye opening because when I wasn&#039;t wearing it, I think people felt that I was more like</div><div id="00:28:58.840" class="transcript_line"> them and now I am wearing it. I look different. So I think maintaining your identity in terms</div><div id="00:29:09.840" class="transcript_line"> of culture and in terms of religion is quite... is very important. I mean religion is always</div><div id="00:29:16.840" class="transcript_line"> played a really big factor in our house, particularly, you know, we read regularly, you know, we</div><div id="00:29:23.840" class="transcript_line"> have get togethers where we read the Quran just as a family, you know, for my dad. We</div><div id="00:29:32.840" class="transcript_line"> maintain as much religion and we keep on learning. And you know, the internet is a great thing</div><div id="00:29:37.840" class="transcript_line"> for the kids these days to learn more but we were taught the Quran when we were here,</div><div id="00:29:41.840" class="transcript_line"> when we were young. We were just taught how to read it so we can read Arabic from the</div><div id="00:29:45.840" class="transcript_line"> Quran but we can&#039;t understand it. So we don&#039;t know what we&#039;re reading but we&#039;re reading</div><div id="00:29:51.840" class="transcript_line"> it. And so, you know, it&#039;s a bit different now. There&#039;s more knowledge out there of transliteration</div><div id="00:29:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and stuff. And the way the world is changing so fast, it&#039;s so fast paced at the moment,</div><div id="00:30:03.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s really important for the next generation, the youngsters now, to keep that</div><div id="00:30:09.840" class="transcript_line"> family unit for them to understand. So when they&#039;re all together, that culture is still</div><div id="00:30:14.840" class="transcript_line"> there. I think the minute you start sort of expanding and going your own way, I think</div><div id="00:30:19.840" class="transcript_line"> they start to change. So they have their limits. They know what&#039;s right and what&#039;s</div><div id="00:30:24.840" class="transcript_line"> wrong. But I think it&#039;s really important for them to understand where they came from</div><div id="00:30:31.840" class="transcript_line"> and where they need, which route they need to take. I think there was always a fear from</div><div id="00:30:36.840" class="transcript_line"> all people that came from Pakistan that the children that grew up here would become too</div><div id="00:30:42.840" class="transcript_line"> westernised and would lose their way, would lose their religion, lose their values. You</div><div id="00:30:48.840" class="transcript_line"> know, people here, they dress differently. You know, that even going to the cinema was</div><div id="00:30:54.840" class="transcript_line"> such a big thing when we were young. You know, it was, you know, why would you want to go</div><div id="00:30:58.840" class="transcript_line"> to a cinema, you know, when you can watch things at home? And it was that fear, I think,</div><div id="00:31:05.840" class="transcript_line"> that, you know, they might lose their way. You know, how do we hold on to that religion</div><div id="00:31:10.840" class="transcript_line"> and that culture? But I found over time that there&#039;s been a dip and there&#039;s been a peak,</div><div id="00:31:17.840" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t there? Because all of a sudden everybody is moving towards Islamic religion in a real</div><div id="00:31:24.840" class="transcript_line"> big way and finding out more about it, learning more about it. Learning that Islam actually</div><div id="00:31:29.840" class="transcript_line"> means peace, you know, and learning how to live in a more tolerated society. Whereas,</div><div id="00:31:36.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, there was a time, was it, when everything was just trying to find your way, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:31:42.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, even if we wanted to go to a restaurant, mum would say, well, why can&#039;t you cook at home?</div><div id="00:31:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Don&#039;t you need to pay to go to eat? I don&#039;t understand.</div><div id="00:31:52.840" class="transcript_line"> What traditions or cultural practices have you possibly even adapted or updated, do you</div><div id="00:31:58.840" class="transcript_line"> feel, as being another generation? Because I think that tends to happen a bit and you</div><div id="00:32:02.840" class="transcript_line"> just make, you know, you have cottage pie for iftar or something like that.</div><div id="00:32:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, exactly. Well, obviously, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:08.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been chilling in my lasagne. I think the food definitely has because they&#039;re</div><div id="00:32:14.840" class="transcript_line"> young and it&#039;s good for them because they can&#039;t just, they need to fit into society</div><div id="00:32:21.840" class="transcript_line"> and be able to socialise in a confident way. But can you remember as, when we were younger,</div><div id="00:32:27.840" class="transcript_line"> that dad used to love foods from different countries, so he&#039;d come home and we used</div><div id="00:32:32.840" class="transcript_line"> to have on a Sunday, on a Saturday, we used to have like javals, rice, all the traditional</div><div id="00:32:39.840" class="transcript_line"> curries and everything. And on a Sunday would be roast dinner. And we would have a roast</div><div id="00:32:45.840" class="transcript_line"> dinner in the same way, with no spices. It was just like a proper chicken roast with</div><div id="00:32:50.840" class="transcript_line"> all the vegetables and everything. And a friend who are Pakistani used to say, they&#039;re having</div><div id="00:32:55.840" class="transcript_line"> English dinner in their house because they saw that as an English dinner that, and I</div><div id="00:33:01.840" class="transcript_line"> used to say, it&#039;s the same food, it&#039;s just cooked in a different way. And they just couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:33:05.840" class="transcript_line"> understand. And even to this day, and you know, this generation&#039;s on now, when we&#039;re</div><div id="00:33:11.840" class="transcript_line"> talking about what you&#039;re cooking today, in our house, they still say, oh, we&#039;re making</div><div id="00:33:16.840" class="transcript_line"> English dinner because it&#039;s in their heads. Sometimes we used to call it that. But the</div><div id="00:33:22.840" class="transcript_line"> menu as such has changed because the kids want to eat differently. So, you know, there&#039;s</div><div id="00:33:27.840" class="transcript_line"> pastas and Italian and pizzas and, you know, you name it, food has totally changed.</div><div id="00:33:33.840" class="transcript_line"> But clothing, the way we dress has changed as well because when we were younger, it was</div><div id="00:33:38.840" class="transcript_line"> always seen as you would wear, you know, clothes that were traditional, even if you were out,</div><div id="00:33:44.840" class="transcript_line"> you know, you would wear the traditional dress. And my father was a little bit more liberal,</div><div id="00:33:49.840" class="transcript_line"> as long as we were covered, you know, he didn&#039;t mind sort of, you know, what their tops and</div><div id="00:33:54.840" class="transcript_line"> trousers looked like. And, you know, you know, we even had people from the community, didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:34:01.840" class="transcript_line"> we, ringing home and saying, I saw your daughter.</div><div id="00:34:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Dresses on the top, jeans on the top, where&#039;s she going?</div><div id="00:34:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, my parents would say, well, she went from home like that.</div><div id="00:34:16.840" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;s going to come home like that.</div><div id="00:34:18.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we had people that used to actually go into the house and then change their clothes,</div><div id="00:34:23.840" class="transcript_line"> just to fit in, just to fit in in society, and then re-change to come home, you know,</div><div id="00:34:28.840" class="transcript_line"> just so they didn&#039;t miss, they feel like they were missing out on something.</div><div id="00:34:32.840" class="transcript_line"> So this generation are very lucky because everything is so much more liberal with them, you know.</div><div id="00:34:39.840" class="transcript_line"> We were brought up with the attitude, look, you&#039;ve got to save, save, save because you have to</div><div id="00:34:44.840" class="transcript_line"> save your money to make sure that you have a better life for yourself.</div><div id="00:34:49.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, you need to buy your own houses. You need to, you know, make sure that you have enough</div><div id="00:34:54.840" class="transcript_line"> to live on, you know, don&#039;t live off the state, work hard.</div><div id="00:34:59.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, we had a really strong work ethic.</div><div id="00:35:04.840" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s because of the struggles that they had faced, that they&#039;d come through.</div><div id="00:35:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they were always going to, you know.</div><div id="00:35:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I find that&#039;s different with the children that are born now.</div><div id="00:35:14.840" class="transcript_line"> I find that everything that people didn&#039;t have is given to them on a plate.</div><div id="00:35:21.840" class="transcript_line"> So, you know.</div><div id="00:35:23.840" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s definitely a change, definitely a change, you know.</div><div id="00:35:27.840" class="transcript_line"> They want to go out all the time, they want to eat out all the time, you know.</div><div id="00:35:32.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember.</div><div id="00:35:33.840" class="transcript_line"> Buy iced coffees and things, it&#039;s a daily thing, it&#039;s not like a treat anymore.</div><div id="00:35:36.840" class="transcript_line"> For us when we were growing up, that would be something you were saved for,</div><div id="00:35:39.840" class="transcript_line"> and then you&#039;d have a treat.</div><div id="00:35:40.840" class="transcript_line"> But now it&#039;s like, oh, I&#039;m just going for a coffee or I&#039;m just going out and go for lunch.</div><div id="00:35:44.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s totally different, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:47.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was different in terms of the housework and everything because we didn&#039;t have microwaves,</div><div id="00:35:54.840" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t have washing machines.</div><div id="00:35:55.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember mum washing by hand and I remember mum using towels for nappies,</div><div id="00:36:02.840" class="transcript_line"> the traditional nappies and having to wash them and hang them on the...</div><div id="00:36:07.840" class="transcript_line"> I think everybody used them, they didn&#039;t have disposable ones then.</div><div id="00:36:10.840" class="transcript_line"> And now it&#039;s so easy.</div><div id="00:36:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I can remember dad having the first colour television and thinking, oh wow,</div><div id="00:36:16.840" class="transcript_line"> and it was all those like lines on there, that one was sitting there like...</div><div id="00:36:20.840" class="transcript_line"> And dad was the first person in the community to have a car.</div><div id="00:36:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, in our street.</div><div id="00:36:24.840" class="transcript_line"> It was such a massive thing.</div><div id="00:36:25.840" class="transcript_line"> So he had a brown Humber.</div><div id="00:36:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Humber sector.</div><div id="00:36:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Humber sector.</div><div id="00:36:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any heirlooms or mementos or ornaments that remind you of your parents&#039; upbringing?</div><div id="00:36:40.840" class="transcript_line"> So I have got...</div><div id="00:36:43.840" class="transcript_line"> So back in the day when my mum got married, traditionally they still do it now,</div><div id="00:36:49.840" class="transcript_line"> but they used to give a big chest and in that chest there would be plates and rugs and crochet,</div><div id="00:36:56.840" class="transcript_line"> hand crochets, you know, pillowcases and things like that.</div><div id="00:36:59.840" class="transcript_line"> So from my mum&#039;s chest I have her...</div><div id="00:37:04.840" class="transcript_line"> What they gave her was...</div><div id="00:37:06.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called a lota, but basically it&#039;s what they use to clean themselves in the bathroom.</div><div id="00:37:11.840" class="transcript_line"> So when people use jugs and things these days, so it&#039;s a bit like a bidet,</div><div id="00:37:15.840" class="transcript_line"> but it looks...</div><div id="00:37:17.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how to describe it, but it looks like a measuring jug with a little...</div><div id="00:37:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Spent.</div><div id="00:37:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Spent on it basically.</div><div id="00:37:24.840" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s quite intricate because obviously it was given to her when she got married,</div><div id="00:37:28.840" class="transcript_line"> so obviously they&#039;re kind of engraved, you know, it&#039;s quite posh, one of you like.</div><div id="00:37:33.840" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s never been used, it&#039;s just, you know, so I&#039;ve got that.</div><div id="00:37:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve also got a little from my granddad when he came for the first time.</div><div id="00:37:43.840" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t have what&#039;s called a hookah, which is what they use in...</div><div id="00:37:48.840" class="transcript_line"> Like a smoking pipe.</div><div id="00:37:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Like a smoking pipe, which they use in shisha bars these days.</div><div id="00:37:52.840" class="transcript_line"> So he made one, like a little bottle and a top and wrapped it up and whatever,</div><div id="00:37:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s got a little spout and everything.</div><div id="00:38:00.840" class="transcript_line"> So I have that as well.</div><div id="00:38:03.840" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t have any air rooms, but I do have some of dad&#039;s clothes still, like his suits.</div><div id="00:38:09.840" class="transcript_line"> My dad was very suet and booted, he was a very smart man.</div><div id="00:38:12.840" class="transcript_line"> And so I still have one of his suits, and it still smells of my dad.</div><div id="00:38:17.840" class="transcript_line"> So, I&#039;ve just got like a mum&#039;s, you know, surma that they put in the eyes, the line of the coal.</div><div id="00:38:26.840" class="transcript_line"> Used to keep it in like sort of like silver little trinket pots then.</div><div id="00:38:30.840" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve got that.</div><div id="00:38:32.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve kept that for many, many, many, many years, so I&#039;ve got that.</div><div id="00:38:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And I think, don&#039;t you still have the first grand shif that was given to you by mum?</div><div id="00:38:41.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you still have that?</div><div id="00:38:42.840" class="transcript_line"> I still have my grand.</div><div id="00:38:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it is a little bit worn, but it&#039;s like, like, decades and decades.</div><div id="00:38:49.840" class="transcript_line"> I read my grand when I was six, so I&#039;ve had it since I was six years old.</div><div id="00:38:52.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and that was passed on, it was one of those that&#039;s been passed on.</div><div id="00:38:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, the reason I ask is, in the monks&#039; people&#039;s collection, we can digitise air rooms if you want them to be.</div><div id="00:39:06.840" class="transcript_line"> So photographs can be scanned and restored, tapes can be restored.</div><div id="00:39:10.840" class="transcript_line"> If you have ornaments, they can be photographed if you want those to exist in another format.</div><div id="00:39:15.840" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s up to you when that moment comes.</div><div id="00:39:20.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a case of dad&#039;s cassettes, but I don&#039;t know what&#039;s on them because I haven&#039;t got a cassette player.</div><div id="00:39:27.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re kind of just people&#039;s collections.</div><div id="00:39:29.840" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s things in there, there&#039;s probably, there&#039;s a cassette somewhere with dad&#039;s voice in it and I don&#039;t know where it is.</div><div id="00:39:37.840" class="transcript_line"> So at this point, I mean, I&#039;ve got one last question, but that&#039;s going to be about Agent Live.</div><div id="00:39:42.840" class="transcript_line"> I think this is over to you now.</div><div id="00:39:44.840" class="transcript_line"> If there&#039;s things you&#039;ve not mentioned that you definitely want to get on file, now&#039;s the chance to speak them.</div><div id="00:39:51.840" class="transcript_line"> So you went through a chronological order of, you know, originally India to Pakistan to migrating to arriving to working.</div><div id="00:40:01.840" class="transcript_line"> And then customs and traditions that you can maintain.</div><div id="00:40:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Is there things that you feel you want to add at this point?</div><div id="00:40:09.840" class="transcript_line"> And if you want me to ask a question to trigger it and say, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:40:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, you probably don&#039;t need to know this, because this is just a little bit of the history that, you know, one of the things I probably would have liked to mention that</div><div id="00:40:27.840" class="transcript_line"> Dad left his whole life behind, his family and everybody.</div><div id="00:40:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, but this wasn&#039;t the first time that Pakistan had helped Britain, because in World War I,</div><div id="00:40:46.840" class="transcript_line"> like 400,000 Indians came over here to fight in the war.</div><div id="00:40:56.840" class="transcript_line"> And many Pakistanis and Indians died alongside British troops in that war.</div><div id="00:41:01.840" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s often forgotten that this wasn&#039;t the first time Pakistan came to the aid.</div><div id="00:41:07.840" class="transcript_line"> It was India then. So the people from the Indian subcontinent at that time came over here.</div><div id="00:41:14.840" class="transcript_line"> So I think sometimes people forget that this is like a history of people coming here to help Britain.</div><div id="00:41:20.840" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t just, you know, the August 1947 partition.</div><div id="00:41:27.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll ask that as a question. So, I mean, from your perspective, based loosely on what you just said,</div><div id="00:41:32.840" class="transcript_line"> what scales do people need to be aware of how integration and migration has benefited the country?</div><div id="00:41:42.840" class="transcript_line"> How do you want to display that really? You can talk about that if you want to.</div><div id="00:41:47.840" class="transcript_line"> We can read it out, it&#039;s up to you.</div><div id="00:41:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Okay. Because you&#039;re an editor anyway, aren&#039;t you? So I just, I just, so.</div><div id="00:41:54.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve already said the part where dad was very perceptive and told us stories about Britain and its experience.</div><div id="00:42:05.840" class="transcript_line"> He used to say, we are here because they were there. And one day they will tell us we don&#039;t belong.</div><div id="00:42:10.840" class="transcript_line"> And at that time we thought he was being humorous because my father was a really, really funny man.</div><div id="00:42:15.840" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, unfortunately, some of those things ring true for us today.</div><div id="00:42:21.840" class="transcript_line"> And the partition in India saw the end of a 200 year British rule.</div><div id="00:42:27.840" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m not sure if people know, but the British Pakistani community is one of the oldest and the largest ethnic minority community outside of Pakistan.</div><div id="00:42:38.840" class="transcript_line"> Here, the UK&#039;s open door immigration policy, they allowed members of the Commonwealth to apply here.</div><div id="00:42:48.840" class="transcript_line"> But that was for Britain&#039;s post-war labor needs, being promised the land of milk and honey, leaving everything behind.</div><div id="00:42:55.840" class="transcript_line"> But pre-partition, everyone lived in India and there was 400,000 Indian soldiers fought for Britain in World War I.</div><div id="00:43:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Many Pakistanis and Indians fought and died alongside British troops.</div><div id="00:43:09.840" class="transcript_line"> So Great Britain coming here was not so great.</div><div id="00:43:13.840" class="transcript_line"> The reception for the Pakistanis was far from welcoming.</div><div id="00:43:18.840" class="transcript_line"> And I worry about that today because we see people coming into the country today and even today certain communities are welcomed more than others.</div><div id="00:43:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Particularly in the recent Ukrainian crisis, for example.</div><div id="00:43:35.840" class="transcript_line"> That wasn&#039;t like the Afghan crisis where we had actually gone from Britain and interfered in people&#039;s lives.</div><div id="00:43:45.840" class="transcript_line"> This was something else that had happened.</div><div id="00:43:48.840" class="transcript_line"> But the welcome the Ukrainians received here, the support they received, the ability to work,</div><div id="00:43:53.840" class="transcript_line"> it was very different from asylum seekers and refugees that come from other countries.</div><div id="00:43:57.840" class="transcript_line"> But it was a far cry from Pakistani society where they lived in tight family units.</div><div id="00:44:05.840" class="transcript_line"> Generations resided together and there was a fundamental support network.</div><div id="00:44:12.840" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t easy for first generation immigrants and racism was widespread.</div><div id="00:44:17.840" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t look the same. The color of our skin, our language, religion and culture became a problem for many.</div><div id="00:44:24.840" class="transcript_line"> My father realized the color of his skin somehow disqualified him from being British.</div><div id="00:44:30.840" class="transcript_line"> And he couldn&#039;t understand that.</div><div id="00:44:32.840" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d come from an Islamic religion which instructs Muslims to wholeheartedly help the needy, the destitute, without considering color, creed, race or religion.</div><div id="00:44:41.840" class="transcript_line"> The weather here was cold and the food was unfamiliar and appetizing and not in accordance with cultural and religious requirements.</div><div id="00:44:50.840" class="transcript_line"> In the mid-60s, discrimination of skin color became illegal.</div><div id="00:44:55.840" class="transcript_line"> But on the other hand, there was an increasing concern over rising immigration.</div><div id="00:45:00.840" class="transcript_line"> The government imposed a series of immigration acts which effectively ended migration into Britain from the Indians of the continent, but that included the Caribbean as well.</div><div id="00:45:13.840" class="transcript_line"> So the black and South Asian people that came here did feel that they were under attack.</div><div id="00:45:18.840" class="transcript_line"> So the country that they voluntarily had come here and they were asked to come and rebuild turned their back on them.</div><div id="00:45:26.840" class="transcript_line"> That affected hundreds and thousands of immigrants.</div><div id="00:45:30.840" class="transcript_line"> But they settled here, they filled manual jobs and steel mill jobs and textile industry jobs.</div><div id="00:45:39.840" class="transcript_line"> And for that, like we said, it was the railways.</div><div id="00:45:42.840" class="transcript_line"> He was only 18 when he came here.</div><div id="00:45:52.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve spoken about sort of him, the way he lived in one house and how he used to share the beds and how determined he was really to make a good life of himself.</div><div id="00:46:05.840" class="transcript_line"> I bet him buying his house.</div><div id="00:46:16.840" class="transcript_line"> So he co-founded the Gwent Community Relations Council.</div><div id="00:46:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So in 1984, he co-founded the Gwent Community Relations Council.</div><div id="00:46:24.840" class="transcript_line"> That was in Newport.</div><div id="00:46:26.840" class="transcript_line"> And he became an executive member.</div><div id="00:46:30.840" class="transcript_line"> And he was representative on the Home Safety Committee, with local authorities, with the police magistrates.</div><div id="00:46:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And obviously all the work that he did with the Jonya Mosque and the Halal Food and Goodness that he introduced in the health board,</div><div id="00:46:45.840" class="transcript_line"> which with dietary requirements that help you to recover better.</div><div id="00:46:50.840" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing people just sometimes wouldn&#039;t eat until they go to hospital.</div><div id="00:46:52.840" class="transcript_line"> There was nothing for them to eat, apart from mashed potato.</div><div id="00:46:57.840" class="transcript_line"> So that was a real turning point.</div><div id="00:47:01.840" class="transcript_line"> But he was a modest man, and many of his contributions were done silently.</div><div id="00:47:08.840" class="transcript_line"> So he helped a lot of people in the community.</div><div id="00:47:11.840" class="transcript_line"> It was only after his death that people would say, he helped bury my daughter, he helped me buy a car when my car wasn&#039;t, you know, he gave me money when I was struggling.</div><div id="00:47:21.840" class="transcript_line"> He helped so many people to the extent that when he died, some of his friends refused to ever travel the road he lived in again because he just wasn&#039;t there.</div><div id="00:47:30.840" class="transcript_line"> There were thousands and thousands of people at his funeral.</div><div id="00:47:34.840" class="transcript_line"> They had to close the streets.</div><div id="00:47:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And the funeral processions took place here in Dewsbury in London, and right across Pakistan as well.</div><div id="00:47:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s remembered by both young and old as an inspirational, happy and kind family man who always helped, mentored and guided so many people.</div><div id="00:47:56.840" class="transcript_line"> He was always there, never missed a funeral or a wedding.</div><div id="00:48:00.840" class="transcript_line"> He was always there at funerals, he always helped bury every person that died.</div><div id="00:48:03.840" class="transcript_line"> He never, ever missed it and treated everyone as his own.</div><div id="00:48:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Nothing was too much trouble.</div><div id="00:48:09.840" class="transcript_line"> And even to this day, both young and old, will say he was my friend.</div><div id="00:48:13.840" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s only last week I was at a funeral.</div><div id="00:48:16.840" class="transcript_line"> And quite a young person actually said, you know, he was my friend.</div><div id="00:48:22.840" class="transcript_line"> And even to this day, he&#039;s been 29 years on the 20th of August.</div><div id="00:48:28.840" class="transcript_line"> And even to this day, people still remember my father.</div><div id="00:48:32.840" class="transcript_line"> When I think about my upbringing and what I love, I think of all that despite all the struggles and the racism experienced, we were brought up in a loving family.</div><div id="00:48:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Advocates for togetherness and peace.</div><div id="00:48:47.840" class="transcript_line"> We were taught to respect and be inspired by all religions and cultures and create bonds.</div><div id="00:48:52.840" class="transcript_line"> I always remember the overabundance of food and being surrounded by lots of people.</div><div id="00:48:57.840" class="transcript_line"> And I think of the values of my faith and how my parents taught me those and taught me how to be honest, to love, be kind and generous.</div><div id="00:49:07.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re the values that our parents passed on to us.</div><div id="00:49:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Due to all his hard work and sacrifices and my mother&#039;s.</div><div id="00:49:16.840" class="transcript_line"> My dad said, we are here because they were there and one day they will tell us we don&#039;t belong.</div><div id="00:49:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Your children, dad, will say we are here, dad, because you were here and we will continue your legacy to help us belong.</div><div id="00:49:30.840" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:49:34.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, my next question is just going to be about Age Alive.</div><div id="00:49:38.840" class="transcript_line"> How did you get involved with Age Alive?</div><div id="00:49:41.840" class="transcript_line"> This is a funny story. You can tell the story.</div><div id="00:49:46.840" class="transcript_line"> Well, for a number of years, pre-COVID, we kept saying that we wanted to join something.</div><div id="00:49:51.840" class="transcript_line"> And all the groups seemed to be older and, you know, or they weren&#039;t sort of like because we both work, they just weren&#039;t suitable for the date times and dates of work and whatever.</div><div id="00:50:00.840" class="transcript_line"> So we kept saying to each other, it&#039;d be really nice to do something, a hobby of something, let&#039;s do something together.</div><div id="00:50:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so one of my friends said, why don&#039;t you join a group called Coffee and Laughs?</div><div id="00:50:14.840" class="transcript_line"> So we sort of said, oh, shall we sort of say, should we go along and just see what it&#039;s about?</div><div id="00:50:20.840" class="transcript_line"> So let&#039;s go and have a little chit chat with them and just see if we fit in or if it&#039;s something we want to do or don&#039;t want to do.</div><div id="00:50:26.840" class="transcript_line"> They were looking for donations and you had found loads for, they&#039;ve got a group there called Baeby Bundles.</div><div id="00:50:32.840" class="transcript_line"> And you had lots of like denny&#039;s and baby bottles.</div><div id="00:50:36.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;d gone somewhere and they had these things on offer and I bought them and thought, well, I need to donate them now.</div><div id="00:50:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Where do I donate them? And then I got in touch with Ingrid Wilson and she said, well, we run a Baeby Bundle.</div><div id="00:50:49.840" class="transcript_line"> Why don&#039;t you come along and bring them on the same day with you? And that&#039;s how it started.</div><div id="00:50:53.840" class="transcript_line"> So we went there and we just took to it. They took to us and we took to them.</div><div id="00:50:58.840" class="transcript_line"> It was really, it&#039;s really funny because a lot of them are older than us, even though everybody&#039;s over 50, I think now.</div><div id="00:51:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And it was like, I kept saying, I can&#039;t think of anything worse.</div><div id="00:51:09.840" class="transcript_line"> You know, that was my original. But when we actually got there, it was quite amazing.</div><div id="00:51:14.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they took to us and straight away it was just like, oh, yeah, they really were so welcoming.</div><div id="00:51:19.840" class="transcript_line"> And we thought, that&#039;s OK. This might be something that we want to do.</div><div id="00:51:23.840" class="transcript_line"> And then a few weeks later, we walked in and they were having a reshuffle within the group</div><div id="00:51:30.840" class="transcript_line"> because some of the sort of founders of it now want to pass things down, pass some responsibilities down.</div><div id="00:51:37.840" class="transcript_line"> So I walked in and they said, oh, there she is. And I said, oh, what have I done?</div><div id="00:51:41.840" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, you&#039;re going to be the new chair of Coffee and Laughs.</div><div id="00:51:44.840" class="transcript_line"> And I said, am I? And they all said, yeah, before you walked in, we all voted you in.</div><div id="00:51:49.840" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s got to be you. So I&#039;m now the chair of Coffee and Laughs and have been for quite a while now.</div><div id="00:51:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how we got involved in that group.</div><div id="00:51:56.840" class="transcript_line"> And that came alongside Age Alive because that&#039;s another group in Newport,</div><div id="00:52:00.840" class="transcript_line"> which most of the members of Age Alive are part of Coffee and Laughs as well.</div><div id="00:52:05.840" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s how we got involved with both of the groups.</div><div id="00:52:07.840" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve done many things with Age Alive and we&#039;ve invited to.</div><div id="00:52:10.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve sent some Windrush songs with them.</div><div id="00:52:13.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So that&#039;s how that came about.</div><div id="00:52:18.840" class="transcript_line"> What do you feel is the importance of projects like Age Alive and Coffee and Laughs?</div><div id="00:52:23.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just the coming together of people who would not necessarily have anything else to do.</div><div id="00:52:29.840" class="transcript_line"> It sort of takes away that loneliness.</div><div id="00:52:32.840" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the ladies there have lost partners.</div><div id="00:52:36.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not in family groups.</div><div id="00:52:38.840" class="transcript_line"> They are on their own. They&#039;re all from different backgrounds.</div><div id="00:52:41.840" class="transcript_line"> So it just brings them together and gives them a bit of a light to look towards things.</div><div id="00:52:48.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got events to look forward to.</div><div id="00:52:50.840" class="transcript_line"> They know they have to get up and get dressed and look nice and go out and meet other people.</div><div id="00:52:56.840" class="transcript_line"> It gives them that sort of life again, where they&#039;ve just been stuck at home doing nothing,</div><div id="00:53:01.840" class="transcript_line"> especially during Covid. That was awful.</div><div id="00:53:03.840" class="transcript_line"> So this is like their little getaway, which they wouldn&#039;t necessarily do or know how to do.</div><div id="00:53:10.840" class="transcript_line"> I think it teaches them as well a greater awareness.</div><div id="00:53:14.840" class="transcript_line"> It gives them more skills.</div><div id="00:53:16.840" class="transcript_line"> It gives them opportunities to try new activities that they perhaps hadn&#039;t grown up with trying.</div><div id="00:53:22.840" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t imagine what it would be like if someone said,</div><div id="00:53:25.840" class="transcript_line"> do you want to learn a bit of flower arrangement?</div><div id="00:53:28.840" class="transcript_line"> They would just do things you just didn&#039;t do.</div><div id="00:53:31.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like anything. If you don&#039;t try, you don&#039;t know if you enjoy it.</div><div id="00:53:35.840" class="transcript_line"> I think this is a way of them not only trying new things,</div><div id="00:53:40.840" class="transcript_line"> but having those skills and maybe then carrying that on if it&#039;s something that they enjoy doing.</div><div id="00:53:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And with these kinds of groups, unfortunately, I&#039;ve seen lots of groups over many years set up and fall.</div><div id="00:53:55.840" class="transcript_line"> The reason for that is because of the funding. People just don&#039;t have the funding to carry on with groups.</div><div id="00:54:03.840" class="transcript_line"> It gets people learning about each other&#039;s cultures.</div><div id="00:54:06.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about the confidence as well.</div><div id="00:54:08.840" class="transcript_line"> You see some of them who were very, very quiet in the beginning when I first started.</div><div id="00:54:13.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re so confident now. They&#039;re vocal. They&#039;ll say what they want to say.</div><div id="00:54:18.840" class="transcript_line"> They get involved in so much more.</div><div id="00:54:21.840" class="transcript_line"> We organize different sessions for them, whether it&#039;s yoga, whether it&#039;s making something,</div><div id="00:54:27.840" class="transcript_line"> whether it&#039;s all to do with health and well-being.</div><div id="00:54:30.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not shy to talk about their problems in front of other people.</div><div id="00:54:37.840" class="transcript_line"> They enjoy that, don&#039;t they, to get other people&#039;s take on what they might be going through.</div><div id="00:54:42.840" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re the only ones that are going through something.</div><div id="00:54:45.840" class="transcript_line"> There are others like them, and that&#039;s a big thing for them.</div><div id="00:54:48.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been a massive contribution to helping towards people&#039;s mental health and well-being.</div><div id="00:54:53.840" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:54:54.840" class="transcript_line"> But we can only go to the groups. We don&#039;t come to Age of Life every week.</div><div id="00:55:00.840" class="transcript_line"> We both work. We&#039;re both professionals. We both work.</div><div id="00:55:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Everything that we do voluntarily, we do in between.</div><div id="00:55:07.840" class="transcript_line"> We volunteer with lots of different things.</div><div id="00:55:09.840" class="transcript_line"> We volunteer. We do a lot of work in the mosques right across the Gwent, really.</div><div id="00:55:17.840" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been involved in setting up, looking at new mosques in areas where there aren&#039;t mosques,</div><div id="00:55:24.840" class="transcript_line"> open days for women, and lots of things.</div><div id="00:55:29.840" class="transcript_line"> So we get involved in things, but we do it.</div><div id="00:55:32.840" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re extra voluntary activities outside our normal everyday work.</div><div id="00:55:37.840" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you would like to add on record?</div><div id="00:55:41.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve done my questions.</div><div id="00:55:43.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to know what we do for a living, or does it really probably not matter?</div><div id="00:55:48.840" class="transcript_line"> You can do.</div><div id="00:55:50.840" class="transcript_line"> I just thought that&#039;s what our parents did. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:55:55.840" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a normal history project. I think modern day, current history is not the day.</div><div id="00:56:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Maybe in about 10, 15 years you can come back and do it.</div><div id="00:56:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Or if I&#039;m still here.</div><div id="00:56:08.840" class="transcript_line"> Next age, you can talk about where you&#039;ve gone to.</div><div id="00:56:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve got plenty there. That was exactly an hour.</div><div id="00:56:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Was it really?</div><div id="00:56:18.840" class="transcript_line"> One minute under an hour.</div><div id="00:56:20.840" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know what to want until we kind of guessed.</div><div id="00:56:23.840" class="transcript_line"> We were in the cast again. I&#039;m not really sure what this is about.</div><div id="00:56:26.840" class="transcript_line"> I said to her, not sure, and I said, funny enough, I typed something.</div></div></p>
