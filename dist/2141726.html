    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How is it?</div><div id="00:00:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Jill Jones talking to Phyllis Brown about Gwynfryn Village and Minera Quarry and</div><div id="00:00:19.880" class="transcript_line"> Gwynfryn School.</div><div id="00:00:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Hello, good afternoon Phyllis.</div><div id="00:00:22.880" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="00:00:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Now would you like to start this by giving your name and date of birth please.</div><div id="00:00:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, yes.</div><div id="00:00:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Well my name is Phyllis Brown and I am 93 years old.</div><div id="00:00:38.960" class="transcript_line"> I was born in 1926.</div><div id="00:00:41.960" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:42.960" class="transcript_line"> And I lived in Gwynfryn.</div><div id="00:00:45.360" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Gwynfryn.</div><div id="00:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:48.840" class="transcript_line"> And I was born in Estedford Cossages which are one of the long houses, the old long houses</div><div id="00:00:57.840" class="transcript_line"> that the people had.</div><div id="00:00:59.840" class="transcript_line"> The house itself belonged to the line works, to the quarry, people of the quarry which</div><div id="00:01:09.840" class="transcript_line"> my father rented.</div><div id="00:01:11.840" class="transcript_line"> And what else was there?</div><div id="00:01:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so that&#039;s up at the top of Gwynfryn Village and these days looks into the quarry</div><div id="00:01:24.320" class="transcript_line"> a little bit.</div><div id="00:01:25.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s at the head of a footpath that goes down into the workings.</div><div id="00:01:29.320" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:01:30.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:31.320" class="transcript_line"> I can remember living there of course and going down that little track that you&#039;re</div><div id="00:01:36.320" class="transcript_line"> talking about down to the village because my father worked in the quarry.</div><div id="00:01:41.800" class="transcript_line"> It was very hard work because at the time the money was very poor because he only had</div><div id="00:01:49.800" class="transcript_line"> – he didn&#039;t earn more than £2 a week while he was working.</div><div id="00:01:57.800" class="transcript_line"> And yes, he went down that path and we were sent down with tea for him when he was working.</div><div id="00:02:08.280" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s just the part that I remember going down to the quarry itself.</div><div id="00:02:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:16.280" class="transcript_line"> The little cottage we had of course had no electricity so we had to go out through the</div><div id="00:02:26.280" class="transcript_line"> gate and across the moors to carry water.</div><div id="00:02:30.760" class="transcript_line"> We also had rainwater stored and we had to go all the way to the village, to Gwynfryn</div><div id="00:02:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Village to buy goods, to buy food.</div><div id="00:02:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so there was – I remember a post office in Gwynfryn Village.</div><div id="00:02:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that was in the one little store that was there.</div><div id="00:02:55.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, the Pentra.</div><div id="00:02:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> There was another shop at the top of Bryn Maddock Road.</div><div id="00:03:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Ah yes, that&#039;s right, Sills Shop.</div><div id="00:03:07.240" class="transcript_line"> That would be quite a long way to walk.</div><div id="00:03:12.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, quite a way.</div><div id="00:03:14.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you lived in Stadford it would be.</div><div id="00:03:18.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a good mile.</div><div id="00:03:20.240" class="transcript_line"> Because you&#039;ve got to remember the extra walk up there.</div><div id="00:03:23.240" class="transcript_line"> True.</div><div id="00:03:24.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:25.720" class="transcript_line"> So, did you go to school in Gwynfryn?</div><div id="00:03:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I went to school in Gwynfryn.</div><div id="00:03:29.720" class="transcript_line"> We went down through the village and over Pennwar Hill down to the bottom where the</div><div id="00:03:38.720" class="transcript_line"> school was located.</div><div id="00:03:40.720" class="transcript_line"> It was one building, one open space which was divided into three classrooms with sort</div><div id="00:03:50.720" class="transcript_line"> of petitions and so on.</div><div id="00:03:55.200" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, yes.</div><div id="00:03:56.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was quite good.</div><div id="00:03:58.200" class="transcript_line"> I remember being there.</div><div id="00:04:00.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:01.200" class="transcript_line"> And then I went from there down to the grammar school at age 11, you know, usual times.</div><div id="00:04:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, so you went to Grove Park, did you?</div><div id="00:04:14.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so I went to Grove Park and eventually I did train to teach.</div><div id="00:04:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:25.680" class="transcript_line"> I went to all sorts of small schools around in what was then Denbighshire, still is Denbighshire</div><div id="00:04:32.680" class="transcript_line"> I think.</div><div id="00:04:34.680" class="transcript_line"> But I did stay in Gwynfryn for a while.</div><div id="00:04:39.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember the children there.</div><div id="00:04:41.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:43.160" class="transcript_line"> I went to all sorts of little schools around the old Denbighshire which was interesting</div><div id="00:04:53.160" class="transcript_line"> really.</div><div id="00:04:54.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:55.160" class="transcript_line"> But quite a way to travel every day.</div><div id="00:04:58.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:05:00.160" class="transcript_line"> So when you travelled to the other schools it was with the local bus services.</div><div id="00:05:06.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the local bus services, yes.</div><div id="00:05:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so Edward&#039;s buses went all the way up to Rithyn and most of the schools I went to</div><div id="00:05:14.640" class="transcript_line"> were within reach of Rithyn or somehow or other else I had to get another bus from there,</div><div id="00:05:20.640" class="transcript_line"> you know, a bit further.</div><div id="00:05:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:05:23.640" class="transcript_line"> That sounds very interesting.</div><div id="00:05:25.640" class="transcript_line"> Well.</div><div id="00:05:26.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:27.640" class="transcript_line"> So while I think about it, was your first language Welsh language?</div><div id="00:05:36.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my first language is Welsh.</div><div id="00:05:41.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Because the Gwynfryn School was actually built as a Welsh school.</div><div id="00:05:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:48.120" class="transcript_line"> It was known as the Council, Minera Council School.</div><div id="00:05:53.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s correct.</div><div id="00:05:54.120" class="transcript_line"> As opposed to Minera Church School down the road which was all English.</div><div id="00:05:58.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:05:59.120" class="transcript_line"> And yes, that&#039;s why they did, my mother went to that school and of course she had more</div><div id="00:06:07.600" class="transcript_line"> English, she was taught more English than Welsh really.</div><div id="00:06:10.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:11.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:12.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:13.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:14.600" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother was, my other grandmother, not my Roger&#039;s grandmother, my other grandmother</div><div id="00:06:19.600" class="transcript_line"> was appointed the first caretaker cleaner of that school at the princely sum of £12</div><div id="00:06:27.600" class="transcript_line"> I think a year.</div><div id="00:06:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:06:30.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a beautiful letter.</div><div id="00:06:33.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:34.600" class="transcript_line"> A beautiful letter, yes.</div><div id="00:06:37.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so an official letter of appointment.</div><div id="00:06:40.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:41.080" class="transcript_line"> That sounds really good.</div><div id="00:06:43.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very good.</div><div id="00:06:44.080" class="transcript_line"> I thought you&#039;d be interested in that letter.</div><div id="00:06:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that sounds good.</div><div id="00:06:50.080" class="transcript_line"> So, how long were you teaching then, Phyllis?</div><div id="00:06:54.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well I did my 40 years altogether.</div><div id="00:06:57.080" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the requisite amount you&#039;re expected to work.</div><div id="00:07:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it is.</div><div id="00:07:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:08.560" class="transcript_line"> So, and moving around you&#039;d meet a lot of people.</div><div id="00:07:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you do.</div><div id="00:07:13.560" class="transcript_line"> You do see all sorts of people.</div><div id="00:07:15.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s strange, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:17.560" class="transcript_line"> I ended up in Brumbagh School eventually after many years and then I was lucky enough to</div><div id="00:07:25.560" class="transcript_line"> be appointed head in Brintay.</div><div id="00:07:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:07:29.560" class="transcript_line"> So I was there for about, oh I don&#039;t know how many years now, 17 I think.</div><div id="00:07:35.040" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a long time.</div><div id="00:07:37.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s a long time, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:07:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:40.040" class="transcript_line"> But at least it was a permanent position.</div><div id="00:07:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, which previously they were a bit ad hoc, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:07:50.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:07:52.040" class="transcript_line"> I remember you teaching in Gwynfren School.</div><div id="00:07:54.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:07:56.040" class="transcript_line"> I was there for quite a while.</div><div id="00:07:58.040" class="transcript_line"> I was there for a number of years and I went away and I came back, I think.</div><div id="00:08:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:08:04.520" class="transcript_line"> I was there on two separate occasions, I know, yes.</div><div id="00:08:07.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so that would account for everybody&#039;s...</div><div id="00:08:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t ask me for dates now because I&#039;ve got one.</div><div id="00:08:13.520" class="transcript_line"> No, I remember you being in Gwynfren School when my family moved in the village and my</div><div id="00:08:20.520" class="transcript_line"> sister was in your class.</div><div id="00:08:22.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:08:23.520" class="transcript_line"> And she remembers you very well.</div><div id="00:08:25.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, so you were saying that your father worked in Minner, Lyme, Porran.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, his father had worked there before him.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s what I was going to inquire.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Edward Rogers was my grandfather and he&#039;d married in 1870, I think that&#039;s the date.</div><div id="00:08:57.480" class="transcript_line"> He came to Gwynfren but of course it was known in those days as...</div><div id="00:09:03.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear, isn&#039;t it awful?</div><div id="00:09:08.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was certainly not Gwynfren.</div><div id="00:09:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, they hadn&#039;t labelled it as Gwynfren then.</div><div id="00:09:13.480" class="transcript_line"> It was Minnera...</div><div id="00:09:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it would be Pentribice.</div><div id="00:09:17.480" class="transcript_line"> Pentribice was known locally but officially it was Minnera Mountain, I think.</div><div id="00:09:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Minnera Mountain or something like that.</div><div id="00:09:28.960" class="transcript_line"> So at that time, did your grandfather, do you know if he...</div><div id="00:09:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Well, he would work via St Edward&#039;s side of the quarry, yes?</div><div id="00:09:39.960" class="transcript_line"> No, he lived in the Minnera village, must have been going for...</div><div id="00:09:45.960" class="transcript_line"> because he was in one of the cottages on the village.</div><div id="00:09:49.960" class="transcript_line"> In the village?</div><div id="00:09:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so he was...</div><div id="00:09:53.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d always lived in the village itself.</div><div id="00:09:56.440" class="transcript_line"> So he would walk to work and it would be Minnera Lime Company.</div><div id="00:10:00.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes, he worked at Minnera Lime Company, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:10:03.440" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what his job was or anything but...</div><div id="00:10:10.440" class="transcript_line"> My father followed him when he was ready to leave school and he worked there as well.</div><div id="00:10:18.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:19.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:10:20.920" class="transcript_line"> So it was a bit...</div><div id="00:10:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Yes, hard work but there was nothing else.</div><div id="00:10:27.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, there would only have been mining which wasn&#039;t...</div><div id="00:10:31.920" class="transcript_line"> there weren&#039;t an awful lot around Gwynryn, you see.</div><div id="00:10:34.920" class="transcript_line"> They were further out.</div><div id="00:10:36.920" class="transcript_line"> And that was no picnic, just going down the mine there.</div><div id="00:10:41.920" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:10:42.920" class="transcript_line"> It was dangerous as well as anything else.</div><div id="00:10:49.400" class="transcript_line"> And there were some lead quarries there as well.</div><div id="00:10:54.400" class="transcript_line"> All sorts of quarries I think up on the mountain.</div><div id="00:10:57.400" class="transcript_line"> But the biggest one that came I think was the Lime quarry when that opened.</div><div id="00:11:03.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got dates.</div><div id="00:11:05.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:09.400" class="transcript_line"> All I know is that we used to go down the path that you were talking about</div><div id="00:11:14.880" class="transcript_line"> with some tea, cold tea for my dad when it was very hot, you know, when the weather was very hot.</div><div id="00:11:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:22.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only thing I remember.</div><div id="00:11:24.880" class="transcript_line"> For the break times.</div><div id="00:11:26.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:27.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:28.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:29.880" class="transcript_line"> And I can just remember the alarms that were set off.</div><div id="00:11:36.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:11:38.360" class="transcript_line"> When they were ready to bring down the rocks.</div><div id="00:11:47.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:48.360" class="transcript_line"> But for a long time they worked all by hand.</div><div id="00:11:51.360" class="transcript_line"> And in much later years they had lorries and equipment that I suppose to move it.</div><div id="00:11:58.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:11:59.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:00.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so you remember the railway train coming into the...</div><div id="00:12:03.840" class="transcript_line"> I remember the railway train coming as it came along the lower end of the Limeworks village,</div><div id="00:12:14.840" class="transcript_line"> do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:12:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:16.840" class="transcript_line"> The village itself.</div><div id="00:12:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, alongside Nice Funlin Road.</div><div id="00:12:18.840" class="transcript_line"> Nice Funlin, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:12:19.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Now in the earth.</div><div id="00:12:21.840" class="transcript_line"> And we used to go to an ant mine down there in that little village.</div><div id="00:12:30.320" class="transcript_line"> And we were able to see the train coming along.</div><div id="00:12:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:34.320" class="transcript_line"> And going back again.</div><div id="00:12:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:37.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:38.320" class="transcript_line"> So that was quite interesting for children I suppose.</div><div id="00:12:42.320" class="transcript_line"> But we were all never to go beyond the gates.</div><div id="00:12:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:12:48.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:50.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:12:51.320" class="transcript_line"> So, where are we now?</div><div id="00:12:56.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re doing very nicely, Phyllis.</div><div id="00:12:59.800" class="transcript_line"> So, would you like to show me a couple of your photographs?</div><div id="00:13:06.800" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:13:07.800" class="transcript_line"> And this one is of the cottage, isn&#039;t it, where we lived?</div><div id="00:13:13.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:13:14.800" class="transcript_line"> It was only a one room cottage and this was next door.</div><div id="00:13:18.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another one, there&#039;s another photograph which may in some ways be better.</div><div id="00:13:24.800" class="transcript_line"> But of course if I can find it, it&#039;s another thing.</div><div id="00:13:29.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, here it is.</div><div id="00:13:30.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, that&#039;s the letter.</div><div id="00:13:31.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the letter.</div><div id="00:13:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, about my grandmother&#039;s appointment.</div><div id="00:13:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:13:36.280" class="transcript_line"> I tried to...</div><div id="00:13:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, to mark things out for me.</div><div id="00:13:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, to mark things off, you see.</div><div id="00:13:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:13:41.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s the one that&#039;s 12... how many pounds?</div><div id="00:13:46.280" class="transcript_line"> 12 pounds a year.</div><div id="00:13:49.280" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:13:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Mind you, she was glad to have it because she was a widow and she used to take her two</div><div id="00:13:56.760" class="transcript_line"> little ones, six and four year old, with her to school in the morning to clean everywhere</div><div id="00:14:04.760" class="transcript_line"> and set the fires off because they had fires then.</div><div id="00:14:09.760" class="transcript_line"> When I was there they just had stoves, you know.</div><div id="00:14:12.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, the enclosed stoves.</div><div id="00:14:15.760" class="transcript_line"> But in her day they were open fires.</div><div id="00:14:20.240" class="transcript_line"> So she had to go and take these two little toks with her and clean and set the fires</div><div id="00:14:28.240" class="transcript_line"> off.</div><div id="00:14:29.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Ready for nine o&#039;clock I suppose, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:32.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:33.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:34.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:14:35.240" class="transcript_line"> There is another one... oh this is it, I can see it hiding there.</div><div id="00:14:38.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the other... those are the other two pictures of the same place.</div><div id="00:14:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Of the...</div><div id="00:14:45.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so you get the better idea of it being a long house.</div><div id="00:14:48.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know which one you want or whether you want both, I don&#039;t know, but you can see</div><div id="00:14:52.720" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s the same...</div><div id="00:14:53.720" class="transcript_line"> The same same place.</div><div id="00:14:54.720" class="transcript_line"> It is the same cottage.</div><div id="00:14:55.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:56.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:57.720" class="transcript_line"> No electricity at all.</div><div id="00:14:59.720" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:15:00.720" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:15:01.720" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:15:02.720" class="transcript_line"> No water.</div><div id="00:15:03.720" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:15:04.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s hard to think.</div><div id="00:15:05.720" class="transcript_line"> Somebody told me electricity came to the village in 1938.</div><div id="00:15:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, probably.</div><div id="00:15:14.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we&#039;d moved by then, I think we were in the village.</div><div id="00:15:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:19.200" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:15:20.200" class="transcript_line"> And the sewage system came in 1970 something.</div><div id="00:15:27.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can imagine that.</div><div id="00:15:29.200" class="transcript_line"> But water was laid on.</div><div id="00:15:31.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:33.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:34.200" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:15:35.200" class="transcript_line"> Those are the... those two are the same as that one, you see.</div><div id="00:15:38.200" class="transcript_line"> So you can choose which ones you want, if you want either of them or any of them.</div><div id="00:15:43.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, oh we could.</div><div id="00:15:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Now, have I got some more in here now?</div><div id="00:15:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was my grandmother.</div><div id="00:15:55.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s your grandmother.</div><div id="00:15:56.680" class="transcript_line"> The lady who... this letter was sent to my mother&#039;s mother, you see.</div><div id="00:16:01.680" class="transcript_line"> The others was the Rogerses, yeah.</div><div id="00:16:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve got any more in there.</div><div id="00:16:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:10.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes, these look like...</div><div id="00:16:12.160" class="transcript_line"> These are rather...</div><div id="00:16:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Family albums.</div><div id="00:16:15.160" class="transcript_line"> Family albums, well of course they&#039;ve been put in, you know.</div><div id="00:16:18.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:19.160" class="transcript_line"> That was at Squidward School of...</div><div id="00:16:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:16:24.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:26.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m on that, I&#039;m there I think.</div><div id="00:16:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:30.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:31.160" class="transcript_line"> And then my brother&#039;s there.</div><div id="00:16:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:33.160" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:35.160" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I&#039;ve got there.</div><div id="00:16:37.160" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:16:38.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what there&#039;s anymore really, but I&#039;ll see what I&#039;ve got here.</div><div id="00:16:43.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:16:51.640" class="transcript_line"> No, I think...</div><div id="00:16:52.640" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got... it&#039;s all very well...</div><div id="00:16:55.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, everything has been put in, but it&#039;s not, you know, necessarily in the right order</div><div id="00:17:03.640" class="transcript_line"> now.</div><div id="00:17:04.640" class="transcript_line"> No, exactly what I want.</div><div id="00:17:07.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:17:08.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:17:09.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:17:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, that&#039;s just an outing we had to Southport I think.</div><div id="00:17:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:17:16.120" class="transcript_line"> That was, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:18.120" class="transcript_line"> That was a, what are you, chapel of course we walked every day.</div><div id="00:17:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:22.120" class="transcript_line"> My father insisted we went.</div><div id="00:17:25.120" class="transcript_line"> We walked from the Steadford, which was quite a walk in itself really, to the chapel.</div><div id="00:17:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:33.120" class="transcript_line"> And we went...</div><div id="00:17:36.600" class="transcript_line"> We attended the service in the morning and in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:17:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it was Sunday school and sometimes it would be, you know, at different times.</div><div id="00:17:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:49.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:50.600" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m afraid I didn&#039;t shine in any way with singing or anything like that.</div><div id="00:17:59.600" class="transcript_line"> I left that to other members of the family I think.</div><div id="00:18:03.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:18:06.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always best to let other people do their best.</div><div id="00:18:08.080" class="transcript_line"> Well.</div><div id="00:18:09.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:11.080" class="transcript_line"> If they feel comfortable that&#039;s it isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:18:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:13.080" class="transcript_line"> So I think that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got.</div><div id="00:18:16.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Well we&#039;ve done very nicely, Phyllis.</div><div id="00:18:19.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether I&#039;ve told you enough.</div><div id="00:18:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh I think so.</div><div id="00:18:23.080" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;ve done very, you&#039;ve told us a great deal.</div><div id="00:18:27.080" class="transcript_line"> And so thank you very much.</div><div id="00:18:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you&#039;re very welcome.</div><div id="00:18:30.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:18:31.080" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
