    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Going starting now. Hello, good afternoon. Hello, good afternoon.</div><div id="00:00:08.160" class="transcript_line"> Could you please tell us who you are and I&#039;m Kanti. My full name is Kanti Moinath</div><div id="00:00:15.360" class="transcript_line"> and I was a GP. I just retired recently. That&#039;s lovely. Now Dr. Nath, tell me, when</div><div id="00:00:27.600" class="transcript_line"> did you come to this country? I came to this country in 1973, 23rd of June. I remember.</div><div id="00:00:35.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite a way back now. Now tell me when did you first come to Cardiff or this area?</div><div id="00:00:41.480" class="transcript_line"> 1981, 10th of June. Excellent. And you know where I&#039;m heading. I&#039;m heading to the</div><div id="00:00:50.960" class="transcript_line"> Which was your first puja in Cardiff? In 1981 I moved to Cardiff and then obviously I met a lot</div><div id="00:01:00.840" class="transcript_line"> of people here, mainly in the Bengali community. Then we went to see the puja and it was held in</div><div id="00:01:10.240" class="transcript_line"> in Rubaina Church Hall and it was well attended by the community from the Cardiff. Excellent. So</div><div id="00:01:23.520" class="transcript_line"> that was 1981 Rubaina Church Hall. Excellent. And was that a proper five days puja? Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:01:30.640" class="transcript_line"> Since 1981, let me put this in different brackets. Now tell me what you have experienced through 1981</div><div id="00:01:42.400" class="transcript_line"> and 1985. Right, 1981 when they came there used to be two pujas. Two groups of Hindu community,</div><div id="00:01:57.880" class="transcript_line"> they are doing two pujas. And 1981 was the time when I attended that puja, it was discussed to</div><div id="00:02:08.640" class="transcript_line"> become together. Okay. And it was very seriously discussed in the sort of like a committee level</div><div id="00:02:17.200" class="transcript_line"> and it became together in 1982. Okay. And the name was given Wales Puja Committee. Okay. And the Wales</div><div id="00:02:29.400" class="transcript_line"> Puja Committee was recognized in 1982. Lovely. And was it in 1982 that it became a registered charity or was it a few years after?</div><div id="00:02:40.320" class="transcript_line"> 1982. Okay. Lovely. Now Dr. Nath, another thing. Since you have been involved with the puja since 1981,</div><div id="00:02:52.280" class="transcript_line"> what has your role been over the years? Have you been involved actively with the puja committee?</div><div id="00:02:57.720" class="transcript_line"> Have you been doing various chores with the puja committee? Yes. Gradually I was sucked into the Wales</div><div id="00:03:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Puja Committee and started becoming an active member and doing lots of things like, you know,</div><div id="00:03:16.080" class="transcript_line"> going to like as any other committee, as well as we were involved in small little jobs like cooking and,</div><div id="00:03:25.680" class="transcript_line"> you know, the arrangement of the stage and decorations and managing other things. As I understand,</div><div id="00:03:35.640" class="transcript_line"> you were also part of the management. You had you held certain roles in the community, like being the chairperson,</div><div id="00:03:42.760" class="transcript_line"> being the secretary. Yes. I was chairperson. I did the job of secretary. I was treasurer. And what else? I was</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> I was an active member in a way. Really? So that means there was, there has to be a form of election to get the results.</div><div id="00:04:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes. We always, every year we used to have an election and with the proper way as we do for the other elections.</div><div id="00:04:19.280" class="transcript_line"> And people, the members who had selected for the executive committee. Okay. And they were elected and</div><div id="00:04:26.680" class="transcript_line"> they used to do their job. When was the first big change that you noticed?</div><div id="00:04:36.200" class="transcript_line"> In which sense? You know, the overall function in the puja, creating Durga, you know, participating</div><div id="00:04:43.720" class="transcript_line"> in a big way, almost nationally. I think we were known nationally when we started making our first</div><div id="00:04:58.440" class="transcript_line"> Durga project or Durga image with two artists from India came. And then it was known to quite a lot of</div><div id="00:05:12.760" class="transcript_line"> people and the committees all over UK. Were there other things you did to put forward or present</div><div id="00:05:22.120" class="transcript_line"> WPC into the image of the normal people of Cardiff or South Wales?</div><div id="00:05:30.360" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think we participated in London in a function which was organized by the Alandavajar</div><div id="00:05:42.920" class="transcript_line"> and we had a sort of a couple of items performed by the Wales Puja Committee members.</div><div id="00:05:56.120" class="transcript_line"> All right. That&#039;s interesting. But I thought I&#039;ve heard that you people participated in</div><div id="00:06:03.720" class="transcript_line"> functions to involve the people of Wales, like certain mailers.</div><div id="00:06:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we did three mailers since the 1990s. Dr. Nath, what is a mailer? Mailer is a sort of like a</div><div id="00:06:23.960" class="transcript_line"> we arrange it for a day. It&#039;s for the general public. With all the Indian culture is shown</div><div id="00:06:32.600" class="transcript_line"> and the food and dance and dramas and all the shops and people are all invited and it was a free</div><div id="00:06:41.160" class="transcript_line"> entrance and people came in. They enjoyed the food, they enjoyed the cultural functions and</div><div id="00:06:48.600" class="transcript_line"> it was a very successful. Lovely. Do you think the profile of Wales Puja Committee has grown over the</div><div id="00:06:54.040" class="transcript_line"> years? Yes, yes it has. Do you have a permanent place where you do your functions?</div><div id="00:07:00.520" class="transcript_line"> We haven&#039;t got a permanent place of our own. Can I interrupt here? Listen, Dr. Nath, why since</div><div id="00:07:10.680" class="transcript_line"> this function, this committee has been growing over the years since the early 80s, why haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:07:16.520" class="transcript_line"> you got a place of your own? It&#039;s very difficult to answer that because it involves funding.</div><div id="00:07:26.520" class="transcript_line"> It involves funding. It needs more manpower and mainly the funding was the reason for that.</div><div id="00:07:36.920" class="transcript_line"> And if we get funding in future, probably we&#039;ll have our own place. Would you think you&#039;ll be able</div><div id="00:07:43.640" class="transcript_line"> to sustain a place of your own? Yes, we can. Okay. Because we are capable people. Lovely. Good.</div><div id="00:07:51.880" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much, Dr. Nath. Thank you.</div></div></p>
