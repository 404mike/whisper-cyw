    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can do if you want.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so today is April the 5th, 2023.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is part of StatPoll&#039;s oral history project.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Joining me today, so I&#039;m Julian Rollins, the tutor at StatPoll.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a couple of students here.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So Richard is joining me, Richard Burns joining me with the questions.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And our interviewee for today is Hannah.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Hi.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Hannah Marshall.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Who lives in StatPoll and also comes here and works with us here at StatPoll Allgarden.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think my first question for you Hannah is how long have you lived in StatPoll?</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> All my life.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, literally all my life.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So you were born here.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was born here.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I was born in Stackpole.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s your earliest memory of StatPoll Allgarden then?</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> My earliest memory?</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It must be about seven years ago where me and my mum and my stepdad would come down</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> here for a cup of coffee and tea and just have a walk around the all gardens and then</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> the woods.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re a bit away from the village here, aren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> How long does it take you to walk into the village?</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> To walk from here to the village it will take me about 30 minutes.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s about three mile.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it?</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so we&#039;re quite separated from the village but it&#039;s kind of somewhere that you could</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> come and, you&#039;ve got a dog, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Walk the dog.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He can&#039;t do any more runs like that, I used to.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you used to come here then, you&#039;d come and walk around, you&#039;d go to the cafe</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and stuff.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How come you then ended up coming here to help with the gardening then?</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess it&#039;s always something I&#039;ve always been interested in, gardening.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But like I&#039;d just finished college and I didn&#039;t know what to do and mum said why don&#039;t you</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> go down the wall gardens for a bit and have a do it there.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s your mum&#039;s idea.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So volunteering then and doing a bit of college work as well.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So how old were you then?</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I must have been 16, 18, around that.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So how old are you now?</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So a few years.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And has much changed then during the time you&#039;ve been here?</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, a lot has changed.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> A lot.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean all the plots used to be with a fish pond whiz and then yeah, everything&#039;s just</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> changed.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re growing, you&#039;re doing gardening as part of the team that look after the whole</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> place.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you&#039;re also growing stuff on individual plots.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you grow on your plots?</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got spinach in, I&#039;ve got lavender, I&#039;ve got two roses and then sometimes I grow carrots,</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> leeks, onions and maybe beetroot this year.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Lots of different things.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So when you first came here then Hannah, what were your kind of, what was your level of</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> gardening knowledge, gardening understanding then?</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Had you done a bit before?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I did.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I potted around in the garden at home and I had quite a big understanding of what gardening</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> was and what to do.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it&#039;s grown since then.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve learned more.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you think you get from gardening then?</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Just exercise, new knowledge again and just new knowledge really.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And just meeting new people and friends, making friends.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s quite a, yeah, it&#039;s quite a sociable thing here, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Richard, she wants a few questions.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, I&#039;ve got a question for you, Hannah.</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose the question is, what is your favourite part about Datspo Gardens altogether?</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s just being out and making friends and just having a social and obviously the</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> gardening as well.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoy that.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Sounds really good.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, do you have a particular favourite time of year at all?</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I think my favourite time of year is autumn because it&#039;s not too hot and it&#039;s not too</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> cold.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I hate the heat.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I actually agree with that statement.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there a favourite job like doing in the gardens?</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I quite like pruning.</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Pruning the fruit bushes and anything physical.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I love doing like digging.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll do anything that needs heavy needs moving, I&#039;ll do it.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Fair enough.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, say for example, well like today obviously it&#039;s raining isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So do you have a particular favourite job that you like to do inside?</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I quite like sanding or potting on.</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I really enjoy them too.</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So you mentioned sanding for the benefit of the recording then.</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a bit of woodwork goes on on rainy days in one of the polytunnels isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> What are you making?</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Bird boxes and bird feeders I think are the main ones and bug boxes.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s all gardening related stuff and then it&#039;s sold in the shop isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So you mentioned that it&#039;s a sociable thing that you&#039;ve got a group of people that you work with,</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> which is nice isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite a tight-knit group.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:02.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve also got visitors coming in through the summer, get more of them during the summer.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel about that?</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have much interaction?</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they&#039;ll come up and ask about the yacchiums, the really tall dinosaur plants as I call them.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I sometimes talk to them if they&#039;re asking what I&#039;m up to and how am I coping with the heat and everything.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So it gives them a bit of an extra, more information about the place doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes I&#039;ll get asked directions as well.</div><div id="00:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like where&#039;s the lily pond?</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> About an hour maybe, a couple of minute walk.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Or the other one is where&#039;s the big country house?</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah that&#039;s the main one.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So what about your neighbours and stuff then? Is this somewhere that they use much?</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they do. During the summer I do see some of them come down here in the summer and have a walk around.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So somewhere just for a bit of a walk?</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Little kids, dogs, that sort of thing?</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, mainly dogs.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course we&#039;ve got the woods just over there as well so it&#039;s quite a good place to park.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the fact that we don&#039;t charge for parking helps as well.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it does help.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So Richard asked you about the favourite job.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking, can you sort of talk us through like a normal day?</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> What time you get here? What do you do first?</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I get here about 10 maybe, depending if we&#039;re running a bit late or whatever.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;ll have a little morning break and then if it&#039;s nice out we&#039;ll go outside,</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> either do some hoeing, some weeding on our veg pots in the summer or even watering or whatever we need to do.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And if it&#039;s raining we&#039;ll either go in the top polytunnel and do some woodworking there,</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> like making bug boxes and sanding and painting or we&#039;ll go in the greenhouse and put on some plants.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice in those polytunnels on a rainy day in the winter.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it almost feels like the summer.</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So we did ask you about what benefits you think you get from it.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s about being outside and getting fresh air and exercise.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s also about being part of a sort of a team, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you prefer, so people are very much given the chance to sort of choose their way of working,</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> do you prefer to be like part of a little team doing weeding or would you rather be off doing something on your own and then come together?</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> It depends what the job is. If it&#039;s something that I can do on my own, I&#039;ll do it on my own.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But if I like, if I want to do a team job, I&#039;ll go on a team job and do it with people.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Just depends.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And the veg you grow then, we&#039;ve spoken about this in the college work recently, haven&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going to ask you the same question again. What of the stuff that you grow then, what do you do with it?</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I will take it home and mum will either cook it or make some like food out of, make a meal out of it or whatnot.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that important to you, the fact that there&#039;s like a product from the gardening or would you be happy just to do like flowers and stuff?</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t mind doing both. I like, I quite like the both side. I like my flowers more as well as the veg.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So if we did away, you know, if they did away with the veg growing altogether and just said the job is to keep the place looking good, you&#039;d be happy?</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be quite happy, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Which is, I mean, as you go around, you mentioned the ecuums.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> As you go around, which is the bit, is there a corner that you particularly like?</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Over in, I do like the sensory garden because in the summer it&#039;s really shaded.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that over by the crockery?</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And up past the gravel circle, it&#039;s really shaded by there so it&#039;s nice and quite cool.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you got any other questions? You&#039;ve covered quite a lot of country, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t think about any.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I was tempted to ask, although it&#039;s a bit like it because it&#039;s my little part of the world, to ask about the college work.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So you do, all the time you&#039;ve been here, you&#039;ve been doing some sort of college courses.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you find that?</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I quite enjoy them actually. It&#039;s just like learning something new.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I think the other last year, I think we made clay pots and I&#039;ve never ever worked with clay before.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s just little bits like that I like learning about.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It adds a bit of variety to the day, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It breaks it up a bit.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Great. Is there anything else you think that we haven&#039;t asked you about?</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You want to tell posterity, you want to tell people in the future, straight forward a hundred years.</div><div id="00:11:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh God, I can&#039;t literally think of anything.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Great. Thanks for your time.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been really useful.</div></div></p>
