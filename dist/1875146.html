I&#039;m here with</div><div id="00:00:18.720" class="transcript_line"> Vanessa Cyril. Can you say your full name for me?</div><div id="00:00:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Vanessa Camilla Cyril.

And what were their professions? What did they do?</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> My father worked on the big ships and my mother done sewing, she done cooking,</div><div id="00:00:42.880" class="transcript_line"> she done everything what to do in the Caribbean. But she used to do a lot of embroidery as well.</div><div id="00:00:48.400" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, all sorts of stuff.</div><div id="00:00:52.160" class="transcript_line"> Did you have siblings?</div><div id="00:00:54.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:54.880" class="transcript_line"> How many?</div><div id="00:00:55.780" class="transcript_line"> Three brothers and three sisters, but I lost a brother when he was age 11. And I lost a sister,</div><div id="00:01:07.460" class="transcript_line"> she was only a baby. What I&#039;d say is called death now that I know.</div><div id="00:01:12.660" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh. That must have been really traumatic for your mother.</div><div id="00:01:15.460" class="transcript_line"> I think my brother may have been thinking of it autistic.</div><div id="00:01:19.140" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:01:19.460" class="transcript_line"> And you know, they didn&#039;t diagnose it then.</div><div id="00:01:21.540" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:22.100" class="transcript_line"> So I lost Elvin to that nice boy.</div><div id="00:01:25.780" class="transcript_line"> 11 as well.</div><div id="00:01:26.580" class="transcript_line"> So he was 11 and my sister was just, I think it was a cut death. My mother got up one morning and</div><div id="00:01:32.340" class="transcript_line"> she was dead.</div><div id="00:01:34.420" class="transcript_line"> Oh my gosh. And where are you in the line? Are you first, second?</div><div id="00:01:37.780" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m the second. My brother&#039;s first, I&#039;m the second. I&#039;ve got another sister after me.</div><div id="00:01:44.500" class="transcript_line"> And then Elvin, one died, and then Marcella, and Ursula, the makeup.</div><div id="00:01:52.340" class="transcript_line"> Okay. So you&#039;re the first girl.</div><div id="00:01:54.260" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:54.900" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember growing up in St. Louis?</div><div id="00:01:56.820" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes. Growing up, well, I think it was quite happy.</div><div id="00:02:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Growing up, you know what it&#039;s like in the Caribbean.</div><div id="00:02:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Aunties and uncles and extended families and so everybody was your cousins.</div><div id="00:02:16.420" class="transcript_line"> And I say sort of waffling in the rain, going up to the country when you have holidays.</div><div id="00:02:25.060" class="transcript_line"> Seeing people digging yams and picking the breadfruit and they&#039;re watching the bats on their</div><div id="00:02:31.380" class="transcript_line"> cashew nuts. There&#039;s a fruit under the cashew nut. Cashew nut on top of this fruit and watching the</div><div id="00:02:37.860" class="transcript_line"> bats and all the mango trees and running up looking the river for crayfish. So it was quite</div><div id="00:02:44.900" class="transcript_line"> happy. And we didn&#039;t live far from the sea actually. We could go out about, I would say, 10</div><div id="00:02:52.740" class="transcript_line"> minutes and you&#039;d be watching the ships come in and there&#039;d be lots of tourists as well.</div><div id="00:03:01.860" class="transcript_line"> And not far from the beach, the beach would take you about half an hour because you all</div><div id="00:03:06.340" class="transcript_line"> had to walk then. We&#039;d have all these like buses and things. So we&#039;d walk through shortcuts at this</div><div id="00:03:11.220" class="transcript_line"> chap. I think his father may have been a slave master and he had this big white house on a hill.</div><div id="00:03:17.700" class="transcript_line"> Nothing around it but lots of trees, mango trees, gore, things. So we&#039;d walk past there,</div><div id="00:03:23.460" class="transcript_line"> a little shortcut where it was really trees on either side and quite creepy.</div><div id="00:03:27.860" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go on the beach and sometimes watching the aeroplane coming in and it was not coming across.</div><div id="00:03:36.580" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;d go on the beach and you&#039;d have barbecues like they put stones on and have something.</div><div id="00:03:42.660" class="transcript_line"> Frankly I didn&#039;t swim because I remember starting to swim and then you were quite</div><div id="00:03:46.980" class="transcript_line"> cruel to sort of duck you in on that. You know children play.</div><div id="00:03:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Was that your siblings or your friends?</div><div id="00:03:51.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, friends and siblings and Esther swam along, my sister, but I didn&#039;t like the thought of them</div><div id="00:03:58.500" class="transcript_line"> sort of ducking you to see if you can get up.</div><div id="00:04:02.100" class="transcript_line"> And what year were you born?</div><div id="00:04:04.900" class="transcript_line"> In 43. So it&#039;s St Lucia. What was St Lucia like at that time around?</div><div id="00:04:12.020" class="transcript_line"> It was like then loads of children around you because people had six, seven, eight,</div><div id="00:04:20.580" class="transcript_line"> nine, how many children? And then you had what I can remember from going to school as a</div><div id="00:04:30.820" class="transcript_line"> sort of I would say five years old, four or five, I remember going to school with my brother holding</div><div id="00:04:36.020" class="transcript_line"> hands and the beginning my mother used to take us and after that we&#039;d walk through a big park</div><div id="00:04:41.780" class="transcript_line"> they call the gardens because the school was just overlooking it and we&#039;d walk through there</div><div id="00:04:46.260" class="transcript_line"> and we were told not to go on a merry-go-round which we would do after school as well.</div><div id="00:04:53.460" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d get into school. I remember the teachers making dresses and doing all these sorts of things.</div><div id="00:05:00.260" class="transcript_line"> We had to go a lot of handicraft there and on Christmas time we&#039;d do all the loops for the</div><div id="00:05:05.940" class="transcript_line"> decorations and all these things and I remember them doing this punch in a thing where,</div><div id="00:05:11.860" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what they call it now, it&#039;s like wool or cotton whatever you punch for a thing</div><div id="00:05:17.380" class="transcript_line"> and you can make like horses and animals and roses on this material. Lots and lots of good</div><div id="00:05:22.740" class="transcript_line"> things I remember them doing. And also play we skip, we play tiki-taka. I don&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:05:32.580" class="transcript_line"> Tiki-taka, no.</div><div id="00:05:33.940" class="transcript_line"> Well the stones, you&#039;d have lovely stones, collect nice stones and it&#039;s on the ground</div><div id="00:05:38.100" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;d play it and then we&#039;d see who pick up. They&#039;d pick up the stones and it would go like that and</div><div id="00:05:46.340" class="transcript_line"> over there and try and pick up some more and see. Yes, it&#039;s like you throw it up and pick up more.</div><div id="00:05:53.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah tiki-taka and we skipped a lot. We got the big group from the mahogany tree, you know these</div><div id="00:06:00.500" class="transcript_line"> big groups that would be around the mahogany tree, we&#039;d go and look for that and cut it and</div><div id="00:06:05.460" class="transcript_line"> skip with that you know. A bit of time we&#039;d have rooms but it would scratch all your skin you know</div><div id="00:06:12.420" class="transcript_line"> and see you can skip better, you can go up, you can go down, you know so lovely time and in the</div><div id="00:06:18.340" class="transcript_line"> rain, running in the room when it&#039;s raining you know. We didn&#039;t know the rain water was good for</div><div id="00:06:22.500" class="transcript_line"> our skin you know and we did run in the rain and I remember what you washed your hair with it was</div><div id="00:06:29.220" class="transcript_line"> like the hibiscus leaves at times you&#039;d have your hair washed of that and then they&#039;d use their</div><div id="00:06:36.660" class="transcript_line"> aloes, not the aloes, the other flat one. What did Mekans call it? Single Bible? No,</div><div id="00:06:45.140" class="transcript_line"> the single Bible aloes. Anyway it was a flat one it hasn&#039;t got the um pickles on it and they use</div><div id="00:06:51.780" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s a family of the aloes and they use it and they scrape it and that condition your hair</div><div id="00:06:56.340" class="transcript_line"> with castor oil in it and yeah and um because I remember confirming my cousin Cecilia was so</div><div id="00:07:03.780" class="transcript_line"> talented and first time I had my hair pressed you know and um for my confirmation and you know</div><div id="00:07:12.260" class="transcript_line"> doing my hair and then putting it in like brown paper rolling it in brown paper and ready for my</div><div id="00:07:19.860" class="transcript_line"> confirmation and she crocheted I think she knitted all socks and crocheted my post she was very</div><div id="00:07:25.300" class="transcript_line"> talented my you know these socks up to here she really knitted them nicely you know um</div><div id="00:07:30.260" class="transcript_line"> what did I call it?

church choir so after choir practice we&#039;d walk around town a group of us</div><div id="00:11:15.380" class="transcript_line"> and go and look at the windows you know because I didn&#039;t realize St. Lucia was a place for a lot</div><div id="00:11:20.500" class="transcript_line"> of the small islands came to shop people from there because it had everything you know um</div><div id="00:11:26.740" class="transcript_line"> so we&#039;d go and look at all the shop windows because you always glass windows of stuff you</div><div id="00:11:30.580" class="transcript_line"> know advertising women dressed up in mannequin dress up in materials and clothes and</div><div id="00:11:37.860" class="transcript_line"> and then walk around with our friends and um then go home through

long wasted a black velcro on the long waist a little black</div><div id="00:12:03.060" class="transcript_line"> velcro we thought it was cat&#039;s whiskers I need a nice flat shoes in a band across</div><div id="00:12:11.140" class="transcript_line"> but apart from that my father didn&#039;t um I get hay fever oh gosh shoemaker as well</div><div id="00:12:18.980" class="transcript_line"> so sometimes you know he&#039;d make shoes and I thought I don&#039;t like it but you know I&#039;m so pleased</div><div id="00:12:27.060" class="transcript_line"> because I never had any problems with my foot you know if you have these cones or that you need</div><div id="00:12:31.220" class="transcript_line"> somebody for my foot that if I have to buy you should make shoes and that would cost me a fortune</div><div id="00:12:37.220" class="transcript_line"> but all the skills these people had or a ship was mostly going to Canada chilling that coming down</div><div id="00:12:44.020" class="transcript_line"> because it was a tourist ship um lady Nelson and um all around one of them anyhow there were two of</div><div id="00:12:52.100" class="transcript_line"> them and I&#039;d have to wait as soon as he&#039;s coming quickly to go and get the stuff because they</div><div id="00:12:56.660" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t spend much time like a day home and then they didn&#039;t give them much time out to work come</div><div id="00:13:02.420" class="transcript_line"> and visit home and he&#039;d bring me some lovely things you know they&#039;ve got a nice school bag</div><div id="00:13:08.900" class="transcript_line"> and plaid you know and lots of pens and things like that so yeah so um I would say my school days</div><div id="00:13:16.180" class="transcript_line"> were quite happy so travel was quite normal as well kind of moving between the islands and I</div><div id="00:13:22.180" class="transcript_line"> would go to um my aunt didn&#039;t left one of my aunts left to go to Marchenic to work and she worked for</div><div id="00:13:28.660" class="transcript_line"> the American Embassy as a cook there and I used to get lots of magazines as well um and so I&#039;d go</div><div id="00:13:36.180" class="transcript_line"> and spend time with uh travel on these little aeroplanes then spend time with my aunts so I had</div><div id="00:13:42.580" class="transcript_line"> to speak French not just K-all I had to speak proper French introduce me to all these people</div><div id="00:13:48.660" class="transcript_line"> and he&#039;d take me to pictures and so it was sort of confusing because he tried to speak English with</div><div id="00:13:53.860" class="transcript_line"> me I remember laughing at a young man tried to say the shoe black because in French you say</div><div id="00:13:59.620" class="transcript_line"> I always remember that joke he said</div><div id="00:14:16.980" class="transcript_line"> in English so um that was nice there because we&#039;d send to the shop deliberately to go and speak</div><div id="00:14:23.460" class="transcript_line"> a lot of them speak short as well but you wanted me to speak French by going and buy</div><div id="00:14:27.860" class="transcript_line"> um</div><div id="00:14:34.180" class="transcript_line"> and they kissed a lot there was a lot of kissing of the French people because they greet you for</div><div id="00:14:40.500" class="transcript_line"> kiss on either side there&#039;s only no I think over here they do it in Britain I mean the last few</div><div id="00:14:45.140" class="transcript_line"> years because you never used to you know and shake your hands and so and then they kept lots of</div><div id="00:14:51.780" class="transcript_line"> wine and

grandchildren</div><div id="00:16:34.420" class="transcript_line"> I started teenage dance I went to a teenage dance restaurant</div><div id="00:16:38.420" class="transcript_line"> I was lovely dressed for a combo by anybody</div><div id="00:16:44.660" class="transcript_line"> so um that was it and um Peter was sort of um imprinting and I worked for a little while</div><div id="00:16:53.140" class="transcript_line"> because I was waiting to go into nursing I was still young so I worked for a little while</div><div id="00:16:57.140" class="transcript_line"> through a chap while in a big shop I was doing the bookkeeping sometimes we even go around and</div><div id="00:17:01.540" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t have all these things that were the big ledgers and doing the bookkeeping</div><div id="00:17:06.500" class="transcript_line"> still laying each other to watch out I think they were quite prominent and his brother had</div><div id="00:17:12.260" class="transcript_line"> a lot of the supermarkets back home and I used to do that you know all the people a lot of the</div><div id="00:17:17.540" class="transcript_line"> people got to know them and um between that</div><div id="00:17:22.580" class="transcript_line"> and then my brother came over</div><div id="00:17:33.460" class="transcript_line"> no more aunt came over here in the 50s my husband was here before I think he came over the same as</div><div id="00:17:39.060" class="transcript_line"> the queen queen&#039;s coronation and an aunt came over and then my dad sent my brother over and then</div><div id="00:17:50.020" class="transcript_line"> Peter came then after and my sister came before me</div><div id="00:17:58.100" class="transcript_line"> because my mother said let her go up Esther was different King was quiet on the side</div><div id="00:18:04.740" class="transcript_line"> Esther was always in a scrape so she came up but she wouldn&#039;t stay in Newport my aunt thought oh</div><div id="00:18:11.460" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s here she left because my aunt then was older having children and she thought Esther had</div><div id="00:18:17.300" class="transcript_line"> invested it off to London which all her friends we did that&#039;s what we&#039;ve seen everything happening</div><div id="00:18:22.500" class="transcript_line"> in London you know dances and this and that whereas Newport we didn&#039;t know many people</div><div id="00:18:27.860" class="transcript_line"> we had lots of people from Jamaica but you know the islands that even though a lot of the things</div><div id="00:18:33.780" class="transcript_line"> we do the same but we&#039;re still this thing at the beginning I thought oh it&#039;s a little small island</div><div id="00:18:40.100" class="transcript_line"> small island they didn&#039;t and sometimes I thought it was a little bit derogatory</div><div id="00:18:44.740" class="transcript_line"> you know we had the same thing but it was always this small island people so</div><div id="00:18:52.420" class="transcript_line"> so it was just another family the Comptons and my aunt and I think Marion</div><div id="00:18:59.540" class="transcript_line"> about three or four other families from St. Lucia. So you always wanted to do nursing? Yes I wanted</div><div id="00:19:06.100" class="transcript_line"> to do teaching or nursing and you know very young they take you into the teaching profession there</div><div id="00:19:13.940" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re teaching and while you&#039;re teaching you&#039;re going to one college or</div><div id="00:19:17.540" class="transcript_line"> teachers college or after that you can just expand and you know there&#039;s a limit of how you can go</div><div id="00:19:24.740" class="transcript_line"> and then I always liked nursing I wanted to do nursing and I was a little bit young to go in and</div><div id="00:19:34.420" class="transcript_line"> when I sat the exam they said you know in the next 18 months or something I can come but then</div><div id="00:19:41.620" class="transcript_line"> after a while when my aunt was here she encouraged my mother so send her over you know she can do it</div><div id="00:19:47.780" class="transcript_line"> over here blah blah yeah people said oh you do it in England the certificate is good and you can</div><div id="00:19:52.740" class="transcript_line"> travel you can go anywhere so um I thought oh I&#039;ll come over here instead. And your boyfriend was</div><div id="00:20:02.180" class="transcript_line"> already here at the time? Yes. What were you expecting before you came? What did you think?</div><div id="00:20:07.860" class="transcript_line"> I just thought it was an adventure I just sort of somehow I&#039;m coming to Loon and whatever but um</div><div id="00:20:18.420" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know you know I just stand by the sea and see all this this this the sea and the sky meeting</div><div id="00:20:24.420" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s and I wonder what&#039;s behind that you know and um you know when people ask me I just</div><div id="00:20:30.580" class="transcript_line"> would ask them if I didn&#039;t think a little bit apprehensive because I thought I&#039;m leaving friends</div><div id="00:20:36.420" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m leaving friends you know but lots of my friends had come over here as well any of their</div><div id="00:20:40.900" class="transcript_line"> mothers were they sent to them more and those were teenagers come over and I just thought I&#039;m</div><div id="00:20:46.180" class="transcript_line"> coming over I&#039;m watching the nurse and I&#039;m you know looking forward to all of that so um. Was it</div><div id="00:20:50.580" class="transcript_line"> hard leaving your mum? It was hard leaving families you know crying and you know it was very hard</div><div id="00:20:58.660" class="transcript_line"> but I think when we&#039;re young yes you think it&#039;s so sad and it&#039;s so hard and leaving said Gloucester</div><div id="00:21:05.540" class="transcript_line"> you had all this carefree life you know and you went to church on Sundays you didn&#039;t have a big</div><div id="00:21:10.660" class="transcript_line"> coat on you so um yeah it was hard but at the same time I thought I&#039;m coming over my brothers</div><div id="00:21:28.740" class="transcript_line"> here my sister here so I had this nuclear family yes so I didn&#039;t think twice I just asked them</div><div id="00:21:36.740" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the journey? Yes I had on this big ship and I mean I was young and this lady said</div><div id="00:21:43.860" class="transcript_line"> to me I think she came home and she said oh I got Margaret I forgot her brother&#039;s name the two were</div><div id="00:21:50.340" class="transcript_line"> coming over couple years young and we could have been nice to look after them because they</div><div id="00:21:54.980" class="transcript_line"> were my dad. How old were you? I was just over 17 years old and their mum and dad were over here</div><div id="00:22:02.660" class="transcript_line"> so it wasn&#039;t unusual just as a problem happened now because wasn&#039;t it usual</div><div id="00:22:07.220" class="transcript_line"> you were coming over then a child of four or five you know they&#039;d give it to auntie to say bring</div><div id="00:22:12.820" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;d have the child on her passport so that&#039;s why a lot of the problem happened because</div><div id="00:22:16.740" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re still and somebody might have gone to live in Boomin and whatever when your passport gone</div><div id="00:22:21.220" class="transcript_line"> so you don&#039;t know where just you know although they are disembarked on cars I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s</div><div id="00:22:24.980" class="transcript_line"> right there but anyhow so Margaret and her brother so we shared the same cabin because her brother</div><div id="00:22:30.340" class="transcript_line"> might have been Lemo 12 and a couple of the young ladies from St Lucia so it was fine you know got</div><div id="00:22:39.780"

know he was from St Lucia and you</div><div id="00:22:59.780" class="transcript_line"> know people always say oh all of you all stay together and that because the ship had everybody</div><div id="00:23:04.100" class="transcript_line"> you know from the islands Grenada and then from Barcelona I thought I thought you went under the</div><div id="00:23:13.460" class="transcript_line"> Alps

id="00:25:03.540" class="transcript_line"> went around town at Marks and Spencer looking at stuff and all that and then as a first first</div><div id="00:25:09.220" class="transcript_line"> of the coal and me because it was still cold in April so um so you came in April yeah okay geez</div><div id="00:25:20.340" class="transcript_line"> is</div><div id="00:25:35.700" class="transcript_line"> so you were here um you had family here which was good and you had Peter here as well um and then</div><div id="00:25:42.580" class="transcript_line"> did you start immediately going into nursing or no what I did I went to look for a job as a secretary</div><div id="00:25:49.460" class="transcript_line"> and going to this place um they said the job was then everyone when I got there I think was some</div><div id="00:25:57.700" class="transcript_line"> little counter thing and they peeped and they said oh there was no job then do you want some water</div><div id="00:26:05.700"

think they changed it in cafe marbly just as a</div><div id="00:27:03.220" class="transcript_line"> observer you know um sort of going into nursing looking at that and then after I worked um</div><div id="00:27:11.940" class="transcript_line"> for a couple months before I went into this anyhow the new sin thing was they wanted me to</div><div id="00:27:16.900" class="transcript_line"> sit exam again so when I applied and I told her you know I done this and oh I don&#039;t know if you</div><div id="00:27:24.180" class="transcript_line"> could do the exam because what happened a lot of nurses

was</div><div id="00:34:21.860" class="transcript_line"> a celebration of different gifts for them you know because my aunt didn&#039;t believe in birthdays</div><div id="00:34:26.340" class="transcript_line"> not Christmas I didn&#039;t believe in Christmas so you just as do no Christmas thing you know</div><div id="00:34:33.460" class="transcript_line"> because um because I lived with her for a while and then imagine Christmas come come from the</div><div id="00:34:41.220" class="transcript_line"> caravan and she&#039;s so religious you know very very but I think she turned that way because</div><div id="00:34:48.180" class="transcript_line"> of the discrimination she faced so um yeah and then my journey into nursing I had the boys in</div><div id="00:34:58.980" class="transcript_line"> between you know going to the nursing I had um Trevor Nigel a couple years in between them</div><div id="00:35:06.100" class="transcript_line"> how old were you um when you had your first I was 22 okay and then had Trevor Nigel and Mark so</div><div id="00:35:17.060" class="transcript_line"> in between that during um nursing as well so then I carried on with my nursing career as well as</div><div id="00:35:27.460" class="transcript_line"> week nights when the children were small so I&#039;ll be there in the day you know all the sort of things</div><div id="00:35:32.820" class="transcript_line"> I had a week having them and um on holidays I&#039;d ask could I do um some people be a month for nights</div><div id="00:35:41.780" class="transcript_line"> or six weeks like can I do your six weeks and I do my month as well</div><div id="00:35:45.780" class="transcript_line"> and um so somebody would be there because Peter would shifts and someone would be there to help</div><div id="00:35:51.700" class="transcript_line"> them you know so it was hard very hard then at the beginning I didn&#039;t want to stay</div><div id="00:36:00.660" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to go back I thought I can&#039;t be staying here I&#039;d be caught it&#039;s cold you can&#039;t go to the</div><div id="00:36:07.140" class="transcript_line"> beaches you want the church if you didn&#039;t although you went to Church of England we&#039;re</div><div id="00:36:13.460" class="transcript_line"> Church of England people but then you got up in the morning it was nice and bright so you were</div><div id="00:36:17.700" class="transcript_line"> sat 10 o&#039;clock then you went to evening mass then you went Sunday school but it was so different</div><div id="00:36:23.700" class="transcript_line"> hey you know I think they still had the same I went to the Anglican church when I lived a little</div><div id="00:36:29.540" class="transcript_line"> further down from here at one time and there are people asking where did you learn the hymns</div><div id="00:36:36.100" class="transcript_line"> I thought I do belong to the Anglican church the bishop then was nice try to you know and</div><div id="00:36:42.020" class="transcript_line"> when the nuns knew Peter was Roman Catholic then a couple nuns came home and said oh we have to</div><div id="00:36:46.980" class="transcript_line"> question the church so um yeah so my experience in the beginning now I just wanted to go home and I</div><div id="00:36:56.340" class="transcript_line"> thought my goodness me you&#039;re supposed to be well educated people but little did I know our problem</div><div id="00:37:02.420" class="transcript_line"> was more educated than some of them you know and all the things you see all these people smell or</div><div id="00:37:09.300" class="transcript_line"> something and I think first thing I&#039;d see on the bus I thought we have to do that the girls have</div><div id="00:37:15.300" class="transcript_line"> their makeup spit on their hand and then when they&#039;re chewing through their dumb yoke put it in their mouth</div><div id="00:37:23.380" class="transcript_line"> and then the mother&#039;s put it in their mouth they just wipe it up and give it to them</div><div id="00:37:27.300" class="transcript_line"> I thought no as well as we are you know we washed you know the morning we had to soap and</div><div id="00:37:33.060" class="transcript_line"> water you know clean you and then I think oh well there we are</div><div id="00:37:40.900" class="transcript_line"> there we are you know iron your clothes and looking good and I thought I couldn&#039;t get just</div><div id="00:37:47.140" class="transcript_line"> a big courtyard wear everywhere until that little window we had in the summer but um I still thought</div><div id="00:37:54.180" class="transcript_line"> oh I love um sewing and auntie used to sew but other auntie men used to sew better so I&#039;d go to</div><div id="00:38:01.140" class="transcript_line"> her and say you make this dress for me you do that for me that dress you made an auntie when she</div><div id="00:38:04.580" class="transcript_line"> passed away two years ago what a material it had lovely red roses and I know I&#039;ll come back and um</div><div id="00:38:11.940" class="transcript_line"> auntie made me that dress for me she said you were my little model because I must have been a size</div><div id="00:38:16.020" class="transcript_line"> eight then and anything I say oh well that&#039;s what the Marks and Spinsby kind of styles</div><div id="00:38:22.900" class="transcript_line"> and then she&#039;d come back and you know these people home they&#039;ve not had pattern cuts</div><div id="00:38:27.860" class="transcript_line"> you know and she&#039;d make these dresses covered buttons and we go to London I say oh I like this</div><div id="00:38:32.980" class="transcript_line"> and we go to a shop at a raft to buy all the material I wanted this we say oh you better come</div><div id="00:38:37.940" class="transcript_line"> and for me to be chatting if we say oh you better come and wait for it and then we go</div><div id="00:38:41.620" class="transcript_line"> sure I&#039;ll just go it here so that&#039;s the hand to take home to do it here and then she&#039;d show me how</div><div id="00:38:46.740" class="transcript_line"> to cut on the bias and do this so I bought a sewing machine and I was well aware me pants with the</div><div id="00:38:51.780" class="transcript_line"> boys trousers yes there&#039;s so a lot and you know because you couldn&#039;t afford it with the trim</div><div id="00:38:57.620" class="transcript_line"> having things like that oh everybody had something new and you know we&#039;d buy good</div><div id="00:39:02.660" class="transcript_line"> shippers by all

class="transcript_line"> needed top and lots of stuff so always kept busy and baking sweet bread for them and cakes and</div><div id="00:39:35.780" class="transcript_line"> then all their friends would come there when they went to school you find a house full of men</div><div id="00:39:40.100" class="transcript_line"> full of men and when they went into music I come there with somebody with</div><div id="00:39:47.060" class="transcript_line"> their saxophone there somebody with this then I could plug into light something then I do in</div><div id="00:39:53.300" class="transcript_line"> the middle of the passage and add some new carpet and then I just brought to keep something something</div><div id="00:39:58.660" class="transcript_line"> on the drum into the

their thing you know</div><div id="00:40:41.540" class="transcript_line"> and bring their friends so it sounds like you know you talk about your aunts and how they</div><div id="00:40:48.020" class="transcript_line"> used religion to kind of connect to find a sense of belonging and you had going back and forth to</div><div id="00:40:53.460" class="transcript_line"> London and here in Creole and then you had the craft you had your you know yeah I done baking I</div><div id="00:41:00.180" class="transcript_line"> used to try and do ice on the cakes for Christmas and I used to get

it and yeah so I think for me I made</div><div id="00:41:35.620" class="transcript_line"> I found things to do to cushion the way I was treated you know if I didn&#039;t do things like that</div><div id="00:41:42.500" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;d be dwelling on oh really treating because I think some people sang some people</div><div id="00:41:48.660" class="transcript_line"> had mental problem because when you went to hospital you couldn&#039;t explain themselves you&#039;d</div><div id="00:41:52.980" class="transcript_line"> see it you know then the NHS was one of the most racist place to work at one time you know um</div><div id="00:42:02.820" class="transcript_line"> promotion as you&#039;d hear lots of people telling the police in the NHS in these big organizations</div><div id="00:42:07.940" class="transcript_line"> it you know they didn&#039;t think you should be promoted you should be either clean or staying</div><div id="00:42:11.940" class="transcript_line"> down where you are and you still have people in in the lati years working with stinky work</div><div id="00:42:18.020" class="transcript_line"> because I didn&#039;t wait even four months to work sirvi and think he was a cleaner that passed me</div><div id="00:42:22.740" class="transcript_line"> by and going the office to the clerical staff you know in my boss the ones and

languages</div><div id="00:43:26.180" class="transcript_line"> no so I said you always think in the language first before they answer you</div><div id="00:43:32.580" class="transcript_line"> I say you probably say that no no no I&#039;m not one of you you know look at me</div><div id="00:43:39.060" class="transcript_line"> so but I think doing things and getting apart from working apart from doing these other things</div><div id="00:43:47.860" class="transcript_line"> hard at the you know stuff doing so um it cushioned a lot of the blows I think</div><div id="00:43:54.180"

of</div><div id="00:51:13.300" class="transcript_line"> decisions because the gp is not stationed there the consultant comes once a week and when he did</div><div id="00:51:18.420"

know you part tell me if you think you have anything wrong</div><div id="00:51:30.500" class="transcript_line"> they just tell me yes so I thought oh so that was the making of me the experience I had you know and</div><div id="00:51:39.380" class="transcript_line"> miss Morgan would come see us so yeah</div><div id="00:51:43.620" class="transcript_line"> and then I faced hostility to divide Clark she wouldn&#039;t give me my pay slip oh I have to go</div><div id="00:51:48.980" class="transcript_line"> through stories of you showing me my pay slip because she was banging the middle there you are</div><div id="00:51:53.460" class="transcript_line"> the words are there you have an office then office then she could see everything and she was really</div><div id="00:51:58.100" class="transcript_line"> hostile so sometimes you&#039;d have a pay slip two days before payday they&#039;d send it down and you&#039;d</div><div id="00:52:04.260" class="transcript_line"> have it in the grant but they sent up to and she&#039;d have it there and I went for my piece if I was</div><div id="00:52:08.660" class="transcript_line"> used to that no you&#039;re not getting until a day no mrs price I worked from I want my piece</div><div id="00:52:16.420" class="transcript_line"> so when I run I rang them in the office don&#039;t I said am I supposed to have my pay slip one day</div><div id="00:52:21.620" class="transcript_line"> because you sent some no I said you can have it it&#039;s been up there how many days you can have</div><div id="00:52:25.460" class="transcript_line"> your piece well I want to so evil and she come to my face I said if you come any more to my face</div><div id="00:52:30.980" class="transcript_line"> well we had this nice staircase very white you know these big houses why I said I threw it up</div><div id="00:52:36.260" class="transcript_line"> the stairs so this white midwife went to unseemly surprise just leave her alone well alone she slapped</div><div id="00:52:45.220" class="transcript_line"> the girl I think she wanted to slap she did she slapped her in the face</div><div id="00:52:52.420" class="transcript_line"> so I thought I said you wanted to do that too but if you&#039;d ever touch me just right should be down</div><div id="00:52:57.860" class="transcript_line"> that stairs so um I told my boss mrs james was there mrs james didn&#039;t do anything she was quiet</div><div id="00:53:06.020" class="transcript_line"> you know that&#039;s why mrs price took advantage and then I thought days nothing had been said so I saw</div><div id="00:53:12.020" class="transcript_line"> miss morgan the top major and I told her shit about it you didn&#039;t say anything I come up here</div><div id="00:53:17.860" class="transcript_line"> I said no I expected mr james to tell you and right because she brought all the hospitals</div><div id="00:53:22.820" class="transcript_line"> sectorial and you see because of delay union this and that but we move in at her office will</div><div id="00:53:28.500" class="transcript_line"> not be there she&#039;ll be going right around the back for office and um when they ask um the young lady</div><div id="00:53:36.180" class="transcript_line"> because she was a christian she said you turn the other cheek say mrs price yes she hit the girl on</div><div id="00:53:41.380" class="transcript_line"> face you know what I think she wanted but as it is when we close at Lydia she found herself working</div><div id="00:53:50.660" class="transcript_line"> somewhere in the back of pharmacy so she had nobody to think then she was a lonely old soul</div><div id="00:53:56.500" class="transcript_line"> working there and I went to something I met her son-in-law and he was telling me about it was he</div><div id="00:54:04.100" class="transcript_line"> was a counselor and he&#039;s saying about this mother-in-law mrs price oh if you worked in the</div><div id="00:54:09.860" class="transcript_line"> religion and you would admit I said oh yes very good encounter I said and I left that that</div><div id="00:54:16.340" class="transcript_line"> she always said you wouldn&#039;t have that&#039;s a very good encounter</div><div id="00:54:21.300" class="transcript_line"> but you faced it everywhere even with a sister I worked with and she was about to retire</div><div id="00:54:28.740" class="transcript_line"> you know I come up all enthusiastic and it was really weak in two days but</div><div id="00:54:35.780" class="transcript_line"> she used to come up and check what I&#039;m doing and I said you know what</div><div id="00:54:39.940" class="transcript_line"> you can look after that you you go on you go and go and do my thing you know</div><div id="00:54:45.540" class="transcript_line"> when I&#039;m like crazy ways and telling them but you face it sometimes they do it and they didn&#039;t think</div><div id="00:54:51.700" class="transcript_line"> you know face it and sometimes you would see what they&#039;re doing and then you retaliate or</div><div id="00:54:59.620" class="transcript_line"> at times I&#039;d come home because when I had the manager&#039;s role looking after the general</div><div id="00:55:05.060" class="transcript_line"> practitioner unit down here and another couple of the union people I work with</div><div id="00:55:11.860" class="transcript_line"> when I was promoted and that was just giving me a promotion because I had to go through the mill</div><div id="00:55:16.900" class="transcript_line"> and they had to ask a chief case about me the new lady took over and people I worked with over the</div><div id="00:55:21.700" class="transcript_line"> years oh why she had that rule why she managed because I had to manage them so my boss said you</div><div id="00:55:29.700" class="transcript_line"> know what Esther you come yesterday and you&#039;ve got where you are and they&#039;ve been there before</div><div id="00:55:37.220" class="transcript_line"> you haven&#039;t got anywhere and they made my life hell it wasn&#039;t easy somebody belonged to the Royal</div><div id="00:55:46.420" class="transcript_line"> College of Midwives and she was supposed to be a steward oh well so your grade will be this and</div><div id="00:55:54.180" class="transcript_line"> this I say well you can take it away from me if you can you can do it no big deal I say no your</div><div id="00:56:01.300" class="transcript_line"> problem this that&#039;s the problem I sound like a problem with you all but this is your problem</div><div id="00:56:07.860" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s too good for me to be a manager is it but fair play message written was very very good</div><div id="00:56:13.300" class="transcript_line"> you know and they went to see Eliza reporting she was horrible to start all sorts of things and then</div><div id="00:56:18.740" class="transcript_line"> she said to me don&#039;t go out I want you to come down after so why this lady was this in all of</div><div id="00:56:24.900" class="transcript_line"> nonsense she asked me so that&#039;s why I&#039;m concerned she said every gp I speak to in Newport they&#039;ve</div><div id="00:56:31.300" class="transcript_line"> got a lot of time for sister Cyril and as far as her stuff is concerned I haven&#039;t heard anything</div><div id="00:56:38.020" class="transcript_line"> from the staff so summing it up they said would you like her to move elsewhere but I still know I said</div><div id="00:56:46.660" class="transcript_line"> as long as you realize I&#039;m in charge and I said there&#039;s a saying two male crabs don&#039;t live in the</div><div id="00:56:52.020" class="transcript_line"> same hole and I said somebody&#039;s got to be in charge and as long as you realize that but I said every</div><div id="00:56:59.780" class="transcript_line"> time they up to the nonsense they come to your side and that and I moved them obviously I&#039;m weak</div><div id="00:57:03.940" class="transcript_line"> no I said I&#039;ll work with them so but you know what I had to go into two units I had to join</div><div id="00:57:13.780" class="transcript_line"> because unison if they have to deal the case they work in with the firm they get somebody</div><div id="00:57:19.780" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s not with the firm from Cardiff or London and I was in the college as well purposely for</div><div id="00:57:25.780" class="transcript_line"> my practice or if I did my practice touchwood and so then I have to join two unions because I felt</div><div id="00:57:34.660" class="transcript_line"> the way they were going people who were looking at you so and then I encouraged them one of my</div><div id="00:57:41.700" class="transcript_line"> colleagues was from Guyana Indian Guyanese and she wasn&#039;t treated very nice somebody reported her and</div><div id="00:57:49.700" class="transcript_line"> I said Jami where are you from why do you have to so many times do this and they&#039;d see her being</div><div id="00:57:54.500" class="transcript_line"> struck off so when that new boss came I said there&#039;s a problem with Jami she again get get</div><div id="00:57:59.700" class="transcript_line"> the notes let me have a look and this sister was a sister as well but she hated black people</div><div id="00:58:05.780" class="transcript_line"> and I said Jami if the doctor had continuous monitor why did you let her tell you take off</div><div id="00:58:11.780" class="transcript_line"> the monitor and take her to the watch the baby died and the mother said I will see up uniform</div><div id="00:58:17.620" class="transcript_line"> off I said why do you like Greta Cotellian anyhow Mrs Drayton Feckley was good the she had five</div><div id="00:58:25.380" class="transcript_line"> cases against her by you know foreign doctor orders and liver and and um but she could keep her job as</div><div id="00:58:32.180" class="transcript_line"> long as in five years nothing comes up against and then they moved Greta the one who told her</div><div id="00:58:37.780" class="transcript_line"> was senior to her and said we&#039;ll do this to them and she was horrible to me as a midwife in training</div><div id="00:58:46.260" class="transcript_line"> you do what you&#039;ve been taught to do which is safe and I was delivering a placenta</div><div id="00:58:53.300" class="transcript_line"> and she came in myself and my colleague pull it this way I said no that&#039;s not what I was taught</div><div id="00:59:03.300" class="transcript_line"> so you&#039;ve got to put your hands on the bottom of the uterus and then ease it comes out easily so</div><div id="00:59:11.060" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;ve been taught so I&#039;ve done my thing what they taught me oh that&#039;s what it&#039;s going to be</div><div id="00:59:16.980" class="transcript_line"> midwives me so a husband somebody&#039;s husband was there because then we had the husbands in</div><div id="00:59:24.420" class="transcript_line"> and he said that&#039;s one puncher so I went to see my tutor told her about having shadowed another time</div><div id="00:59:37.140" class="transcript_line"> I I don&#039;t know month on nights because I was sort of a senior sister then so I didn&#039;t want that</div><div id="00:59:41.780" class="transcript_line"> I was looking after a young lady and she had thalassemia but I wasn&#039;t happy with the fetal</div><div id="00:59:47.700" class="transcript_line"> heart so I said to the assistant of me go on tell sisters was in the office to ring</div><div id="00:59:54.100" class="transcript_line"> a doctor for me because I&#039;m not happy oh she comes in and the sin dosimundrup but we&#039;re not</div><div id="01:00:00.180" class="transcript_line"> allowed to put sin dosimundrup on my eyes was bulging and I thought I said are we allowed to do that</div><div id="01:00:08.100" class="transcript_line"> oh well doctor&#039;s been up all night he said to me if I can do I thought if anything happened to this</div><div id="01:00:12.260" class="transcript_line"> woman my name is there on the notes I couldn&#039;t sleep in a day so I rang the office I said is</div><div id="01:00:19.620" class="transcript_line"> it something I missed out are we allowed to put sin dosimundrup no greater than it well when I went</div><div id="01:00:25.860" class="transcript_line"> into it the following night I called on your sister I wear blue and you wear blue you should</div><div id="01:00:30.020" class="transcript_line"> respect what I asked you to do because I would respect what you asked me to do if you asked me</div><div id="01:00:33.700" class="transcript_line"> to get a doctor I&#039;d do it why are you doing it why did you do it to me my name if anything</div><div id="01:00:38.980" class="transcript_line"> happened to that baby I would be the one or to the mother oh well you know we see the doctors do it so</div><div id="01:00:45.620" class="transcript_line"> then after they didn&#039;t like in the night I worked with them there were two of them Mrs.</div><div id="01:00:49.060" class="transcript_line"> Nicholas and her and the other sister didn&#039;t get one so I was in the middle now I was experienced</div><div id="01:00:54.180" class="transcript_line"> to be on the shop for working they put into special a woman and he kept coming in to see if I was</div><div id="01:01:00.260" class="transcript_line"> asleep so I know what you&#039;re coming in for we were evil I guess what she decided 40 something she um</div><div id="01:01:09.940" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t married to a child or two that she had a baby and I was then a staff midwife on the</div><div id="01:01:16.500" class="transcript_line"> board she was coming to I said revenge is sweet no sweet well check her pillows let me put you right</div><div id="01:01:28.100" class="transcript_line"> are you all right I said you&#039;re ever so sweet</div><div id="01:01:39.300" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re ever so sweet but after Jamie&#039;s case Mr. Dritten decided to shift them around so</div><div id="01:01:46.420" class="transcript_line"> guess where did she work I was a boss then come to work with me she couldn&#039;t take it</div><div id="01:01:52.900" class="transcript_line"> hmm she she had time off Mr.</div><div id="01:01:56.180" class="transcript_line"> Jimmy she had time off sick was a colleague sick I moved down with me tell her you want to work</div><div id="01:02:00.180" class="transcript_line"> with me said no you&#039;re going to work with Vanessa upstairs because that was a punishment for her for</div><div id="01:02:06.020" class="transcript_line"> telling the midwife take the one of the monitor Jamie had a punishment as well I think this was</div><div id="01:02:12.500" class="transcript_line"> might have been the severest because she listened to it take the woman off the monitor and Greta had</div><div id="01:02:18.740" class="transcript_line"> for not well I thought revenge is so sweet so just thought a turnaround as a student by the way she</div><div id="01:02:27.380" class="transcript_line"> treated me so I looked after her so I need to clean it because I still do the clinics now since</div><div id="01:02:34.660" class="transcript_line"> she didn&#039;t like she still she drinks really she&#039;s still how many minutes she going to work at</div><div id="01:02:38.100" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;s going to finish up there oh she said well it&#039;s a nice finesse there because she wanted</div><div id="01:02:42.580" class="transcript_line"> to go and see her husband was buried around which she said and um I said well after her love</div><div id="01:02:51.060" class="transcript_line"> and she went with priests and everything went in the night and then he was the right way around but</div><div id="01:02:54.980" class="transcript_line"> she couldn&#039;t cope with coming to me I&#039;m her boss well goodness me and then in the end guess who her</div><div id="01:03:02.260" class="transcript_line"> daughter actually</div><div id="01:03:06.420" class="transcript_line"> her wife is locks wow and she came to my

nasty I was quite nice which I</div><div id="01:03:46.980" class="transcript_line"> looked after quite well and I thought the same thing you did you couldn&#039;t stand me and she was</div><div id="01:03:53.140" class="transcript_line"> a refugee from the war from oh some of us were a refugee because her name was KUICK</div><div id="01:04:05.460" class="transcript_line"> and um I know there

would undermine me I said I&#039;m more happy</div><div id="01:04:19.540" class="transcript_line"> this when I was on the baby I said oh nothing wrong with it and the one day I walk off and I</div><div id="01:04:24.740" class="transcript_line"> just walk off the ward so I&#039;m coming back and she come here she had so many trips oh I said I don&#039;t</div><div id="01:04:30.980" class="transcript_line"> know I said you&#039;re too rude but these were the things you had to face with and I don&#039;t know why</div><div id="01:04:38.260" class="transcript_line"> I got the strength when I think back I said you know how I managed how I stayed oh I didn&#039;t go</div><div id="01:04:42.100" class="transcript_line"> mental I got the strength to come home and I used to come

because they&#039;re black you&#039;re</div><div id="01:24:02.980" class="transcript_line"> thinking of the subi and all this thing and these people walking around you know and Costa was here</div><div id="01:24:09.620" class="transcript_line"> for two years and I used to invite them cook food for them or get stuff for them and</div><div id="01:24:15.860" class="transcript_line"> and they decided to send Costa to her after two years so I said I knew the woman because I used</div><div id="01:24:20.260" class="transcript_line"> to go to these meetings I said you can&#039;t do that so I said Costa you got all your papers sorting</div><div id="01:24:26.900" class="transcript_line"> out the lawyer yes he said I have to wait I said Jane you come and live with me just give him pocket</div><div id="01:24:33.380" class="transcript_line"> money and so I asked Pete I told the boys as well and my friend said oh you might have been</div><div id="01:24:40.340" class="transcript_line"> a killer in this country when I was driving him but that boy said and he told people from Angolan</div><div id="01:24:46.420" class="transcript_line"> and he said God look after you this is a nice person Costa live with me for a few weeks and I</div><div id="01:24:52.260" class="transcript_line"> said you learn English now Costa none of this speak in Angolan money so he was listening to</div><div id="01:24:57.860" class="transcript_line"> talking to</div><div id="01:25:08.580" class="transcript_line"> if he doesn&#039;t hear from me for a couple weeks then he&#039;ll ring me and he got married at</div><div id="01:25:18.660" class="transcript_line"> because his wife has got um mental problem and she was a great maneuver you know anyhow</div><div id="01:25:27.140" class="transcript_line"> um Costa then he named one after me and he named one after Peter</div><div id="01:25:35.140" class="transcript_line"> and he was in problems about four years ago with the social services</div><div id="01:25:39.860" class="transcript_line"> you know he threatened a train well the girl must have said one of the daughters said that social</div><div id="01:25:45.220" class="transcript_line"> server come and take the train they come and do this like I had to walk up and down in court they</div><div id="01:25:49.460" class="transcript_line"> give the train for fostering yeah the girl said I&#039;ve had a friend of a pink bed she said no I only</div><div id="01:25:56.260" class="transcript_line"> said that you know my father you know I they just enlist in this and police around oh well so I had</div><div id="01:26:02.660" class="transcript_line"> to get a papasi the court case you know down in Cardiff going with him I said it was social</div><div id="01:26:07.300" class="transcript_line"> because he always accused black men of being aggressive I said when we talk in the Caribbean</div><div id="01:26:12.900" class="transcript_line"> we touched we talked but I said you will think it&#039;s something sexual and because he speaks two</div><div id="01:26:17.780" class="transcript_line"> languages three languages I please book I said you think he&#039;s aggressive because he tries to put a</div><div id="01:26:22.820" class="transcript_line"> emphasis on the English language he&#039;s not aggressive but you always treat black men</div><div id="01:26:27.460" class="transcript_line"> and then I said of course the door speak let me speak for you and then the barrister then came one</div><div id="01:26:32.580" class="transcript_line"> day I don&#039;t know why all this nonsense is going on and he&#039;s chatting to me and say this is what</div><div id="01:26:36.900" class="transcript_line"> what is happening today you have literally you know he was so very good and went to the lawyer&#039;s</div><div id="01:26:42.260" class="transcript_line"> room because Maria didn&#039;t have a lawyer or somebody an interpreter so I said you supposed I go to</div><div id="01:26:49.300" class="transcript_line"> meetings I didn&#039;t all the palms and the cams and all these abbreviations are social I&#039;d go to</div><div id="01:26:53.620" class="transcript_line"> meetings with him with Maria and I know the chair said she got to have an interpreter and he said</div><div id="01:27:00.100" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll walk out the next time because as they didn&#039;t so you see all the racism all the thing they didn&#039;t</div><div id="01:27:04.740" class="transcript_line"> care so um I think from what I went for I&#039;ll never see anybody I&#039;ll never see injustice of people</div><div id="01:27:16.100" class="transcript_line"> not at all you know because I was</div><div id="01:27:26.340" class="transcript_line"> is a very out of all of them is a nice and there&#039;s one left and she&#039;s in London and there&#039;s another</div><div id="01:27:31.860" class="transcript_line"> lot from Brazzaville and I think the lot would think come anyone everything Peter is to take</div><div id="01:27:40.100" class="transcript_line"> the one boy said he ran through forest and he had terrible six he was a six foot four boy</div><div id="01:27:46.900" class="transcript_line"> but his legs was like my wrist his arm was then he had a terrible soreness for his eyes was yellow</div><div id="01:27:55.940" class="transcript_line"> we took him to the doctor and because I could explain myself them speak French and I knew that</div><div id="01:28:01.380" class="transcript_line"> I was for him to go to look when Peter&#039;s car was a little um</div><div id="01:28:07.780" class="transcript_line"> a smaller car and we took this tall boy and I was going to him for his treatment and the one day</div><div id="01:28:13.620" class="transcript_line"> because the street you forget to ring casualty they wouldn&#039;t treat him and so I was working I</div><div id="01:28:20.900" class="transcript_line"> got some stuff there I went to their place and I sort of looked at this we don&#039;t treat him with</div><div id="01:28:27.300" class="transcript_line"> gloves and everything he didn&#039;t have anything goes what he didn&#039;t have anything like easy was</div><div id="01:28:31.060" class="transcript_line"> bad sickling and he was still and girls gave me some stuff and things you know my colleagues and</div><div id="01:28:38.180" class="transcript_line"> all but um and two weeks there he said oh no pull not push it pass on Peter said there&#039;s a big</div><div id="01:28:44.660" class="transcript_line"> river going off first and he wants to preach in two weeks he wanted to be a he&#039;s preaching</div><div id="01:28:49.620" class="transcript_line"> money making all that thing so this lot I didn&#039;t bother I see them occasionally but I</div><div id="01:28:54.420" class="transcript_line"> you know and I said well you said it comes after you that&#039;s the mother of so-called mother she said</div><div id="01:28:59.940" class="transcript_line"> that I don&#039;t believe and I said you&#039;re going back to brazil for holidays</div><div id="01:29:08.180" class="transcript_line"> but of course there&#039;s a nice</div><div id="01:29:12.420" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think when you have a when you&#039;re open and you have that</div><div id="01:29:17.620" class="transcript_line"> intuition isn&#039;t it yeah you could kind of know make the right kind of choices</div><div id="01:29:22.500" class="transcript_line"> um final question I think what what do you think is the value of having these stories</div><div id="01:29:28.820" class="transcript_line"> accessible to the younger generation what do you think do you think it matters that other people</div><div id="01:29:35.300" class="transcript_line"> hear this I do think it matters because nobody knows your story if you don&#039;t give it to them</div><div id="01:29:44.420" class="transcript_line"> everybody think you come through the ranks and you find nothing happened</div><div id="01:29:48.580" class="transcript_line"> but I think it&#039;s still you saying the strength some people could have</div><div id="01:29:56.180" class="transcript_line"> the negative and turn it into positive the support you get from families and good friends</div><div id="01:30:05.380" class="transcript_line"> and I think the young people need to know or people after me because</div><div id="01:30:10.660" class="transcript_line"> it won&#039;t always be nice for them it doesn&#039;t matter whether you&#039;ve got all the race relation</div><div id="01:30:15.540" class="transcript_line"> rules and the laws and the thing the institution some will come and they practice what they think</div><div id="01:30:22.100" class="transcript_line"> is good some will go others come and they think to hell with it because right now we&#039;ve got</div><div id="01:30:28.580" class="transcript_line"> right-wing government in power and you can see it all around and they wouldn&#039;t care and it&#039;s always</div><div id="01:30:35.780" class="transcript_line"> the people who are poor who are black another ethnicity they&#039;ll be paying the price so I think</div><div id="01:30:44.500" class="transcript_line"> it is nice to have stories and I mean this is just a nutshell of my story I would go on and on</div><div id="01:30:51.460" class="transcript_line"> and on with what I had to put up with what I had to endure with everything some nights come in here</div><div id="01:30:58.100" class="transcript_line"> crying and thinking have I got to put up with that I think I better go home I gotta go St. Lucia</div><div id="01:31:04.740" class="transcript_line"> let&#039;s go and that&#039;s he by the land I think that&#039;s his language</div><div id="01:31:09.140" class="transcript_line"> and no I think no you&#039;ve gone for all of that you had the strength and you had the courage</div><div id="01:31:14.260" class="transcript_line"> and you had the tenacity to stand up to people to challenge people as well</div><div id="01:31:20.180" class="transcript_line"> and why not could be a home as well</div><div id="01:31:23.380" class="transcript_line"> and why not could be a home as well</div><div id="01:31:32.980" class="transcript_line"> Vanessa Sarah OBE thank you</div><div id="01:31:37.540" class="transcript_line"> here</div><div id="01:31:49.140" class="transcript_line"> but thank you for your time thank you thank you yeah and I didn&#039;t say whatever Peter support from</div><div id="01:31:53.780" class="transcript_line"> Peter as well because he faced the same thing we both faced the same thing he faced when he came</div><div id="01:31:58.660" class="transcript_line"> here and the first job he applied because he was doing print and I know print was that he went and</div><div id="01:32:04.100" class="transcript_line"> he said yes yes we&#039;ll have you and the first day he went in he refused to work with him</div><div id="01:32:10.500" class="transcript_line"> because he thought he was a white man his name Peter his face he went in to work they tell him</div><div id="01:32:16.340" class="transcript_line"> start and he went in and he said he not working I&#039;d rather walk away and the MP heard Mr Hughes</div><div id="01:32:24.500" class="transcript_line"> and he went to speak but there was no law stopping that and Peter never forget it</div><div id="01:32:31.940" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll never forget the patient who said to me and she was crippled in a bed</div><div id="01:32:37.300" class="transcript_line"> get your blood you&#039;re not going to
