    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He ran the Cardiff border shkita. Again, in Cardiff we used to do our own shkita.</div><div id="00:00:07.360" class="transcript_line"> So there was a ritual slaughtering took place in Cardiff and it was under the guidance of Rabbi</div><div id="00:00:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Rogoznitsky. When I was growing up there used to be a ritual slaughter in Hebrew called a shokhet</div><div id="00:00:18.960" class="transcript_line"> and they used to be employed by the community on a full-time basis, shokhet in Cardiff. Even</div><div id="00:00:24.160" class="transcript_line"> to digress even further, in Myrtha Tidvill they also used to do their own shkita and there was</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> a minister called there, the minister I can remember, the minister of shokhet was Reverend</div><div id="00:00:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Fine and his son who lives just around the corner of his called Rabbi Fine who was a minister in</div><div id="00:00:37.520" class="transcript_line"> Southgate and Cockfosters. So yes, there was rituals. My father was very adamant that had to</div><div id="00:00:41.760" class="transcript_line"> keep on going. There was a ritual slaughtering done in Cardiff. We used to have our own shokhtim,</div><div id="00:00:46.720" class="transcript_line"> the literal slaughterers and many of those have got family or are still in contact with</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and are in London. So Grape was a child that he was involved in. We&#039;re not just talking chickens</div><div id="00:00:56.720" class="transcript_line"> here, no, we&#039;re talking animals, cows. To the extent that when I was already in my 18th because</div><div id="00:01:03.440" class="transcript_line"> I was driving a car and my parents were away once on holiday and I happened to be at home and I was</div><div id="00:01:08.720" class="transcript_line"> giving the Rabbi, Rabbi Rogoznitsky, a lift back from Cathedral Road Synagogue one morning and he</div><div id="00:01:13.600" class="transcript_line"> said to me, Adrian have you got any time to spare? And I said yes. Why? He said I want to go and</div><div id="00:01:20.480" class="transcript_line"> check up on the shokhtim, on the slaughtering. I said fine. So I said but Rabbi you&#039;re old and</div><div id="00:01:26.160" class="transcript_line"> the Rabbi suffered from Parkinsonism and he couldn&#039;t walk very well. I said well,</div><div id="00:01:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Rob, how are you going to get in and out of the slaughterhouse? He said don&#039;t worry,</div><div id="00:01:36.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll sort that out. So we went there. The shokhtim that day was a Rabbi Smith from who lived in Brighton</div><div id="00:01:43.760" class="transcript_line"> and we got there and he said go and tell the slaughtermen I&#039;ve arrived. We went to tell the</div><div id="00:01:47.600" class="transcript_line"> slaughtermen we&#039;ve arrived. They then came out with a chair. They put the Rabbi on a chair. They took</div><div id="00:01:53.200" class="transcript_line"> him all the way through on the chair. This is before I&#039;d even had breakfast in the morning</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and I then watched as they slaughtered at least two cows and then checked them because part of</div><div id="00:02:02.880" class="transcript_line"> the process of when they do the slaughtering you&#039;ve got to do certain checks. You&#039;ve got to check the</div><div id="00:02:06.480" class="transcript_line"> no blemishes on the lungs as an instance. So I watched as they slaughtered these two cows.</div><div id="00:02:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Another aside, a little smaller side, this Rabbi Smith who I just mentioned was a shokhtim, was an</div><div id="00:02:17.280" class="transcript_line"> old gentleman and he the shokhtim, my father in charge at the time, the slaughtermen said at one</div><div id="00:02:23.520" class="transcript_line"> point refused to work with him and they said Rabbi Smith I&#039;m very sorry you&#039;re too old. We don&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:28.080" class="transcript_line"> trust you anymore. You&#039;re going to do damage. So he said to them that&#039;s fine. He said will you work</div><div id="00:02:32.880" class="transcript_line"> with me if we have a competition and I win? And they said what type of competition? So he said if</div><div id="00:02:38.240" class="transcript_line"> we have a push-up competition and I win, he said that you bring your fittest man and I will do</div><div id="00:02:44.480" class="transcript_line"> push-ups on the floor against him now. If I win, I stay on. If he wins, I will leave immediately.</div><div id="00:02:52.080" class="transcript_line"> Rabbi Smith was working the next day. He used to walk regularly from Stanford Hill to Golders Green.</div><div id="00:02:57.200" class="transcript_line"> He was a very fit gentleman. He might not have looked fit but he was. I also remember being in</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> the Rabbi&#039;s house talking about shkita when in order to do shkita you have to use what they call</div><div id="00:03:06.960" class="transcript_line"> a chalif which is a special ritual knife. That knife is going to be razor razor sharp and have</div><div id="00:03:11.920" class="transcript_line"> no indentations. You check that by running it against your thumbnail. Again the Rabbi was an</div><div id="00:03:17.040" class="transcript_line"> old dodgery as I would say. I had all respect for him. He wasn&#039;t dodgery but that&#039;s the way I describe</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> him and he then ran his back of his nail against this knife to check it was kosher and it was there.</div><div id="00:03:28.160" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s my story about shkita. Where was the slaughtering taking place? The slaughtering was</div><div id="00:03:32.800" class="transcript_line"> taking place in Cardiff in I don&#039;t remember where the slaughterhouse was. I thought not mistakenly</div><div id="00:03:38.160" class="transcript_line"> it was in town somewhere. There was a slaughter. It was a non-Jewish slaughterhouse which was a</div><div id="00:03:42.640" class="transcript_line"> section and in order to do Jewish slaughtering you have a pen and the animal is then turned upside</div><div id="00:03:47.680" class="transcript_line"> down in the pen and its neck is sliced. And that was done in I remember going there. I can&#039;t</div><div id="00:03:52.640" class="transcript_line"> remember exactly where it was. I think it might have been in Canton. I can&#039;t remember offhand though.</div></div></p>
