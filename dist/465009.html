    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, well, I moved here in July 1969, and in fact I moved the day after the first man landed on the moon.</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> And the program was going on that night, and I was finishing, my brother and I were finishing packing up the family home.</div><div id="00:00:22.800" class="transcript_line"> And so we only had a sort of sporadic view of that. So that, I&#039;m amazed that that was the same month as the Investiture.</div><div id="00:00:39.800" class="transcript_line"> Because that was the thing that marked it, particularly for me, the landing on the moon.</div><div id="00:00:45.200" class="transcript_line"> But, yes I watched it, and whether I watched it in the family home or in my present home, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:00:59.200" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember, but I certainly remember the program and the fears about whether there would be some sort of incident.</div><div id="00:01:09.600" class="transcript_line"> And there were rumours, whether it was true or not, I don&#039;t know, that the Queen&#039;s hat was in fact a protective helmet, dressed up.</div><div id="00:01:21.600" class="transcript_line"> And the fact that Anthony, oh what was his name, before he became Lord Snowden anyway,</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> that he had designed for himself some sort of uniform for the occasion.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember seeing him interviewed at the Carnarvon Castle, as well as the Investiture itself.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But there was definitely an apprehension about whether anything was going to occur.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So the whole thing was coloured by that.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And it all passed over very smoothly, but everybody was well aware that there might have been an incident.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So apart from that, what do you remember seeing in the run-up to the ceremony on television?</div><div id="00:02:23.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember seeing very much in the run-up actually, but possibly that was because I was packing up to come here, probably.</div><div id="00:02:33.400" class="transcript_line"> So no, I don&#039;t remember the run-up, but I do remember the actual day of the installation.</div><div id="00:02:42.400" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of objections that came across on television?</div><div id="00:02:48.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I think so, yes.</div><div id="00:02:50.800" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, had there been anybody planning to disrupt the occasion, they wouldn&#039;t be expressing their views on television</div><div id="00:03:00.800" class="transcript_line"> because they wouldn&#039;t want to be pinpointed.</div><div id="00:03:03.800" class="transcript_line"> But yes, people who had no intention of doing anything like that did put forward a contrary view, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:03:14.800" class="transcript_line"> As a Welsh woman, what did the ceremony mean to you?</div><div id="00:03:20.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose it was a recognition of the separate entity of Wales and the importance of Wales,</div><div id="00:03:34.800" class="transcript_line"> which is something which nowadays I think has increased enormously,</div><div id="00:03:41.800" class="transcript_line"> the sort of impact of Wales on the rest of not just this country, but other countries as well, and its culture.</div><div id="00:03:48.200" class="transcript_line"> And I suppose I saw it as a recognition of that, even though there might not have been much in the way of a practical outcome.</div><div id="00:04:04.200" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see it as an affront to Wales, which some people obviously did, treating Wales as a subsidiary to England.</div><div id="00:04:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t see it that way, I did see it as a recognition of a country.</div><div id="00:04:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Were there any sort of events organised in this area?</div><div id="00:04:30.600" class="transcript_line"> I think there probably were, but again, I wasn&#039;t involved in them, for obvious reasons.</div></div></p>
