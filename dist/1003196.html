    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t have Betty Journey to help me out every day, but I&#039;ve talked to Betty on many occasions.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And most of the time I&#039;m talking to Gwen Davies Helm, who can&#039;t be here today,</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but she&#039;s filled my little head with all sorts of visions.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And then of course there&#039;s Hugh Perry, and he says to me, he goes, I&#039;ll tell you a story.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course it&#039;s not the sort of thing you&#039;re going to say in front of everybody in the church.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember that. You&#039;re going to get me in trouble.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I won&#039;t tell you Hugh Perry&#039;s story, but I did write a poem.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had so much trouble writing this poem, it was sort of like giving birth to twins.</div><div id="00:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m really not even sure if I finished it.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But I hope Betty and everybody else who was in this church, I hope it&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t come up with a fancy title, so I just put Seattle&#039;s Old Welsh Church at the top.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s see if it works, okay?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing there where the heart once stood, nothing but a sharp stucco box rising rudely,</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> flush against the sidewalk intruding.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no way to tell where the steps used to be, no sacred bit of earth to stand on.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It was meant to be our legacy, a home for us to hand on.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember, we all came together there to bear witness to Christenings, marriages, and deaths.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Too untimely to bear alone. Of course we sang on Sundays, and for all the critical moments,</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> music welled up from the depths, washed over us, and reverberated into the city streets.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It brought us together, cleansed our bitterness and pain, and for a time,</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> like an unruly current, tore us apart. But all the same, it carried us.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Every year Welsh pilgrims came in a greyhound bus hired from Vancouver, Renton, and Elmira,</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Spokane and Black Diamond, an instant choir.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Croissant, Mr. Thomas! Hello, Mr. Jones! Handshakes around, eyes on fire.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, Mr. Parry! Have you seen Mr. Pritchard? Do you remember my friend?</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Then one deep, rolling thunder struck. Amen. A gaman vagani has begun.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Songs of praises I will ever give to thee echoed in the moving part to feed the soul and touch the heart.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> A great baptism through immersion in this blended harmony.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then downstairs the tables white, a feast of ham, cakes, and cups of tea,</div><div id="00:02:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and everything a lovely sight to feed this Cumbric family.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Some of us married and moved away. Death and indifference took its toll.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But we always expected the church to stay.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It had married us, carried us, and buried us. It was the sun our universe went round.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The guardian of our Cambrian sound.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> A place to heal here I snagging pain, a shelter from the winter rain,</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> where God&#039;s great spirit lived within to comfort us and sponge our sin.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Then behind closed doors in other places from strangers&#039; mouths on strangers&#039; faces,</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> they said it&#039;s really not a church at all. It&#039;s an ethnic playground past its prime.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The pews sit half empty all the time. It&#039;s just a steepled stained glass social hall.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Then a scratching pen declared its fate. It&#039;s just a piece of real estate.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But all those who lived both far and near remembered then the joyful noise,</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> the bronze plaque tribute to our boys that died in the Great War.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember the organ full of praise, the great steaming pots of tea, daffodils, china, and silver trays.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And remembered our Cumbric community.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There was Mr. Pritchard and Mrs. Hughes. And all the faces that filled the pews.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> The strolling chorus walking home. The sweet, full, and heartfelt tone.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> If there is power in remembering and words can let you see through the stucco boxes to know,</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> there still remains, despite the pen and the wrecking ball, a Seattle Cumbric community.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Applause</div></div></p>
