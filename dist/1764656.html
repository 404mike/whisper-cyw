    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re recording now. So my name is Paul Hunt and I work for Man Cap Cymru and could</div><div id="00:00:11.180" class="transcript_line"> you introduce yourself please? My name is Joe Powell. I work for All Wales People First.</div><div id="00:00:17.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m on the autism spectrum and I lived in autism care for 11 years. And where do you</div><div id="00:00:23.360" class="transcript_line"> live at the moment? At the moment I live in Newport in South Wales. So obviously we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:00:29.200" class="transcript_line"> interviewed you before under very different circumstances. Could you tell me a little</div><div id="00:00:35.440" class="transcript_line"> bit about what you&#039;ve been up to for the last seven months? What&#039;s really interesting is</div><div id="00:00:40.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been working from home an awful lot. Now usually the organisation I work for, All</div><div id="00:00:45.720" class="transcript_line"> Wales People First, we got rid of our offices a long time ago so I didn&#039;t think it would</div><div id="00:00:49.560" class="transcript_line"> be much of a challenge. But I was really, really surprised because just going out to</div><div id="00:00:55.840" class="transcript_line"> meetings a lot doesn&#039;t happen anymore. So everything is obviously home base now. Now</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> in one of the interviews I did before, and I&#039;m not sure if this was used on the film,</div><div id="00:01:08.440" class="transcript_line"> one of the interviews I did before with you, I was talking about how if there was a nuclear</div><div id="00:01:13.560" class="transcript_line"> war or a nuclear holocaust I wouldn&#039;t miss anybody and I&#039;d be okay on my own. And I think</div><div id="00:01:18.040" class="transcript_line"> what I&#039;ve learnt over these seven months is that I actually do need people. Maybe not</div><div id="00:01:23.240" class="transcript_line"> need people in the way other people need people. But actually, you know, no man is an island.</div><div id="00:01:29.040" class="transcript_line"> And okay, it&#039;s been easier for me than your average bear. And it&#039;s easier for me than</div><div id="00:01:33.720" class="transcript_line"> most people. But actually, it&#039;s had a bigger toll on me than I thought. Although I would</div><div id="00:01:39.320" class="transcript_line"> say largely I&#039;ve been unaffected compared to most people. So I think it was a massive</div><div id="00:01:44.200" class="transcript_line"> learning curve for me. So in a nutshell, all I&#039;ve done is just work from home. That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:01:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Has it affected the way that you&#039;ve accessed any social groups or not even groups necessarily</div><div id="00:01:58.480" class="transcript_line"> individuals you would have met up with in your spare time?</div><div id="00:02:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s really affected in a few ways, positives and negatives. The negatives obviously</div><div id="00:02:07.800" class="transcript_line"> are there is not physical interface. One of the members I usually meet up with and we</div><div id="00:02:12.800" class="transcript_line"> have a got friends and we have a meal and we do some shopping that couldn&#039;t happen.</div><div id="00:02:17.680" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve actually done more member engagement because of this. In the past, for instance,</div><div id="00:02:22.320" class="transcript_line"> people were learning disabilities if we were to put an idea to zoom or teams to them, they</div><div id="00:02:27.640" class="transcript_line"> would just turn it down and flatly refuse. I think it&#039;s a no, we can&#039;t do that. That&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:31.720" class="transcript_line"> not a thing. So we never went there. We always did things physically because of zoom. So</div><div id="00:02:37.760" class="transcript_line"> because of the COVID-19 situation, I think there&#039;s been an element of the necessities</div><div id="00:02:42.440" class="transcript_line"> the mother of invention. People have been forced to come out of their comfort zone and</div><div id="00:02:47.920" class="transcript_line"> learn things like zoom because if they don&#039;t, they&#039;re not going to be able to mix with people</div><div id="00:02:51.800" class="transcript_line"> and have any social interaction. And because of that, I actually think during these times,</div><div id="00:02:58.080" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got more we&#039;ve got more engagement with members now than we&#039;ve ever done before.</div><div id="00:03:04.440" class="transcript_line"> And do you think if things return back to normal, you&#039;ll do things the way you used</div><div id="00:03:11.240" class="transcript_line"> to or do you think you might continue online just because there&#039;s so many more people involved?</div><div id="00:03:18.360" class="transcript_line"> I personally would like to get a mixture of the two things. I think I think definitely the person</div><div id="00:03:24.440" class="transcript_line"> thinks good at regular intervals, but at the same time, you know, just so there&#039;s a human contact</div><div id="00:03:30.040" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s good for certainly for staff team morale. And I think members need to be together</div><div id="00:03:34.440" class="transcript_line"> in a place so they can feel that physical connection. But I think in terms of resources</div><div id="00:03:39.400" class="transcript_line"> and time, the fact that we&#039;ve been able to do stuff on zoom that we wouldn&#039;t have dreamed before.</div><div id="00:03:45.640" class="transcript_line"> Also, there are times when I think it would be lovely just to have, say,</div><div id="00:03:49.960" class="transcript_line"> team meetings and other meetings online as well. One of the benefits, for start, you cut out the</div><div id="00:03:55.160" class="transcript_line"> travel time, especially people live in different parts of Wales. One of the major benefits</div><div id="00:04:01.240" class="transcript_line"> of of this kind of technology as well. Oh, I lost my thread then I&#039;m so sorry.</div><div id="00:04:08.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all right. There was a major benefit, which I&#039;m trying to think of this technology.</div><div id="00:04:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we go back to sorry, I&#039;ll just take you while I get my thread.</div><div id="00:04:21.640" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re asking, would we go back? So that&#039;s a positive we can connect with more people. Oh,</div><div id="00:04:26.200" class="transcript_line"> yeah, yeah, yeah. Another problem we&#039;re having is with our national council in terms of physical</div><div id="00:04:31.080" class="transcript_line"> meetings. So our national council is our member led forum across Wales, where we bring all reps</div><div id="00:04:36.280" class="transcript_line"> from all counties to one place to hold me to account as chief executive and set our strategy.</div><div id="00:04:41.800" class="transcript_line"> There are some parts of Wales where people could have an impact on their benefits. If they seem to</div><div id="00:04:48.440" class="transcript_line"> travel independently, might not be able to get to our physical meetings. Now that was in the past,</div><div id="00:04:54.760" class="transcript_line"> a real problem for us. And before Covid, we were already looking at how do we make this happen? How</div><div id="00:05:00.760" class="transcript_line"> do we get people to meetings that they can&#039;t attend? We looked at one of those hubs, you know,</div><div id="00:05:05.400" class="transcript_line"> those Amazon hubs. Yeah. We look at those portals. But since this look at it, Zoom,</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve now realized it&#039;s much easier to do this now. It&#039;s not ideal. But if say we do go to</div><div id="00:05:18.200" class="transcript_line"> North Wales and people from the South can&#039;t get there, we can beam them in. If we&#039;re in the South</div><div id="00:05:22.520" class="transcript_line"> and people from the North can&#039;t get there, we beam them in. So it gives us that flexibility,</div><div id="00:05:27.480" class="transcript_line"> which we didn&#039;t have before. And so thinking away from your role in your personal life,</div><div id="00:05:35.800" class="transcript_line"> how has it affected how you communicate with friends or family?</div><div id="00:05:40.360" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really strange because I don&#039;t really communicate with friends or family very often</div><div id="00:05:45.160" class="transcript_line"> anyway, because I am such a loner. But it&#039;s still affected me an awful lot. And it&#039;s affected me in</div><div id="00:05:51.160" class="transcript_line"> a way you wouldn&#039;t imagine. I have more social contact now than ever before since Zoom. And this</div><div id="00:05:58.680" class="transcript_line"> is because of the Covid situation. Meetings, meetings that would happen quarterly, and now</div><div id="00:06:04.600" class="transcript_line"> were happening for a long time weekly. And then there were subgroup meetings to that and prep</div><div id="00:06:09.400" class="transcript_line"> meetings. So it actually put a lot of pressure on me. And I found interacting as a person with</div><div id="00:06:14.840" class="transcript_line"> autism online under that format, excruciatingly painful to the point where at times I just wasn&#039;t,</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was being spoken over and what have you. And I&#039;ve got to be honest, in one meeting,</div><div id="00:06:26.520" class="transcript_line"> I really lost my temper. And I really put my foot down and said, I&#039;m on the autism spectrum,</div><div id="00:06:31.560" class="transcript_line"> have some consideration. Which I hated, because I don&#039;t want to do that. I don&#039;t want to,</div><div id="00:06:36.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not ashamed to have autism, but I just want to appear like any other chief exec, any other</div><div id="00:06:40.840" class="transcript_line"> employee of an organisation. But I got into that situation where I really got upset and annoyed.</div><div id="00:06:46.760" class="transcript_line"> So in terms of participation, it&#039;s harder because of Zoom, unless people hand up through the chair.</div><div id="00:06:53.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a nightmare for me, because I need to see the social cues. But also, I have more meetings now</div><div id="00:06:59.800" class="transcript_line"> than I ever did by a country mile on Zoom. And that stifles me and my ability to do stuff I really</div><div id="00:07:07.080" class="transcript_line"> need to do for the job. So it&#039;s actually put a lot of pressure on me in that response. And of course,</div><div id="00:07:11.560" class="transcript_line"> when the social things don&#039;t happen as well as I thought, I then doubt myself, I doubt my position,</div><div id="00:07:16.840" class="transcript_line"> I doubt who I am. Am I really qualified to do this job? So it&#039;s had a negative impact on my well-being.</div><div id="00:07:23.560" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no doubt about it. But I&#039;d say not because of lack of social contact, but because of too much</div><div id="00:07:28.840" class="transcript_line"> of it. So do you think if you were the kind of person to talk to friends and family often, do you</div><div id="00:07:36.120" class="transcript_line"> think that and your job, how do you think you would cope with that? With my family, I never</div><div id="00:07:45.720" class="transcript_line"> saw them much anyway, but I used to video conference them once a week. So that was dead</div><div id="00:07:50.600" class="transcript_line"> straightforward. I think that wouldn&#039;t be an issue for me, to be honest. You know what I mean? With</div><div id="00:07:56.360" class="transcript_line"> the friends and family, I don&#039;t think, no, I never really went out with people much anyway.</div><div id="00:08:02.200" class="transcript_line"> And when I did, it was only over the telephone if we spoke. And if we did go out to be like once a</div><div id="00:08:06.840" class="transcript_line"> quarter or something, very rare. So I remember you said at the start of our conversation that you</div><div id="00:08:14.520" class="transcript_line"> were surprised that, you know, you thought you couldn&#039;t, you could do without the contact and</div><div id="00:08:20.760" class="transcript_line"> you now find that you need it. Do you think that will change how you approach things when we are</div><div id="00:08:24.520" class="transcript_line"> allowed to interact with people again? I think I won&#039;t change how I approach things, but I think</div><div id="00:08:31.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll appreciate more when I am with people, when I&#039;m not always wanting to be there or there&#039;s times</div><div id="00:08:38.440" class="transcript_line"> when I&#039;m thinking, God, I wish I could just work from home. I&#039;ve become more aware of how sometimes</div><div id="00:08:43.560" class="transcript_line"> you just need to be around people sometimes, because sometimes just being with a person and</div><div id="00:08:48.200" class="transcript_line"> having a positive conversation in person can just make you feel positive. You can come back.</div><div id="00:08:53.960" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s times I&#039;ll go out for a meeting, say at 10 o&#039;clock in the morning, and we don&#039;t have our</div><div id="00:08:57.960" class="transcript_line"> offices. So I go to another organization, have a meeting. But if that meeting just goes quite well,</div><div id="00:09:03.160" class="transcript_line"> or it goes okay, or a point of view you&#039;ve expressed has been understood or respected,</div><div id="00:09:08.920" class="transcript_line"> you go home and think about yourself, you know, and you&#039;ve broken the deal by being out. So when</div><div id="00:09:14.120" class="transcript_line"> you do come home and do admin, just that hour or two out makes a big difference to your well-being</div><div id="00:09:18.520" class="transcript_line"> when you come back, because you&#039;ve had some interaction. And I think it&#039;s made me more</div><div id="00:09:23.960" class="transcript_line"> appreciative of that. And I think I&#039;ve done a lot of self-reflection. And I do sometimes wonder,</div><div id="00:09:31.080" class="transcript_line"> now with hindsight, when I keep saying I don&#039;t need people, I don&#039;t need people,</div><div id="00:09:35.240" class="transcript_line"> maybe I do need people, maybe I&#039;ve always needed people. Maybe the problem has been for me,</div><div id="00:09:40.360" class="transcript_line"> as somebody who was non-verbal for years and had a lot of problems with my autism and Asperger&#039;s,</div><div id="00:09:45.480" class="transcript_line"> maybe I&#039;ve just learned or I&#039;ve been forced in a position where I was socially isolated so much,</div><div id="00:09:51.240" class="transcript_line"> that it just became the norm. And I was out of the loop so much that it became my new normal.</div><div id="00:09:56.920" class="transcript_line"> And maybe with hindsight, it&#039;s not that I don&#039;t need people. Maybe with hindsight,</div><div id="00:10:01.720" class="transcript_line"> it is more the fact that I&#039;ve just lost the ability to know how to deal with,</div><div id="00:10:08.280" class="transcript_line"> to work with people. And I&#039;ve lost the ability to know what I&#039;ve lost out on.</div><div id="00:10:13.240" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hmm. That&#039;s an interesting viewpoint. I suppose we&#039;ve touched on this a little bit,</div><div id="00:10:20.040" class="transcript_line"> but do you think it&#039;s affected your well-being, being either locked out or at least</div><div id="00:10:25.800" class="transcript_line"> physically distancing from people? I think it&#039;s definitely affected my well-being in terms of</div><div id="00:10:32.920" class="transcript_line"> the overload of information. So I&#039;m not just doing my job, but there&#039;s constant emails,</div><div id="00:10:38.840" class="transcript_line"> constant chats, follow-up actions. It&#039;s definitely done that. That makes me more aware of being on</div><div id="00:10:45.960" class="transcript_line"> the autism spectrum, being different to my peers. That makes me doubt myself more. So I think there&#039;s</div><div id="00:10:51.880" class="transcript_line"> definitely been all that going on from a selfish point of view. I think absolutely that has</div><div id="00:10:58.760" class="transcript_line"> certainly affected me. I think I&#039;ve got away with it more than most people in the grand scheme of</div><div id="00:11:05.880" class="transcript_line"> things. I&#039;ve actually been very, very lucky, luckier than the vast majority of people I&#039;d say.</div><div id="00:11:12.840" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, it really has impacted for those reasons. Yeah, I&#039;d say for those reasons.</div><div id="00:11:21.880" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re talking to me today from your sofa. Do you have a workspace at home?</div><div id="00:11:27.880" class="transcript_line"> I have an office in my house upstairs, and the internet&#039;s rubbish. So I end up sitting on the</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> sofa and doing work there. The problem is I always used to just work all day anyway,</div><div id="00:11:38.360" class="transcript_line"> so I didn&#039;t really have much of a social boundary. I think now it&#039;s even less so with me working from</div><div id="00:11:45.640" class="transcript_line"> home because I&#039;m constantly working, whereas before, at least if you&#039;re on the train,</div><div id="00:11:50.040" class="transcript_line"> going somewhere, you know, you might have 10 minutes to yourself to think, or what have you.</div><div id="00:11:54.520" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;m not even doing that really. You might break for something to get back. So you end up</div><div id="00:11:58.760" class="transcript_line"> doing a lot more hours. Productivity&#039;s massive. Has it changed your relationship with your</div><div id="00:12:08.040" class="transcript_line"> home and your living area? Do you see it now as one thing, or was it always like that?</div><div id="00:12:13.240" class="transcript_line"> I think for me it was always like that anyway because even when I used to come home,</div><div id="00:12:16.760" class="transcript_line"> when I did go to meetings, I would still sit down and do loads of works and send emails out.</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I think work&#039;s my hobby as well, which is very tragic. But I think it is. And so actually when</div><div id="00:12:28.360" class="transcript_line"> I come home in an evening, when my hours are done, I&#039;ll put the telly on in the background</div><div id="00:12:33.480" class="transcript_line"> and what have you because I like that feeling of being at home. But I can&#039;t just sit and watch</div><div id="00:12:37.640" class="transcript_line"> the television anyway. I&#039;d have to be doing something. So in that respect, no, I don&#039;t think</div><div id="00:12:42.440" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s made much of a difference. So do you talk to anyone at the moment, like a friend or maybe a</div><div id="00:12:51.800" class="transcript_line"> family member, about not just the pandemic but everyday life? No, I don&#039;t think I do, to be honest.</div><div id="00:13:00.920" class="transcript_line"> I talk to staff mostly and that&#039;s on everyday work stuff or I help them with their problems. But</div><div id="00:13:10.440" class="transcript_line"> no, very rarely, to be honest. I speak to my parents once a week online because they&#039;ve now</div><div id="00:13:14.920" class="transcript_line"> moved back to the northeast of England, interestingly, and they did it in the middle</div><div id="00:13:18.920" class="transcript_line"> of the pandemic. So I&#039;m literally isolated now. I just live on my own, which doesn&#039;t seem to affect</div><div id="00:13:24.040" class="transcript_line"> me at the minute for health reasons they need to be up there. But no, I don&#039;t really know.</div><div id="00:13:34.360" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lady called Yvonne Boxall who used to do my job in the past before we give it to somebody</div><div id="00:13:40.600" class="transcript_line"> with lived experience. And I check in with her now and again if I&#039;m worried. So I say once a week,</div><div id="00:13:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I call her and I check in with her and that&#039;s normally about, is this normal? Is this normal?</div><div id="00:13:51.240" class="transcript_line"> Is this normal? So if somebody behaves in a certain way I don&#039;t understand, I check out with Yvonne</div><div id="00:13:56.200" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s like, is that because I&#039;ve got autism? Is that because they know I&#039;m different? And she&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:59.560" class="transcript_line"> sitting there, what&#039;s happened to me all the time? So that&#039;s the kind of stuff I check out. And</div><div id="00:14:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Warrie, is it about Yvonne that makes you feel comfortable talking to her? I think Yvonne gets me</div><div id="00:14:10.920" class="transcript_line"> and very few people do. The amount of psychologists and counselors I&#039;ve had over the years and</div><div id="00:14:16.520" class="transcript_line"> yeah, I&#039;m very complicated like that. But I think it&#039;s because she knows my job.</div><div id="00:14:20.600" class="transcript_line"> We get on well anyway because we just see things very similarly in terms of the third sector.</div><div id="00:14:27.080" class="transcript_line"> And I think over a period of time she&#039;s been able to get to know me. I think as well the fact that</div><div id="00:14:32.280" class="transcript_line"> she comes from a learning disability background as a support worker. She was a special education</div><div id="00:14:37.240" class="transcript_line"> teacher and all that. I think there&#039;s a mixture of all that really means that she&#039;s more</div><div id="00:14:42.200" class="transcript_line"> insightful and understanding of my needs than a lot of people would be. So would you</div><div id="00:14:50.840" class="transcript_line"> would you view her as a friend or maybe a former colleague? I know the distinction can sometimes</div><div id="00:14:56.680" class="transcript_line"> be difficult to make because you know we spend most of our time with our colleagues and often</div><div id="00:15:01.720" class="transcript_line"> they become friends. But how would you view Yvonne in that kind of way? Isn&#039;t that a brilliant</div><div id="00:15:06.760" class="transcript_line"> question? And you might think why? Because you know what? I&#039;ve never thought of that.</div><div id="00:15:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you know I never call anybody a friend and I don&#039;t even know. I guess it&#039;s a friendship I</div><div id="00:15:17.240" class="transcript_line"> suppose. I never think of it as a friendship. I just think of it as this is a I&#039;ll not swear</div><div id="00:15:24.200" class="transcript_line"> because obviously we&#039;re all recorded but I think of it as just one of the very few people in the</div><div id="00:15:28.840" class="transcript_line"> world that don&#039;t get on my nerves. I don&#039;t think of it as a friendship although actually I would</div><div id="00:15:35.800" class="transcript_line"> reciprocate and I would do anything for her if she wanted to and I&#039;m fond of her so maybe it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:15:41.880" class="transcript_line"> friendship. You know I don&#039;t think I understand what a friendship is and maybe I&#039;ve got friendships</div><div id="00:15:47.240" class="transcript_line"> and don&#039;t even know I&#039;ve got them. I know there&#039;s lots of people who call me their friend and I</div><div id="00:15:51.240" class="transcript_line"> think oh that&#039;s nice but I&#039;m not necessarily sure if I&#039;m a friend back. It&#039;s you know.</div><div id="00:15:57.240" class="transcript_line"> How would you view then I presume you&#039;re on Facebook. You know the term friend is used</div><div id="00:16:04.200" class="transcript_line"> quite loosely on there to describe people you&#039;re connected to. Would you describe any of them as</div><div id="00:16:08.280" class="transcript_line"> friends or just I don&#039;t know connections? Yeah I would see them as associates as people we know</div><div id="00:16:15.160" class="transcript_line"> through people first. I use it more as a work platform. Some people call me their friend and</div><div id="00:16:22.440" class="transcript_line"> then I give them a lot of emotional support in the evenings which isn&#039;t really a reciprocal</div><div id="00:16:29.080" class="transcript_line"> relationship really. It&#039;s more me being there to listen to them and speak to them which I&#039;m happy</div><div id="00:16:33.400" class="transcript_line"> to do. So they would see me as a friend. I don&#039;t necessarily see them as friends you know. Interestingly</div><div id="00:16:39.160" class="transcript_line"> enough I just see them as people who have asked me for help and I help them because that&#039;s my nature</div><div id="00:16:47.720" class="transcript_line"> but they would probably be devastated at that because they would see me as a friend.</div><div id="00:16:50.920" class="transcript_line"> So with Yvonne do you listen to her concerns or you know does she chat to you about things</div><div id="00:16:58.600" class="transcript_line"> that are going on? She does. It&#039;s mostly mine to be honest. Not from a selfish point of view but</div><div id="00:17:03.320" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s back to work all the time. She&#039;s to work for us and I&#039;ll give her the updates what&#039;s happening</div><div id="00:17:07.800" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;ll run something past her. But yeah we talk about her too. I&#039;d say it&#039;s about 25% of Yvonne,</div><div id="00:17:13.080" class="transcript_line"> 75% me I&#039;d say. But I do ask about it and I do check in and I ask how her family are and all</div><div id="00:17:18.840" class="transcript_line"> the rest of it and I&#039;ve given her emotional support at times. Mostly it&#039;s me but I don&#039;t phone all the</div><div id="00:17:26.360" class="transcript_line"> time from the you know I phone as I guess I do phone as a friend. I phone when I think about it.</div><div id="00:17:31.160" class="transcript_line"> I phone as a how are you every Sunday or something. Sometimes I phone and say God I&#039;m really sorry</div><div id="00:17:37.400" class="transcript_line"> Yvonne I&#039;m not sure what to do can I have your advice? But mostly it&#039;s a catch-up thing and I</div><div id="00:17:43.320" class="transcript_line"> think because we both come from the one thing we&#039;ve got in common is we both work for all Wales</div><div id="00:17:47.960" class="transcript_line"> people first. So I guess it always comes back down to work for that reason more than anything.</div><div id="00:17:56.200" class="transcript_line"> And do you I know we&#039;re getting inside your topic but do you think</div><div id="00:17:59.880" class="transcript_line"> if a time comes where you leave your current position you would stay in touch with your</div><div id="00:18:04.760" class="transcript_line"> colleagues as friends? I think so yeah I&#039;m not sure. I think Yvonne maybe I&#039;ve got a funny</div><div id="00:18:12.360" class="transcript_line"> feeling I&#039;ll probably lose contact with everybody else when I think actually when I think about it.</div><div id="00:18:16.440" class="transcript_line"> And strange thing if I went to say work in a factory or do something different</div><div id="00:18:20.920" class="transcript_line"> I would be completely isolated. It&#039;s funny it&#039;s because I do my job and because of the nature of</div><div id="00:18:25.960" class="transcript_line"> the job other people learning disabilities then contact me and they want to spend time with me</div><div id="00:18:31.480" class="transcript_line"> and I think that&#039;s where my social validation comes from and I think if I went to an ordinary</div><div id="00:18:37.000" class="transcript_line"> everyday job I would be so isolated and I&#039;d have no purpose left when I think about it.</div><div id="00:18:42.120" class="transcript_line"> When I think about it the more I think about it this job although it doesn&#039;t give you know</div><div id="00:18:47.240" class="transcript_line"> although I don&#039;t maybe distinguish friends the way other people distinguish friends</div><div id="00:18:51.400" class="transcript_line"> actually it&#039;s because of this job that people want to speak to me they know who I am they want to</div><div id="00:18:56.520" class="transcript_line"> chat with me they invite me to stuff so all my social validation comes through this job and the</div><div id="00:19:02.120" class="transcript_line"> nature of what this is. And so as that validation you felt changed since having to do it online</div><div id="00:19:10.280" class="transcript_line"> I know you talked earlier about doubting your abilities. No I think now people want because</div><div id="00:19:15.400" class="transcript_line"> people are lonely and they&#039;re isolated in the lockdown they want to talk more so in the past</div><div id="00:19:20.840" class="transcript_line"> when people might want to chat people want to chat a lot more now because they want somebody to talk</div><div id="00:19:25.400" class="transcript_line"> to and I&#039;m there and I&#039;m happy to talk so I say now it&#039;s increased it&#039;s increased again and because</div><div id="00:19:31.640" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of information that we feed to Welsh Government about members experiences members are</div><div id="00:19:36.440" class="transcript_line"> more likely to reach out now and say Joe can I tell you something can I tell you what&#039;s going</div><div id="00:19:40.760" class="transcript_line"> on for me so yeah. You mentioned that your parents have recently moved back to the North of England</div><div id="00:19:50.520" class="transcript_line"> how did you feel when they told you? It&#039;s really interesting it was my idea funny enough</div><div id="00:19:56.440" class="transcript_line"> not because I was trying to get rid of them but ironically I&#039;m going to be honest look they annoy</div><div id="00:20:03.320" class="transcript_line"> me at times and I feel terrible for it because they love me to bits and if anything happened</div><div id="00:20:07.640" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d be the first there for me but I was just aware my dad&#039;s having health problems more and</div><div id="00:20:14.120" class="transcript_line"> more with cancer and different things and he&#039;s getting treated my mom can&#039;t cope with anything</div><div id="00:20:19.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean literally can&#039;t cope with a thing and there&#039;s no way she can cope we&#039;re looking after</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> me dad and I was just aware that as much as they love living in Wales and I love living in Wales</div><div id="00:20:32.120" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re not really happy they&#039;re not miserable but they were never as happy as they could be</div><div id="00:20:36.920" class="transcript_line"> they missed their grandchildren growing up so I said to them look you know what you&#039;d be better</div><div id="00:20:42.440" class="transcript_line"> off up there because you would see my new nephew who&#039;s just been born they missed the other four</div><div id="00:20:48.280" class="transcript_line"> growing up they&#039;re in their late teens early 20s now there&#039;s a new one born and if my dad has any</div><div id="00:20:54.520" class="transcript_line"> crisis or any health problems my sister&#039;s there to support me mom and be there for them so I suggested</div><div id="00:21:00.360" class="transcript_line"> it and they were over the moon because they&#039;d actually thought about this for a bit themselves</div><div id="00:21:05.640" class="transcript_line"> but didn&#039;t want to leave me in the lurch and I said well no I&#039;ll be all right we&#039;ve got video</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> software we can talk we can still keep in touch but actually it&#039;s better for you it&#039;s better for</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> you there&#039;s nothing for you here now it&#039;s better for you to move forward so that&#039;s how that happened</div><div id="00:21:22.120" class="transcript_line"> so yeah yeah do you do you notice any difference the fact that they&#039;re in the north of England</div><div id="00:21:29.640" class="transcript_line"> compared to when they were maybe up the road with you isn&#039;t it really interesting but not a</div><div id="00:21:33.640" class="transcript_line"> not a difference at all I&#039;m a cool person but no not at all I still talk about football and I&#039;ll</div><div id="00:21:41.400" class="transcript_line"> check the house for them um because they haven&#039;t sold it yet they&#039;re living with me sister&#039;s house</div><div id="00:21:46.680" class="transcript_line"> um but no it&#039;s like nothing&#039;s changed really and and so when things return to normal will you see</div><div id="00:21:54.120" class="transcript_line"> them as often as you used to then? via video I will yeah and I&#039;ll go and visit them for</div><div id="00:22:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Christmases and stuff which would be nice this Christmas is obviously a write-off it seems to be</div><div id="00:22:05.480" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;ll go and visit them for the summer for my birthday for Christmas it&#039;ll be lovely that</div><div id="00:22:09.400" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;ll go to see the northeast again I&#039;ll have somewhere to stay um so yeah I&#039;ll do that</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> but I would say in that respect I guess I would see them just as much as I used to see them</div><div id="00:22:21.080" class="transcript_line"> um sorry go on Joe I was going to say in the past it would come safer to visit my house I</div><div id="00:22:28.360" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t visit them that often because I don&#039;t drive or anything and it&#039;s easy for them to get here</div><div id="00:22:33.320" class="transcript_line"> so I guess it would still be once a week but on video instead of once a week in person</div><div id="00:22:39.320" class="transcript_line"> and did am I right in thinking they had a dog oh yes yes um Tigger yes Tiggs now I think I</div><div id="00:22:48.360" class="transcript_line"> spoke last time about how I could really relate to him and I gave him a hug and I was always</div><div id="00:22:53.160" class="transcript_line"> squeezing Tigger when he got put down last November would you believe oh I&#039;m sorry to hear that</div><div id="00:22:59.320" class="transcript_line"> yeah it was an interesting one because and this is where my emotions got very very strange</div><div id="00:23:04.360" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s an autism logic thing or whether I&#039;m just cold but I love Tiggs and every</div><div id="00:23:08.920" class="transcript_line"> time I saw him I couldn&#039;t resist squeezing him and kissing him and all the other stuff but when he</div><div id="00:23:13.160" class="transcript_line"> was put down my mum and dad were in tears we all went to the vet and what have you he had cancer</div><div id="00:23:17.320" class="transcript_line"> he had to get put down but I was just so logical about it all and I thought well</div><div id="00:23:23.880" class="transcript_line"> if we let if we don&#039;t do the procedure now in a month or two&#039;s time they reckon he could die</div><div id="00:23:29.560" class="transcript_line"> in real agony in real discomfort so I thought well actually let&#039;s celebrate his life let&#039;s</div><div id="00:23:34.760" class="transcript_line"> celebrate the love we give him and what he gave back for us but we have a wonderful gift because</div><div id="00:23:39.320" class="transcript_line"> we can end this for him now we have control of the situation and we can put him out of his misery now</div><div id="00:23:46.280" class="transcript_line"> not many human beings get that opportunity human beings in the same position would just have to</div><div id="00:23:51.080" class="transcript_line"> die in agony we&#039;re in a position to to control this for him and I&#039;m not saying when I got home</div><div id="00:23:57.400" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t feel a kind of sickening knot in my stomach but for me it was almost like he was there</div><div id="00:24:03.960" class="transcript_line"> now he&#039;s not there and it was that that black and white even though what you know I think about him</div><div id="00:24:08.680" class="transcript_line"> a lot and I think about squeezing him a lot and I think about hugging him a lot I don&#039;t kind of</div><div id="00:24:13.160" class="transcript_line"> feel the need to burst into tears the way my parents do and so would it be fair do you miss</div><div id="00:24:21.160" class="transcript_line"> him and everything he gave you or is it just you miss what he was able to give you in terms of</div><div id="00:24:28.120" class="transcript_line"> you know squeezing him and and affection and things it&#039;s really strange you know I&#039;m very</div><div id="00:24:33.480" class="transcript_line"> fond of him and I have fun thoughts of him but I don&#039;t miss him do you would you like if your</div><div id="00:24:43.720" class="transcript_line"> parents got another dog do you think you would be as attached to that dog as you are as you were</div><div id="00:24:48.520" class="transcript_line"> yeah I&#039;d be silly with him I&#039;d be absolutely daft yeah we had a Yorkshire Terrier before him and I</div><div id="00:24:54.120" class="transcript_line"> was the same with him it&#039;s weird I get I&#039;m crazy about them when they&#039;re around and I love them and</div><div id="00:25:00.760" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t leave them alone but then when they&#039;re gone it&#039;s like my brain just thinks oh they&#039;re</div><div id="00:25:04.680" class="transcript_line"> gone and it doesn&#039;t see the logic in crying or getting upset about it I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s an</div><div id="00:25:09.800" class="transcript_line"> autistic thing or what but it&#039;s just logic it&#039;s like oh they&#039;re gone now oh it&#039;s interesting</div><div id="00:25:15.560" class="transcript_line"> and so have you have you entertained the idea of maybe getting a dog yourself</div><div id="00:25:20.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah well funny enough I did and then I thought because I live on my own especially my parents</div><div id="00:25:25.080" class="transcript_line"> have gone because I stay away overnight at times there&#039;d be nobody there for the dog so I thought</div><div id="00:25:30.600" class="transcript_line"> maybe I better not do that I did think about getting a cat I&#039;m not a massive fan of cats but</div><div id="00:25:35.560" class="transcript_line"> they reckon there&#039;s a breed of cat who are quite like dogs who are affectionate but because they</div><div id="00:25:40.600" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t need so much attention I thought we&#039;d be getting two cats so they could keep each other</div><div id="00:25:45.320" class="transcript_line"> company and I could leave a litter tray for them and food when I go out I did consider that for a</div><div id="00:25:50.600" class="transcript_line"> bit but I think the practically I&#039;m not sure whether I could but yeah I&#039;d love a dog really</div><div id="00:25:58.920" class="transcript_line"> ideally I&#039;m just not sure how fair it would be with me being living on my own so sorry did you</div><div id="00:26:05.240" class="transcript_line"> say you had a cat oh sorry no I considered having a cat all right sorry and I thought if I considered</div><div id="00:26:10.440" class="transcript_line"> getting two cats then they could keep each other company and if I did go out somewhere it wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:15.800" class="transcript_line"> be so so bad it&#039;d be cruel even a dog but with cats that have got company and they&#039;ve got their</div><div id="00:26:20.680" class="transcript_line"> food they&#039;re more likely to cope because I think dogs always need that hug and that reassurance and</div><div id="00:26:30.280" class="transcript_line"> pardon me so I mean one of the areas we&#039;re talking about with people is around physical intimacy but</div><div id="00:26:38.360" class="transcript_line"> I suppose how have your feelings on that changed since lockdown it really hasn&#039;t you know I&#039;m not</div><div id="00:26:44.680" class="transcript_line"> kidding you one of the things I&#039;ve done in the evenings I&#039;ve been I&#039;ve been watching box sets of</div><div id="00:26:49.400" class="transcript_line"> things and I never saw shameless ever I knew about I never saw it so I was watching shameless and</div><div id="00:26:56.920" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s an interesting one because when there&#039;s sex scenes and stuff and it&#039;s like a sexy thing I get</div><div id="00:27:03.400" class="transcript_line"> attracted to it you know what I mean I get kind of I get turned on by it by one of an expression</div><div id="00:27:08.680" class="transcript_line"> but it still fascinates me that this is actually real that it&#039;s done and I know that it&#039;s one</div><div id="00:27:15.640" class="transcript_line"> thing for me to think it but I would never ever make that connection still with oh I</div><div id="00:27:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m attracted to this person why don&#039;t I see this through why don&#039;t I see for one of the better</div><div id="00:27:27.080" class="transcript_line"> words why don&#039;t I see if I can get it on with them and see if we can do this and when I watch</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> things like shameless okay it&#039;s exaggerated and it&#039;s over the top but you actually think</div><div id="00:27:36.040" class="transcript_line"> but you actually think oh people actually do have sex and people actually do do this stuff</div><div id="00:27:39.480" class="transcript_line"> and this is real and I&#039;m like wow and that makes me question myself again why am I different why</div><div id="00:27:45.000" class="transcript_line"> am I cool why am I this and then I just seem to forget that this stuff happens and I still</div><div id="00:27:50.120" class="transcript_line"> find it fascinating that everyday respectable people in society who might get embarrassed if</div><div id="00:27:56.680" class="transcript_line"> people mention sexual things at the same time actually have sex are not embarrassed about that</div><div id="00:28:03.160" class="transcript_line"> but yet don&#039;t like talking about it it&#039;s yeah so long short answer no it</div><div id="00:28:11.880" class="transcript_line"> still hasn&#039;t changed still and I even think people I know females I know who I get on quite well with</div><div id="00:28:18.600" class="transcript_line"> I think what would it be like to be their boyfriend I wonder what it would be like this</div><div id="00:28:21.400" class="transcript_line"> and the other and there&#039;s no feeling inside there&#039;s no other than oh that&#039;s strange it just</div><div id="00:28:28.040" class="transcript_line"> doesn&#039;t seem logical you know I see boyfriends and girlfriends who just met each other madly</div><div id="00:28:33.480" class="transcript_line"> in love and I think well how can you be madly in love with a complete stranger I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:28:40.280" class="transcript_line"> so when things return to normal what what would you be looking forward to doing</div><div id="00:28:47.080" class="transcript_line"> first that perhaps you can&#039;t do now you know what&#039;s really interesting is in a strange way</div><div id="00:28:54.040" class="transcript_line"> nothing would change for me I&#039;d be looking forward to getting on with the business this is a</div><div id="00:28:59.160" class="transcript_line"> terribly terribly square answer but I&#039;d be looking forward to getting on with the business plan that</div><div id="00:29:04.840" class="transcript_line"> we were funded by Welsh Government to do which meant going out and doing outward things my biggest</div><div id="00:29:10.120" class="transcript_line"> inconveniences were having to find other ways to do things that were meant to deliver outside</div><div id="00:29:16.440" class="transcript_line"> I guess like this project for a certain extent I imagine you&#039;re imagining you&#039;re expecting to</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> interview me in person via video or what have you or sound recorder and we&#039;re doing it via zoom</div><div id="00:29:27.400" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s more I want to get back to doing what we plan to do in the business plan I think</div><div id="00:29:33.320" class="transcript_line"> straightforward as that and do you think things will go back to how they were before do you think</div><div id="00:29:38.680" class="transcript_line"> things will have changed slightly I on my instinct is that 2021 is a write-off I hate to see it I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:29:45.800" class="transcript_line"> got a feeling that&#039;s already gone I think 2022 it will be back to normal in terms of coronavirus</div><div id="00:29:53.240" class="transcript_line"> being safe but I think there will be differences in this experience that people will incorporate</div><div id="00:30:00.120" class="transcript_line"> so I think there&#039;ll be certain other organizations who might also close their offices and think well</div><div id="00:30:04.040" class="transcript_line"> actually we can work from home I think there&#039;ll be some other people who see the benefits of social</div><div id="00:30:08.760" class="transcript_line"> video media interfacing and interviews I think there&#039;ll be an element of that</div><div id="00:30:15.640" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think there&#039;ll be lessons learned in that respect</div><div id="00:30:20.920" class="transcript_line"> what has all of this period you know COVID coronavirus whatever you want to call it what</div><div id="00:30:25.960" class="transcript_line"> has it meant to you I think for me it&#039;s exactly I think what&#039;s really interesting is and I&#039;m coming</div><div id="00:30:32.360" class="transcript_line"> back to a political work situation here but what&#039;s really interesting is you know in the</div><div id="00:30:38.600" class="transcript_line"> work that I do we&#039;ve talked about coronavirus and the unfair impact on people with learning</div><div id="00:30:44.760" class="transcript_line"> disabilities and what have you but I think what this has really shown to me is that</div><div id="00:30:49.480" class="transcript_line"> coronavirus is not the problem coronavirus just exacerbates an injustice that was already been</div><div id="00:30:57.640" class="transcript_line"> there anyway in terms of choice control people making decisions for other people without</div><div id="00:31:05.880" class="transcript_line"> concluding them and the mortality problems for people learning disabilities that were there before</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re the same mortality problems under COVID is the COVID hasn&#039;t caused</div><div id="00:31:15.720" class="transcript_line"> hasn&#039;t caused the inequalities and the inequalities were already there and I think</div><div id="00:31:19.880" class="transcript_line"> what it&#039;s taught me more than anything is again whenever there&#039;s a crisis of any type</div><div id="00:31:25.400" class="transcript_line"> it is the most vulnerable people who are always going to be affected first</div><div id="00:31:31.880" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the right answer to give in terms of me personally but I think it again it</div><div id="00:31:36.600" class="transcript_line"> comes back to down to my job and my work it just refocuses this idea of the injustice the social</div><div id="00:31:43.640" class="transcript_line"> injustice</div><div id="00:31:48.760" class="transcript_line"> and so do you have any like concerns about the next two months I think winter is going to be a</div><div id="00:31:56.440" class="transcript_line"> really really difficult time for you personally or in terms of work um personally and work</div><div id="00:32:03.160" class="transcript_line"> yeah personally no personally I&#039;m looking forward to it I&#039;ve got a new settee coming</div><div id="00:32:07.640" class="transcript_line"> after I wrecked this one and I&#039;m looking forward to having a Christmas and I&#039;m looking forward to</div><div id="00:32:11.960" class="transcript_line"> switching my brain off because I really need to do that because it&#039;s obsessive anyway and</div><div id="00:32:16.280" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s thinking and it&#039;s whatever um work-wise yeah I think I think winter is going to be a</div><div id="00:32:21.400" class="transcript_line"> terrible time for people with learning disabilities in lots of ways um there&#039;s going to be more</div><div id="00:32:26.920" class="transcript_line"> inequalities obviously the potential isolation the day centres still aren&#039;t open um in some cases</div><div id="00:32:34.520" class="transcript_line"> I think the longer it goes on the harder it is to tolerate and and and to keep up to date with so</div><div id="00:32:41.080" class="transcript_line"> yeah I think winter is going to be a really tough time for people with learning disabilities even</div><div id="00:32:46.760" class="transcript_line"> tougher than it&#039;s been so far and so do you think there&#039;s any positive things that have come out of</div><div id="00:32:54.200" class="transcript_line"> all all of the last seven months I think there&#039;s been a lot of positives isn&#039;t that a strange thing</div><div id="00:33:01.240" class="transcript_line"> I think one of the things we&#039;re seeing is as much as our members people learn disabilities</div><div id="00:33:06.040" class="transcript_line"> in some ways have suffered a lot of negativity in some ways they&#039;ve also been more</div><div id="00:33:12.360" class="transcript_line"> more involved in their local communities because local communities who have often kind of shied</div><div id="00:33:18.200" class="transcript_line"> away from people with learning disabilities because they&#039;ve kind of rallied around and</div><div id="00:33:23.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve tried to get uh make sure everybody in the community&#039;s got food and what have you</div><div id="00:33:28.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s actually meant people learn to be more involved in the community than maybe they</div><div id="00:33:32.440" class="transcript_line"> were before some of our members have actually helped local councils with litter collection</div><div id="00:33:37.640" class="transcript_line"> and different stuff they&#039;ve been involved in that respect I think the increase in digital literacy</div><div id="00:33:43.720" class="transcript_line"> of people with learning disabilities has vastly increased and I think it would have been more of</div><div id="00:33:48.440" class="transcript_line"> a challenge to do this in non-covid times I guess as I was saying before they&#039;ve been forced to have</div><div id="00:33:55.560" class="transcript_line"> to do it necessity is the mother of invention and all that so their digital literacy has increased</div><div id="00:34:03.000" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve saw real leadership as well there have been some members who become real leaders who&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:34:07.960" class="transcript_line"> there for other people who&#039;ve done online events and quizzes to help other people they become real</div><div id="00:34:12.840" class="transcript_line"> self-advocates real champions they&#039;ve had their voice heard so there&#039;s been a lot of positives</div><div id="00:34:18.280" class="transcript_line"> actually I think I think no doubt about that and you mentioned Christmas um what will you do</div><div id="00:34:27.480" class="transcript_line"> at Christmas now absolutely nothing which is I&#039;m gonna love it&#039;s gonna be bizarre I&#039;ll have my</div><div id="00:34:33.640" class="transcript_line"> house done all beautiful ready for Christmas and I&#039;ll have it all spic and span I&#039;ll have my new</div><div id="00:34:37.880" class="transcript_line"> sofa and I might play the PlayStation and I&#039;ll just have a very sedate non-thinking few days</div><div id="00:34:46.840" class="transcript_line"> and that to me would be bliss will you see anyone or talk to anyone via the internet</div><div id="00:34:53.400" class="transcript_line"> my mom and dad probably I&#039;ll say well definitely more than likely I&#039;ll say hello to on video</div><div id="00:34:58.280" class="transcript_line"> chats and what have you and new year um but that would be it I&#039;d imagine</div><div id="00:35:06.520" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;re fine with that oh absolutely no definitely I can hear how I&#039;m sounding when</div><div id="00:35:13.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m saying this but yeah it&#039;s uh it&#039;s bliss for me I think part of that just because my brain&#039;s</div><div id="00:35:19.800" class="transcript_line"> constantly overloaded um I&#039;ve been looking at stuff because I&#039;m always trying to second guess</div><div id="00:35:25.000" class="transcript_line"> who am I who am I and I think I fit into this thing called the highly sensitive person</div><div id="00:35:29.960" class="transcript_line"> which I&#039;ve seen online and I think the volume and the is turned up I&#039;ve got such a rich inner life</div><div id="00:35:36.440" class="transcript_line"> and the volume of my thoughts in the world is so high that um I think one of the reasons I live</div><div id="00:35:43.160" class="transcript_line"> and think the way I do isn&#039;t just somebody with autism although this could be part of it too I</div><div id="00:35:48.600" class="transcript_line"> think it is because the volume&#039;s turned up and I need so much downtime and switch off time to to</div><div id="00:35:55.560" class="transcript_line"> exist that where other people might be absolutely driven to distraction for me it&#039;s just like</div><div id="00:36:01.720" class="transcript_line"> somebody needing a nap it needing to disengage how have you found shopping for food during all of</div><div id="00:36:10.600" class="transcript_line"> this I&#039;m laughing because I got done for shoplifting last week that story it&#039;s hilarious um</div><div id="00:36:19.560" class="transcript_line"> uh five long story short fine it was it was a problem at first because I couldn&#039;t go to</div><div id="00:36:24.120" class="transcript_line"> supermarkets that didn&#039;t drive and my dad couldn&#039;t get me to supermarkets or anything like that</div><div id="00:36:29.560" class="transcript_line"> because of he had health concerns as well and in them days you know weren&#039;t meant to mix households</div><div id="00:36:34.120" class="transcript_line"> and all that so I had to get a taxi when I had to do a supermarket run and that was more of a pain</div><div id="00:36:39.480" class="transcript_line"> and it was an inconvenience and I had to pay for for taxis the uh I the shoplifting thing was an</div><div id="00:36:45.560" class="transcript_line"> accident it was last week um I went to the supermarket thought I&#039;d done the chip and</div><div id="00:36:50.040" class="transcript_line"> pin on the machine long story short and right in front of an armed policeman who was behind me I</div><div id="00:36:54.520" class="transcript_line"> just walked out my shopping and this stopped me and I explained it it was all sorted it was all fine</div><div id="00:37:00.520" class="transcript_line"> so I think I&#039;m get definitely getting absent-minded as well um yeah and how do you</div><div id="00:37:09.160" class="transcript_line"> feel about the face masks oh I hate them I really do um I just find them so hot and uncomfortable</div><div id="00:37:18.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean I you know I use them and I and I obey the rules and one of those people and I would never be</div><div id="00:37:24.200" class="transcript_line"> irresponsible I&#039;m not going to panic over Covid if I get it I get it and if I&#039;ve got to die I&#039;ll die</div><div id="00:37:31.960" class="transcript_line"> you know and I know it&#039;s a terrible thing to say but the point I&#039;m trying to make is I would never</div><div id="00:37:36.040" class="transcript_line"> break the rules and I would always follow the rules for other people&#039;s safety and well-being</div><div id="00:37:41.400" class="transcript_line"> but I&#039;m not one of those people who was going to panic about it either life too short I&#039;m just</div><div id="00:37:47.080" class="transcript_line"> going to get on with it and do my best um I hate the mask because it&#039;s red hot it steams me glasses</div><div id="00:37:52.760" class="transcript_line"> up and after a few seconds I find it hard to breathe so yeah real real inconvenience and I</div><div id="00:37:59.640" class="transcript_line"> keep forgetting to bring them to the shops and I&#039;ve got to keep coming back and getting them</div><div id="00:38:03.960" class="transcript_line"> and how do you feel when you see other people wearing it have you communicated with anyone</div><div id="00:38:07.880" class="transcript_line"> wearing a mask I haven&#039;t but when I first saw people wearing masks to my shame I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:38:14.680" class="transcript_line"> in the supermarkets I remember thinking you fool what are you doing this is before with mandatory</div><div id="00:38:20.120" class="transcript_line"> and everything and I thought well come on that&#039;s over the top isn&#039;t it um maybe that was foolish</div><div id="00:38:25.480" class="transcript_line"> of me maybe that was ignorant of me with hindsight now um now I just see it as a necessary thing a</div><div id="00:38:33.000" class="transcript_line"> necessary evil to be fair at that time as well I think you know in Wales it was advised that</div><div id="00:38:38.680" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no evidence for masks as well there was no need for you to wear them you know that was the</div><div id="00:38:43.320" class="transcript_line"> official advice then to be fair to myself but but no I don&#039;t really think twice about them</div><div id="00:38:50.520" class="transcript_line"> is it do you find it um difficult if you were to communicate with someone you couldn&#039;t see their</div><div id="00:38:57.880" class="transcript_line"> mouth so they&#039;re you know half of their face or would it bother you no it just bothered me to be</div><div id="00:39:03.240" class="transcript_line"> honest in some ways it&#039;s it&#039;s it&#039;s socially easier because you know in terms of um it&#039;s less</div><div id="00:39:11.240" class="transcript_line"> sensory in part when I say if I don&#039;t see people&#039;s mouths and because I don&#039;t see the</div><div id="00:39:16.520" class="transcript_line"> expressions on their faces I don&#039;t then have to overreact in terms of did they mean this</div><div id="00:39:21.880" class="transcript_line"> did they mean that did they mean the other I can just take the words for what as long as they&#039;re</div><div id="00:39:25.480" class="transcript_line"> clear enough I can just take them at whatever their word is and how about the the two meter</div><div id="00:39:32.520" class="transcript_line"> thing in shops um how have you found trying to follow that I&#039;ve been all right with that I found</div><div id="00:39:40.040" class="transcript_line"> it more inconvenient than anything but I&#039;m aware we have to do it um if anything I get more ratty</div><div id="00:39:47.000" class="transcript_line"> at the fact that it means that the queues are like sometimes really long or they were long</div><div id="00:39:52.360" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m one of those people I get really impatient because I just want to get on</div><div id="00:39:55.720" class="transcript_line"> go to the shops get back and do what I want to do so I&#039;m more affected by my own impatience and</div><div id="00:40:00.920" class="transcript_line"> the fact that I can&#039;t get on and do stuff the way I want to do it but but I obey it and there&#039;s no</div><div id="00:40:06.440" class="transcript_line"> issues with that it&#039;s more of a selfish thing really um and do you currently or</div><div id="00:40:14.120" class="transcript_line"> understand the rules have you always understood the rules of the as they have been announced</div><div id="00:40:19.080" class="transcript_line"> do you know what&#039;s really weird here and I&#039;m going to be really honest with you</div><div id="00:40:22.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never really understood them I know what the rules are but I can&#039;t honestly say I&#039;ve always</div><div id="00:40:29.240" class="transcript_line"> known why we have to do it I know it&#039;s a thing called covid and I know it keeps us safe I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:40:34.120" class="transcript_line"> had such little interest it&#039;s really weird and I think this is where it goes back to me living in</div><div id="00:40:37.960" class="transcript_line"> my own bubble I know this thing called covid I know people could get ill I know people could die</div><div id="00:40:43.560" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s very serious and in order to stop that happening you&#039;ve got to do x y and z so I do x y</div><div id="00:40:49.080" class="transcript_line"> and z I play the game but do I know why I&#039;m doing x y and z exactly for whatever individual reason</div><div id="00:40:55.560" class="transcript_line"> probably not have you ever found the rules themselves confusing or pretty clear to follow</div><div id="00:41:04.200" class="transcript_line"> I find them confusing just from the point of view that they&#039;re so contradictory a lot of them are</div><div id="00:41:11.560" class="transcript_line"> guidance they&#039;re not necessarily rules they&#039;re open to interpretation they&#039;re changing then</div><div id="00:41:17.320" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got the communication from Wales and Scotland the fact that it&#039;s such a big big issue</div><div id="00:41:22.520" class="transcript_line"> and you can&#039;t hide from it I get overloaded by that and I think that&#039;s part of the reason why I</div><div id="00:41:28.280" class="transcript_line"> kind of just switch off to it and my attitude is just tell me what I&#039;ve got to do and I&#039;ll do it</div><div id="00:41:34.520" class="transcript_line"> but not necessarily fully understanding exactly why</div><div id="00:41:40.280" class="transcript_line"> So I think that&#039;s about it Joe unless there&#039;s anything else that you think you may have missed</div><div id="00:41:47.640" class="transcript_line"> talking about do anything you wanted to say no I think that&#039;s it really I think the main thing is</div><div id="00:41:52.760" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s just my lesson the big big thing I&#039;ve learned as I said before it&#039;s just I guess I do need</div><div id="00:41:58.040" class="transcript_line"> people even if I didn&#039;t think I did I think that&#039;s been a big learning curve for me in a big lesson</div><div id="00:42:03.480" class="transcript_line"> yeah and will that and will the fact that you now realize that change how you go about things</div><div id="00:42:14.280" class="transcript_line"> I think so I think what it will do is I think my well-being will get better as well I think</div><div id="00:42:20.200" class="transcript_line"> like I say even going out just to another organization in Cardiff for a meeting for an</div><div id="00:42:25.160" class="transcript_line"> hour or two and coming back breaks of the day makes you feel better about yourself I think those</div><div id="00:42:30.440" class="transcript_line"> mornings when you get up and you&#039;re not always motivated especially in a cold morning to go to</div><div id="00:42:35.160" class="transcript_line"> a meeting in the morning or why we&#039;re having this meeting it&#039;ll make you realize well the</div><div id="00:42:39.960" class="transcript_line"> alternative is remember there was a time Joe when you were in the house 24 7 you know</div><div id="00:42:46.520" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you very much Joe I&#039;m going to stop recording now brilliant</div><div id="00:42:52.360" class="transcript_line"> if I how do I do it oh no I think it just keeps recording till we stop the call actually</div><div id="00:42:57.080" class="transcript_line"> stop recording here we are</div></div></p>
