    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Richard Howell Shaw. I am a person, not a native of Newport but I&#039;ve frequented</div><div id="00:00:18.040" class="transcript_line"> it on many occasions. I will be telling you my experience of watching the cult on the</div><div id="00:00:26.720" class="transcript_line"> Love Electric tour sometime in the late 80s. I can&#039;t quite exactly work out when it was.</div><div id="00:00:34.800" class="transcript_line"> Newport Centre. I think it was my first gig. I&#039;m not sure. My first proper gig. It was,</div><div id="00:00:42.640" class="transcript_line"> so I went to see Public Enemy and I&#039;ve got a timeline thing going on so I can&#039;t quite</div><div id="00:00:49.120" class="transcript_line"> work out whether it was Public Enemy or the cult. Quite a difference between the two.</div><div id="00:00:53.920" class="transcript_line"> What was memorable about it was I was very young. I was still in school so I must have been,</div><div id="00:01:02.680" class="transcript_line"> I was less than 16, so maybe 15 or 14 years old and I was making my own attempts at trying to be</div><div id="00:01:14.320" class="transcript_line"> a young man I guess and it was an interesting, kind of scary experience because I was in a</div><div id="00:01:21.600" class="transcript_line"> large town and I&#039;m used to small villages because I was surrounded by people who were drunk and I</div><div id="00:01:30.520" class="transcript_line"> wasn&#039;t. That&#039;s probably another reason why it&#039;s my most memorable gig because I wasn&#039;t heavily</div><div id="00:01:35.800" class="transcript_line"> intoxicated. I was wearing a pair of tight black jeans, winkle pickers and a ski jacket.</div><div id="00:01:49.960" class="transcript_line"> I hadn&#039;t quite formed my luck by that time or maybe my budget hadn&#039;t extended to a black jacket</div><div id="00:02:00.360" class="transcript_line"> and I certainly didn&#039;t know what the opportunity was. I was wondering if I could, if I may be a</div><div id="00:02:07.160" class="transcript_line"> goth. The most memorable bit of the gig I think was the spitting. The audience was spitting at</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> the band and I remember Ian Asbury, the singer of the cult, said Anymore Flamon was stopping</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> the gig and I believe that Billy Duffy shouted yeah. They carried on so my assumption is there</div><div id="00:02:30.560" class="transcript_line"> was less spitting but that doesn&#039;t really go with the punk ethos of the early cult maybe,</div><div id="00:02:36.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. Was there a punk ethos with the cult? I mean I wasn&#039;t spitting, it wasn&#039;t my fault.</div><div id="00:02:41.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what Ian Asbury&#039;s mum looks like but I can hazard a guess. I think he was wearing a</div><div id="00:02:49.720" class="transcript_line"> large fur hat and a leather jacket but I&#039;m just, no, I&#039;m just, that&#039;s a composite of imagery from</div><div id="00:03:02.560" class="transcript_line"> that time. He was probably wearing a lot of phlegm as well. Yeah I would say there were a number of</div><div id="00:03:12.480" class="transcript_line"> goth types, there were some punk types. I mean I think back in those days people tended to kind</div><div id="00:03:24.760" class="transcript_line"> of, there was an element of tribalism but people would also come together for certain acts so</div><div id="00:03:29.880" class="transcript_line"> definitely felt like there was a culture thing going on. There weren&#039;t too many people like me</div><div id="00:03:36.240" class="transcript_line"> but then I was very young to be going there and I think Eve and I was aware of that at the time,</div><div id="00:03:41.680" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s why I was slightly scared. Felt like a different world. I think there were about three</div><div id="00:03:49.440" class="transcript_line"> or four of us from school. I can&#039;t remember how we got here, I can&#039;t remember how we got back,</div><div id="00:03:53.280" class="transcript_line"> but we did. I can&#039;t remember how I negotiated that with my parents either but it&#039;s my first</div><div id="00:03:59.760" class="transcript_line"> proper gig. I think, I&#039;m not clear, it could have been public anyway. I would say it would be cold</div><div id="00:04:08.080" class="transcript_line"> because yes once again I was wearing a ski jacket. I felt pretty cool in school. I felt slightly</div><div id="00:04:15.200" class="transcript_line"> more unruly. I felt that I was slightly better maybe than other people or I had a little bit</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> of a secret. I was feeling quite young. I probably felt connected, happy and joyful.</div></div></p>
