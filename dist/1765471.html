It started as a very informal chat between Jack and myself.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve had to carry on ever since. Nobody else seemed to want to take over.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But my greatest problem throughout the years has been getting Welsh recordings.</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re not very plentiful here.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And it has been a problem. Though since my visit to Wales in 1973,</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I fortunately was able to obtain some recordings.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I should mention here that many recordings which were available were not worthy of broadcast.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And CKUA is very, very particular as to the quality.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So unfortunately, some of the discs I had were just not worthy of broadcast.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> However, we&#039;ve worried through. And I&#039;m happy to say that I do get much encouragement.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> There are times when I feel it&#039;s not quite worth the effort.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then all of a sudden I either receive mail or telephone calls from the most unexpected places.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think it would be of interest for people to know that non-Welsh people seem to be terribly interested in this program.</div><div id="00:06:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And for this reason, I do a great deal of research and try to explain the traditions of Wales,</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> particularly the musical parts such as the gamamba, the ysdewod, noson lawan, and that type of thing.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, I describe the countryside.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of my greatest thrills two years ago was to go into a shoe store in Edmonton.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the clerk said, You must be Mrs. Len Williams. I had never seen the man before.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, Good gracious, how did you know that?</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he said, I recognize your voice.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I&#039;m so glad that I&#039;ve had this opportunity of speaking with you,</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;d like you to know that my Canadian-born wife, he was an Englishman, by the way,</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> insisted that they go to the Llangollen Ysdewod and to the Royal National Ysdewod that particular year.</div><div id="00:07:44.000" class="transcript_line"> It was about two or three years ago.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> After my explanation of these festivals and describing them.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was one instance where I felt it was well worth the effort I put into it.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve also had some interesting interviews.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> A few years back, I had the famous North American American, Welsh American baritone, Thomas L. Thomas.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was a delightful person to interview.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> He was here in Edmonton having a concert, holding a concert on our Celebrity Series,</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> which brought all the stars across the continent, really, on the series Celebrity Concerts.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t in any way connected with the Welsh society.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But I had this interview with Mr. Thomas.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I also had a very interesting interview with Mr. John Williams Hughes of Maryam Glass, Anglesey,</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> who is a very distant relative of my husband&#039;s and a well-known lecturer in the United States</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and well-known in Wales and throughout Britain as a broadcaster and a journalist.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> John spent a weekend with us.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was one that I also interviewed.</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m not going to be interviewing you, Glenys.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I do my next program on the 11th of July.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course at that time I&#039;ll be giving details of the Gammanbagany in Penocha,</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> which is now becoming quite an institution in Alberta.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We have Gammanbagany in Edmonton each year, usually in the winter over our 1st of March celebrations.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> This year we had it on the 28th of April.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had Mr. Edwell Parry, our conductor.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He was also an international figure.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s known in Wales as well as in the United States.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the annual summer Gammanbagany will be in Penocha in August.</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So these are things that are always of interest to broadcast to the people.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And you managed to get over to the Canadian in Edmonton,</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> a little of the Welsh tradition and the Welsh way of life.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I find that is so.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> When I first started, I was absolutely amazed to find that people couldn&#039;t believe</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> that we had a language of our own.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And that we had so many wonderful seats of learning in Wales,</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> the various colleges, the Aberystwyth and Bangor, and of course the University in Cardiff and so on.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was greatly encouraged to go into that angle as well as the music.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Now the program is introduced as the music and tradition of Wales.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So it gives me great scope.</div><div id="00:11:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But nevertheless it takes a great deal of research as well.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I do all the research and the arranging of the programs.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And also commenting. I do the commentaries.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And what more can I say about it now?</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> How long have you been in Canada?</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;re putting me on the spot. I&#039;m certainly going to be dating myself.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I came out here with my mother and my younger sister in 1914.</div><div id="00:11:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Our father had come out the year before.</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And therefore we rather consider our parents in something of the light of pioneers here.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Certainly Edmonton wasn&#039;t the metropolis that it is now.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But you would be interested to know that even then there was a very active Welsh church here.</div><div id="00:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a Welsh minister and it was connected with a Presbyterial in the United States.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And the church flourished until, oh I would say, the early 1920s.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it seemed to drift into a society more than the church services.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Welsh Society of Edmonton has gone on continuously since then.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had our ups and downs with membership.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We hope that we struggle along regardless.</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Some years we go along with a very encouraging membership.</div><div id="00:12:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And all of a sudden it will dwindle down and then come back again.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve been very active this last 10 or 12 years.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And have sponsored the Gordraraan Choir here.</div><div id="00:13:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And various concerts of course.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> We have a St. David&#039;s Welsh male voice choir here.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Though in latter years I&#039;m afraid there are not too many Welsh speaking gentlemen in this group.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s a fairly active group here.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And what about the Welsh language?</div></div></p>
