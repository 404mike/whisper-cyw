So what was Alice and Menorah Land? How did you go about organising that?</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> Well I just auditioned the children.</div><div id="00:00:27.760" class="transcript_line"> And then did you write the play or did you write the script?</div><div id="00:00:31.200" class="transcript_line"> No, it was given to me.</div><div id="00:00:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Who did that then?</div><div id="00:00:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Well the reform rabbi, he had it.</div><div id="00:00:42.400" class="transcript_line"> Was it children or adults?</div><div id="00:00:44.800" class="transcript_line"> No, children.</div><div id="00:00:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Just children?</div><div id="00:00:47.320" class="transcript_line"> And were there any stage people helping out as well?</div><div id="00:00:50.840" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had to have eight candles large enough to conceal the children.</div><div id="00:00:59.320" class="transcript_line"> So I was going through the halls one day, you know the house of Fraser,</div><div id="00:01:04.600" class="transcript_line"> and in the window, it was just before Christmas, so I saw these big candles.</div><div id="00:01:13.320" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, well I don&#039;t lose anything, so I went in, asked to see the display manager,</div><div id="00:01:19.320" class="transcript_line"> I said, can I borrow those? And he said yes.</div><div id="00:01:23.560" class="transcript_line"> How they were transported, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And the next time, many years later, when I produced the play again,</div><div id="00:01:32.520" class="transcript_line"> and fortunately the father of one of the children had a shop, a furniture shop,</div><div id="00:01:39.800" class="transcript_line"> and he sold linoleum. So we have these big rolls of miloaneum,</div><div id="00:01:46.680" class="transcript_line"> and we had orange paper on top for the lit candle, and that concealed the children.</div><div id="00:01:54.840" class="transcript_line"> So did the children appear or what happened?</div><div id="00:01:57.400" class="transcript_line"> Well I had to use the candles so that they sort of wove in and out.</div><div id="00:02:04.200" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what the third Hanukkah play was about?</div><div id="00:02:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Two of those, and the other one, it started with a boy and girl playing with a chemistry set,</div><div id="00:02:15.160" class="transcript_line"> and all of a sudden it explodes. They found themselves in the land of</div><div id="00:02:24.680" class="transcript_line"> the Maccabeans and the Greeks, and they told the story of Hanukkah was told.</div><div id="00:02:33.240" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what it was about. I know that the leading girl also did a dance,</div><div id="00:02:41.480" class="transcript_line"> which I choreographed, and I had eight little girls. Among them was my little girl,</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> who was what, about six at that time. So I did a little dance for the eight candles as well.</div><div id="00:02:55.320" class="transcript_line"> So was this part of a service or was it an extra, or how did it fit into the synagogue&#039;s calendar?</div><div id="00:03:02.360" class="transcript_line"> No, this was just part of the celebration of Hanukkah for them.</div><div id="00:03:07.080" class="transcript_line"> Did each show go on once, yes?</div><div id="00:03:09.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And then the children doing the experiment in the beginning,</div><div id="00:03:14.920" class="transcript_line"> they were at the side of the stage watching all the story, and then they came back into the,</div><div id="00:03:22.760" class="transcript_line"> with their chemistry set at the end.</div></div></p>
