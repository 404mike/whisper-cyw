So you&#039;re in Cardiff now, you&#039;ve got to get a job.</div><div id="00:07:25.620" class="transcript_line"> Well I had a job, when I came to Cardiff I got straight to a job.</div><div id="00:07:30.620" class="transcript_line"> When my brother took me over he would already know somebody and I had a job.</div><div id="00:07:38.620" class="transcript_line"> So you had a job to come to?</div><div id="00:07:40.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I had a job to come to, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:42.620" class="transcript_line"> What job was that?</div><div id="00:07:43.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was in St. Davies Hospital but I was working in the laundry part.</div><div id="00:07:49.620" class="transcript_line"> My mother worked in the laundry and went to hospital in England.</div><div id="00:07:53.620" class="transcript_line"> So what was that like, was that okay?</div><div id="00:07:57.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, well.</div><div id="00:08:01.620" class="transcript_line"> Did you encounter any difficulties when you first came?</div><div id="00:08:05.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, not, ah.</div><div id="00:08:10.620" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only me and you talking, you can tell us.</div><div id="00:08:12.620" class="transcript_line"> No, ah. Well, you know when you work with some of the people I&#039;ve been asking you stupid questions if you have a horse and things like that, that where you come from.</div><div id="00:08:24.620" class="transcript_line"> But my difficulty now when I left my brother and when I was in Ely and that was my greatest hell that I ever had.</div><div id="00:08:38.620" class="transcript_line"> In Ely?</div><div id="00:08:40.620" class="transcript_line"> In Ely.</div><div id="00:08:41.620" class="transcript_line"> Why, why, I don&#039;t know Cardiff that well, so what&#039;s the matter with Ely?</div><div id="00:08:46.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, my neighbour, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with him, whether he didn&#039;t like blocks or what, but what it is, but we can be happy.</div><div id="00:08:58.620" class="transcript_line"> What happened?</div><div id="00:09:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, he used to pick on the children then.</div><div id="00:09:05.620" class="transcript_line"> And they couldn&#039;t go outside and when my friend come over he pick on them and the wife, it was horrible.</div><div id="00:09:15.620" class="transcript_line"> And I wake up one morning and when I looked out at the back of my kitchen, as though she used whether the bucket or what it is, she just threw the mess at the back.</div><div id="00:09:33.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, excrement and all that sort of stuff.</div><div id="00:09:35.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:37.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh my goodness.</div><div id="00:09:38.620" class="transcript_line"> And when I go to work and come back it&#039;s always complaining.</div><div id="00:09:48.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:49.620" class="transcript_line"> And, but then after a while my other brother that was here, his children, heard about it and I didn&#039;t know what was going on.</div><div id="00:10:07.620" class="transcript_line"> But then the police came over and asked me to stop him from, stop my neighbour from coming because of all the hustling I was having.</div><div id="00:10:22.620" class="transcript_line"> They were a boxer and everybody know them as a boxer.</div><div id="00:10:29.620" class="transcript_line"> But to work together he said that they were coming to take him out of his house and beat him up.</div><div id="00:10:36.620" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t know nothing about it.</div><div id="00:10:39.620" class="transcript_line"> So, well, it calmed down a bit.</div><div id="00:10:43.620" class="transcript_line"> But then the councilors that I have, everything, you know, you want this to be done and you want that to be done.</div><div id="00:10:53.620" class="transcript_line"> And I always pay my money in advance, pay them all.</div><div id="00:10:57.620" class="transcript_line"> And I couldn&#039;t, I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore.</div><div id="00:11:04.620" class="transcript_line"> But then I was short cash.</div><div id="00:11:08.620" class="transcript_line"> But one day I was in the house and my, my, I let her come through the door.</div><div id="00:11:21.620" class="transcript_line"> I think it was a rebate of 250 pounds.</div><div id="00:11:26.620" class="transcript_line"> So I put it, I take it down to Wilson Road and I said I&#039;m going to put this money down.</div><div id="00:11:33.620" class="transcript_line"> So I, and then when I came from, yeah, I was working in the hospital, Ely hospital.</div><div id="00:11:38.620" class="transcript_line"> I was doing nursing in Ely hospital.</div><div id="00:11:40.620" class="transcript_line"> What year was this now?</div><div id="00:11:41.620" class="transcript_line"> This is about 62-ish, is it?</div><div id="00:11:43.620" class="transcript_line"> 63?</div><div id="00:11:44.620" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:46.620" class="transcript_line"> You were here?</div><div id="00:11:47.620" class="transcript_line"> 70s.</div><div id="00:11:48.620" class="transcript_line"> 70s, o&#039;n i, 70s.</div><div id="00:11:50.620" class="transcript_line"> I said I&#039;m going to put this little cash down.</div><div id="00:11:59.620" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know what I was going to do with it, but I started to, you know, when I get my wages and what I have left, I try to put a couple pounds down and see.</div><div id="00:12:12.620" class="transcript_line"> And we were in work and all the girls then were talking and they said, oh, I&#039;m going to buy a house.</div><div id="00:12:19.620" class="transcript_line"> And I said, and then because I couldn&#039;t get no repair and he couldn&#039;t, that fellow wouldn&#039;t lay off my back.</div><div id="00:12:31.620" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, when the law came out that you could buy your consulat, but I didn&#039;t want to live there.</div><div id="00:12:42.620" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t want to live there?</div><div id="00:12:44.620" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t want to live there because I write to the MP telling the condition of everything.</div><div id="00:12:50.620" class="transcript_line"> And well, anyhow, I go back to my, I didn&#039;t, I say to my other, to my eldest brother,</div><div id="00:13:00.620" class="transcript_line"> that I&#039;m going to buy a house.</div><div id="00:13:04.620" class="transcript_line"> And he said yes.</div><div id="00:13:09.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, at that time you could pay the solicitor, but I have bought a thousand pounds.</div><div id="00:13:16.620" class="transcript_line"> And he took me and I saw the house didn&#039;t beat the road anymore.</div><div id="00:13:22.620" class="transcript_line"> My brother word was said, I saw one first and he said, no, don&#039;t have that one.</div><div id="00:13:28.620" class="transcript_line"> And his word was I step out in style.</div><div id="00:13:32.620" class="transcript_line"> So I went and I had no, no, I moved to be the road.</div><div id="00:13:44.620" class="transcript_line"> I left the house and I moved to be the road.</div><div id="00:13:47.620" class="transcript_line"> I had the house and at that time I think that was my happiest time.</div><div id="00:13:57.620" class="transcript_line"> So how far is, what was it, Peter Road?</div><div id="00:14:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Beedar Road.</div><div id="00:14:01.620" class="transcript_line"> Beedar Road?</div><div id="00:14:02.620" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s in Canton.</div><div id="00:14:03.620" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a totally different area then.</div><div id="00:14:05.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:06.620" class="transcript_line"> So what was it like in Beedar Road?</div><div id="00:14:09.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was lovely.

It was really, really hard. It was very hard.</div><div id="00:17:38.620" class="transcript_line"> I mean, when I came here, I came over a very bright child and yet I was put down to the lowest of the lowest class because they think that I was stupid.</div><div id="00:17:52.620" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll get to that when you take us there.</div><div id="00:17:55.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:56.620" class="transcript_line"> So, okay, so then what happened?

Do you see Wales as your home or do you still think of yourself as Jamaican?</div><div id="00:18:31.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, sometimes I think about Jamaica and another time I think, say, well, stay here.</div><div id="00:18:40.620" class="transcript_line"> So if you had the chance, say you won a million pounds or something like that, would you stay here or would you go back to Jamaica?</div><div id="00:18:47.620" class="transcript_line"> I think I would go back.</div><div id="00:18:49.620" class="transcript_line"> You would go back to Jamaica?</div><div id="00:18:50.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because I would have enough to survive.</div><div id="00:18:54.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:55.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:56.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:57.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:58.620" class="transcript_line"> So have you been back to Jamaica since the time you left?</div><div id="00:19:03.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, several times.</div><div id="00:19:05.620" class="transcript_line"> Several times. What do you think of it?</div><div id="00:19:07.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think Jamaica is nice if you have money.</div><div id="00:19:20.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:22.620" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s nice if you have money.</div><div id="00:19:25.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:26.620" class="transcript_line"> Has it changed since, it must have changed, but do you think Jamaica has changed for the better or do you think it&#039;s worse than when you left?</div><div id="00:19:36.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it&#039;s worse than really that one I left because, you know, when people appreciate you more when you was out there than now.</div><div id="00:19:50.620" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay.</div><div id="00:19:51.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:52.620" class="transcript_line"> What do you do for leisure time now over here?</div><div id="00:19:57.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I go to church and…</div><div id="00:20:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Is church a big part of your life?</div><div id="00:20:03.620" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:04.620" class="transcript_line"> How long have you been going to church?</div><div id="00:20:07.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I go to church every week. I go to the Pentecostal church.</div><div id="00:20:16.620" class="transcript_line"> When did you start going to church?</div><div id="00:20:18.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, a long time ever since when I was in Ely.</div><div id="00:20:25.620" class="transcript_line"> But then when I moved down, it was a bit distant to go and then after I go to the Pentecostal.</div><div id="00:20:35.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay, and that plays a big part of your life.</div><div id="00:20:38.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:39.620" class="transcript_line"> How often do you go? Once a week?</div><div id="00:20:41.620" class="transcript_line"> No, we go twice a week.</div><div id="00:20:44.620" class="transcript_line"> What do you do in church?</div><div id="00:20:47.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, sometimes they want you to say a bit of word, exaltation, and then I don&#039;t really want to part with it because I&#039;m too old now.</div><div id="00:21:00.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay, but you just like…</div><div id="00:21:02.620" class="transcript_line"> Socialise.</div><div id="00:21:04.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes, church is not just to go there and worship, is it? So church is almost like a gathering.</div><div id="00:21:13.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:14.620" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a gathering.</div><div id="00:21:16.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:17.620" class="transcript_line"> Because nearly every Caribbean people, no matter which Caribbean country they come from, there&#039;s a church in their life somewhere, isn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:21:24.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:21:25.620" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so that&#039;s your leisure time as church. Do you do anything else?</div><div id="00:21:35.620" class="transcript_line"> My mum loves crochet.</div><div id="00:21:37.620" class="transcript_line"> Oh, see, you didn&#039;t tell me that.</div><div id="00:21:40.620" class="transcript_line"> My mum loves crochet.</div><div id="00:21:42.620" class="transcript_line"> I used to do a lot of sewing.</div><div id="00:21:45.620" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:21:46.620" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t bother with it now. Bad eyes now. I don&#039;t. And the price that I&#039;m going to pay for material in this…</div><div id="00:21:59.620" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t be bothered with it now.</div><div id="00:22:01.620" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s cheaper.</div><div id="00:22:03.620" class="transcript_line"> What has been the highlight since you&#039;ve been here? Is this something you could point to and say, yes, this was my best time?</div><div id="00:22:16.620" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t really… I really don&#039;t. Because the thing is, when I&#039;m working, I don&#039;t go anywhere, like I said, just from work.</div><div id="00:22:30.620" class="transcript_line"> Work to home, work to home.</div><div id="00:22:32.620" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I used to be like seven in the morning until eight in the night, so when I come home…</div><div id="00:22:39.620" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s why you came here, I suppose, isn&#039;t it? To work, because there&#039;s hardly any work when you left Jamaica, was there? There wasn&#039;t that much work, was there?</div><div id="00:22:48.620" class="transcript_line"> No, no, there wasn&#039;t that much work.</div><div id="00:22:51.620" class="transcript_line"> O.C.
