    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a guy called Mike Parker Pearson. He&#039;s the</div><div id="00:00:03.640" class="transcript_line"> prof of archaeology in charge of the big dig that&#039;s going on up in the</div><div id="00:00:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Priscelles at the moment, and that will be this summer.</div><div id="00:00:10.800" class="transcript_line"> The archaeological dig is to pick out exactly where these stones came from</div><div id="00:00:16.080" class="transcript_line"> and how they were utilised. Talking to Mike, I mean he&#039;s a</div><div id="00:00:21.120" class="transcript_line"> Hecumenalist guy, he&#039;s a friendly sort of guy, he feels that they were</div><div id="00:00:26.240" class="transcript_line"> of a religious nature, but not religion as we would understand it now,</div><div id="00:00:30.640" class="transcript_line"> but of a more sort of animist kind of thing. People obviously felt that the stones were</div><div id="00:00:38.480" class="transcript_line"> in some ways magic, they were very important, and people would venerate the stones, but they</div><div id="00:00:44.640" class="transcript_line"> would venerate the effort that was needed to make them into a circle. So they think that the</div><div id="00:00:50.800" class="transcript_line"> circles were important because they were aligned upon the solstice, the winter and summer solstice,</div><div id="00:00:56.560" class="transcript_line"> of the year, so that they were aligned, specially aligned, so that they could calculate. Well,</div><div id="00:01:01.920" class="transcript_line"> one argument is they would calculate the alignment so that they knew which time of year to plant crops</div><div id="00:01:08.480" class="transcript_line"> and which time of year to have their festivals. So there&#039;s a lot of information attached to that,</div><div id="00:01:14.640" class="transcript_line"> which again, there&#039;s a lot of interpretation because nobody knows for certain because these</div><div id="00:01:19.920" class="transcript_line"> guys didn&#039;t read and write, so there&#039;s no written record, and it&#039;s really the edge of history</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> up there. But those stones were obviously very important, they were important enough</div><div id="00:01:33.920" class="transcript_line"> that people would transport them probably a month&#039;s journey eastwards to go to Stonehenge.</div><div id="00:01:40.800" class="transcript_line"> Why on earth would they do that? Because they must have had thousands of people moving them,</div><div id="00:01:44.800" class="transcript_line"> and why they did it, we don&#039;t know. We think it&#039;s religion, we think it&#039;s to do with the</div><div id="00:01:49.600" class="transcript_line"> celebration of communal effort. I have one here, that&#039;s a prusselli bluestone, it&#039;s a chip,</div><div id="00:01:58.720" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not, it&#039;s not, the big one&#039;s very, very about three tons. But if you look at this very carefully,</div><div id="00:02:04.880" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you can see it very well in here, but it&#039;s got little crystalline structures in the</div><div id="00:02:10.560" class="transcript_line"> rock. If you polish this rock like this, right, that is the sky, that&#039;s the stars, and that&#039;s the</div><div id="00:02:20.160" class="transcript_line"> constellations, and I&#039;m sure that&#039;s what we old guys used to think. Yeah, so it&#039;s of interest that</div><div id="00:02:26.480" class="transcript_line"> they would get a three ton, four ton lunder this stuff and then cut all the way up to Stonehenge.</div><div id="00:02:33.680" class="transcript_line"> They were highly motivated to do it, but whether it was religion, whether it was</div><div id="00:02:39.600" class="transcript_line"> the kind of animist religion that they would have had, I don&#039;t know. Their own religion,</div><div id="00:02:44.880" class="transcript_line"> based upon the world in which they lived, so that they would relate more readily to something like</div><div id="00:02:50.560" class="transcript_line"> the spirit of the stone, or the spirit of the sky, or the spirit of the land, rather than saying</div><div id="00:02:57.520" class="transcript_line"> that there&#039;s an abstract sort of god hidden away somewhere. And their blue, dollarite I think,</div><div id="00:03:05.760" class="transcript_line"> but it&#039;s a rock which is not uncommon. This one was found in a place where I go to house,</div><div id="00:03:12.960" class="transcript_line"> just in the ground, and I had it polished because I had this idea. There&#039;s a couple of us who</div><div id="00:03:19.600" class="transcript_line"> think that the reason for having these stone circles is because they thought that the rock</div><div id="00:03:25.200" class="transcript_line"> was special in some way. But I&#039;ve tried all sorts about trying to communicate with it,</div><div id="00:03:31.120" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve slept up the night up there. I&#039;ve sat there listening all day sometimes,</div><div id="00:03:39.280" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s no vibes, there&#039;s no sort of magic. It&#039;s just a number up.</div></div></p>
