Sophia can you</div><div id="00:00:09.520" class="transcript_line"> introduce yourself please. My name is Sophia Johnson I was born on the 14th of</div><div id="00:00:15.720" class="transcript_line"> July 1956 in Nairobi Kenya. You were born in East Africa can you tell me your</div><div id="00:00:23.880" class="transcript_line"> memories of living there? Sure, sure. Even though I was born in Kenya we were</div><div id="00:00:30.840" class="transcript_line"> British East Africa then and my family moved to Tanzania, Mwanza to start a</div><div id="00:00:38.360" class="transcript_line"> business or my grandfather did and we had soda factories in Mwanza and Arusha</div><div id="00:00:45.440" class="transcript_line"> and we also owned some land which we didn&#039;t quite rent to to the local</div><div id="00:00:54.560" class="transcript_line"> population but let them farm their food there to sell to the market so nothing</div><div id="00:01:00.320" class="transcript_line"> was there was no money to be made from that but it was land. Can I ask you about</div><div id="00:01:06.920" class="transcript_line"> how your family went from Kenya to Tanzania? I think my grandfather decided</div><div id="00:01:16.320" class="transcript_line"> he wanted to go to Mwanza to start a business. I can&#039;t recall it because</div><div id="00:01:20.840" class="transcript_line"> obviously I wasn&#039;t there but that was all my both no not my parents my father</div><div id="00:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> my grandmother my grandfather were all born in Kenya but then they left to go</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> to Tanzania and I don&#039;t know the reason why. But you were born in Kenya? Yes. And so</div><div id="00:01:38.120" class="transcript_line"> how old were you when you when your family left Kenya? Oh immediately well my mother I</div><div id="00:01:42.360" class="transcript_line"> think was visiting from from Mwanza and of course I was born in Kenya but then</div><div id="00:01:49.520" class="transcript_line"> you know we were just East Africans there was I just a little permit to say</div><div id="00:01:53.640" class="transcript_line"> you were East African there was no passport per se in that time or if I</div><div id="00:01:58.400" class="transcript_line"> remember. So you could leave and go to one country there was a lot of fluidity in your</div><div id="00:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> movement. Yes. Do you know what your family did in Kenya before moving to Mwanza?</div><div id="00:02:09.440" class="transcript_line"> They had a little factory a soda factory. In Nairobi? In Nairobi I believe but I</div><div id="00:02:14.840" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t know nobody talks about that time anymore you know all I know is my my own</div><div id="00:02:20.720" class="transcript_line"> personal recollection of Mwanza. The family didn&#039;t talk about any of our</div><div id="00:02:25.640" class="transcript_line"> where we came from what we did what happened all I know is about we were in</div><div id="00:02:30.240" class="transcript_line"> Mwanza and that was that. So does that mean that you don&#039;t have any historical</div><div id="00:02:35.080" class="transcript_line"> knowledge of your ancestors how your grandparents came to India? No. Sorry East</div><div id="00:02:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Africa. Yeah. Because that&#039;s very common with our community. Yes. Nobody actually</div><div id="00:02:43.160" class="transcript_line"> remembers. No. I mean great great grandfather was 10 when he came to East</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> Africa but that&#039;s all I know and of course it&#039;s great great great. So you</div><div id="00:02:55.560" class="transcript_line"> would have been fourth generation? Yes. So that&#039;s a long established line in East Africa? Yes.</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> By that point? Yes. I mean we were Africans we didn&#039;t never thought of</div><div id="00:03:05.680" class="transcript_line"> ourselves as Indians because this was home. Home was never India. My mother was</div><div id="00:03:12.640" class="transcript_line"> born in Tanzania exactly so we were all Africa East Africans and of course</div><div id="00:03:20.960" class="transcript_line"> things changed. So can you tell me some of the memories you have of Mwanza then?</div><div id="00:03:26.640" class="transcript_line"> It was a lovely lovely town on the shores of Lake Victoria. Beautiful. Very</div><div id="00:03:33.400" class="transcript_line"> colonial. My grandfather was very big in the British colonial government. When you</div><div id="00:03:41.080" class="transcript_line"> say big? He was a it was a member of the Legislative Council in the British</div><div id="00:03:46.600" class="transcript_line"> government representing the Indians in East Africa in Africa in Tanzania. And so</div><div id="00:03:52.160" class="transcript_line"> when you say it was very colonial? It&#039;s a very colonial town you know a lot of</div><div id="00:03:55.840" class="transcript_line"> British there. I have no clue why but you know in those days you were not as</div><div id="00:04:01.240" class="transcript_line"> Indians or Africans you were not allowed to go into British facilities if you</div><div id="00:04:06.560" class="transcript_line"> know that you know you couldn&#039;t go into the clubs you couldn&#039;t go into the yoke</div><div id="00:04:09.600" class="transcript_line"> clubs into the golf clubs not allowed. So there was segregation? Of course</div><div id="00:04:14.680" class="transcript_line"> absolutely. But was it segregation with whites only? Were Indians and</div><div id="00:04:21.400" class="transcript_line"> Africans mixing or you able to go into each other&#039;s? We could go into it we</div><div id="00:04:27.040" class="transcript_line"> could go into brown and black communities but not in white. So it really was?</div><div id="00:04:32.880" class="transcript_line"> They were colonial until they left in 1960 and so even then even after 1960 we still had the</div><div id="00:04:41.520" class="transcript_line"> clubs where they allowed Indians in but not Africans. Why do you think Indians</div><div id="00:04:47.560" class="transcript_line"> were allowed in? Business people. Okay. And and because my father my grandfather was</div><div id="00:04:53.360" class="transcript_line"> in the government we were kind of honorary whites. Now I was I was very</div><div id="00:04:58.960" class="transcript_line"> young then so I don&#039;t remember I remember going to dances at the club you</div><div id="00:05:04.240" class="transcript_line"> know my grandmother was entertaining these ladies with their beautiful silver</div><div id="00:05:11.080" class="transcript_line"> and whatnot I I remember all that cutlery which came from Sheffield and</div><div id="00:05:15.640" class="transcript_line"> what then be I can&#039;t remember what it was we only saved one piece after what</div><div id="00:05:21.600" class="transcript_line"> happened in you know after what happened in 1971. Okay. We had a beautiful home huge</div><div id="00:05:27.520" class="transcript_line"> home family lived together the soda factories were in town and actually I</div><div id="00:05:37.280" class="transcript_line"> had a very privileged life I must say a very happy life. So you grew up in this</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> big house yeah and with this special status within that yes yes that gave</div><div id="00:05:50.520" class="transcript_line"> you access yes privileges and to white people basically in white society yes</div><div id="00:05:55.280" class="transcript_line"> and you imported cutlery from the UK yes and the crockery and you know so that it</div><div id="00:06:00.120" class="transcript_line"> was very much trying to be to the British standards yes yes and did your</div><div id="00:06:05.520" class="transcript_line"> grandmother wear her saris or was she dressed western western dress so would</div><div id="00:06:11.880" class="transcript_line"> you describe it as a complete copy of the colonial culture? Yes I would think so</div><div id="00:06:18.320" class="transcript_line"> with my grandfather certainly after my grandfather died she went back to wear</div><div id="00:06:22.400" class="transcript_line"> wearing her long dresses and a sari you know on her head. So it was because of your</div><div id="00:06:26.920" class="transcript_line"> grandfather that your grandmother actually wore western clothes? Yes.</div><div id="00:06:31.880" class="transcript_line"> Into that particular society of that world which was totally different from</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> our world and then the African world. But it was enabling you to have a quality of</div><div id="00:06:43.600" class="transcript_line"> life yes that you wouldn&#039;t have had otherwise no if you had stayed in saris</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> Yes because we were encouraged can I say this by the Aga Khan the old Aga Khan that</div><div id="00:06:56.600" class="transcript_line"> where you go into whichever country you go assimilate don&#039;t you know and start</div><div id="00:07:02.520" class="transcript_line"> wearing western clothes and because my grandfather was also president of the</div><div id="00:07:07.640" class="transcript_line"> Ismaili council so my grandmother started wearing dresses then all the</div><div id="00:07:12.560" class="transcript_line"> women followed her into a dress is not properly not not too short obviously</div><div id="00:07:18.600" class="transcript_line"> modest dressing but no saris or anything no. So did your grandmother did you sense</div><div id="00:07:25.640" class="transcript_line"> that your grandmother felt really quite comfortable being western or was she</div><div id="00:07:28.640" class="transcript_line"> always aware that she was never a westerner? I don&#039;t think she was but in</div><div id="00:07:33.320" class="transcript_line"> her heart she was always Indian but she was born in Kenya I mean you know she</div><div id="00:07:37.640" class="transcript_line"> never been to India in her life either so there was a culture but the culture</div><div id="00:07:42.040" class="transcript_line"> obviously that culture from India was brought into us you know to the food to</div><div id="00:07:47.920" class="transcript_line"> speak the language it was important but we were always kids in our family were</div><div id="00:07:54.800" class="transcript_line"> always taught to speak English have western food we were never allowed</div><div id="00:07:59.520" class="transcript_line"> Indian food it was totally different because it was a very strange household</div><div id="00:08:04.880" class="transcript_line"> where we there was a kids dining room there was an adults dining room I never</div><div id="00:08:09.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I went into the adults dining room once and then my grandfather would</div><div id="00:08:13.880" class="transcript_line"> hold all these sundowners on our terrace upstairs where the people were invited</div><div id="00:08:17.760" class="transcript_line"> when Princess Margaret visited sundowner when Hajjuan came sundowner he came to</div><div id="00:08:25.360" class="transcript_line"> our house I&#039;ve got pictures. So you have your family hosted royalty? Yes. This</div><div id="00:08:33.200" class="transcript_line"> colonial contact yeah so your grandfather&#039;s really really high up. He was awarded the</div><div id="00:08:40.480" class="transcript_line"> MBE by the Queen for services to the British Empire. So it was very necessary</div><div id="00:08:46.800" class="transcript_line"> for you to fit in into the colonial system? Yes. How do you feel about that</div><div id="00:08:53.480" class="transcript_line"> retrospectively? Well I never thought that there was snobbish and you</div><div id="00:08:59.280" class="transcript_line"> know I&#039;ve also lived in different countries now and you see the English I&#039;m</div><div id="00:09:04.280" class="transcript_line"> sorry to say this when they&#039;re out there they sort of develop this inverted</div><div id="00:09:09.800" class="transcript_line"> snobbery and you may be a it&#039;s nothing but you think you know with the posh</div><div id="00:09:15.240" class="transcript_line"> voices I never you know I never actually thought of them as well okay skins</div><div id="00:09:20.520" class="transcript_line"> different so what. So the fact that your grandfather was part of this colonial</div><div id="00:09:25.440" class="transcript_line"> system yes that was causing a lot of inequality yes in East Africa yes do you</div><div id="00:09:32.240" class="transcript_line"> have any thoughts or feelings about that having belonged to it and grown up with</div><div id="00:09:35.480" class="transcript_line"> it? Well actually I didn&#039;t belong in a way when he died in 1960 not 1962 he died</div><div id="00:09:43.120" class="transcript_line"> then things start changing. And how did they start changing? Because after after</div><div id="00:09:48.240" class="transcript_line"> the after independence the British were going and you know we were there then</div><div id="00:09:53.600" class="transcript_line"> not many not many British then some who obviously working elsewhere but you know</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> we used to have a another beautiful colonial home in a place called Musoma</div><div id="00:10:05.840" class="transcript_line"> we used to go on our holidays there and every month of December we&#039;d take the</div><div id="00:10:10.400" class="transcript_line"> car and go all the way to Uganda Kenya Tanzania through the Serengeti and back</div><div id="00:10:15.240" class="transcript_line"> to Monsa it was it was a that&#039;s what it was it was an idyllic life in a way my</div><div id="00:10:20.440" class="transcript_line"> father was lovely he loved adventure but then things start changing in 19</div><div id="00:10:26.240" class="transcript_line"> Nyerere became president and he decided to adopt the Chinese socialist way of</div><div id="00:10:32.600" class="transcript_line"> life where nothing belongs to you everything belongs to the state. So just</div><div id="00:10:38.160" class="transcript_line"> before we talk about that just so that I can grasp your life in the first 10</div><div id="00:10:44.760" class="transcript_line"> years of your life yeah yeah it was sundowners it was long vacations long</div><div id="00:10:50.480" class="transcript_line"> vacations sundowners obviously we weren&#039;t allowed these kids but we&#039;d watch</div><div id="00:10:53.960" class="transcript_line"> you know road trips and holidays what about your schooling was that private? No no no we were at the</div><div id="00:11:01.460" class="transcript_line"> Aga Khan school and remember in December yes yes so that the educational system</div><div id="00:11:09.160" class="transcript_line"> was an elitist in that sense. But not Africans. No Africans? Only Indians. And only Indians? Yeah at the Aga Khan school yeah. So only Asmaelites?</div><div id="00:11:17.720" class="transcript_line"> mm-hmm no other yeah other other other Hindus and other races but no Africans</div><div id="00:11:24.040" class="transcript_line"> okay so if I can remember I don&#039;t think there were any Africans. Other religions so</div><div id="00:11:28.680" class="transcript_line"> that you could be Hindu Sikh? Yeah we used to go to the Hindu temple we used to go for</div><div id="00:11:33.520" class="transcript_line"> Diwali, Holi we used to go to the marriages and it was very very togetherness</div><div id="00:11:39.200" class="transcript_line"> you know it was a lovely life in a way because there was no hassle. What about</div><div id="00:11:45.800" class="transcript_line"> your friendship group because you have this grew up with these British</div><div id="00:11:51.280" class="transcript_line"> affiliations yeah were you friends with those white colonial children? No. Or did you</div><div id="00:11:56.080" class="transcript_line"> stay with the Asians? No we only met them in clubs you know in the clubs when we</div><div id="00:11:59.760" class="transcript_line"> went swimming or play tennis or that but no but most of my friends were</div><div id="00:12:05.160" class="transcript_line"> Asmaelites because it was a community was a centre of heart but our family was</div><div id="00:12:10.960" class="transcript_line"> very aloof people didn&#039;t like us very much because they thought we were very</div><div id="00:12:15.600" class="transcript_line"> apathy so if we&#039;d go to the movies we&#039;d have the first row of the cinema that&#039;s</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> what I&#039;m saying you know kind of royalist so people were scared to come</div><div id="00:12:24.960" class="transcript_line"> in fact people were scared to come and talk to us and I said why won&#039;t you have</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> got many friends you know because they were actually not happy to talk to us</div><div id="00:12:32.760" class="transcript_line"> they wouldn&#039;t come to the big house they were scared and I just wondered why and</div><div id="00:12:37.800" class="transcript_line"> then coming to the UK and meeting them again they said you know we never came</div><div id="00:12:41.680" class="transcript_line"> to your big house why because it didn&#039;t feel right so no the my friends were my</div><div id="00:12:49.120" class="transcript_line"> cousins cousins group of three or four cousins and that was our group and so</div><div id="00:12:56.680" class="transcript_line"> there was no mixing with Africans not at that stage no and then in</div><div id="00:13:01.840" class="transcript_line"> 1970 when this I was it now at secondary school in what you call my third year</div><div id="00:13:09.560" class="transcript_line"> was that in Ismaili secondary school no no it was it was a it was called Moanser</div><div id="00:13:14.400" class="transcript_line"> secondary school so it was mixed what whites Africans most of the whites went</div><div id="00:13:19.400" class="transcript_line"> to their own private school there were a couple who came but mainly Asians Indians</div><div id="00:13:25.560" class="transcript_line"> and then the Africans came as well so it was pretty mixed but that was an</div><div id="00:13:32.760" class="transcript_line"> interest that&#039;s when things really started changing because they nationalized</div><div id="00:13:40.520" class="transcript_line"> everything I&#039;m going now into I was 13 at the time I was in secondary school and</div><div id="00:13:49.640" class="transcript_line"> and the year before that they nationalized because everything belonged</div><div id="00:13:55.360" class="transcript_line"> to the state so up until that point your grandfather passed so he was no longer</div><div id="00:14:00.280" class="transcript_line"> part of this colonial no it was all gone so it was just the family were just</div><div id="00:14:04.680" class="transcript_line"> working in the business yes which was the pop factory yeah we just know Coca</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Cola Coca Cola hmm any other no so there was a Coca Cola factory yeah you</div><div id="00:14:14.920" class="transcript_line"> still had the land which Africans were living on yes there was no rent being</div><div id="00:14:18.680" class="transcript_line"> charged no thanks so that was great yeah then nationalization happened in 1970</div><div id="00:14:23.960" class="transcript_line"> after the independence yes 1971 yeah and then yeah so one night I could hear the</div><div id="00:14:33.360" class="transcript_line"> adults kind of getting very uppity things was tense and but you know as a</div><div id="00:14:39.200" class="transcript_line"> child nobody tells you what&#039;s going on oh you go to school it&#039;s fine but we</div><div id="00:14:44.120" class="transcript_line"> were always escorted to school always escorted back by we had drivers security</div><div id="00:14:50.560" class="transcript_line"> people and then my father decided oh so one day I&#039;m coming home from school and</div><div id="00:14:57.320" class="transcript_line"> I see this big notice is saying property of the Tanzanian government and this was</div><div id="00:15:04.080" class="transcript_line"> on our house notices on our house so by that time they would have taken the</div><div id="00:15:09.240" class="transcript_line"> factory was the last to go because there was a big discussion between Coca Cola</div><div id="00:15:14.880" class="transcript_line"> and and government of Tanzania they wouldn&#039;t allow it eventually they took it</div><div id="00:15:20.840" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s when my father left to go back to Kenya so you were saying about going</div><div id="00:15:26.520" class="transcript_line"> home from school yeah and I see all this notices now and Swahili so and then after</div><div id="00:15:31.960" class="transcript_line"> the time we were not allowed to speak Gujarati or English we had to speak</div><div id="00:15:35.280" class="transcript_line"> Swahili all the time if you were caught speaking those two languages don&#039;t you</div><div id="00:15:40.760" class="transcript_line"> in trouble everyone

yes we</div><div id="00:34:51.120" class="transcript_line"> followed all the traditions I mean you know it&#039;s a different world for the kids</div><div id="00:34:55.720" class="transcript_line">

And was that out of an act of humility?</div><div id="00:35:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah well that also and also I think my mother was so hell-bent on sending us</div><div id="00:35:34.520" class="transcript_line"> three girls because you remember the hierarchy that you&#039;re patriarchal you</div><div id="00:35:38.960" class="transcript_line"> know if you didn&#039;t have a son my grandfather was titled it was my</div><div id="00:35:43.480" class="transcript_line"> countryman it&#039;s my title and and obviously if my if my father had a son</div><div id="00:35:52.360" class="transcript_line"> the thing would pass to him but my father had three girls and he was always</div><div id="00:35:57.280" class="transcript_line"> this thing about you know his younger brother had a son so it was still very</div><div id="00:36:01.760" class="transcript_line"> patriarchal but anyway my mother was hell-bent that us three would get an</div><div id="00:36:08.240" class="transcript_line"> education you know and if they not to marry because otherwise what like I was</div><div id="00:36:14.600" class="transcript_line"> thinking what life would have been like if I was still in Africa would I be</div><div id="00:36:18.200" class="transcript_line"> married with two three children but no education you know what what would my</div><div id="00:36:22.440"

to not even be my mother I</div><div id="00:36:47.720" class="transcript_line"> think my mother she came from a very high-class family in Dar es Salaam and</div><div id="00:36:53.000" class="transcript_line"> she married my father was a bit of a lout her words and when she came when</div><div id="00:37:00.440" class="transcript_line"> she married my father and she came to this Dar es Salaam was very sophisticated</div><div id="00:37:05.080" class="transcript_line"> and her sister-in-law her brothers they lived in South Africa so they were very</div><div id="00:37:11.160" class="transcript_line"> sophisticated and when she came to this little thing called Mwanza yes the big</div><div id="00:37:16.960" class="transcript_line"> house wasn&#039;t built then it was a little it was a little house you know tend to</div><div id="00:37:22.120" class="transcript_line"> tend to a space and the toy and she was like her trousseau was all from South</div><div

id="00:37:44.800" class="transcript_line"> father ran hotels in Dar es Salaam and then she comes into this thing and she</div><div id="00:37:51.120" class="transcript_line"> thought that&#039;s it if I have any children they will never suffer what I went</div><div id="00:37:56.440" class="transcript_line"> through they&#039;ll go they&#039;ll be out gone independent never needing anyone to</div><div id="00:38:01.720" class="transcript_line"> rely on so which is she depending on my father didn&#039;t she and she was 21 years</div><div id="00:38:06.760" class="transcript_line"> old so by Indian standards she was too old to be some you know should have</div><div id="00:38:11.960" class="transcript_line"> married at 18 or 17 and there was my father she only saw him and she went</div><div id="00:38:16.120" class="transcript_line"> ill I said really I said I never want you to go through that again and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:38:21.680" class="transcript_line"> why

to be into Wales this is such a fascinating</div><div id="00:45:00.540" class="transcript_line"> story you were living in England I&#039;m interested that you didn&#039;t apply for</div><div id="00:45:07.380" class="transcript_line"> citizenship when you arrived in the UK was that because it was not available</div><div id="00:45:11.260" class="transcript_line"> not available I would have

id="00:45:23.940" class="transcript_line"> at the age of 19 I married Michael so that kind of took care of itself that</div><div id="00:45:28.220" class="transcript_line"> because you did it on in those days you became automatically became a British</div><div id="00:45:31.660" class="transcript_line"> citizen except that when we went to the home office this was funny and Michael</div><div id="00:45:36.780" class="transcript_line"> saying because he&#039;d never seen Jews of people you know they asked me if my</div><div id="00:45:41.780" class="transcript_line"> marriage had been consummated because at that time you were too young probably</div><div id="00:45:46.140" class="transcript_line"> Asian you know the port Asian women into Indian women into and there were the</div><div id="00:45:53.140" class="transcript_line"> marriage wasn&#039;t country it was a marriage of convenience a lot was</div><div id="00:45:56.900" class="transcript_line"> happening then so this home office person asked me has your marriage been</div><div id="00:46:01.220" class="transcript_line"> consummated and Michael said what do you think and she said well we have to</div><div id="00:46:07.060" class="transcript_line"> ask if if are you prepared to be examined by a doctor oh yes are you</div><div id="00:46:12.740" class="transcript_line"> exam prepared to be examined by a

id="00:46:27.200" class="transcript_line"> you do you know she&#039;s jumped the password and said welcome to Britain I</div><div id="00:46:31.160" class="transcript_line"> went really and I never felt at home in England I never did I never felt welcome</div><div id="00:46:41.360" class="transcript_line"> you know there was always this underlying something that I never felt I</div><div id="00:46:46.600" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t have a lot of friends in London you know and then of course I discovered</div><div id="00:46:53.320" class="transcript_line"> Wales but this is interesting that you said about never feeling at home in</div><div id="00:46:59.880" class="transcript_line"> England yeah despite presenting as British and having a lot of friends yes</div><div id="00:47:04.520" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have any smiley friends no all English so this is why I&#039;m interested</div><div id="00:47:12.720" class="transcript_line"> why did you not feel at home because I don&#039;t know I just do something which is</div><div id="00:47:17.600" class="transcript_line"> making me feel not welcome yes they talked to me I was their mate there was</div><div id="00:47:24.160" class="transcript_line"> always this underlying you know something I can&#039;t put my finger in it</div><div id="00:47:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got this friend in London and she&#039;ll say to me no I went to see the</div><div id="00:47:32.320" class="transcript_line"> doctor today and he was black and you think so or he was brown I said so and</div><div id="00:47:41.000" class="transcript_line"> my cousin actually kicked her out of the house his house because he said she was</div><div id="00:47:44.920" class="transcript_line"> racist so he she&#039;s still good or the plumber came to the oh he was he was he</div><div id="00:47:50.840" class="transcript_line"> was black it&#039;s the way it was said yeah so I said so what do you think of me then</div><div id="00:47:57.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m brown how about you again you different and then you discovered Wales</div><div id="00:48:03.280" class="transcript_line"> yeah so I met some Welsh people when I was a whole year in Greece really nice</div><div id="00:48:09.360" class="transcript_line"> ladies older much older and they were really really loved the accent I loved</div><div id="00:48:14.120" class="transcript_line"> this thing songy accent and it was so funny and I said wait so you&#039;re doing</div><div id="00:48:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Wales

getting over this bridge which was then the seventh bridge I was like whoa this</div><div id="00:48:42.800" class="transcript_line"> is it this is me this is me I&#039;m home even though of course I didn&#039;t know</div><div id="00:48:47.520" class="transcript_line"> anything about you know what was down there it was just something about I</div><div id="00:48:52.560" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t know I can&#039;t express it it was the feeling of peace which I&#039;d never known</div><div id="00:48:58.440" class="transcript_line"> in England so that&#039;s something that the Welsh landscape yes very much the light</div><div id="00:49:05.440" class="transcript_line"> something is that we go to France you see this light where they painted and</div><div id="00:49:10.200" class="transcript_line"> you think oh it was the same year I mean look at that the light and I thought</div><div id="00:49:15.160" class="transcript_line"> wow anyway that there was a long time ago but I used to visit I used to come</div><div id="00:49:20.120" class="transcript_line"> every month to Wales and they took me everywhere they brought me to the</div><div id="00:49:23.120" class="transcript_line"> valleys they brought me took me to Monmouthshire to Swansea remember Cardiff</div><div id="00:49:27.800" class="transcript_line"> Bay wasn&#039;t there wasn&#039;t there then

real</div><div id="00:49:43.040" class="transcript_line"> Tiger Bay yes and that&#039;s something that&#039;s yes historically again you know I said to</div><div id="00:49:48.640" class="transcript_line"> my so this is your immigrant area and she said yeah but we don&#039;t go there it&#039;s</div><div id="00:49:54.080" class="transcript_line"> dangerous I said okay fine no but I saw a lot of ways and really Cardiff is great it&#039;s a</div><div id="00:50:03.240" class="transcript_line"> city but I love the mountains I love the mountains every time they brought me

class="transcript_line"> they were back on because you know when you when you got a big injury you&#039;d be</div><div id="00:52:44.220" class="transcript_line"> out for six seven months these weren&#039;t three months later though I mean they</div><div id="00:52:47.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very big in Canada in the US there&#039;s some places in London that do it</div><div id="00:52:52.620" class="transcript_line"> but it hasn&#039;t got on here because the pharmaceuticals won&#039;t let you they want</div><div id="00:52:58.140" class="transcript_line"> you to have the medicines why should you I had trouble with the pharmaceuticals</div><div id="00:53:02.500" class="transcript_line"> in America oh yeah yeah yeah and the and the medics because oh it doesn&#039;t

you&#039;ve had such a journey and so many life experiences and these</div><div id="00:59:10.100" class="transcript_line"> ups and downs you know having a business not having a business taking care of</div><div id="00:59:13.620" class="transcript_line"> your family taking care of your in-laws having places to live not having places</div><div id="00:59:17.820" class="transcript_line"> to live not having money not having passports yeah displaced what does</div><div id="00:59:22.980" class="transcript_line"> resilience mean to you now am I am I as resilient as I as I was then I think</div><div id="00:59:31.140" class="transcript_line"> then now I feel I feel not so strong maybe I&#039;m getting older I don&#039;t know but</div><div id="00:59:38.980" class="transcript_line"> then it was like a big adventure you know everything was an adventure I</div><div id="00:59:44.140" class="transcript_line"> treated it like an adventure I think I wouldn&#039;t have survived if I hadn&#039;t been</div><div id="00:59:48.580" class="transcript_line"> so resilient and I think it&#039;s thanks to my mom who just tell me go you you you</div><div id="00:59:54.100" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t need to depend on anyone you need to go stand on your own two feet and I</div><div id="00:59:58.780" class="transcript_line"> always remember that go and my sisters both of them too so this idea of being</div><div id="01:00:06.220" class="transcript_line"> a need to be independent very has been the thing that has given you has been</div><div id="01:00:11.420" class="transcript_line"> the source of your resilience yes yes never never never I&#039;m saying never obey</div><div id="01:00:18.220" class="transcript_line"> I mean even with my dad when he went eventually when they came to live in</div><div id="01:00:22.940" class="transcript_line"> England because they live they left they left Kenya soon after to go to India but</div><div id="01:00:29.780" class="transcript_line"> they didn&#039;t like it because they couldn&#039;t assimilate with the Indians they</div><div id="01:00:33.980" class="transcript_line"> said they were they&#039;re really different I went but dad we&#039;re all Indians he said no</div><div id="01:00:39.540" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re not you need to come and look but we didn&#039;t go never been to India but then</div><div id="01:00:44.060" class="transcript_line"> we decided that going live in Portugal and they loved Portugal so again I went</div><div id="01:00:49.580" class="transcript_line"> if the colonial thing you know that loved loved Portugal they lived in near</div><div id="01:00:54.420" class="transcript_line"> near the sea Nestor real and there was a Jamaat Khan in Portugal they loved it</div><div id="01:01:00.820" class="transcript_line"> until they both got poorly and then came back came to you can&#039;t live yeah after</div><div id="01:01:06.260" class="transcript_line"> that was time and how easy was it for them to come from Portugal into the UK</div><div id="01:01:11.340" class="transcript_line"> very at that time they came as our dependence applied for dependency as long</div><div id="01:01:17.900" class="transcript_line"> as they did not ask the government for anything I said no we have a house we</div><div id="01:01:24.580" class="transcript_line"> have money we have resources now and so no they&#039;ll be totally reliant on on me</div><div id="01:01:31.700" class="transcript_line"> and my husband and we built us we built a further story on our house so they</div><div id="01:01:37.540" class="transcript_line"> could have their own bedroom bathroom we had our own space very together and and</div><div id="01:01:42.780" class="transcript_line"> we did everything else together they&#039;ve got to they&#039;ve got to mosque on Fridays</div><div id="01:01:46.580" class="transcript_line"> we didn&#039;t obviously and we had a dog not a mad dog like the one you&#039;ve got now</div><div id="01:01:53.580" class="transcript_line"> but smaller dog my mom was really fond of the dog yeah and then of course they</div><div id="01:02:00.220" class="transcript_line"> both got poorly and passed away so that actually goes against the stereotypes of</div><div id="01:02:05.260" class="transcript_line"> how people come to the UK and why they come to the UK and a lot of that is</div><div id="01:02:09.140" class="transcript_line"> about claim benefits yeah having free housing and so on but you supported your</div><div id="01:02:15.460" class="transcript_line"> parents and through their illnesses never ever I until now that I&#039;m now</div><div id="01:02:20.320" class="transcript_line"> getting a pension I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a benefit I think it&#039;s my entitlement for</div><div id="01:02:25.220" class="transcript_line"> working 35 years in this country and paying tax never did my parents got</div><div id="01:02:31.940" class="transcript_line"> claim any benefit until my father was dying and the social workers said you</div><div id="01:02:36.860" class="transcript_line"> know you can get something called attendance allowance and he went what&#039;s</div><div id="01:02:40.700" class="transcript_line"> that then and I said but we&#039;re not allowed to I said I&#039;ve signed a paper</div><div id="01:02:44.780" class="transcript_line"> with the home office still got it I went to dad okay you want to take it I said</div><div id="01:02:51.620" class="transcript_line"> if we get caught then I&#039;ll have to pay it back you know that when we died and</div><div id="01:02:56.900" class="transcript_line"> all the money went back all right but he got he got benefits he didn&#039;t want them</div><div id="01:03:01.620" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t want them because I&#039;d signed a condition with the home office that he&#039;d</div><div id="01:03:07.420" class="transcript_line"> never be dependent from the state and this was a recommendation from a white</div><div id="01:03:11.940" class="transcript_line"> social worker British social worker so they were getting something attendance</div><div id="01:03:18.100" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember attendance allowance keep it because I might have to give it</div><div id="01:03:26.860" class="transcript_line"> back because this is not right and then they were asked for it I give it to</div><div id="01:03:31.740" class="transcript_line"> charity give it all to Marie Curie yeah and just before we kind of wrap things</div><div id="01:03:42.940" class="transcript_line"> up I&#039;m curious would you you said that you&#039;ve never been to India would I ever</div><div id="01:03:48.900" class="transcript_line"> go you mean and would you ever go back to East Africa I think it would hurt too</div><div id="01:03:55.140" class="transcript_line"> much I think I took Michael when we married I wanted him to see but only to</div><div id="01:04:01.420" class="transcript_line"> Kenya but things were different I said this this is what I really but they do</div><div id="01:04:05.260" class="transcript_line"> we did the right thing you know Safari and all that and all that but I left that</div><div id="01:04:11.900" class="transcript_line"> I got on the plane and I was so upset I thought I can&#039;t come back I don&#039;t know</div><div id="01:04:18.700" class="transcript_line"> if I can go back it would be too hurtful my cousins go all the time even my</div><div id="01:04:23.620" class="transcript_line"> cousins have just come back from Monza and they show me it&#039;s now a city of 1</div><div id="01:04:28.340" class="transcript_line"> million people and it hurts to see it like that you know I think oh my god</div><div id="01:04:34.060" class="transcript_line"> those happy days by the lake watching the crocodiles and watching the hippo</div><div id="01:04:40.380" class="transcript_line"> local hippo come and and now it&#039;s nothing there so gone one a city of 1</div><div id="01:04:46.540" class="transcript_line"> million people when it used to be about 10,000 and it was very close to nature</div><div id="01:04:51.220" class="transcript_line"> yes because you could hear at night this is what I&#039;ll never forget it&#039;s the</div><div id="01:04:56.340" class="transcript_line"> sounds of the drums you see you lying there and you hear a lion roar and you</div><div id="01:05:01.720" class="transcript_line"> hear a leopard roar and then you hear the of the drums and I was with the drums</div><div id="01:05:08.540" class="transcript_line"> of Africa and I thought that sound will never leave me until I die so in a way I</div><div id="01:05:15.100" class="transcript_line"> think do I say I&#039;m an African or I&#039;m British I just say I&#039;m a universal</div><div id="01:05:22.220" class="transcript_line"> citizen because Africa means the world to me it really does but we had to leave</div><div id="01:05:30.900" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s sad you okay thank you very much okay thank you very much it&#039;s okay</div><div id="01:05:43.540" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s beautiful I haven&#039;t said anything stupid all right</div></div></p>
