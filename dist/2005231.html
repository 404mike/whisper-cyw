    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Newport as a town, well it was doing well. Even though the Tories were in governance</div><div id="00:00:14.840" class="transcript_line"> and you would have thought that Newport would have been economically compromised by that.</div><div id="00:00:21.800" class="transcript_line"> It was winning awards for the best cap town in Britain or in Wales. There was a sense</div><div id="00:00:28.720" class="transcript_line"> of civic pride for a short time there. It&#039;s kind of lost its identity and once a city loses its</div><div id="00:00:36.120" class="transcript_line"> identity it loses its soul and then it becomes like this desiccated and dead post-industrial town.</div><div id="00:00:47.120" class="transcript_line"> I still see Newport as a town even though it became a city. That&#039;s when Cardiff decided to</div><div id="00:00:55.560" class="transcript_line"> dismantle the art scene in Newport and assimilate it into Cardiff. I&#039;m not saying that there are</div><div id="00:01:03.040" class="transcript_line"> many patterns there but yeah Newport was wonderful back then. It was wonderful. I&#039;m not looking at</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> this through rose-tinted glasses either. There was still a little chewing gum on the streets</div><div id="00:01:14.360" class="transcript_line"> but it wasn&#039;t as peppered with it as it is now. There wasn&#039;t broken glass, there wasn&#039;t a plague</div><div id="00:01:20.760" class="transcript_line"> of drug addiction, there wasn&#039;t syringes littering the streets or empty tents sitting in the doorway</div><div id="00:01:32.600" class="transcript_line"> of vacant shop units. All the shops were open, all the pubs were thriving. All roads led to Newport</div><div id="00:01:42.200" class="transcript_line"> rather than all railway tracks leading to Cardiff. 88, it was vibrant. There was quite an energized</div><div id="00:01:57.520" class="transcript_line"> subculture that rotated around the art college student community who were involved in all these</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> activities like throwing borderline illegal raves below pubs in Newport. The Carpenters Arms in</div><div id="00:02:18.840" class="transcript_line"> particular. There was a Slaughterhouse downstairs and there was this collective who used to put on</div><div id="00:02:25.960" class="transcript_line"> raves and dance nights down there. I think the collective was called UFO. That was in 1991.</div><div id="00:02:36.520" class="transcript_line"> They all developed around that period, the late 80s, early 90s. It was a fascinating period.</div><div id="00:02:45.720" class="transcript_line"> You had gothic folk horror rock units like Wicker Man doing their thing and Dean Bettis with the</div><div id="00:02:57.240" class="transcript_line"> Cowboy Killers. I think the abs were still in circulation at that time. At that time,</div><div id="00:03:04.200" class="transcript_line"> John Peel&#039;s favorite band. He worshipped the abs and understandably so they were a brilliant band.</div><div id="00:03:10.840" class="transcript_line"> Over a period of time, things changed. Having a Labour council for a prolonged period of time has</div><div id="00:03:18.440" class="transcript_line"> led to a political entropy. They made it very difficult for John Izzicolo to put on gigs for</div><div id="00:03:24.840" class="transcript_line"> the last 10 years of his career before his death. The police were actively in operation opposite</div><div id="00:03:33.240" class="transcript_line"> venue in the hope that they could close it down. All because of some</div><div id="00:03:39.720" class="transcript_line"> apocryphal stabbing event that tragically led to someone&#039;s death on their Clarence place.</div><div id="00:03:48.280" class="transcript_line"> It was just a case that they associated a subcultural, uncategorizable and somewhat</div><div id="00:03:54.680" class="transcript_line"> troubling phenomena like TJs as an enemy. They were gunning for it from the late 80s onwards.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> The student population no longer exists in Newport. The Welsh Assembly decided to absorb</div><div id="00:04:12.840" class="transcript_line"> most of the art departments who were instrumental in creating the subculture that made Newport so</div><div id="00:04:20.280" class="transcript_line"> fascinating from the mid 80s to the mid 90s. They dismantled it, took it apart and absorbed</div><div id="00:04:27.720" class="transcript_line"> it into Cardiff in an attempt to sustain the illusionary cultural heganomy that that capital</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> city has. I don&#039;t want to go into politics but it has something to do with the Welsh Assembly and</div><div id="00:04:40.200" class="transcript_line"> something to do about sustaining an illusion of Cardiff being an international city. Of course,</div><div id="00:04:47.560" class="transcript_line"> no international city can exist without a thriving subculture and they did their utmost</div><div id="00:04:57.320" class="transcript_line"> and gradually succeeded in absorbing all of those creative artists who were sustaining the scene in</div><div id="00:05:09.240" class="transcript_line"> Newport.</div></div></p>
