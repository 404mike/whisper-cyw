class="transcript_line"> This is the devolution campaign.</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The devolution campaign.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> What are your recollections of that?</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was...</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> When Blair formed his first government,</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> he asked me to be the minister for post-16 education training</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and regional development agencies.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I worked with David Blunkett, who was Secretary of State for Education.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, essentially, I was university&#039;s minister</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> because we had to take through...</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to take through the first tuition fees bill.</div><div id="00:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve still got the scars on my back to prove it.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And Blunkett called me in very early on in...</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> not long after we&#039;d come to government.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you know all about this devolution stuff.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you and Straw, I know you two were working on this</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> when you were on the Shadow on the First Team.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah, I was.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, well, listen, I&#039;m not going to go to this bloody...</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> this cabinet committee to draw up the Scottish and Welsh settlements.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to go.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;m going to take this tuition fees bill.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a big row about it.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, no, no, you do it.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I turned up and I think I was the only person at that meeting</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> that wasn&#039;t in the cabinet because it was a cabinet committee meeting.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was chaired by Derry Irving, Lord Irving.</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he wasn&#039;t chaired, Jack Straw was chaired.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And Representative Wales and his kind of brief sojourn in that post</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> was none other than Ron Davis.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And every single meeting there was blood on the walls.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It was...I mean, you know, this was really rough stuff.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And it went on for a very long time.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the meantime, Blair was an absolute...</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, a real fanatic for devolution.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he was absolutely convinced that this was, you know,</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> this had to be pushed through.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And believe me, Blair, when he got messianic about something,</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> was quite a force.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And so everyone was expected to do their bit.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And we did.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it wasn&#039;t so bad for me, but for people like Paul Murphy</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and Ron Davis and all these people who were so vociferously</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> opposing it, you know, chin-neck, right?</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, suddenly they&#039;re all on their feet saying,</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> what a great thing it is.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always find that a bit strange, I must say.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m saying that it was a great thing.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And having said that, I think it was a pretty good campaign</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> because the money initially was on us losing the vote.</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a pretty close thing in the end, as you know.</div></div></p>
