In the June of</div><div id="00:01:12.880" class="transcript_line"> 1919 when Tiger Bay and Bute Town were attacked by white mobs over a number of days the press</div><div id="00:01:26.520" class="transcript_line"> coverage the reaction of the minister the appropriate minister which was Winston Churchill</div><div id="00:01:36.280" class="transcript_line"> was very notable the blame was directed towards the residents of Tiger Bay who were attacked by</div><div id="00:01:48.760" class="transcript_line"> white mobs which meant their actions in trying to save their homes their businesses actually much</div><div id="00:02:03.880" class="transcript_line"> more importantly their families from the mob were self-defense.

Abdullah who is listed as a shopkeeper but was also a boarding house owner</div><div id="00:06:05.160" class="transcript_line"> all of the black men were in the merchant Navy at the time of the riots and therefore it&#039;s extremely</div><div id="00:06:12.240" class="transcript_line"> likely that they were also involved in World War one now thanks to the Cardiff Story Museum</div><div id="00:06:19.520" class="transcript_line"> we know that a number of people were compensated for loss of goods and damage during the riots</div><div id="00:06:26.240" class="transcript_line"> the bulk of those being in Bute town some of these were among the men that appeared in court</div><div id="00:06:31.960" class="transcript_line"> the figures I&#039;m going to quote show the actual amount

shillings compensation a modern equivalent of a thousand one thousand nine hundred</div><div id="00:06:58.200" class="transcript_line"> sixty one pounds and so we can understand that in a real context what we&#039;re also going to do is quote</div><div id="00:07:04.840" class="transcript_line"> what that meant if you were a skilled tradesman that&#039;s the high level of salary so that would</div><div id="00:07:12.280" class="transcript_line"> have been 204 days wages for a skilled tradesman at that time John Tucker received 30 pounds that&#039;s</div><div id="00:07:22.640" class="transcript_line"> the equivalent to in 2017 of 886 pounds 26 pence 92 days wages Mohammed Sharif received 14 pounds</div><div id="00:07:35.120" class="transcript_line"> 421 pounds 34 in 2017 money and 43 days wages at the time now John Abdullah who owned a shop</div><div id="00:07:46.720" class="transcript_line"> and boarding house which was the center of a lot of the damage received 175 pounds now that&#039;s the</div><div id="00:07:54.080" class="transcript_line"> equivalent of just over five thousand pounds and it was 531 days wages is a Mohammed received 12</div><div id="00:08:05.040" class="transcript_line"> pounds 348 pounds equivalent which is the equivalent of 36 days wages Ishmael Mohammed</div><div id="00:08:14.240" class="transcript_line"> received seven

although the events were savage and caused some serious physical injury to the black merchant</div><div id="00:09:02.880" class="transcript_line"> seaman the treatment they received in court reflected the fact that they did not start the</div><div id="00:09:09.280" class="transcript_line"> riot also the compensation amounts were significant at that time so despite the press consistently</div><div id="00:09:17.440" class="transcript_line"> for most of June placing the blame for the Cardiff riots on black people living in Cardiff that was</div><div id="00:09:23.440" class="transcript_line"> not the conclusion reached by the court and they received compensation for loss of belongings and</div><div id="00:09:28.800" class="transcript_line"> damage to property it&#039;s interesting to note that even that these events occurred 20 years before</div><div id="00:09:36.800" class="transcript_line"> the start of world war one world war two and despite racist attacks brutality by white
