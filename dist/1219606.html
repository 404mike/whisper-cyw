making, making, making signs of recording.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oops.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think, yes, it&#039;s still recording.</div><div id="00:00:19.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just gone dull.</div><div id="00:00:21.240" class="transcript_line"> So this is Jim Barrett interviewing Stuart McCarty at his home on the 23rd of January</div><div id="00:00:29.040" class="transcript_line"> Stuart has signed the project consent form.</div><div id="00:00:33.360" class="transcript_line"> This interview is being recorded for Wunderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.</div><div id="00:00:41.040" class="transcript_line"> Right, Stuart, so how did you first hear about Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:00:50.720" class="transcript_line"> I met Richard Evans at the Gmorgan Jazz summer school and then I saw Wunderbras play in the</div><div id="00:01:02.800" class="transcript_line"> evening.</div><div id="00:01:03.800" class="transcript_line"> And what was your impression of Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:01:06.760" class="transcript_line"> I thought it looked like a very exciting band and you just didn&#039;t see, you just don&#039;t see</div><div id="00:01:12.920" class="transcript_line"> bands that big anymore.</div><div id="00:01:14.480" class="transcript_line"> It was just like big and bold and brassy.</div><div id="00:01:19.720" class="transcript_line"> It was right up my street.</div><div id="00:01:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Big, bold, brassy and brash.</div><div id="00:01:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:01:29.720" class="transcript_line"> But in that mix, there was also some very good players and some really nice improvising</div><div id="00:01:42.440" class="transcript_line"> in that mix as well.</div><div id="00:01:47.120" class="transcript_line"> So how long had you been playing before you actually did Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:01:51.880" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:01:52.880" class="transcript_line"> Or joined Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:01:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Probably about 15 years.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you play anything other than saxophone or was saxophone your first instrument?</div><div id="00:02:05.720" class="transcript_line"> No, I just play saxophone.</div><div id="00:02:07.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so how did you start playing the saxophone?</div><div id="00:02:14.600" class="transcript_line"> I played clarinet at school and I really liked it but I&#039;m dyslexic so reading music was always</div><div id="00:02:27.040" class="transcript_line"> a huge struggle for me.</div><div id="00:02:29.560" class="transcript_line"> And so I was learning at school off written music and when I went home I used to go home</div><div id="00:02:35.840" class="transcript_line"> and practice by improvising and trying to work things out by ear instead of reading</div><div id="00:02:42.040" class="transcript_line"> the music.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no place for that in the school I went to, I only did it for about</div><div id="00:02:52.640" class="transcript_line"> three years and then I stopped playing.</div><div id="00:02:56.600" class="transcript_line"> And then I joined the army.</div><div id="00:02:59.200" class="transcript_line"> When I left the army, I met an old friend of mine, I&#039;ve known since I was five, who</div><div id="00:03:06.400" class="transcript_line"> was in a new wave band.</div><div id="00:03:12.240" class="transcript_line"> And he said, you used to play clarinet didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:16.520" class="transcript_line"> And I said yeah and he said well do you want to be in a band?</div><div id="00:03:19.760" class="transcript_line"> But you should probably play saxophone.</div><div id="00:03:22.480" class="transcript_line"> So I went and bought a saxophone and was in a band.</div><div id="00:03:29.400" class="transcript_line"> I thought I did book a few lessons with a guy called Mark Buckingham.</div><div id="00:03:36.480" class="transcript_line"> So I had about a year of lessons from Mark to get the basics and then I&#039;ve had little</div><div id="00:03:43.400" class="transcript_line"> bits of lessons on and off but mostly self taught.</div><div id="00:03:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Was it always tenor sax or did you play any other exercise?</div><div id="00:03:53.840" class="transcript_line"> I have flirted with, I had a, I used to play a, what were those plastic saxophones called?</div><div id="00:04:02.440" class="transcript_line"> Grafden, I used to play a grafden alto and I did play with, I did have a soprano at one</div><div id="00:04:14.040" class="transcript_line"> point as well.</div><div id="00:04:15.440" class="transcript_line"> But what I found is all that did is double your practice because unless you practice</div><div id="00:04:23.620" class="transcript_line"> on both, when you were playing out, changing over is difficult then.</div><div id="00:04:30.500" class="transcript_line"> And I just didn&#039;t have the time to do that much practice so I just concentrated on tenor.</div><div id="00:04:39.660" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve sold the others now.</div><div id="00:04:44.220" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been my favourite to tell you the truth of all the saxophones.</div><div id="00:04:49.260" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been tenor for me except for Eric Dolphy who&#039;s the only alto player who gets</div><div id="00:04:58.980" class="transcript_line"> in my path and on of tenor players.</div><div id="00:05:06.860" class="transcript_line"> Maybe Cannonball Adley on a good night.</div><div id="00:05:16.260" class="transcript_line"> And are there any particularly memorable occasions with Wunderbras playing with Wunderbras?</div><div id="00:05:24.540" class="transcript_line"> Oh, there were quite a few.</div><div id="00:05:28.060" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always said about Wunderbras, I&#039;ve played some of the best gigs I&#039;ve ever played with</div><div id="00:05:34.860" class="transcript_line"> Wunderbras but I&#039;ve also played some of the worst.</div><div id="00:05:41.420" class="transcript_line"> And then we used to play a lot of street gigs and smaller gigs and we had the mini bus and</div><div id="00:05:50.220" class="transcript_line"> not many people could make it and you were sections short and you turn up and you go</div><div id="00:05:55.140" class="transcript_line"> oh no this is awful and just have to struggle through.</div><div id="00:05:59.420" class="transcript_line"> So I remember a few of those but then I remember playing at the Fuse Festival to 2,000 people</div><div id="00:06:09.900" class="transcript_line"> that was fantastic.</div><div id="00:06:14.300" class="transcript_line"> I also remember a great gig the first time we played on stage at Brecon and there weren&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:21.860" class="transcript_line"> many people in the audience and so the band decided to get off the stage and dance and</div><div id="00:06:29.460" class="transcript_line"> I think we were playing El Watuzzi and the rhythm section just carried on but then they</div><div id="00:06:35.500" class="transcript_line"> got to the part where it was my solo so I jumped back on stage in solo and people wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:41.060" class="transcript_line"> come back and I must have done 30 choruses running out of breath going please come back</div><div id="00:06:47.340" class="transcript_line"> 30 choruses I&#039;m running out of stuff to play now.</div><div id="00:06:55.660" class="transcript_line"> So that was a very memorable gig for me.</div><div id="00:06:58.380" class="transcript_line"> And then what other ones do I remember?</div><div id="00:07:03.500" class="transcript_line"> Oh and then I don&#039;t think I ever travelled abroad with Wonder Brass with all the things</div><div id="00:07:12.380" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve done abroad I don&#039;t think I ever went abroad with Wonder Brass.</div><div id="00:07:18.300" class="transcript_line"> How many Brecons do you think you did?</div><div id="00:07:24.540" class="transcript_line"> I think I was involved with Wonder Brass for 10 years and I went every year so I must have</div><div id="00:07:29.500" class="transcript_line"> done about 9 or 10 something like that.</div><div id="00:07:34.220" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a long time with the band.</div><div id="00:07:37.660" class="transcript_line"> And I was in the band when we used to so I did that transition from playing on the street</div><div id="00:07:45.620" class="transcript_line"> at Brecon to being on the stage with other people like those were great gigs the Amapundo</div><div id="00:07:53.620" class="transcript_line"> gigs the gigs with Claude and Jason Yard those were oh they were really challenging but amazing</div><div id="00:08:03.380" class="transcript_line"> what a learning experience they were as well.</div><div id="00:08:07.060" class="transcript_line"> So those project gigs were really really good.</div><div id="00:08:12.700" class="transcript_line"> And you know I never thought I&#039;d play at Brecon Jazz Festival never ever in a million years.</div><div id="00:08:22.380" class="transcript_line"> So that was Brecon was always the high point of the year for me really because you got</div><div id="00:08:29.060" class="transcript_line"> to play and then you got to go and see your heroes afterwards.</div><div id="00:08:34.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:08:35.060" class="transcript_line"> And for free.</div><div id="00:08:38.060" class="transcript_line"> And as many of them as you liked it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:08:43.460" class="transcript_line"> It was good yes it was very good.</div><div id="00:08:47.700" class="transcript_line"> And since Wonder Brass what have you been doing since?</div><div id="00:08:52.700" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been going to jam sessions on and off since I left Wonder Brass and I&#039;m now playing</div><div id="00:09:02.020" class="transcript_line"> a blues band.</div><div id="00:09:07.020" class="transcript_line"> Which is interesting because it means I have to know stuff because I&#039;m the only horn player</div><div id="00:09:14.860" class="transcript_line"> and with Wonder Brass if you didn&#039;t quite know something you could probably just not</div><div id="00:09:18.980" class="transcript_line"> play.</div><div id="00:09:19.980" class="transcript_line"> Because there&#039;d be another three tenor players you know and if there was a bit was tricky</div><div id="00:09:29.500" class="transcript_line"> you didn&#039;t know you just didn&#039;t play.</div><div id="00:09:32.660" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;ve got to play all the time.</div><div id="00:09:41.140" class="transcript_line"> Do you think Wonder Brass enabled you to do things musically that you know otherwise</div><div id="00:09:47.420" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t have done?</div><div id="00:09:48.420" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah absolutely yeah I mean done some amazing stuff.</div><div id="00:09:53.420" class="transcript_line"> As I said there was who&#039;s that is that Gaynor?</div><div id="00:09:56.420" class="transcript_line"> How&#039;d you get in?</div><div id="00:09:59.300" class="transcript_line"> Was the front door open?</div><div id="00:10:00.300" class="transcript_line"> Oh dear.</div><div id="00:10:01.300" class="transcript_line"> Hello matey.</div><div id="00:10:02.300" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m being interviewed.</div><div id="00:10:05.300" class="transcript_line"> Four.</div><div id="00:10:06.300" class="transcript_line"> About Wonder Brass.</div><div id="00:10:09.460" class="transcript_line"> Wonder Brass.</div><div id="00:10:12.460" class="transcript_line"> Cheeky.</div><div id="00:10:15.460" class="transcript_line"> Okay and you know this sort of Wonder Brass 25 years.</div><div id="00:10:24.460" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to get involved with that?</div><div id="00:10:27.180" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to get anything particular out of that?</div><div id="00:10:29.580" class="transcript_line"> I would like to get involved with that.</div><div id="00:10:33.260" class="transcript_line"> I mean I would say I did try to join Wonder Brass again but during the time I&#039;d left there</div><div id="00:10:42.900" class="transcript_line"> were many more people who would read music and I just couldn&#039;t I have to learn everything</div><div id="00:10:49.420" class="transcript_line"> by rote so I know it by rote and I just didn&#039;t have the time because instead of when I joined</div><div id="00:10:56.340" class="transcript_line"> there were many people couldn&#039;t read so we used to spend a long time learning a new piece</div><div id="00:11:01.660" class="transcript_line"> and now it&#039;s a couple of weeks and it&#039;s done and it just meant I was getting further and</div><div id="00:11:07.700" class="transcript_line"> further behind and yeah you know which was a shame because I do enjoy playing with Wonder</div><div id="00:11:15.780" class="transcript_line"> Brass but I&#039;ve always I only learn the tune so I can improvise on it.</div><div id="00:11:22.300" class="transcript_line"> If I don&#039;t want to improvise on a tune I won&#039;t bother learning it.</div><div id="00:11:32.300" class="transcript_line"> Okay well I&#039;m sure we can you know I&#039;m sure we can there&#039;s plenty of tunes that we can</div><div id="00:11:39.500" class="transcript_line"> do that you would still remember so I&#039;m sure we can sort out something.</div><div id="00:11:44.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah yeah.</div><div id="00:11:45.300" class="transcript_line"> For the project.</div><div id="00:11:46.300" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;ll be good.</div><div id="00:11:47.300" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:48.300" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:11:49.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll be nice to meet Nick and Claude again yeah as well.</div><div id="00:11:53.700" class="transcript_line"> Yeah yeah.</div><div id="00:11:56.220" class="transcript_line"> Okay great thanks Stuart thank you very much.</div><div id="00:11:58.700" class="transcript_line"> Thanks Brian.</div></div></p>
