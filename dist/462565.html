    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think television influenced your leisure time at all?</div><div id="00:00:06.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, not really.</div><div id="00:00:09.360" class="transcript_line"> No, it probably kept the children quiet for an hour</div><div id="00:00:12.560" class="transcript_line"> and that was the main reason you put it on,</div><div id="00:00:15.280" class="transcript_line"> but mostly it was for the news.</div><div id="00:00:20.400" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s what we missed, I think.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, we used to go to the cinema to see what was happening on the news.</div><div id="00:00:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Like the 1956 floods and things?</div><div id="00:00:32.480" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we watched things like Coronation Street for a long time,</div><div id="00:00:36.800" class="transcript_line"> but the thing is that even then it doesn&#039;t matter if you miss a few episodes.</div><div id="00:00:44.720" class="transcript_line"> You know, we&#039;re not addicts to that extent,</div><div id="00:00:48.560" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t know what else is on regularly.</div><div id="00:00:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I like things like Morse and the Minder and things like that,</div><div id="00:01:00.160" class="transcript_line"> rather than a lot of the programmes I don&#039;t actually sit and watch.</div><div id="00:01:04.880" class="transcript_line"> Heartbeat, yes.</div><div id="00:01:10.160" class="transcript_line"> And the Songs of Praise.</div><div id="00:01:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you see, you mentioned some time about S4C.</div><div id="00:01:15.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, we had good S4C at one stage and then they came around and adjusted your set</div><div id="00:01:26.960" class="transcript_line"> and it still worked for a while.</div><div id="00:01:28.880" class="transcript_line"> But where we live in Coed Pwyth,</div><div id="00:01:32.880" class="transcript_line"> and this doesn&#039;t apply to the whole of Coed Pwyth,</div><div id="00:01:36.160" class="transcript_line"> our main television comes from the Midlands.</div><div id="00:01:41.120" class="transcript_line"> So people who only wanted Welsh television,</div><div id="00:01:45.760" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve had to have special aerials pointing in a certain direction</div><div id="00:01:50.560" class="transcript_line"> and not necessarily getting a good picture.</div><div id="00:01:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, because you get a good picture on something else,</div><div id="00:01:56.480" class="transcript_line"> well, you stay to that, but I don&#039;t know what else happened.</div><div id="00:02:01.360" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve ever been able to get S4C until it went digital</div><div id="00:02:06.240" class="transcript_line"> until it went digital and now it&#039;s a good signal.</div><div id="00:02:10.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, I haven&#039;t found it yet.</div><div id="00:02:11.200" class="transcript_line"> But BBC Wales, we can&#039;t get at all.</div><div id="00:02:13.600" class="transcript_line"> We get Granada and HTV or whatever it is.</div><div id="00:02:18.800" class="transcript_line"> ITV Wales, that&#039;s all right.</div><div id="00:02:21.280" class="transcript_line"> I, yes, well, I leave what the television in the dining room,</div><div id="00:02:25.360" class="transcript_line"> I leave that on ITV Wales so that I haven&#039;t got a fiddle with it.</div><div id="00:02:32.640" class="transcript_line"> But I have to scroll up and down to get BBC One Wales.</div><div id="00:02:42.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve managed to get that, but so far I don&#039;t think I found BBC Two Wales.</div><div id="00:02:48.320" class="transcript_line"> But there are many people around me who have Sky for that reason.</div><div id="00:02:53.040" class="transcript_line"> So, but you see, it really does depend because I don&#039;t think David gets good reception.</div><div id="00:03:00.800" class="transcript_line"> Despite, you know, they had different aerials and they&#039;ve tried.</div><div id="00:03:08.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, we&#039;ve got two aerials, but as I say, it comes from over there.</div><div id="00:03:14.960" class="transcript_line"> I think the Bedwin Mountains stop anything.</div><div id="00:03:19.760" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re supposed to put a new transmitter, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s on the whirrl.</div><div id="00:03:26.880" class="transcript_line"> I really don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:27.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s magic as far as I&#039;m concerned.</div><div id="00:03:30.080" class="transcript_line"> They switch something on and it&#039;s on fair enough.</div><div id="00:03:32.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I watch Campton and things like that.</div><div id="00:03:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Of everything that you have seen on television,</div><div id="00:03:38.400" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s made the greatest impression on you?</div><div id="00:03:43.280" class="transcript_line"> Probably somebody more.</div><div id="00:03:43.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, the Royal Functions, you know, we&#039;re a great one for ceremonial things</div><div id="00:03:49.440" class="transcript_line"> and you know, watch it and watch it and it&#039;s on all day and we.</div><div id="00:03:53.440" class="transcript_line"> The Queen&#039;s hat at the.</div><div id="00:03:55.840" class="transcript_line"> At the investiture.</div><div id="00:03:58.160" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what happened.</div><div id="00:04:00.320" class="transcript_line"> She normally has very nice hats, but that one was not.</div><div id="00:04:02.880" class="transcript_line"> Like a helmet.</div><div id="00:04:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I don&#039;t know what else.</div><div id="00:04:10.080" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it&#039;s a bit like now you.</div><div id="00:04:16.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s it&#039;s disasters that really, you know, you.</div><div id="00:04:23.920" class="transcript_line"> You take more notice and it&#039;s right there with you.</div><div id="00:04:27.200" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like Japan at the moment.</div><div id="00:04:29.200" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was Christchurch a couple of weeks ago and I have a feeling you see,</div><div id="00:04:34.080" class="transcript_line"> I went to New Zealand a couple of years ago because my step-grandson is now living there</div><div id="00:04:38.240" class="transcript_line"> and I have a feeling that the hotel we stayed in is no longer there sort of thing and.</div><div id="00:04:47.280" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very thankful and it was.</div><div id="00:04:49.520" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when you went.</div><div id="00:04:51.280" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re all the other side of the world like Aberfan was here, wasn&#039;t it?</div></div></p>
