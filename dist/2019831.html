He was a human being first and foremost with his faults and his admissions to his faults.</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember one occasion during a service he had berated the congregation because we had another priest there, a parish priest who was older and not as interesting.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> People would put their heads around the door and if they saw it was the older priest they would go away and come back when Father Sartori was saying mass.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> On one Sunday, oh my goodness me, he let rip. He said to us all, you do not come to church for the priest.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He said you come to worship God.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We were all quaking in our seats but we didn&#039;t take any notice of him.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We still only went to listen to him preach because he was a good preacher.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Another occasion during a service which was one of the reasons why I felt that he was so much so human was it was during the consecration and he was literally holding the host up and he stopped.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And he looked at us and he said, how many of you actually believe this is the body of Christ?</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, this is the priest asking us because he said, sometimes I don&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I doubt.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And he says, I have to work really hard at reminding myself of why I&#039;m here and the importance of this moment in the service.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it really hit home to me that here was a man who was not just a man, he was a priest who was able to say, it&#039;s not plain sailing.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We all have doubts and it&#039;s OK.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And that as a young adult made me feel this is OK.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> This is good. This is what the church should be about.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s that was one of his his strengths was bringing religion into your everyday life and making you feel that it was OK to have doubts.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And maybe some days you didn&#039;t think it was right.</div><div id="00:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was fine. It was OK.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And that helped me a lot with my faith as a young adult.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> We all struggle with, you know, is this the right thing to do?</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Do we really want this anymore?</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And he yeah, he really kept me in the church for a long time because of his philosophy and his way of reaching out to people and making making them feel that the mass was for them.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Church was for them. It wasn&#039;t just the priests and holy people and saints.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> It was for everybody, you know.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was that was my experience of him in Haverford West.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on, I think I told you he married us.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And Rory and I were married in 1975 in Cardiff, which was where we were both from originally.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And our parish priest at the time agreed that Father Paul could actually come to Cardiff and marry us.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And now before the wedding, traditionally Rory had a stag night to which Father Paul went.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And on the day itself, June the 19th, 1975, July the 19th, I arrived at the church in the car and I was told by the usher, could you go around the block?</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh, crumbs, the groom hasn&#039;t arrived, you know, is it?</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So off I go around the block.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Come back.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you go round again?</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The priest hasn&#039;t turned up.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> What I&#039;ve got to do is driving up from Haverford West.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went around a third time.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I got there, there he was.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Bright as a ray of sunshine.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Hi, everything all right?</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Come on in.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was all robed up and into the church we went.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Lovely service.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We got to the sermon.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said to the congregation, just sit down and talk among yourselves.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, I&#039;ve got to say it&#039;s only for Rory and Sue.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So we sat there with our backs to the congregation.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I can&#039;t for the life of me remember what he said.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But all I know is he had us in fits of laughter.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And the congregation could just see our shoulders going up and down, up and down, laughing at whatever it was that he said to us.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But he didn&#039;t want to share it with the congregation, just for us.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a nice little personal touch.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was my those are my main memories about Father Paul.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Later on, when he became sick, Rory had been moved to Swansea and he went to visit him in the hospital.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, because of his illness, he was lying face down.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very difficult to sort of converse with him.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Very tragic, very sad, great loss taken far too soon.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think in the short time that he was there, he touched the hearts of so many people.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll know yourselves that that legend is still alive with all the Paul Sartori Foundation and all the charity shops.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were actually down in Tembe last Easter.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we said, we&#039;re going to have a little ride into Nailyne and West.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Have a look around.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were in Nailyne and there was a Paul Sartori charity shop.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, we&#039;ve got to go in and we&#039;ve got to buy something.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t care what it is.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve just got to go in.</div><div id="00:07:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And the lady in there, we told her that we knew him and she said, well, she didn&#039;t know him.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> She was too young to know him.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But she said the number of people who go into the shop just because they remember him and they just want to keep his memory alive,</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> keep that foundation going, keep giving as he did, giving all the time.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Wonderful man.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely wonderful.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> How would you describe him as a person?</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Fun, a little outrageous perhaps.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And kind.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the kindness and this, the willingness to get to know people, to take the time to talk to them, whether it was in the pub or after mass or whatever, he was, he always had time for people.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think those, I think the fun thing is the one thing I remember most.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> He liked to laugh.</div><div id="00:08:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He liked a joke.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He liked a bit of fun.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And he, yeah, he always was always smiling.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, he was always a happy chappy.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s how I would describe him.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you&#039;ve probably anticipated this to some extent, but do you have any other favorite stories about Father Paul?</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think the two most, my two favorite were the wedding and the occasion at mass.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I think those are my absolute favorites.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And we always ask the interviewees, did Father Paul impact your life in some way?</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, obviously he married you and your husband, so that&#039;s a fundamental influence.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you think of any other impact he might have had?</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you think of any other impact he might have had?</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think, as I said in the beginning, he kept me in the church.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He kept my faith going for a long time, to time when perhaps, you know, a lot of young people would have been leaving the church, early 20s.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, so that was an impact.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I will never forget, you know, the things that he said.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, now, I mean, I did leave the church for a while.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m back.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I often think about what he used to say.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that&#039;s the biggest impact he&#039;s had on my life is my religion.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Really.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, thank you.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I know this is a difficult question, but if you could sum up Father Paul in three words, what would they say?</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> What would they be?</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Fun, as I said.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Unconventional, which was a word you used.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And sincere.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And is there anything, finally, else you&#039;d like to mention?</div><div id="00:10:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;ve said everything that I need to.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, thank you.</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s been really, really useful having you share your memories of Father Paul with us.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And very, very grateful.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And good to see you across the Irish Sea.</div></div></p>
