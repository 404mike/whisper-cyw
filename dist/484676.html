    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Aileen Richin interviewing Rikson Richin for the Swigga 25th anniversary Cardiff</div><div id="00:00:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Carnival Heritage Project. It is the 13th of November and we are in Penelan in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:18.800" class="transcript_line"> Rikson, please could you spell your name for the recording?</div><div id="00:00:23.760" class="transcript_line"> My first name?</div><div id="00:00:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:00:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Rikson, spell R-I-X-O-N.</div><div id="00:00:28.640" class="transcript_line"> What can you remember about the first get involved in the Cardiff Carnival?</div><div id="00:00:37.760" class="transcript_line"> What can I remember about first getting involved? I think it was 2003. I got involved because</div><div id="00:00:49.680" class="transcript_line"> my wife had been involved for quite a few years prior to that and I think probably a</div><div id="00:00:55.680" class="transcript_line"> couple of years prior to that she&#039;d suggested I get involved but I wasn&#039;t so sure because</div><div id="00:01:02.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never really done anything like that before. But I was quite interested in the idea of</div><div id="00:01:07.240" class="transcript_line"> doing steel pans. So the first year I did it I went, I did I think it was classes once</div><div id="00:01:16.560" class="transcript_line"> a week for a few weeks or a couple of times a week to do steel pans and then actually</div><div id="00:01:22.520" class="transcript_line"> in the carnival I was part of the steel pan section. So that&#039;s I guess that&#039;s my first</div><div id="00:01:29.080" class="transcript_line"> memory. Although my first I guess my first memory is watching it.</div><div id="00:01:35.560" class="transcript_line"> What is it about the carnival that keeps you being involved?</div><div id="00:01:42.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just fun. On the day it&#039;s good fun. I must admit I don&#039;t do an awful lot. I don&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:48.880" class="transcript_line"> get involved too much prior to the actual event. My wife does all the costume making</div><div id="00:01:56.760" class="transcript_line"> so I pretty much just turn up on the day. It&#039;s just good fun. It&#039;s very different. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:03.720" class="transcript_line"> a different thing for me to do. I guess I&#039;m quite a shy person generally so it&#039;s not something</div><div id="00:02:11.320" class="transcript_line"> I would normally do. But it&#039;s kind of it&#039;s an alter ego for me. So once a year I get</div><div id="00:02:17.520" class="transcript_line"> to do something that&#039;s quite different for me.</div><div id="00:02:22.160" class="transcript_line"> How many carnival have you been involved in?</div><div id="00:02:25.680" class="transcript_line"> I know this because I&#039;ve made a record. So I&#039;ve been in seven. First one was in 2003.</div><div id="00:02:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Then there was a gap and I&#039;ve been in every year since 2009.</div><div id="00:02:44.680" class="transcript_line"> What is the gap?</div><div id="00:02:48.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I think there was a lot whilst I really enjoyed the steel pan there was a</div><div id="00:02:55.920" class="transcript_line"> lot of involvement. At that time I guess I wasn&#039;t that keen to do a section involving</div><div id="00:03:05.720" class="transcript_line"> around. But then when you got bigger and you went in the carnival on your own I thought</div><div id="00:03:15.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d join in with you. That&#039;s what kind of got me back involved really.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> How are the carnivals different?</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I guess they&#039;re different in different ways. Obviously there&#039;s a different theme every</div><div id="00:03:32.920" class="transcript_line"> year. So that changes it. The routes have changed quite a lot. The venues have changed.</div><div id="00:03:42.080" class="transcript_line"> The route probably changes the experience of doing it quite a lot I think. There&#039;s been</div><div id="00:03:49.880" class="transcript_line"> bits added every year. There&#039;s a static section. You do a lot of walking but then there&#039;s lots</div><div id="00:03:56.880" class="transcript_line"> of static bits as well. But for me I guess what makes it different every year is the</div><div id="00:04:02.640" class="transcript_line"> costumes and the outfits.</div><div id="00:04:09.160" class="transcript_line"> What was your experience of the carnival camp?</div><div id="00:04:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Experience of the carnival camp? I must admit I haven&#039;t been that involved in the last few</div><div id="00:04:19.120" class="transcript_line"> years although when I first started I did used to go down. But it&#039;s just difficult for</div><div id="00:04:27.720" class="transcript_line"> me now to really get involved in the carnival camp. But my experience of it is a positive</div><div id="00:04:32.520" class="transcript_line"> one. People are very friendly. It&#039;s quite good fun. It&#039;s just difficult to find the</div><div id="00:04:38.520" class="transcript_line"> time to do it.</div><div id="00:04:41.240" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember music and dance being involved?</div><div id="00:04:46.280" class="transcript_line"> I think the music and the dance are the most important things for me. I like dancing. There&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:59.480" class="transcript_line"> a kind of freedom that you get in being part of the carnival that I think is difficult</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> to replicate elsewhere. I like the fact that you can put an outfit on. I wear lots of masks</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> so I can hide myself a little bit so I can create a character and maybe be a bit more</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> like I&#039;d like to be. But I guess I find it more difficult in everyday life. I like being</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> able to dance around quite a lot.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you remember music as you said in the steel pans earlier. What was your most</div><div id="00:05:41.400" class="transcript_line"> memorable carnival incident?</div><div id="00:05:43.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know really. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve got a single incident. I guess I&#039;m probably</div><div id="00:05:50.400" class="transcript_line"> in it every year because I enjoy it every year. For me it&#039;s probably the outfits. On</div><div id="00:06:03.400" class="transcript_line"> the day it makes a big difference who you&#039;ve got in terms of the band. Which band you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:06:08.800" class="transcript_line"> got in front of you and which band behind you. So that makes a big difference in terms</div><div id="00:06:11.800" class="transcript_line"> of how much fun it is. But yeah I think it&#039;s probably the outfits. Just kind of dancing</div><div id="00:06:21.800" class="transcript_line"> around and mucking around with people. So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a single moment. It&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:25.800" class="transcript_line"> lots of different moments.</div><div id="00:06:31.800" class="transcript_line"> What do you recall about taking part in the parade?</div><div id="00:06:38.800" class="transcript_line"> What do you recall about taking part in the parade?</div><div id="00:06:45.800" class="transcript_line"> What do I enjoy?</div><div id="00:06:48.800" class="transcript_line"> What do you recall?</div><div id="00:06:50.800" class="transcript_line"> What do I recall?</div><div id="00:06:55.800" class="transcript_line"> I probably recall the outfits more than anything. I recall getting very wet on occasion. But</div><div id="00:07:06.200" class="transcript_line"> that just being part of the fun.</div><div id="00:07:11.200" class="transcript_line"> So what is your favourite outfit?</div><div id="00:07:16.200" class="transcript_line"> My favourite outfit was probably the 2010 Cosmic Tech Couch. It was a Terminator outfit.</div><div id="00:07:25.200" class="transcript_line"> It was a cross between a bit like Terminator from the movie Terminator. It was a bit of</div><div id="00:07:33.600" class="transcript_line"> a Roman skirt. So that was probably my favourite outfit. But I&#039;ve had lots of different outfits</div><div id="00:07:39.600" class="transcript_line"> across the years. Last year was the Hellrealm Demon which was a character from the Buddhist</div><div id="00:07:50.600" class="transcript_line"> Wheel of Life, Tanker. I&#039;ve been Davy Jones from a kind of Davy Jones like character.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been a Blue Devil, a Lightning Man, Dragon with you. So every year I&#039;ve got a different</div><div id="00:08:12.000" class="transcript_line"> mask and all my masks are on the wall of the house. So everyone that comes into the house</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> every time they go up and down the stairs they can see the masks.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> What is your favourite part of Carnival involvement?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably just the very friendly atmosphere that you get.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And what elements do you find least enjoyable?</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Least enjoyable? I don&#039;t know if there is a least enjoyable part. Actually usually, even</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> though you&#039;re tired at the end, because you&#039;ve been dancing around and engaging with the</div><div id="00:08:57.400" class="transcript_line"> crowd. I do a lot of dancing and mucking around and engaging with the crowd quite a lot. So</div><div id="00:09:03.400" class="transcript_line"> when it&#039;s over, that&#039;s probably the least engaging part of it really. When it&#039;s over,</div><div id="00:09:10.400" class="transcript_line"> when it ends.</div><div id="00:09:12.400" class="transcript_line"> How do you feel the crowd reacted?</div><div id="00:09:17.400" class="transcript_line"> I think mostly good. I think some people were a bit shy and a bit unsure about how to react.</div><div id="00:09:24.800" class="transcript_line"> I wear my masks because I like to interact with the crowd quite a lot. I&#039;ve never had</div><div id="00:09:31.800" class="transcript_line"> a negative reaction. People don&#039;t necessarily know how to react, but people are clearly</div><div id="00:09:44.800" class="transcript_line"> having a good time. So I think it&#039;s a positive one. It always surprised me how many people</div><div id="00:09:51.200" class="transcript_line"> turn out actually to watch it.</div><div id="00:09:54.200" class="transcript_line"> What is that?</div><div id="00:09:56.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m just surprised. There&#039;s always so many people out on the route watching</div><div id="00:10:01.200" class="transcript_line"> it, regardless of the weather. It&#039;s always jam-packed.</div><div id="00:10:05.200" class="transcript_line"> What changes have you seen in the Carnival over time?</div><div id="00:10:12.200" class="transcript_line"> I guess the probably biggest changes have been the routes. But I guess also it used</div><div id="00:10:18.600" class="transcript_line"> to be part of the big weekend. It&#039;s probably a shame that it&#039;s not associated with that</div><div id="00:10:26.600" class="transcript_line"> anymore to some degree because I think it lost something a little bit.</div><div id="00:10:33.600" class="transcript_line"> Whilst it&#039;s big enough as an event to stand on its own, I think it&#039;s a shame that the</div><div id="00:10:38.600" class="transcript_line"> council decided to pull funding from it and it lost its connection with that because I</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> think they gave it a slightly larger stage for it really.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you think the value of Carnival is?</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Probably that it brings people together.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What is that?</div><div id="00:11:06.400" class="transcript_line"> Not just the participants, but there is a real sense of togetherness on the day. You</div><div id="00:11:16.400" class="transcript_line"> never see any trouble or problems. People seem to be enjoying themselves and there&#039;s</div><div id="00:11:21.400" class="transcript_line"> a very relaxed atmosphere.</div><div id="00:11:24.400" class="transcript_line"> After the Carnival experience is over, how do you feel?</div><div id="00:11:30.400" class="transcript_line"> A mixture of exhilarated because you&#039;ve been dancing around and often in the rain.</div><div id="00:11:36.400" class="transcript_line"> Tired, but then usually a bit disappointed that it&#039;s all over.</div><div id="00:11:46.400" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div><div id="00:11:47.400" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome.</div></div></p>
