    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Emma Delkes from a volunteer with</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Spencer Cardiff Reservoir talking to Phil Savage of Farsomart Digital Memories Project.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the 15th of November 2024 and we are at Lisbon District Centre.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So what are your earliest memories of the rental website?</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well when I was young I wasn&#039;t even really aware the reservoir was here because it was behind,</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> it always had a buffer of fields around it and high hedges and stuff.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So unless you were a fisherman or a sailing person you didn&#039;t really come here, you know,</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because there wasn&#039;t public access.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So one evening when I was in the sixth form back in 1978 and like that,</div><div id="00:01:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on my way home from the pub and saw a gap in the hedge and just wandered through it</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and it was night time and then just sat on the edge of this reservoir and I just couldn&#039;t believe,</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t believe what I was seeing.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I was literally, I lived in Grouted Avenue and I was coming home through Fitness Park</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and I couldn&#039;t believe it was so close to where I lived, you know, 60 acres of water and I hope you missed it.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, how lovely to get someone across that.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh it was a fantastic discovery, it really was, just sat there,</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you can see it in the visible time in the area, in the seventh form anyway,</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s only my 11th genki.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just nice to sort of sit in this place and look across this water in the moonlight,</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> it was just, you know, kind of thing you just never forget, you know, it was the first impression of a place</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> and you just knew it was really special, you know.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so that was my first brush through the reservoir, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So were you, you mentioned fishing and sailing, were you, did you get involved in that?</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my mother badgered me into sailing, she said you should get up there and make the most of this fabulous facility,</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and you know, like a lot of kids, obviously ignored my mother for seven years,</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> that eventually, you know, won&#039;t cap and came up here and I did my RYA 1 and 2 up here with Anne Barrett,</div><div id="00:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Anne and Fran, the two ladies who ran it, and yeah, it was great, we had really good times up there,</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, and it was all run by the council, friends who are very good standard, you know,</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> and they had a good selection of boats to sail, yeah, they were very good at bringing you on, you know,</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and gently introducing you to the various basic concepts behind sailing,</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> and I think the thing that really captured my imagination was that the principles of sailing,</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> a little miradingi, or a little tupperdingi, were the same as the great big naval vessels,</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> they all have to, you know, stay out of irons, you know, if you go directly into the wind you&#039;re going to stop,</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> but as long as you&#039;re outside the angle, I think it was called irons, it&#039;s like 45 degrees either side of the weather,</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> winds heading onto you, if you&#039;re outside, if you go inside that you stop,</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> but once you&#039;re tacking across the wind you&#039;re away, and it&#039;s just really clever, you know,</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s age-old stuff, the oldest man, you know, is Dale, and you&#039;re learning all these first principles, you know,</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> free energies as well. Well yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah,</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> and I just remember sailing a laser boat, you know, these are sort of racing boats,</div><div id="00:04:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and I got in this boat and I was sailing it very cautiously, and Anne Barrett is yelling at me from the boat,</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> she said, she said, she wants me to lay flat off the side of the boat, hanging off the side of the boat,</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> she said, I want to see your head clipping the waves, and this boat just suddenly took off,</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean it sailed in a way, you know, I was being ultra cautious, and she said something pathetic,</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> get your head out of there, and suddenly this boat just took off like a motorbike, you know,</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s like you&#039;re turning the throttle on a motorbike, and I shot across the Thantua, I couldn&#039;t believe it,</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> literally, you know, you have your eyes, literally like just the width from your nose to your ear,</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> from the waves, and you&#039;re skimming across the water, it was such, oh, it was just an amazing,</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> exhilarating, it was exhilarating, that&#039;s right, exactly, yeah, yeah,</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and I thought this is fantastic, and I really, you know, and you come up here with your bag and kit,</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d be checking the wind speed and all that, you know, and you thought, oh, today&#039;s a good,</div><div id="00:05:29.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, thing for sailing, you know, and so if you were being sort of particularly confident,</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> there were two sail sizes for a laser, and you&#039;d put the big sail off, you know, even though it was going to</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> throw you in the water quite a bit, if it worked, if it worked right, boy, really travel,</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and the thing is, the reservoir, you know, going a diagonal across 68, you know, it&#039;s a nice,</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> you get a, you know, maybe about two, three minutes of zooming along, you know, before you have to tack</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> and turn, and it&#039;s really budding, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so that was, yeah, it was good,</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and they had a nice clubhouse as well, and it was called the place with, it even had coal hires in it,</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah, it was lovely, it was a...</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> This flame you won&#039;t blow, okay?</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, don&#039;t worry.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s your heart wall, you think?</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was this clubhouse like?</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was family, it was a, it had a child roof, it was a single storey sort of bungalow sort of thing there,</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and it had coal fires in it, it was a real museum piece, you know, sort of built, I think, post-war,</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> but it was really lovely, and one of the tragedies really of the sort of destruction that Western power</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> wrought on the place was they just all those deaths, yeah, and it was a real shame, because I think</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> if it had survived, I think they would have made a bit of a feature of it, you know,</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d expanded it with some very bland, terrapin building which we used for changing,</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> but that, you know, it got the job done, and then it has two old sort of virtually earth plasmas in Holland,</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> which had to be experienced and be believed, you know, but it all added to the kind of stick of the place,</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, the feeling of it, you know, it was lovely, and obviously the visitor tent in there was fantastic,</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> but I think if they had that old sailing tent, it would still exist, I think they could have made something of it,</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> yeah, you know, it&#039;s got a real character, yeah, so, but yeah, there we are, we&#039;ve come through it.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So what sort of dates was that?</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well that must have been in the early 2000s, the RAD campaign kicked off in 2001,</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> the sailing I think limped on to about 2010, I&#039;m not sure, maybe you can call that, I&#039;m not very good on dates,</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> but then once they, what they did, they lowered the reservoir level very, very low,</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> so it made it very difficult to do it in the lurch and boats and stuff,</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and when you&#039;re low down, you&#039;ve got windshadow off the walls of the reservoir,</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> whereas the water&#039;s right up, you&#039;ve got really good wind, sail with, you know, which ever got eddy and all that,</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> so they lowered the level, so they were doing anything that was for the sailing, yeah, yeah,</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> so that was the end of the thing?</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, that was it, and they moved all the boats down to Cardiff Bay,</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> but I don&#039;t know, I didn&#039;t follow it down there,</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> but the boats were down there, I don&#039;t think they really, the sailing got off the ground there,</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> because the water wasn&#039;t really suitable for immersion sports,</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve actually fallen in Cardiff Bay, seen the water and I&#039;ve had it in my mouth,</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s definitely not the same as the lovely fair water they had in Clannocking,</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> so...</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Because everything gets flushed out of there.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, well this is it, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, they did a lot of work on the sewer jobs,</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> the forcing stuff, all the impounded things out of the bay,</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> but there&#039;s still lucky stuff going down there, you know,</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> so I think when you&#039;re learning stuff, you&#039;re going to spend a lot of time with the water,</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, if you&#039;re stressing yourself,</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> so, and you didn&#039;t want to, and people would fall in any way,</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> they were getting ear and eye infections, you know, and tummy bugs,</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s why you&#039;re attracted, you fall in a sort of placement sewage, you know.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, you can get the whole shebang going down there, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, there we are.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Nothing to compare to here.</div><div id="00:10:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So, do you feel like it touches any of the people you&#039;ve learned to sail with?</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly Anne, and you know, the extra structure,</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> she&#039;s living in the area, and I did, after we were there,</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> when we were trying to work out a bit of the reservoir, you know,</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> when it looked like we might be able to beat western power,</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> but at that time, world board was on board,</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> so we were trying to work out a business formula for running the reservoir,</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> but actually, do your best thing, because they are a water company,</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> and they know their stuff, you know, and they&#039;ve got to, you know,</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re set up for it, to run reservoirs.</div></div></p>
