He just didn&#039;t want to work on the railways.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So what he did, he decided to put all his money, hired a load of Africans to carry all the groceries.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So he used to buy all the stuff, travel all the way to the railways.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t matter which area, whether it was Uganda, Kenya or Tanzania.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d travel through the jungles all the way with carrying all this.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d sell all the products to the railway workers.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after a few years, once everybody got to know him,</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> and he decided that he was going to open a shop.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So when he was traveling around, he had found this patch in the middle of nowhere in Uganda.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And he called it Paranga.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And he opened a little shop, basically a shed with a room in the back where he was sleeping.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he told all the railway workers, you can come to me now and buy whatever you want.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And basically they used to there buy any.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And if they needed something, he&#039;d make a note of it so he&#039;d get it for them.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how he opened his first shop.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> It was Ahmad Haji, his name, Ahmad Haji Pabani.</div><div id="00:04:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, he then basically brought my grandmother over.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And it just built up from that.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And my memory of that town in Paranga is roughly down to about 11, 12 houses and a schoolhouse.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where Mum and Dad and we used to live.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the schoolhouse.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know, one of the memories of the schoolhouse is when we had the rainy season,</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> the orchard, it was full of oranges and grapefruits,</div><div id="00:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d have the heavy rains.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you go out there, you had a blanket of fruit on the ground</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> because the rain was so heavy.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the rain was so heavy, you know.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fabulous.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I always remember that.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That is one memory that&#039;s stuck in my head.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Really good, you know.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, there was a schoolhouse there.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And what he did, my grandfather, he built another shop.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he&#039;d send to India to get his friends over.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And bit by bit, all his friends come over.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was a grocery shop, then you had a bicycle shop,</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> you had a car shop, you know, a mechanic and things like that.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was an entrepreneur?</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, he was. He was.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, he did quite well there.</div><div id="00:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He built the whole community.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t a very big community, but he built it.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he moved to Soroti then.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So this town, your grandfather started out in, whereabouts was it, in Uganda?</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, do you know what you&#039;re asking?</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> All I know, it was called Paranga.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and it wasn&#039;t far from the border of Kenya, actually, you know, Kisumo?</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, Kisumo.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He said the borderline.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Around there it was. It wasn&#039;t very far.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think the reason he opened it there was it was closer to the border</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> for the guys to come from the railways in Kenya, you know.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And your grandfather would have gone from India to sort of Mombasa with the railways?</div><div id="00:06:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So anything he talked about, how he travelled?</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, all I know is he came over on a ship he did, but didn&#039;t know much about it.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And a lot of this information I found out was through my uncle.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my uncle was in Britain studying when everything kicked off.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So he told me quite a lot and there were some photographs which he wouldn&#039;t give me.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the reason I was asking all these questions, in the mid-70s I started writing it all down.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Right? I started writing it all down.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was looking for information myself, you know.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So all I know is he came from India and then he sort of travelled through the three countries where the railways were being built.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there was much to do with Tanzania, but it was more Uganda and Kenya, you know.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And I presume they came from Gujarat or Kutch was it?</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Kutch, yeah it was Kutch it was.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And Mundra?</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, Kutch, Mundra.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where my mother is from as well.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And basically my great-grandfather was still out in India, Kutch.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And when my dad was born and as he grew up and all that, my dad was driving lorries for my granddad.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And at that time my granddad had built up quite a business with cotton, soap, oil, all that, you know.</div><div id="00:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So dad was driving for him, driving the lorries and that.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he sent dad to India because that&#039;s what people used to do.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They send your kids or go see where, you know, because dad was born in Uganda, but he&#039;d never been to India.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So dad went out there and he found the place fascinated, like, you know, and dad was so easy going everybody loved him.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And while he was there, now this is the story my mum told me.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum and her friends used to go to school and things like that and they&#039;d go to the mosque in the evenings and they&#039;d see my dad and his friends and that.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to say, oh look at them, like, you know, they can&#039;t, you know, behave themselves and all that.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> What she didn&#039;t realise that when she got home one day after quite a few months, dad&#039;s grandfather had arranged to marriage, arranged the marriage between mum and dad.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And he told dad, he said, you know, going back to Uganda without a bride.</div><div id="00:09:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that bride happened to be mum.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My daughter needs to look at you and sort.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so it was quite nice.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But I found out that they sort of arrived in Uganda and it was only a couple of months after I was born.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was born in 57 November 57.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m assuming my parents got back from India in August, October, November around there.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so yeah.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were born in Uganda.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Uganda in Saroti.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> 30th of November, 1957.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was good.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We stayed.</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What was your childhood like in Saroti?</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I can remember my school days where I lived with my uncles and aunties and that with my grandparents.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite hard.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite hard.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was hard work and being sort of kids and you&#039;ve got it wrong, your aunties would give you a slap.</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, so yeah, we did all right.</div><div id="00:10:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Did all right.</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I wouldn&#039;t say it was how can I put it?</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it wasn&#039;t very pleasant, but it&#039;s OK.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:11:10.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:11:11.000" class="transcript_line"> We we learned and basically me and Yashmin, my sister, we stayed there.</div><div id="00:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I can&#039;t exactly remember how old I was when we went to Mbali then with mum and dad.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t quite remember that.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But then in Mbali, I remember my school days.</div><div id="00:11:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember my senior days in the senior school.</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to have fun, lots of sports.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I always remember that we on top of the street where we were, it was a school field and we&#039;d play football there and cycling and that.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we always sit down on a weekend listening to Arsenal playing because Arsenal was our favourite team.</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Used to love listening to the radio.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, I used to play a lot of sports.</div><div id="00:12:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to do athletics.</div><div id="00:12:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to play cricket, hockey, football and squash was one of my love.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved playing squash.</div><div id="00:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, I carried on with squash and cycling when I came to Britain.</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:12:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So when Amin gave the notice that three months time you&#039;ve got to leave, what was that like for your family, your parents?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was chaos.</div><div id="00:12:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, you know, we were all trying to and you had I think it was close to 800000 people trying to leave the country.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can imagine what chaos that caused.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And we landed.</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, mum and they were still in Mbali, but I went to Kampala to help dad because we had to get our visas and things like that.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the square.</div><div id="00:12:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You had all the main embassies, you had the Canadian, the British, the Americans, the Red Cross.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They were all there.</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember four four queues outside the British Embassy, four across, and it was going round the block.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. So you had so many people trying to.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, my memory of that was I used to sleep the night there on the pavement to keep my place and dad would come there in the morning and take over.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I would go home, have a couple of hours sleep, something to eat, and I go back down in the afternoon for dad to come home and have some food.</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is how we kept the place to get not to lose the queue.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And some of the things were happening in the queues were just, oh, and you get to know people when you&#039;re there day in, day out.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And I seen this young boy.</div><div id="00:13:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He happened to see his father in the queue for the wrap.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And he ran to see his father and the guys from the army caught him.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They were and he said, that&#039;s my dad, my dad.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I just want to be with my dad.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And they wouldn&#039;t listen to him.</div><div id="00:14:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They thought he was jumping the queue and all that.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was that was a horrible sight to see.</div><div id="00:14:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They tied him to the bars of the Jeep and they took the canopy off.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was tied there and they were whipping him going up and down the street to show people that you can&#039;t get away with it.</div><div id="00:14:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so that was horrible.</div><div id="00:14:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I was to see a young kid.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> He was no, no bigger, no older than me.</div><div id="00:14:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, and I was only what, 14, you know, and to see that.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was only one of the things some of the army guys, they used to just whip people walking along and they they had the big long whips like that.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they just hit you for no reason at all.</div><div id="00:14:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, because I mean, that basically corrupted their mind to say we were robbing the country and all that, you know, because initially he started picking on the Jews.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The things he came out and said about the Jews.</div><div id="00:15:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I always remember that.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he started saying about the British and the Asians.</div><div id="00:15:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, that&#039;s what killed the country.</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because once everybody left, the country just collapsed.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, the economy just collapsed.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But I always remember that I was there sleeping in the night.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was there in the afternoons for dad to come home.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he&#039;d come back for an hour or so.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I&#039;d go back in the night and I&#039;d sleep on the pavement, keeping the place.</div><div id="00:15:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to do it.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was the oldest son.</div><div id="00:15:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to do it.</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And then dad would help his brothers and sisters and help granddad and grandma.</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And it got a little bit hectic then because one of the memories I remember is my dad&#039;s younger brother.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He forgot the key to his shop.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he thought, well, it&#039;s his shop.</div><div id="00:16:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And he broke the door open.</div><div id="00:16:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the army arrested him.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And he landed up in a camp where once you go in there, you never seen they were whipping and killing people like a concentration camp.</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Always remember that because a lot of photographs came out later on where people were tied to the posts.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But lucky enough, dad was a man of many talents, I would say.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he got to know one of the guards and he sort of made a deal.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> What exactly he paid them, what he did, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:16:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But he managed to get my uncle out of there and straight on a plane with granddad and grandma with the Red Cross.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And they managed to get away to America.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was a good thing that he saved his brother.</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, there was some horrible sights when I was in Mbali before I went to Kampala.</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Our neighbor, one of the neighbors, they took her, you know.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was so much raping and pillaging and that going on.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the things I remember as well is everybody was selling their stuff.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So mum was selling everything off.</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And now this is a good bit, this is, which was really shocking.</div><div id="00:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Mum was selling all the stuff and there was a boat with a light in it, electric light.</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And the army jeep stopped outside the house and they came up and Shabila, who was there with mum, started screaming, crying and screaming.</div><div id="00:17:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And this guy said, the army guy said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don&#039;t start screaming.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re not here to hurt you. We just want to see where you go for sale.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were looking at the boat.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And mum said, oh yeah, yeah, you can have it. No, no, we will pay for it.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can promise you, nobody will touch you.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> None of my men will touch you. I guarantee you.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember mum saying that and he actually bought the boat and he paid for it.</div><div id="00:18:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, he actually paid for it.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But my worst memory.</div><div id="00:18:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, how can I put this? I&#039;d say it as it is.</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on my way into town and I was going to go from Jamath Khanna first.</div><div id="00:18:40.000" class="transcript_line"> As you know, Jamath Khanna is a mosque, our mosque.</div><div id="00:18:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember I&#039;m coming past the Hindu temple and just past the Hindu temple, there&#039;s a big green.</div><div id="00:18:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m walking along the green and all of a sudden a car pulls up and a jeep behind the car, an army jeep.</div><div id="00:19:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;re all screaming in Swahili, right, telling this man and his son to get out of the car.</div><div id="00:19:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And the boy got out, but the old man couldn&#039;t get out in time.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m basically, there&#039;s the pavement, the road, there&#039;s the pavement and I&#039;m by, that&#039;s how close.</div><div id="00:19:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say about two metres.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And they just walk up, beat the boy with the stick and the other one come round and he just took his gun out and shot the old man through the window.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And that, I just froze and I was standing there and I literally peed myself.</div><div id="00:19:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I wet myself and I was shaking like hell and I thought I&#039;m next because I&#039;ve seen this happening.</div><div id="00:19:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But because they seen that I was a young boy, I was shaking, I was scared.</div><div id="00:20:00.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no way I was a threat.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And they just jumped in the car and drove off.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Asians, yeah, but I can&#039;t, I didn&#039;t know them, I can&#039;t remember them.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> All I can remember is that thing, he come out, he beat the boy, one of them beat the boy and the other one shot the old man because he couldn&#039;t get out of the car quick enough.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the worst thing.</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought that was the end of me that day.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I really thought that was the end of me.</div><div id="00:20:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But they could see I was no threat to them.</div><div id="00:20:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I was shaking, I wet myself, I ran back home and mum found me under the bed.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the second time mum found me under the bed.</div><div id="00:20:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And the second time was in Kampala.</div><div id="00:20:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the first time mum found me.</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first time was in Mabale.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In Mabale, yeah.</div><div id="00:21:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Second time was Kampala.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Now what had happened, I&#039;m a big Western fan, right?</div><div id="00:21:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I love Westerns.</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were showing the good, the bad and the ugly.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Now in Uganda, they used to have shows from the West.</div><div id="00:21:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to have shows from afternoon shows.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you had three to six, then three to nine, nine to twelve.</div><div id="00:21:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went to see the good, the bad and the ugly, nine to twelve.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So as kids, nothing was, you know, so we didn&#039;t really...</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were walking through now and I seen, we were coming through the mosque in Kampala.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I seen all the lights on it.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was late for lights, you know, and all these army jeeps.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So I jumped on, curious, jumped on a bin to have a look through the window.</div><div id="00:22:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And all I could see was lots and lots of army men with guns and people on the floor.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Spread out eagles.</div><div id="00:22:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They were trying to rob the place.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Take anything they could get and money, you know, because they knew money there.</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, wow, what&#039;s happening?</div><div id="00:22:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I tried to jump off.</div><div id="00:22:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I jumped, the bin fell over.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And I run.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean I run.</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> All I could hear was machine gun fire behind me.</div><div id="00:22:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Screaming and shouting, all that and all that.</div><div id="00:22:39.000" class="transcript_line"> All I did was I just dived into this ditch, right?</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I went under into the ditch all the way, crawled right out to the other side of the road.</div><div id="00:22:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, because this was a long ditch all the way through the tunnel, all the way out to the other side.</div><div id="00:22:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I was absolutely soaking, dirt, everything.</div><div id="00:22:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just run.</div><div id="00:23:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I just run.</div><div id="00:23:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember jumping over a fence, like a hedge.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:23:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the second time mum found me under the bed.</div><div id="00:23:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was that scared.</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only twice I can think I was in danger.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they traumatise you?</div><div id="00:23:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was pretty strong.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t really, right?</div><div id="00:23:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I just basically forgot about it.</div><div id="00:23:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, it was basically my mind blocking it, I suppose.</div><div id="00:23:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not a psychiatrist or anything, but I suppose that&#039;s what it...</div><div id="00:23:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And kids tend to be resilient.</div><div id="00:23:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just...</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And the third time was quite...</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh, am I going to make it?</div><div id="00:23:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Mum gave me a ring to put on because all the kids were very...</div><div id="00:23:53.000" class="transcript_line"> to see if we could get something out, like, you know?</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And we got to the airport, Intay Bay Airport, and they were checking everybody.</div><div id="00:24:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody was getting out of there.</div><div id="00:24:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They were taking all the necklaces off and the rings off.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And they put me in this room and they stripped me.</div><div id="00:24:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Basically, I was standing there with my pants.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, right?</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were like little shorts, homemade things like mum had made.</div><div id="00:24:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And they took the ring off my hands, right?</div><div id="00:24:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And they just stripped me clean.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And then all of a sudden, lucky enough, I was out of the room.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And they just stripped me clean.</div><div id="00:24:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then all of a sudden, lucky enough, the phone rang.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So the woman went to answer the phone, and she was barking away on the phone,</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> shouting at somebody.</div><div id="00:24:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just grabbed all my clothes, checked them on quick,</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> and walked out straight onto the plane.</div><div id="00:24:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Right?</div><div id="00:24:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a British Caledonian plane, right?</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So they couldn&#039;t board that.</div><div id="00:24:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They couldn&#039;t have the British territory.</div><div id="00:24:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was lucky I got on there.</div><div id="00:25:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I got on there, I noticed mum and the sisters and brothers and that.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were lucky we got out there, right?</div><div id="00:25:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, what exactly happened with the rest of them, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:25:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But that day, I thought, now was it like, you know,</div><div id="00:25:14.000" class="transcript_line"> especially when they made me strip, I thought, oh no.</div><div id="00:25:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they were checking that we weren&#039;t hiding anything under our clothes and that.</div><div id="00:25:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I was lucky.</div><div id="00:25:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I just grabbed all my clothes.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She was barking on the phone.</div><div id="00:25:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just slowly opened the door and walked out.</div><div id="00:25:29.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="00:25:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I just walked out, run up the runway straight onto the plane.</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they didn&#039;t have buses and things like that.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> There were people who just walk into the planes.</div><div id="00:25:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what happened.</div><div id="00:25:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And once we were on the plane, brilliant.</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember that flight, right?</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that flight because we stopped in Benghazi.</div><div id="00:25:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We stopped in Benghazi.</div><div id="00:25:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They fueled up.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t allowed to get off the plane, but they fueled up.</div><div id="00:26:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we flew to Britain.</div><div id="00:26:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And we landed at Stensted Airport.</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was November.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I was on top of the steps coming out,</div><div id="00:26:12.000" class="transcript_line"> all you could see was frost everywhere.</div><div id="00:26:15.000" class="transcript_line"> It was freezing.</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So when we got down, they were going through all the customs</div><div id="00:26:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and everything and that.</div><div id="00:26:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m waiting, waiting, waiting.</div><div id="00:26:26.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d lost all my luggage.</div><div id="00:26:30.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d lost all my suitcases.</div><div id="00:26:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I had three suitcases.</div><div id="00:26:34.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d lost them all.</div><div id="00:26:36.000" class="transcript_line"> All I had was literally what I was wearing.</div><div id="00:26:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they find them?</div><div id="00:26:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:26:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ll come to that after.</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They found when we came, we boarded the buses.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t know where we were going.</div><div id="00:26:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So they drove from Stensted Airport to Gaydon.</div><div id="00:26:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And they called it Gaydon Resettlement Center.</div><div id="00:27:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Basically, it was a refugee camp, you know?</div><div id="00:27:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t bad.</div><div id="00:27:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely.</div><div id="00:27:07.000" class="transcript_line"> When we got there, they gave me clothes</div><div id="00:27:09.000" class="transcript_line"> because they could see I was cold.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They gave me clothes.</div><div id="00:27:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I put my clothes on, warmed up, and they had opened the kitchens up</div><div id="00:27:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and we had food and everything.</div><div id="00:27:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They fed us well, you know?</div><div id="00:27:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Really good.</div><div id="00:27:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="00:27:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, tidy.</div><div id="00:27:23.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a nice welcome.</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> How long were you there?</div><div id="00:27:28.000" class="transcript_line"> We got there in November and we left there in March,</div><div id="00:27:33.000" class="transcript_line"> the following year, 73.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think it was March the 14th I arrived in Penrith.</div><div id="00:27:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But Dad had arrived a week earlier with the kids</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> because Mum wasn&#039;t very well.</div><div id="00:27:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I stayed behind with her until she was well enough to travel.</div><div id="00:27:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, that&#039;s another story to tell.</div><div id="00:28:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It was just, how can I say?</div><div id="00:28:04.000" class="transcript_line"> My stomach was churning and yet I was excited, you know?</div><div id="00:28:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But in the camp itself are some marvellous times</div><div id="00:28:15.000" class="transcript_line"> and some horrendous times as well.</div><div id="00:28:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You get all the elderly people would find a little corner</div><div id="00:28:23.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ll play the cards, you know?</div><div id="00:28:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you had us youngsters with our radios.</div><div id="00:28:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go play a lot of badminton and table tennis.</div><div id="00:28:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was never hanging around.</div><div id="00:28:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I was out playing.</div><div id="00:28:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a university professor from Leamington Spa</div><div id="00:28:42.000" class="transcript_line"> who used to pick us up in a minibus</div><div id="00:28:44.000" class="transcript_line"> and take us to play badminton and table tennis all over the place.</div><div id="00:28:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But the one thing I used to have in the Midlands a lot was racial problems.</div><div id="00:28:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Racial, terrible names and they scream and shout</div><div id="00:28:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and tell you go where you came from and all that, you know?</div><div id="00:29:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And you had lots of...</div><div id="00:29:03.000" class="transcript_line"> But a 15-year-old kid then, you know,</div><div id="00:29:06.000" class="transcript_line"> and some of the boys were a little bit older than me who were with me,</div><div id="00:29:10.000" class="transcript_line"> they just wanted to fight everybody.</div><div id="00:29:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t, like my old man, my father,</div><div id="00:29:16.000" class="transcript_line"> he would have just slapped one of them and that&#039;d be it.</div><div id="00:29:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Now with me I was more like mum.</div><div id="00:29:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t want to know, I didn&#039;t want to fight at all, so I just walk away.</div><div id="00:29:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And don&#039;t get me wrong, if it came to the crunch I stood my ground.</div><div id="00:29:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t want to get into situations like that,</div><div id="00:29:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but there was a lot of racial problems.</div><div id="00:29:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a few problems when we went playing badminton and table tennis and that.</div><div id="00:29:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:29:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But in the camp we had a lot of youngsters thinking they ruled the roost.</div><div id="00:29:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They gang this and they gang that and all that.</div><div id="00:29:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were harassing all the old men and everything.</div><div id="00:29:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember my cousin&#039;s father, Kareem Khasab and Firoz Khasab,</div><div id="00:30:04.000" class="transcript_line"> their father and his friends, they loved playing cards.</div><div id="00:30:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And they used to sit in the corner playing</div><div id="00:30:13.000" class="transcript_line"> and for weeks on end nobody would disturb them.</div><div id="00:30:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But this gang tried to take over to say,</div><div id="00:30:20.000" class="transcript_line"> we are ruling the camp and we are the bosses here and all that.</div><div id="00:30:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They walked in there with a big jack-o-blaster</div><div id="00:30:27.000" class="transcript_line"> and they were blasting the music and all that.</div><div id="00:30:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So they kept harassing the old men.</div><div id="00:30:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And then one day Kareem&#039;s father said to my dad,</div><div id="00:30:38.000" class="transcript_line"> oh look, can you do something about this, like can you help us?</div><div id="00:30:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So dad walked in there and he told him, excuse me boys, can you take that out?</div><div id="00:30:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wouldn&#039;t listen until dad heavy handed.</div><div id="00:30:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He just laid them out.</div><div id="00:30:52.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d done a good job on them and he smashed their jack-o-blaster</div><div id="00:30:57.000" class="transcript_line"> and he told them, you ever come in here again, you&#039;ll have another one again.</div><div id="00:31:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So this particular boy, he knew a Sikh guy in another camp.</div><div id="00:31:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were the big guys, like you know, he said,</div><div id="00:31:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to bring him over here and I will sort this guy out.</div><div id="00:31:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my dad, like you know.</div><div id="00:31:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s word going around the camp, oh this is going to happen and all that.</div><div id="00:31:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You know how it is? Everybody&#039;s on alert.</div><div id="00:31:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And oh that was, oh my God, Chandrika, that was absolutely amazing what happened.</div><div id="00:31:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had this big fence post with sharp end</div><div id="00:31:41.000" class="transcript_line"> and he was going to stab dad with it, like you know, with standing behind this guy.</div><div id="00:31:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So this one evening now, bus comes along, a car comes along</div><div id="00:31:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s loads of men and this guy comes out of the car, Sikh guy.</div><div id="00:32:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So that guy with the fence post, he runs over, he tells them, come on in, he said, let&#039;s go in there.</div><div id="00:32:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re all in the reception now. I&#039;m worried about talking to my dad.</div><div id="00:32:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the boys were there and cousins were there, we&#039;re all there now.</div><div id="00:32:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And this guy walks in and he flings the doors open to make his entrance like.</div><div id="00:32:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So dad is just sitting there, you know, he&#039;s so calm and cool.</div><div id="00:32:31.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t care, dad never cared.</div><div id="00:32:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because dad could handle himself, you know, he wasn&#039;t, you wouldn&#039;t, you wouldn&#039;t just pick on Bahadur, you know.</div><div id="00:32:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Bahadur Ahmad Haji Pabani, you definitely wouldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:32:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you did pick on him, you&#039;d have someone to pick on and somebody leave you his mark.</div><div id="00:32:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:32:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So dad got up now because he could hear the noise and the commotion.</div><div id="00:33:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And the fellow walks in, dad opens the door where the guys are playing and he comes out, he shuts the door behind him.</div><div id="00:33:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And they look at each other, right.</div><div id="00:33:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So they walk up to each other now and this guy now with the post thinks like we got him now, you know, can see Bahadur now.</div><div id="00:33:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s panicking. And he walked up to each other and they grabbed each other and gave each other a big hug.</div><div id="00:33:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, hi, how are you doing? All that, you know.</div><div id="00:33:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So he said to my dad, he said, what&#039;s happening?</div><div id="00:33:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, who is this guy I&#039;m supposed to meet up and it&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:33:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you are? Yeah, it&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:33:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I gave him a slap so he brought you in to sort me out.</div><div id="00:33:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Leave it with me, he said, he turned around, grabbed that boy by the throat.</div><div id="00:33:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, let me tell you something now.</div><div id="00:33:50.000" class="transcript_line"> You lay a finger on him, I&#039;m going to shove that bar up your arse.</div><div id="00:33:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I tell you, I couldn&#039;t believe it.</div><div id="00:33:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And dad, you know, dad knew him from the belly.</div><div id="00:34:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, brilliant.</div><div id="00:34:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great. It was really nice.</div><div id="00:34:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And we never had any problems after that.</div><div id="00:34:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Never. But dad was number one there.</div><div id="00:34:13.000" class="transcript_line"> He really just kept everything cool.</div><div id="00:34:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He didn&#039;t get into any hassle, enjoyed himself.</div><div id="00:34:19.000" class="transcript_line"> But dad was working, see, because within two days of us arriving in the camp,</div><div id="00:34:24.000" class="transcript_line"> dad went looking for work.</div><div id="00:34:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And because we already had British passports,</div><div id="00:34:30.000" class="transcript_line"> we managed to get our national insurance number.</div><div id="00:34:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Our dad had his national insurance number straight away.</div><div id="00:34:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So he went to Coventry, looked for work and he had a job in the Fords.</div><div id="00:34:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow, OK.</div><div id="00:34:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And he worked in Ford, so he&#039;d work away for the week</div><div id="00:34:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and come home on the weekends.</div><div id="00:34:48.000" class="transcript_line"> In the camp. In the camp, yeah.</div><div id="00:34:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And we did that till March.</div><div id="00:34:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said to dad that there&#039;s a place in South Wales and it&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:35:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Firoz and Carine Babani, Kassam and them,</div><div id="00:35:11.000" class="transcript_line"> they were originally from the camp here in Wales.</div><div id="00:35:15.000" class="transcript_line"> In Tonfenay.</div><div id="00:35:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, come over here, it&#039;s lovely and all that.</div><div id="00:35:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So this is why we came here.</div><div id="00:35:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad came over first, because as I said, mum wasn&#039;t well and I stayed behind.</div><div id="00:35:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad came on his own first to have a look around,</div><div id="00:35:32.000" class="transcript_line"> seen the house in Penrith they offered, liked it.</div><div id="00:35:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So because he liked it, he went straight into Cardiff to look for work.</div><div id="00:35:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And he went to Cardiff and he found work straight away</div><div id="00:35:47.000" class="transcript_line"> in a company called Edward Currens in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:35:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they told him, yeah, fine, because dad was mechanic by trade.</div><div id="00:35:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was a tool handler.</div><div id="00:35:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he learned to drive trains because he was driving trains as well.</div><div id="00:36:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had a job straight away.</div><div id="00:36:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So he came back, arranged it all great.</div><div id="00:36:10.000" class="transcript_line"> He was going to take all the kids first.</div><div id="00:36:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was to stay there with mum and come the following week.</div><div id="00:36:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said, yeah, great.</div><div id="00:36:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So like I said, I&#039;m not quite sure, but I&#039;m pretty sure.</div><div id="00:36:22.000" class="transcript_line"> 99.9% sure it was the 14th of March, 1973, we arrived in Penrith.</div><div id="00:36:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And we drove the bus through the valleys and going to Penrith.</div><div id="00:36:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, I&#039;m all excited because it&#039;s a new adventure for a 15 year old kid.</div><div id="00:36:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But there again, I&#039;m a little bit apprehensive as well.</div><div id="00:36:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we get to Penrith, I started, oh, my God, my stomach was churning.</div><div id="00:36:52.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a gang of skinheads.</div><div id="00:36:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking, oh, no, no, please, no.</div><div id="00:36:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was really panicking now.</div><div id="00:37:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So there&#039;s a gang of skinheads, loads of neighbours and everybody.</div><div id="00:37:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Dad had come out with the kids as well.</div><div id="00:37:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they&#039;re all there and all excited.</div><div id="00:37:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So we got off the bus and oh, my God, what a welcome.</div><div id="00:37:19.000" class="transcript_line"> What a welcome.</div><div id="00:37:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely amazing welcome from all the neighbours and that.</div><div id="00:37:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And the gang of skinheads, they were brilliant.</div><div id="00:37:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And the leader of the gang, whose name is Keith Harris, who I still keep in touch with,</div><div id="00:37:36.000" class="transcript_line"> after getting to know everybody, I started dating his sister.</div><div id="00:37:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I started dating his sister, Kim.</div><div id="00:37:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I keep in touch with her as well.</div><div id="00:37:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And you can imagine, like, my stomach just, that relief, like, you know,</div><div id="00:37:56.000" class="transcript_line"> to think that the boys, the skinheads who were giving me trouble in the midlands,</div><div id="00:38:01.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;re completely different over here, like, you know, brilliant, brilliant.</div><div id="00:38:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Loved it.</div><div id="00:38:06.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like in Penrith, early days?</div><div id="00:38:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, early days, we started school and it was nice.</div><div id="00:38:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I was going to Ferndale Comprehensive School.</div><div id="00:38:16.000" class="transcript_line"> They called it Ferndale, but it&#039;s actually situated in Mardie.</div><div id="00:38:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yes, I was going there and I just couldn&#039;t settle in school.</div><div id="00:38:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Just couldn&#039;t settle.</div><div id="00:38:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to school from March to the following April.</div><div id="00:38:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But before that, what I used to do, I used to bunk school and work in Tilerstone Co-op.</div><div id="00:38:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you?</div><div id="00:38:45.000" class="transcript_line"> In the warehouse.</div><div id="00:38:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:38:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And only part-time, like, you know.</div><div id="00:38:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And it started off right opposite the shop in Tilerstone was a little corner shop,</div><div id="00:38:58.000" class="transcript_line"> which later on became a chemist.</div><div id="00:39:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But before it became a chemist, it used to be a second-hand shop.</div><div id="00:39:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I always remember a record player in there.</div><div id="00:39:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And I loved it, I did, because when we left the camp,</div><div id="00:39:13.000" class="transcript_line"> where we used to do discos in the camp, I used to help the guy.</div><div id="00:39:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He gave me a box full of singles.</div><div id="00:39:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:39:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had all these singles, right, but no record player.</div><div id="00:39:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So I asked Mum, could she give me money to buy that?</div><div id="00:39:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And she said, look, we can&#039;t afford it.</div><div id="00:39:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll have to work and save up yourself.</div><div id="00:39:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I did.</div><div id="00:39:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I was bunking school, working in Tilerstone Co-op.</div><div id="00:39:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as I had enough money, which I always remember was five pounds,</div><div id="00:39:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I went and bought, because he used to give me a couple of pennies here and there</div><div id="00:39:45.000"

We were together for 38 years.</div><div id="00:45:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:45:52.000" class="transcript_line"> But marriages fall apart, so it happened.</div><div id="00:45:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I bought this house down here in 82, I think it was August 82.</div><div id="00:46:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve been here ever since, you know, so yeah.</div><div id="00:46:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Your first home in your home.</div><div id="00:46:12.000" class="transcript_line"> My first home, yeah, my own,

class="transcript_line"> I built it up by buying the house next door.</div><div id="00:46:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it&#039;s big.</div><div id="00:46:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m on my own, but you know, this is more like a family hub now</div><div id="00:46:29.000" class="transcript_line"> because Frida comes here, my little sister,</div><div id="00:46:34.000" class="transcript_line"> then my son Azad and Philip and Michelle, daughter, they all come in here, you know.</div><div id="00:46:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, Carl comes in sometimes, my

week somebody will show up, so it&#039;s nice.</div><div id="00:47:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And at one time I did think of selling up and moving to Spain.</div><div id="00:47:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I was thinking of moving to Benidorm, but when Yashmin passed away.</div><div id="00:47:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yashmin&#039;s your sister.</div><div id="00:47:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yashmin&#039;s my sister, yeah.</div><div id="00:47:15.000" class="transcript_line"> She passed away.</div><div id="00:47:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, everybody remembers us from the program I did with the BBC called Full House.</div><div id="00:47:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we did the series, the follow-up series of Full House, which was on BBC One.</div><div id="00:47:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, basically that&#039;s what I was supposed to do, a couple of other documentaries with Sky.</div><div id="00:47:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But that never progressed after.</div><div id="00:47:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They did the research and that.</div><div id="00:47:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all about Uganda nations coming to Wales.</div><div id="00:47:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And as it happened, then that didn&#039;t take off, but you&#039;re doing it now.</div><div id="00:47:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:47:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me more about your sort of life now in Rwanda.</div><div id="00:48:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I love the Rwanda.</div><div id="00:48:03.000" class="transcript_line"> All my brothers and sisters, they traveled away, moved away.</div><div id="00:48:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Like Kareem, my brother, he moved to Milton Keynes and he said he wouldn&#039;t come back to Wales.</div><div id="00:48:15.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s done well for himself, you know.</div><div id="00:48:18.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s accounted by trade.</div><div id="00:48:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s in Milton Keynes now since he was about 18, 19.</div><div id="00:48:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he worked with me in Grenada.</div><div id="00:48:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then he worked for the government in St. Athens.</div><div id="00:48:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Now he&#039;s working in the Royal Mint.</div><div id="00:48:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:48:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So he moved from mum&#039;s house in Ponty to his own flat.</div><div id="00:48:46.000" class="transcript_line"> From his flat then he got married and now he&#039;s in Kilbernet.</div><div id="00:48:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Shabila went to Basin Stoke.</div><div id="00:48:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Shabila&#039;s your sister.</div><div id="00:48:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Shabila&#039;s my sister.</div><div id="00:48:56.000" class="transcript_line"> She trained in Bridgend as a nurse.</div><div id="00:48:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And she went to Basin Stoke.</div><div id="00:49:02.000" class="transcript_line"> From Basin Stoke, she&#039;s in Leicester now.</div><div id="00:49:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And she got married to my cousin Kareem.</div><div id="00:49:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, Farida, that&#039;s my little sister, she was working as a chef down in West Wales.</div><div id="00:49:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she got married to a local West Wailian and she lives in West Wales.</div><div id="00:49:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yashmin married a Welshman as well.</div><div id="00:49:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And she stayed in Thrunapia.</div><div id="00:49:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, last year she passed away.</div><div id="00:49:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, no, 2022.</div><div id="00:49:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, 2022 she passed away, not 2023.</div><div id="00:49:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, so it&#039;s just five of us left.</div><div id="00:49:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And I stayed in the Rhondda because I love the Rhondda.</div><div id="00:49:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I try and do as much as I can.</div><div id="00:49:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I got my little charity events and all that.</div><div id="00:49:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Like I try and raise money for breast cancer by dyeing my hair pink every year.</div><div id="00:50:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we do something for cancer research.</div><div id="00:50:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I haven&#039;t done nothing for two years, but we used to do collections for the homeless.</div><div id="00:50:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But I still advertise and things like that for the homeless on my Facebook page.</div><div id="00:50:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And on my radio show, I present a local radio station.</div><div id="00:50:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a presenter on there, Rhondda radio.</div><div id="00:50:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And every so often I will mention homeless on there and things like that.</div><div id="00:50:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And basically when people get in touch with me, they ask me to advertise for them for something.</div><div id="00:50:46.000" class="transcript_line"> If it&#039;s a charity, we&#039;ll do it free.</div><div id="00:50:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But if it&#039;s anything personal, there&#039;s a charge.</div><div id="00:50:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, we&#039;re still doing, I&#039;m still doing my little bit.</div><div id="00:50:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I love it. I do. I love the Rhondda.</div><div id="00:51:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve worked all your life in the Rhondda?</div><div id="00:51:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yeah. I worked all my life.</div><div id="00:51:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I worked all my life and I&#039;m still working.</div><div id="00:51:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I should have retired last year in November, but I&#039;ve continued working.</div><div id="00:51:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m thinking of retiring later on this year in April, maybe June.</div><div id="00:51:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll see how things go, but nothing&#039;s definite.</div><div id="00:51:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you know, it&#039;s quite surprising that I started off in the retail trade in the co-op.</div><div id="00:51:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going to finish off in ASDA in the retail trade again.</div><div id="00:51:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But in between, I have worked for several different companies as a salesman for just rentals.</div><div id="00:51:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And later on they were called by ASU.</div><div id="00:51:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I then worked for a company called, what was the other one?</div><div id="00:51:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to think of the small company I went to work for.</div><div id="00:51:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They were selling Hoovers. They were selling Kirby Hoovers.</div><div id="00:52:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Kirby&#039;s, and I couldn&#039;t stick it there.</div><div id="00:52:04.000" class="transcript_line"> They expect us to sell a thousand pound Hoover and expect a little bit of commission.</div><div id="00:52:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no, it&#039;s a con.</div><div id="00:52:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So I give that up and went back to Granada, where there was a second state.</div><div id="00:52:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I stayed with Granada for another nine years.</div><div id="00:52:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was with the co-op for 15 years.</div><div id="00:52:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I worked for just rentals for three years.</div><div id="00:52:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I went to Granada for nine years.</div><div id="00:52:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went to work for a German company called Mullatec.</div><div id="00:52:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And I started off as a warehouse worker, forklift driver.</div><div id="00:52:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And they put me through a little bit of training to do Six Sigma.</div><div id="00:52:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a green belt.</div><div id="00:52:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a continuous improvement course and things like that.</div><div id="00:52:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And I passed it.</div><div id="00:52:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they made me a trainer.</div><div id="00:52:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to travel, you know, travel.</div><div id="00:53:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it wasn&#039;t traveling actually.</div><div id="00:53:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just doing all the training in Wales.</div><div id="00:53:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And they asked us to show around the Japanese who came to visit.</div><div id="00:53:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And the guy who owns Toyota himself, his name is Toyota.</div><div id="00:53:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came dressed up in dungarees and all that.</div><div id="00:53:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And he guy, he&#039;s a multi, multi billionaire.</div><div id="00:53:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was dressed like any worker.</div><div id="00:53:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And they asked me to do a presentation.</div><div id="00:53:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, what?</div><div id="00:53:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, you&#039;re joking.</div><div id="00:53:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ve never done anything like that.</div><div id="00:53:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he said, you do the manifest every day.</div><div id="00:53:46.000" class="transcript_line"> All you&#039;ve got to do is just explain what you&#039;re doing.</div><div id="00:53:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, God, here we go.</div><div id="00:53:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, me being cheeky, you know, I made a good impression.</div><div id="00:53:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I finished, I banded everything ready.</div><div id="00:53:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Got it all for shipment, signed it.</div><div id="00:54:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And they said, oh, thank you and all that.</div><div id="00:54:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They went away.</div><div id="00:54:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And next thing I know, there&#039;s a Tanoy announcement.</div><div id="00:54:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Could Nasir come up to the office?</div><div id="00:54:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went up in the office and everybody said, yeah, come on in, come on in.</div><div id="00:54:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And all the Japanese guys moved their chairs for me to sit down.</div><div id="00:54:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, no, I&#039;m all right, you know.</div><div id="00:54:23.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, they wanted me to sit next to the boss.</div><div id="00:54:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So I sat down next to the boss and I could see all my bosses looking.</div><div id="00:54:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was looking at them.</div><div id="00:54:34.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing I can do.</div><div id="00:54:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They just, and my boss just nodded to me and winked.</div><div id="00:54:39.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you&#039;re all right, don&#039;t worry.</div><div id="00:54:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were asking questions and I was telling them slow</div><div id="00:54:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because he couldn&#039;t understand his interpreter.</div><div id="00:54:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to tell him.</div><div id="00:54:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just said to him, I said, what do you think of me?</div><div id="00:54:55.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you think of me getting all the parts ready for one of the best cars in the world?</div><div id="00:55:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And he laughed then.</div><div id="00:55:02.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you reckon it&#039;s a good guy?</div><div id="00:55:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I think it&#039;s a fabulous guy.</div><div id="00:55:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ve driven it once.</div><div id="00:55:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he said, we&#039;ll have to arrange for you to drive the others.</div><div id="00:55:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So we got quite chocked here now.</div><div id="00:55:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And it went so, went really well it did.</div><div id="00:55:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I went back down, they said, oh, you&#039;re going to have food?</div><div id="00:55:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you stay.</div><div id="00:55:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re having food.</div><div id="00:55:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, I stayed for food and everything.</div><div id="00:55:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And when it all finished and they all went away, the German boss came downstairs</div><div id="00:55:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and he called me and he said, come on, they want to see you in the office.</div><div id="00:55:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I said, oh, no, what have I done?</div><div id="00:55:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Automatically thinking I&#039;ve done something wrong.</div><div id="00:55:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And the guy who owned the company, Mullatec, his son was there.</div><div id="00:55:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He looked after the Welsh end of it and the European end of it.</div><div id="00:55:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, and he shook my hand, he said, absolutely amazing.</div><div id="00:55:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you did a fantastic job.</div><div id="00:56:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, they were so impressed with you.</div><div id="00:56:04.000" class="transcript_line"> They really liked what you did and the way you did it.</div><div id="00:56:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, the way you were explaining everything, that&#039;s more,</div><div id="00:56:12.000" class="transcript_line"> they understood more of that than what you were making jokes.</div><div id="00:56:16.000" class="transcript_line"> He said the humor side of it, but he said the explanation of it all,</div><div id="00:56:21.000" class="transcript_line"> the way you described it all, he said they were more pleased about that.</div><div id="00:56:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So brilliant, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:56:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when they offered me to become a trainer.</div><div id="00:56:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic.</div><div id="00:56:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And I become a trainer.</div><div id="00:56:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we had another contingency from France who came to have a look</div><div id="00:56:38.000" class="transcript_line"> what we were doing and all that.</div><div id="00:56:40.000" class="transcript_line"> So again, they picked me to show them how I did everything and all that.</div><div id="00:56:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And because I&#039;d been doing this for quite a while now,</div><div id="00:56:49.000" class="transcript_line"> we were there in the office and I just said to them, I said, look,</div><div id="00:56:54.000" class="transcript_line"> if you want any help, I said, just give us a ring and I&#039;ll guide you through.</div><div id="00:56:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:57:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So a couple of weeks down the road, a couple of months down the road,</div><div id="00:57:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I was called into the office.</div><div id="00:57:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, you know the people we had here from France, they need some help.</div><div id="00:57:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Will you help them?</div><div id="00:57:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah.</div><div id="00:57:12.000" class="transcript_line"> You want me to phone them?</div><div id="00:57:13.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, he said, we want you to go out to France.</div><div id="00:57:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what?</div><div id="00:57:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he said, we want you to go out there and train them.</div><div id="00:57:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:57:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, the only thing is I haven&#039;t got a passport.</div><div id="00:57:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Nobody said we&#039;ll get it for you and they applied for it.</div><div id="00:57:29.000" class="transcript_line"> They made every sorted flight, the lot.</div><div id="00:57:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I got to France and well, yeah, they asked me to go to France.</div><div id="00:57:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah, okay.</div><div id="00:57:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, when I get to France, I find out the warehouses were half a mile down the road</div><div id="00:57:45.000" class="transcript_line"> and they said, yeah, we&#039;ll take you down everything.</div><div id="00:57:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They picked me up from the airport and all this, like, you know,</div><div id="00:57:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and quite away from Paris Airport, like Charles de Gaulle, it was called.</div><div id="00:57:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, when we got to the warehouse, there was nothing in there, nothing at all.</div><div id="00:58:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Not one shelf, just a wooden warehouse, all wooden.</div><div id="00:58:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, I can&#039;t train anybody in this.</div><div id="00:58:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, you&#039;ve got nothing here.</div><div id="00:58:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, no, no, we don&#039;t want you to train anybody.</div><div id="00:58:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That comes after.</div><div id="00:58:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what do you mean?</div><div id="00:58:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I&#039;ve been told I&#039;ve got to train nine people.</div><div id="00:58:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, he said it&#039;ll be quite a lot of people you&#039;ll be training.</div><div id="00:58:28.000" class="transcript_line"> But we want you to set this up like you got in Wales.</div><div id="00:58:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, what? You serious? Yeah, we want you to set it up.</div><div id="00:58:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Because what was happening, the Toyota Yaris was being built in France.</div><div id="00:58:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And they wanted me to build up.</div><div id="00:58:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But they wanted me to do it in a way so they had rocking for Renault, rocking for Nissan,</div><div id="00:58:56.000" class="transcript_line"> rocking for all the companies they were dealing with.</div><div id="00:58:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But my main aim was to set it up like it was in Wales.</div><div id="00:59:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought to myself, oh, my God, I&#039;ve never done anything like this.</div><div id="00:59:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I phoned Germany and I said, listen, I thought you said I was training nine people.</div><div id="00:59:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said, you realize there&#039;s nothing here.</div><div id="00:59:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, of course, we thought we told you.</div><div id="00:59:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, you didn&#039;t tell me.</div><div id="00:59:20.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, we want you to set it all up.</div><div id="00:59:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, I don&#039;t mind.</div><div id="00:59:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s going to be a challenge because I&#039;ve never done anything like this.</div><div id="00:59:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you can do it.</div><div id="00:59:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, I&#039;m going to have a go.</div><div id="00:59:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said, I need somebody then who&#039;s going to be interpreting and everything.</div><div id="00:59:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I need things, who do I order it with?</div><div id="00:59:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, the manager.</div><div id="00:59:44.000" class="transcript_line"> You just tell him what you want and we&#039;ll give him the budget to do it.</div><div id="00:59:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, all right, OK.</div><div id="00:59:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, right, OK, now I know what I&#039;m doing.</div><div id="00:59:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, now I know what I&#039;ve got to do.</div><div id="00:59:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll have to sit down, go through my mind, what we need, what we&#039;ve got to do and all that.</div><div id="01:00:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, the Six Sigma, I also did through a Japanese company called the Kanban System.</div><div id="01:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And it basically you got to make the parts and tell them when you want it, when you need it and all that.</div><div id="01:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was stumped.</div><div id="01:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, how am I going to do?</div><div id="01:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, you&#039;ve got a warehouse half a mile away, factory there.</div><div id="01:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you correspond?</div><div id="01:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t keep going on the phone all the time.</div><div id="01:00:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I said, right, we&#039;ll do that.</div><div id="01:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, can I have today off?</div><div id="01:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I need to find a hotel.</div><div id="01:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, we&#039;ve done it all.</div><div id="01:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, your hotel is booked everything.</div><div id="01:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So, all right, OK.</div><div id="01:00:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So they took me to my hotel.</div><div id="01:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> First, I went around meeting everybody.</div><div id="01:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I met the manager.</div><div id="01:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I met the assistant manager.</div><div id="01:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I met all these different people in different offices.</div><div id="01:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they took me to the factory.</div><div id="01:00:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a little pedestal there where you stand on the pedestal.</div><div id="01:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Say hello.</div><div id="01:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> How are you?</div><div id="01:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So, brilliant.</div><div id="01:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I thought to myself, you know, this is and he said the interpreter, they give me, you know, Lionel in Britain, you know, he&#039;s my interpreter.</div><div id="01:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Six languages, they could speak.</div><div id="01:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic guy.</div><div id="01:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Really nice guy.</div><div id="01:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So he explained to me, he said, you know, when you come to work now, he said, you go to the manager&#039;s office, you say hello to him.</div><div id="01:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you go along, say hello to everybody.</div><div id="01:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you go into the factory and say hello to everybody there.</div><div id="01:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="01:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="01:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yeah.</div><div id="01:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, come and meet this young lady.</div><div id="01:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> This is our secretary.</div><div id="01:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> You need anything done.</div><div id="01:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s the lady for you.</div><div id="01:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;ll be with you.</div><div id="01:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So anything you need to do it.</div><div id="01:01:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I will do it.</div><div id="01:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, all right.</div><div id="01:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, look, I&#039;m a bit tired now.</div><div id="01:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had a bit of a shock to what I got to do.</div><div id="01:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;ll have the night off now.</div><div id="01:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Relax, enjoy.</div><div id="01:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;ll start in the morning.</div><div id="01:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, can you pick me up?</div><div id="01:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, we&#039;ll send the car for you.</div><div id="01:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="01:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So the following day, I just went through the motion.</div><div id="01:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="01:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine.</div><div id="01:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told him, I&#039;m going to send the car for you.</div><div id="01:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="01:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So the following day, I just went through the motion.</div><div id="01:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="01:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine.</div><div id="01:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told him, I&#039;m going to send the car for you.</div><div id="01:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="01:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="01:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And I told him, I said, well, look, we&#039;re going to need racking.</div><div id="01:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to need to mark out how we&#039;re going to do everything.</div><div id="01:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, blah, blah, blah.</div><div id="01:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Then it all great.</div><div id="01:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Mark out the floor first.</div><div id="01:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I said, we&#039;ll get the racking up, but we don&#039;t want to bolt it.</div><div id="01:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Because what I want to do is try it out.</div><div id="01:02:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And if it doesn&#039;t work, we can move the racking so it&#039;s not bolted.</div><div id="01:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ll be able to do it.</div><div id="01:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I need a forklift driver.</div><div id="01:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="01:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Down comes this lady.</div><div id="01:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I need three.</div><div id="01:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Down comes another lady and another one.</div><div id="01:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, oh, you got all lady driver.</div><div id="01:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, all production is done by men.</div><div id="01:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> All driving on forklifts is women.</div><div id="01:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="01:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, can you tell me why?</div><div id="01:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, the women are more careful.</div><div id="01:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="01:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I told him, look, I want this moved.</div><div id="01:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re moved anywhere.</div><div id="01:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="01:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And you know what I liked about the French was, when I left them a list at the end of</div><div id="01:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> the week to say, look, I want this done by the time I come back, I had no hassles at</div><div id="01:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> all.</div><div id="01:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all done.</div><div id="01:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all done.</div><div id="01:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, you now would phone me up and say, oh, look, can I do this?</div><div id="01:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Can I do that?</div><div id="01:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were doing a lot more.</div><div id="01:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I did that in Wales, I had hell of a time.</div><div id="01:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="01:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Just wouldn&#039;t listen.</div><div id="01:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> How many years did you do that job?</div><div id="01:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Nine years?</div><div id="01:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, nine years.</div><div id="01:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, nine years.</div><div id="01:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed it.</div><div id="01:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I did really enjoyed it.</div><div id="01:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And what I enjoyed most was thinking on my feet.</div><div id="01:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the problems I mentioned was the distance between the factory and the, and</div><div id="01:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> do you know how I solved that?</div><div id="01:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I happened to be sitting in the hospital.</div><div id="01:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you&#039;re in a waiting room, what do you notice most?</div><div id="01:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Trullies.</div><div id="01:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> No?</div><div id="01:04:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a light going round telling you waiting time is four hours continuous.</div><div id="01:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Right?</div><div id="01:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it goes red and it tells you a different time.</div><div id="01:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Then it goes green and green.</div><div id="01:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So automatically it&#039;s going green, red, green, red, green, red.</div><div id="01:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And sometimes you notice the amber on the side.</div><div id="01:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, that&#039;s what I want.</div><div id="01:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Traffic light system for the parts.</div><div id="01:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I went back to France, I said to the guy, I said, let&#039;s go in the workshop.</div><div id="01:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So I noticed, looked around everywhere and say now, for instance, that&#039;s the manager&#039;s</div><div id="01:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> office.</div><div id="01:05:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And this is a big wall up here above the machine.</div><div id="01:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Opposite the manager&#039;s office, yeah?</div><div id="01:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Right?</div><div id="01:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Opposite the, I said, that&#039;s what I want.</div><div id="01:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So I phoned him up.</div><div id="01:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I want the manager.</div><div id="01:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, not the workshop manager, the main manager.</div><div id="01:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, I want a 65 inch TV, please.</div><div id="01:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I want somebody who&#039;s good with the internet.</div><div id="01:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So we went to the warehouse.</div><div id="01:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> We put the TV up on this side, connected to the internet.</div><div id="01:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to the warehouse then and I said to him, I said, right, what I want you to do</div><div id="01:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> is send a message to that TV screen, right, with a big red dot.</div><div id="01:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="01:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So he did it.</div><div id="01:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And he picked up the phone.</div><div id="01:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I just seen this message.</div><div id="01:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> What are you going to talk for?</div><div id="01:05:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you see the message?</div><div id="01:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it clear?</div><div id="01:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s great.</div><div id="01:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So I designed a system that when we need a part, right, it&#039;ll show red.</div><div id="01:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> The part number next to it will be the tool number, right, and the quantity of parts.</div><div id="01:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;ll go along, right?</div><div id="01:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So every time we needed parts, which was red, if they got the parts ready, he&#039;ll put it</div><div id="01:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> on number and when it gets to the warehouse and it&#039;s in stock there, it&#039;ll go to green.</div><div id="01:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So everybody had a job to do and they didn&#039;t have to phone each other.</div><div id="01:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all done internally on the internet.</div><div id="01:06:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, we&#039;re going to try this now.</div><div id="01:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I said to him, I said, what parts are we going to need urgently?</div><div id="01:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And he mentioned some parts.</div><div id="01:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, right, give me the number and that.</div><div id="01:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So I told him what to do and he put it all on there.</div><div id="01:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came up on the screen and the manager seen it and he said, that&#039;s what I said.</div><div id="01:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can see it.</div><div id="01:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s telling you what we need.</div><div id="01:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I said, don&#039;t forget now when you&#039;re actually doing the parts and you&#039;ve got the amber,</div><div id="01:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ve got to calculate how long it&#039;s going to take you to get it to the warehouse.</div><div id="01:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t want to leave it too long.</div><div id="01:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, I loved it.</div><div id="01:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I did.</div><div id="01:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But then when I came back, there was a young boy who would just come out with a little</div><div id="01:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> boy who would just come out to university and he become my manager.</div><div id="01:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Apparently, while I was away, there was a bit of a dispute or something.</div><div id="01:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And the guy who was the manager, they demoted him to some other department.</div><div id="01:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And this boy took over and he was all knew it all and all that.</div><div id="01:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first job he said to me, he said, oh, I got a thing by for you.</div><div id="01:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, look what I did right by.</div><div id="01:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s that?</div><div id="01:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, oh, the Nissan still edges.</div><div id="01:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve devised this now to put all the still edges there.</div><div id="01:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, you know, look, I said, yeah, great.</div><div id="01:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to look at it.</div><div id="01:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as I looked at it, I went, it&#039;s not going to work.</div><div id="01:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you mean it&#039;s not going to work?</div><div id="01:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, it&#039;s not going to work.</div><div id="01:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re going to be at least 12 still edges out.</div><div id="01:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t.</div><div id="01:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He said, I measured them all.</div><div id="01:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, yes, I can see you measured them, but you&#039;ve forgotten the cups.</div><div id="01:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Got a cup on top.</div><div id="01:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So the leg would fit into the cup and he wouldn&#039;t slip.</div><div id="01:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he had measured them.</div><div id="01:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That was half an inch out.</div><div id="01:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So because I showed him up a bit, he didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="01:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, I didn&#039;t try to show him up.</div><div id="01:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I just told him because it was only me and him and he didn&#039;t like it.</div><div id="01:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And he made things hard for me.</div><div id="01:08:35.000" class="transcript_line"> In the end, I just thought I got to get out of there.</div><div id="01:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t stick it.</div><div id="01:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But I love my job in Asda.</div><div id="01:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I absolutely love it.</div><div id="01:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s absolutely.</div><div id="01:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If my health wasn&#039;t bad, honest to God, I would stay there as long as I can.</div><div id="01:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The customers are just amazing people.</div><div id="01:08:58.000"

she&#039;ll tell you straight.</div><div id="01:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, you can&#039;t do it.</div><div id="01:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I love my job.</div><div id="01:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> But the customers are Asda&#039;s customers.</div><div id="01:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re all my friends.</div><div id="01:09:20.000"

class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="01:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But I can&#039;t imagine that you will just be

class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I definitely will be.</div><div id="01:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> If I retire, right, I won&#039;t say if, I&#039;ll say when, because I intend to retire, I will</div><div id="01:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> probably do a little bit more radio work and I&#039;ll do school work because a lot of schools</div><div id="01:11:17.000" class="transcript_line"> hire us and we take our trailer to the schools for the music and the discos and things like</div><div id="01:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> that.</div><div id="01:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s from the because of the radio.</div><div id="01:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> For the radio, right?</div><div id="01:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we do occasions like the Christmas fair, when the radio gets involved with that.</div><div id="01:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> We do the Christmas markets, the one the radio gets involved with that.</div><div id="01:11:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So, I will have something to do all the time, you know?</div><div id="01:11:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And me being mouthy, they normally throw me in the front end anyway.</div><div id="01:11:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I&#039;ll probably be doing a lot more.</div><div id="01:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Like at the moment I&#039;m doing Monday, Tuesday and Saturday shows.</div><div id="01:12:01.000" class="transcript_line"> If it comes to the crunch that somebody&#039;s on holiday, I&#039;ll cover their show for them.</div><div id="01:12:07.000" class="transcript_line"> When I&#039;m on holiday, they&#039;ll cover my show, you know?</div><div id="01:12:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So, with a bit of luck.</div><div id="01:12:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="01:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, sounds really good.</div><div id="01:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I enjoy it.</div><div id="01:12:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I

class="transcript_line"> Honestly, you want to see the Asians who moved in here?</div><div id="01:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="01:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I am hoping to start an hour long program with just Bollywood songs.</div><div id="01:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, gosh.</div><div id="01:12:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Hour long, just Bollywood songs.</div><div id="01:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m going to pitch that to the manager.</div><div id="01:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact, they wanted me to do that about two years ago.</div><div id="01:12:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But because there wasn&#039;t a lot to ask.</div><div id="01:12:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what?</div><div id="01:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> My best, my favorite listener for Bollywood songs is a German lady called Sabine Kommerl.</div><div id="01:13:02.000" class="transcript_line"> All the way from Baden-Baden.</div><div id="01:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="01:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Every Saturday she&#039;ll text me first thing in the morning,</div><div id="01:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Nash, don&#039;t forget my Bollywood song.</div><div id="01:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="01:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> How are you today?</div><div id="01:13:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Brilliant.</div><div id="01:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it.</div><div id="01:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a physiotherapist, she is.</div><div id="01:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I met her in India five years ago.</div><div id="01:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="01:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And we kept in touch.</div><div id="01:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="01:13:25.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s brilliant.</div><div id="01:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much for that fantastic
