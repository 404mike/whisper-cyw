    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, Margaret, would you mind stating your full name and if you like date of birth?</div><div id="00:00:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Please for records.</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> My full name?</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Margaret McBreaty.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And I could say where and when were you born?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in London.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> In? We all know when. 1933?</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Correct.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know that.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know that because you just had a birthday.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Only a month ago, so.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. When did you first meet Paul Sartore?</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, when he arrived in the parish.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> You became aware that Father Coffey was quite elderly and he had Father Sartore as a curate.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Total different characters and type of person Father Coffey.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Gentle, very gentle man Father Coffey was.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But getting on in years and quite traditional.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Father Sartore was totally different.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Full of fizz and things.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Charisma on the legs he was.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic man from that point of view.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It took years before I stopped going into town and expected him to come whizzing round the corner.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> He was such a personality.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And such a sort of person that had an effect on those who were totally not Catholic, even in some ways opposed to it.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> When we started doing door to door collections, I more than once had people say, oh, well, I don&#039;t really hold with the Catholics, but Father Sartore is a lovely man and they put money in the box.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> He had that effect on people.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So your earliest memory would have been just going to Mass as a parishioner and coming across him and then presumably you might have gotten to know him personally, but you&#039;ve got to understand his character from his sermons and the way he walked.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What was he like as a priest?</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> What was he like at Mass sermon wise?</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very good because, sorry, I&#039;m getting a cough.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> He had this sort of warmth and strong belief that came across very well.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all the priests have the belief, they must have, but they wouldn&#039;t be doing the job.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But some of them are able to project this much more than others.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Rather than read a prepared sermon from a book, which we have sometimes.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Spontaneous.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> What else can I ask you now?</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So, how would you describe him?</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> As you say, fizzing, full of energy.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, full of energy.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Run rather than walk.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> This is fizzing with life.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And did he have any impact on you personally or just, would you say, particularly?</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Or I don&#039;t really know.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, he did in a way because, sorry about this, when I first came across him,</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t married, my husband to be lived down here.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I used to come on, you can&#039;t do your courting over the telephone.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I used to, they call my holidays in long weekends.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And because my husband had been married before, we had to, father put towards the door,</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> he did come out and have a cup of tea with us and talk about it,</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> about the possibilities of whether we could.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, yes, it should be all right, but you have to go through the process.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was good with his advice.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Good, good, and it worked.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> What else are we going to say?</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So more or less this is a little bit repetitive now, just trying to sum him up.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Trying to sum him up in a few words again.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a little bit repetitive now.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, I can suggest no.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So any stories, anything?</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Carisperon legs.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good one, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I never heard of anybody not liking him.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s lovely.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Some had stronger feelings than others, but you know, as I say,</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> either within the church or outside.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Amazing man he was.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And such a contrast to Father Coffee, who was more traditional.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Did they get on?</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Did Father Coffee and Father Paul get on?</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What were they like as a?</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They learnt to live together.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well put.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, they did.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I think they had respect for one another, but obviously totally different sort of personalities.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think it was Father Paul must have said some one day that we get by, we get along.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;re sharing the house, you&#039;ve got to.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got to, yes.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then of course, you know, when Father Coffee got ill,</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> then they made him a cannon, but they made Father Paul the parish priest</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because of the work of the others.</div><div id="00:06:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And Father Coffee survived Father Paul, did he?</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Not very long.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, no.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> He, Father Coffee had gone back to Ireland because he was ill.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And he came, he made great effort, and he came to Father Paul&#039;s funeral.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And while he was here, he got taken ill, taken into hospital.</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And as far as I remember, I don&#039;t think he ever came out.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a matter of weeks after Father Paul.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was the impact on the parish when they both died?</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, everybody was stunned, shocked, and waiting to find out what was going to happen.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Because Father Paul had been ill for some time.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that it was the last time I saw him, and he&#039;s actually in the parish.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And he said, and he had his big armchair by the altar, and he was sitting down most of the time.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He threw up the concentration, and that was about it.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But you knew by then that he wasn&#039;t?</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes, yes.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, everybody knew by then.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Not sure everybody, not sure I knew exactly how serious it was, but he was obviously very ill.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you know anything of his wishing to set up a hospice?</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> As far as I know, there was nothing to do at the time, but there was a group of people who had already started to discuss,</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> or he had started discussing with them about some form of hospice in this area.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was told that at one point he said, well, you&#039;d better hurry up, because I&#039;m going to be your first patient.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when he knew how ill he was.</div><div id="00:08:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And then after he died, it gave more incentive to the original committee to start setting things up, start fundraising and so on.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s really when I got involved, the beginning of the fundraising.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So in what way?</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Well...</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> House to house?</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I got taken on to the committee by you-know-who.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, shh, yes.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so we had a fundraising committee, and we started off taking our blue boxes around all the houses.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And some people would give you the odd pennies out of their pocket, and other people were very generous.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I said, some of them, they&#039;re old with the Catholics, but...</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> His reputation went before him.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> His personality had affected the whole area that they gave.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just went on collecting money in various ways, then the outside test goes rattling about.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I did a little of that, but not much.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> In latter years, I was just saying, going round the houses.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t like it as a way of doing it.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And they set up the shop, they had the shop then, and the green.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it snowballed.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, gradually, as the whole idea of Pembrokeshire Hospice, if you like, as that began to grow in the community, and the money began to come in.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So they could expand then, so you could have the shop, you could start having annual ball.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> All these things gradually grew out of all that, until you finish up with this.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> What we have today.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> About 40 years or something.</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s excellent.</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s covered it all, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And got extra.</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div></div></p>
