    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember the change after the armchairs,</div><div id="00:00:05.160" class="transcript_line"> when mealtimes began to be much more somber,</div><div id="00:00:08.200" class="transcript_line"> because to begin with they tried not to discuss what was going on in front of the children, as you do.</div><div id="00:00:13.920" class="transcript_line"> But as time went on it got so bad that I remember the laughing and the jokes stopping,</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and the discussions were all about playmates and visas and people who&#039;d been able to get out and those who haven&#039;t.</div><div id="00:00:27.040" class="transcript_line"> And of course things changed dramatically at school because</div><div id="00:00:31.440" class="transcript_line"> after the armchairs</div><div id="00:00:33.720" class="transcript_line"> suddenly those of us in the class who were Jewish were kept separate from the others.</div><div id="00:00:37.840" class="transcript_line"> You sit over there, you&#039;re Jewish, nobody has to talk to you.</div><div id="00:00:42.280" class="transcript_line"> And I remember many of the girls joining the BDM, the Bundlerge MÃ¤dchen, which was like the Hitler Youth for girls.</div><div id="00:00:49.680" class="transcript_line"> And I remember what they wore,</div><div id="00:00:52.040" class="transcript_line"> including the three-quarter length white socks. And I have to say to this day,</div><div id="00:00:57.760" class="transcript_line"> I have a dislike for three-quarter length white socks,</div><div id="00:01:01.160" class="transcript_line"> although I&#039;m not neurotic about it and my children wore them, same as everybody else, but I don&#039;t feel comfortable about them.</div><div id="00:01:07.920" class="transcript_line"> And I have a very very strong memory of that time, which I</div><div id="00:01:12.080" class="transcript_line"> always relate to people because it made a big, it had a big influence on me. I remember the teacher telling the children</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> that we have a new regime now,</div><div id="00:01:21.200" class="transcript_line"> and</div><div id="00:01:22.400" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;ll have noticed that things are different.</div><div id="00:01:24.840" class="transcript_line"> And I want you to promise me that you will come and tell me if you hear your parents or any of their friends</div><div id="00:01:31.200" class="transcript_line"> or your brothers and sisters saying anything nasty about this new regime that we have, you have to come and report to me.</div><div id="00:01:39.080" class="transcript_line"> So what she was doing, she was encouraging the children to tell on their parents, as we say.</div><div id="00:01:45.200" class="transcript_line"> And I found at age 10 that that was intolerable.</div><div id="00:01:49.440" class="transcript_line"> I was age 67, I still find it intolerable. And when I was training teachers, every year group that I</div><div id="00:01:58.480" class="transcript_line"> worked with, I invariably told them you must do what you think is right.</div><div id="00:02:04.040" class="transcript_line"> You must work out what you think is right and stick with that, not just what they are telling you.</div></div></p>
