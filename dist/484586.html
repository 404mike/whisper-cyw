Interviewer Steve Fletcher.</div><div id="00:00:08.400" class="transcript_line"> Interviewee Mike Chubb.</div><div id="00:00:10.880" class="transcript_line"> The venue is the Swicker office.</div><div id="00:00:13.320" class="transcript_line"> And the date today is Tuesday the 2nd of December 2015.</div><div id="00:00:18.520" class="transcript_line"> Mike, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full</div><div id="00:00:21.920" class="transcript_line"> for the record, please?</div><div id="00:00:23.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Chubb, C-H-U-B-B.</div><div id="00:00:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:00:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Mike, what are your earliest recollections of the Cardiff</div><div id="00:00:34.600" class="transcript_line"> mass carnival as it was known then?</div><div id="00:00:39.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I remember going right back to when we talked about</div><div id="00:00:42.280" class="transcript_line"> funding at the time when it was quite difficult to actually</div><div id="00:00:46.400" class="transcript_line"> get screw money out of people.</div><div id="00:00:50.440" class="transcript_line"> And we did, we managed it.</div><div id="00:00:52.200" class="transcript_line"> And I think from memory serves, you</div><div id="00:00:54.800" class="transcript_line"> managed to get a grant from the arts committee.</div><div id="00:00:58.400" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember that?</div><div id="00:00:59.200" class="transcript_line"> From Cardiff County Council and indeed...</div><div id="00:01:00.920" class="transcript_line"> No, City Council.</div><div id="00:01:01.680" class="transcript_line"> City Council, sorry.</div><div id="00:01:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And Supporting Kind, the first venue for the carnival camp</div><div id="00:01:09.880" class="transcript_line"> was somewhat far away from its key participants, who were</div><div id="00:01:13.440" class="transcript_line"> largely based in Butown, was Insull Court.</div><div id="00:01:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:01:17.520" class="transcript_line"> A very beautiful venue in Clandaff, in the north of the city.</div><div id="00:01:21.480" class="transcript_line"> Run by two dancers.</div><div id="00:01:22.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, absolutely.</div><div id="00:01:23.640" class="transcript_line"> And the Rottweiler, as I recall.</div><div id="00:01:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so obviously it was important that we were in touch</div><div id="00:01:32.360" class="transcript_line"> with the project as much as we could.</div><div id="00:01:33.840" class="transcript_line"> But at the time, we were really quite busy putting together</div><div id="00:01:37.160" class="transcript_line"> what effectively is one of the first Cardiff festivals, or</div><div id="00:01:39.440" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff summer festivals.</div><div id="00:01:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Can you just clarify, what was your role?</div><div id="00:01:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Who were you working for at this point in your life?</div><div id="00:01:45.400" class="transcript_line"> Well, at the time I started, well, the summer festival was</div><div id="00:01:50.200" class="transcript_line"> called the Shopping Festival.</div><div id="00:01:53.040" class="transcript_line"> And it was run by a marketeer at Leisure and Amenities.</div><div id="00:02:00.360" class="transcript_line"> And I was a play officer, running the</div><div id="00:02:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Adventure Playgrounds.</div><div id="00:02:09.880" class="transcript_line"> I was really disillusioned with what she did, but I</div><div id="00:02:11.960" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t do anything.</div><div id="00:02:12.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s her bag.</div><div id="00:02:15.200" class="transcript_line"> But then she left, and I somehow...</div><div id="00:02:18.680" class="transcript_line"> Theatres, I mean, I&#039;ve been brought up as an actor, and</div><div id="00:02:24.360" class="transcript_line"> also a drama, and I&#039;m not qualified to teach and all</div><div id="00:02:30.600" class="transcript_line"> that.</div><div id="00:02:31.160" class="transcript_line"> But I always felt that the city needed something that was</div><div id="00:02:35.720" class="transcript_line"> exciting.</div><div id="00:02:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And what, she was a lovely girl, don&#039;t get me wrong, but</div><div id="00:02:41.040" class="transcript_line"> she used to bring in lots of plenty of</div><div id="00:02:42.880" class="transcript_line"> cheek, cheerful clowns.</div><div id="00:02:45.040" class="transcript_line"> And if you&#039;d seen one balloon modeler, you&#039;d seen 50 balloon</div><div id="00:02:48.200" class="transcript_line"> modelers.</div><div id="00:02:50.080" class="transcript_line"> And I knew there was something different out there.</div><div id="00:02:52.160" class="transcript_line"> I knew there was, but I didn&#039;t have a clue where.</div><div id="00:02:54.760" class="transcript_line"> So I managed to get Leisure and Amenities, who were quite</div><div id="00:02:58.920" class="transcript_line"> supportive, unless I overspent, which I did most of</div><div id="00:03:02.080" class="transcript_line"> the time.</div><div id="00:03:03.520" class="transcript_line"> They let me go down to London, and I went to Covent Garden.</div><div id="00:03:06.480" class="transcript_line"> And their Dick tea was putting on the Covent Garden Street</div><div id="00:03:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Festival.</div><div id="00:03:12.680" class="transcript_line"> So I met Dick, and I saw really amazing street artists</div><div id="00:03:16.760" class="transcript_line"> that have never seen it before.</div><div id="00:03:19.480" class="transcript_line"> I was absolutely stunned.</div><div id="00:03:20.480" class="transcript_line"> Was Eddie Izzard one of them?</div><div id="00:03:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Because he was performing, and that&#039;s where he began.</div><div id="00:03:23.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know.</div><div id="00:03:25.760" class="transcript_line"> It was just like, whoa, small town boy, come to London, see</div><div id="00:03:29.200" class="transcript_line"> all this stuff.</div><div id="00:03:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I met up with an artist called Les Bubb in a pub.</div><div id="00:03:35.840" class="transcript_line"> And he put me in touch with his agent.</div><div id="00:03:40.680" class="transcript_line"> And he put me in touch with the guy who was responsible</div><div id="00:03:43.720" class="transcript_line"> marketing Orangina.</div><div id="00:03:46.480" class="transcript_line"> And to cut a long story short, I bragged 5,000 pounds from</div><div id="00:03:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Orangina the first year, and it was 10,000 the second year.</div><div id="00:03:56.080" class="transcript_line"> But that allowed me then to actually really consider what</div><div id="00:03:59.040" class="transcript_line"> do we want to do on the street.</div><div id="00:04:00.480" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where the summer festival started from.</div><div id="00:04:03.720" class="transcript_line"> It was a street festival.</div><div id="00:04:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Everything else came afterwards.</div><div id="00:04:08.640" class="transcript_line"> But I found more and more of my time was being spent</div><div id="00:04:13.480" class="transcript_line"> organizing this street festival.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So much so that the department getting a bit pissed off with</div><div id="00:04:20.160" class="transcript_line"> me about spending so much time and not doing a proper job.</div><div id="00:04:22.880" class="transcript_line"> By then, I was also head of community.</div><div id="00:04:25.440" class="transcript_line"> So I was running all the community halls, and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:27.400" class="transcript_line"> where Rob Corp comes in, who we&#039;ll discuss later.</div><div id="00:04:31.280" class="transcript_line"> Maybe, if I&#039;m allowed to.</div><div id="00:04:33.840" class="transcript_line"> And it got to the point when it was getting quite successful</div><div id="00:04:38.840" class="transcript_line"> after the first or second year.</div><div id="00:04:41.680" class="transcript_line"> I was getting more money in.</div><div id="00:04:44.600" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t ever spending that much.</div><div id="00:04:46.680" class="transcript_line"> And in the end, they gave me the job.</div><div id="00:04:48.400" class="transcript_line"> At that time, there were no interviews.</div><div id="00:04:51.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, go on.</div><div id="00:04:51.960" class="transcript_line"> You see what you can do with it.</div><div id="00:04:53.400" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how it all started.</div><div id="00:04:55.400" class="transcript_line"> Would your job title be what?</div><div id="00:04:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Some festival coordinator, festival director?</div><div id="00:04:58.200" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it.</div><div id="00:04:59.280" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what the title was.</div><div id="00:05:01.320" class="transcript_line"> You just did it.</div><div id="00:05:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ll call myself festival director, perhaps.</div><div id="00:05:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Much of the chagrin of Mike Turle.</div><div id="00:05:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Because Mike Turle used to run the Cardiff Festival, but that</div><div id="00:05:11.320" class="transcript_line"> was in September.</div><div id="00:05:12.280" class="transcript_line"> And he was absolutely spitting bricks.</div><div id="00:05:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Because the more successful it became, the more the city was</div><div id="00:05:18.920" class="transcript_line"> taken over by amazing things.</div><div id="00:05:21.480" class="transcript_line"> He wanted it then to be moved into September.</div><div id="00:05:23.920" class="transcript_line"> And I said, no, Mike, no.</div><div id="00:05:25.040" class="transcript_line"> It won&#039;t suit September.</div><div id="00:05:26.960" class="transcript_line"> Yours is an indoor thing.</div><div id="00:05:29.400" class="transcript_line"> Mine is outside.</div><div id="00:05:30.400" class="transcript_line"> The two don&#039;t go together.</div><div id="00:05:32.640" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, it got to the point when he tried to run me over</div><div id="00:05:35.400" class="transcript_line"> in the car park, the city hall.</div><div id="00:05:37.680" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s true, because Jane Davidson, who was on the arts</div><div id="00:05:41.440" class="transcript_line"> committee at the time, was there and saw it happen.</div><div id="00:05:43.800" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, nevertheless, he didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:05:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And going back to the question about Massie.</div><div id="00:05:48.880" class="transcript_line"> His lawyers will be in touch.</div><div id="00:05:50.320" class="transcript_line"> His lawyers?</div><div id="00:05:50.800" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s dead.</div><div id="00:05:52.640" class="transcript_line"> He can&#039;t prove anything.</div><div id="00:05:54.160" class="transcript_line"> But I remember, so does Jane.</div><div id="00:05:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, Massie impressed me, A, because of the community</div><div id="00:06:02.720" class="transcript_line"> context in which it took place, and B, because you seem to be</div><div id="00:06:05.680" class="transcript_line"> quite a nice guy.</div><div id="00:06:07.600" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m just saying that for the sake of this recording.</div><div id="00:06:11.840" class="transcript_line"> But it ticked all the buttons on the boxes.</div><div id="00:06:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it wasn&#039;t so much the art form.</div><div id="00:06:19.320" class="transcript_line"> It was where it was positioned in the whole calendar.</div><div id="00:06:22.760" class="transcript_line"> And it was about involvement.</div><div id="00:06:25.160" class="transcript_line"> It was about multiculturalism.</div><div id="00:06:26.800" class="transcript_line"> It was about open space.</div><div id="00:06:28.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I used to say about the festival</div><div id="00:06:30.360" class="transcript_line"> that you had to make a detour to avoid it.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That was all free as well, which is most unusual these days.</div><div id="00:06:38.920" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s only one festival I know of in the UK</div><div id="00:06:43.880" class="transcript_line"> that is the same, and that&#039;s Stockton on Tees,</div><div id="00:06:46.840" class="transcript_line"> the Riverside Festival run by Frank Wilson.</div><div id="00:06:49.840" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s been doing it.</div><div id="00:06:51.600" class="transcript_line"> He started it here at the same time</div><div id="00:06:53.160" class="transcript_line"> as I started the Cardiff Summer Festival.</div><div id="00:06:55.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s been going for a long, long time.</div><div id="00:06:57.400" class="transcript_line"> And his understanding of international arts</div><div id="00:06:59.240" class="transcript_line"> is second to none.</div><div id="00:07:00.240" class="transcript_line"> I mean, he just takes so many risks.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s unbelievable.</div><div id="00:07:03.800" class="transcript_line"> This is interesting.</div><div id="00:07:04.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about, can a city cope with having it in your face?</div><div id="00:07:10.080" class="transcript_line"> And I know right at the beginning,</div><div id="00:07:12.160" class="transcript_line"> people in the audience felt so subjected to art in their face</div><div id="00:07:18.400" class="transcript_line"> that one of my artists got hit.</div><div id="00:07:20.160" class="transcript_line"> They couldn&#039;t cope with it.</div><div id="00:07:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Frank knew up in Stockton, because he had no arts at all</div><div id="00:07:26.840" class="transcript_line"> up there until the Dove Cup was started,</div><div id="00:07:29.320" class="transcript_line"> he knew that he could only cope with two days.</div><div id="00:07:32.120" class="transcript_line"> Stockton could only cope with two days, a Saturday and Sunday.</div><div id="00:07:34.920" class="transcript_line"> Any more than that, the natives go wild.</div><div id="00:07:38.600" class="transcript_line"> And over the years, he has educated them,</div><div id="00:07:42.280" class="transcript_line"> so it&#039;s now a week.</div><div id="00:07:44.600" class="transcript_line"> And of course, in Cardiff, we educated people</div><div id="00:07:46.960" class="transcript_line"> to want more and more challenging stuff.</div><div id="00:07:49.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll talk about this later,</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> but I think we&#039;ve lost all that now.</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;ve lost the challenge.</div><div id="00:07:54.720" class="transcript_line"> I think we&#039;re going for something that is corporate.</div><div id="00:07:58.640" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s been sanitized.</div><div id="00:08:02.360" class="transcript_line"> And I think people are genuinely scared.</div><div id="00:08:05.640" class="transcript_line"> Everything you see is just either in a building</div><div id="00:08:09.080" class="transcript_line"> where it&#039;s safe, but nothing is challenging anymore.</div><div id="00:08:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Fireworks in an orgy, it&#039;s just a mess.</div><div id="00:08:18.480" class="transcript_line"> Or in an audience, or marching through a crowd.</div><div id="00:08:22.600" class="transcript_line"> Anyway.</div><div id="00:08:24.600" class="transcript_line"> And hence, my support of Mass and the qualities it brought,</div><div id="00:08:32.680" class="transcript_line"> I felt, to the festival, but also to the people who took part.</div><div id="00:08:37.200" class="transcript_line"> They seem to really enjoy it.</div><div id="00:08:39.800" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s good that it&#039;s gone from strength to strength</div><div id="00:08:42.280" class="transcript_line"> over 25 years, but I&#039;m sure it has been absolutely bloody awful</div><div id="00:08:45.200" class="transcript_line"> to try to fund.</div><div id="00:08:46.800" class="transcript_line"> I know that funding is is is horrendous.</div><div id="00:08:50.340" class="transcript_line"> And but when I look through it, I mean, for the sake of the recorder,</div><div id="00:08:54.260" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;ve got lots of I&#039;ve brought all my old stuff.</div><div id="00:08:57.140" class="transcript_line"> You know, you can tell I live in the past.</div><div id="00:08:59.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, all the old programs, every single one.</div><div id="00:09:03.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a memory of and every single artist</div><div id="00:09:06.280" class="transcript_line"> and every single person who volunteered and who helped.</div><div id="00:09:09.520" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m sure you&#039;re saying with mass, you remember,</div><div id="00:09:12.360" class="transcript_line"> you know, all the kids who are now what they&#039;ve got

into a lovely gig space right outside St. David&#039;s Hall?</div><div id="00:20:08.120" class="transcript_line"> So what used to happen is that you used to come out with their</div><div id="00:20:10.160" class="transcript_line"> dickey bows from St. David&#039;s Hall at night to find just</div><div id="00:20:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, let&#039;s face it, a lot of people in anoraks</div><div id="00:20:17.400" class="transcript_line"> and having drinks and stuff like that.</div><div id="00:20:20.580" class="transcript_line"> And of course, you know, I wonder,</div><div id="00:20:23.740" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to ask you a question now.</div><div id="00:20:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that Swicker,</div><div id="00:20:28.880" class="transcript_line"> the artistic policy and the vision behind mass</div><div id="00:20:34.380" class="transcript_line"> did it change slightly over the years?</div><div id="00:20:36.600" class="transcript_line"> With given the the the artist coming in from the festival,</div><div id="00:20:40.740" class="transcript_line"> did it give you spark ideas?</div><div id="00:20:43.480" class="transcript_line"> Ah, I say indirectly, I mean, overall, as you pointed out,</div><div id="00:20:48.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was a good self and your team who</div><div id="00:20:51.760" class="transcript_line"> paved the way literally and opened the streets of Cardiff</div><div id="00:20:54.420" class="transcript_line"> so that carnival could be take its place amongst those street activities.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We used to admire people like Dada Dang,</div><div id="00:21:03.820" class="transcript_line"> who were the Italian costume drummers who came over.</div><div id="00:21:06.920" class="transcript_line"> So I think the right word would be to inspire us.</div><div id="00:21:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Often, you know, here on our doorstep and, as you said,</div><div id="00:21:14.340" class="transcript_line"> nine times out of 10 or even 10 times out of 10, free of charge,</div><div id="00:21:17.800" class="transcript_line"> were some of the the best acts in the UK and indeed from abroad</div><div id="00:21:21.840" class="transcript_line"> were being brought so that not only ourselves,</div><div id="00:21:26.120" class="transcript_line"> and by that I mean the our team of artists and designers and makers</div><div id="00:21:29.480" class="transcript_line"> who really had nothing better to go and look at other people&#039;s work</div><div id="00:21:32.200" class="transcript_line"> and be inspired, but also the the other two groups,</div><div id="00:21:36.600" class="transcript_line"> the our community participants.</div><div id="00:21:38.980" class="transcript_line"> Again, it&#039;s sort of up the ante for them.</div><div id="00:21:40.640" class="transcript_line"> You know, we want to be as good as what we saw in Europe week or whatever.</div><div id="00:21:45.280" class="transcript_line"> And the most important is that the work you did over the years</div><div id="00:21:49.880" class="transcript_line"> educating the audience so that the audience for the very first parade</div><div id="00:21:54.880" class="transcript_line"> so the very first parade 1990, it came down to St.</div><div id="00:21:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Mary Street, which at that point was motorized</div><div id="00:22:01.280" class="transcript_line"> and had a road divide in the middle.</div><div id="00:22:02.780" class="transcript_line"> And it came down one side.</div><div id="00:22:03.980" class="transcript_line"> So for one year only, we had a parade which was not visible</div><div id="00:22:07.960" class="transcript_line"> from the other side of the street because that was a working road, you know.</div><div id="00:22:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But we moved from those positions where, you know, as you built up</div><div id="00:22:16.700" class="transcript_line"> the events, the ASEAN panel, as you built up your track record</div><div id="00:22:19.900" class="transcript_line"> of not merely designing events, but delivering them as you described them,</div><div id="00:22:24.900" class="transcript_line"> then we were able to follow, I think, in the wake of that</div><div id="00:22:28.800" class="transcript_line"> as, you know, I mean, you were the</div><div id="00:22:32.660" class="transcript_line"> pathfinder, the pioneer, the the door opener, particularly in terms of</div><div id="00:22:37.040" class="transcript_line"> getting other departmental officials to even consider</div><div id="00:22:41.400" class="transcript_line"> that these things were worthwhile, because, you know,</div><div id="00:22:44.260" class="transcript_line"> if you&#039;re ahead of drains, you just want to talk drains, you know.</div><div id="00:22:48.160" class="transcript_line"> But I think, you know, you were yes, I think you were</div><div id="00:22:52.340" class="transcript_line"> kind of city council&#039;s captain of fun for a number of years.</div><div id="00:22:55.140" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, no, that was that really helped us in many, many ways.</div><div id="00:22:59.940" class="transcript_line"> For which was suitably grateful.</div><div id="00:23:01.460" class="transcript_line"> I know. Yes, I&#039;m glad you said that.</div><div id="00:23:05.020" class="transcript_line"> Because over the years, I mean, it&#039;s what I left in.</div><div id="00:23:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m still trying to remember when it was 95, 94, 95 to go to Birmingham.</div><div id="00:23:13.400" class="transcript_line"> Dreadful place.</div><div id="00:23:16.740" class="transcript_line"> And their lives will be in touch.</div><div id="00:23:19.400" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t give a.</div><div id="00:23:20.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:22.940" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And it&#039;s been what, 10 years now, 10 years</div><div id="00:23:27.240" class="transcript_line"> since a decade ago.</div><div id="00:23:29.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, since I left 16.</div><div id="00:23:31.240" class="transcript_line"> No, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:33.720" class="transcript_line"> Whatever. No, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:23:35.580" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember now.</div><div id="00:23:38.060" class="transcript_line"> But you see, I&#039;m losing my brain about getting older.</div><div id="00:23:40.560" class="transcript_line"> But and you kind of lose sight of what</div><div id="00:23:44.860" class="transcript_line"> when somebody comes up to you</div><div id="00:23:47.060" class="transcript_line"> and to the other day, I do this community thing called the big picnic</div><div id="00:23:50.840" class="transcript_line"> or did last year anyway.</div><div id="00:23:52.100" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a guy there.</div><div id="00:23:54.240" class="transcript_line"> And I said to him, I said, I know you.</div><div id="00:23:56.580" class="transcript_line"> And he looked at me, said,</div><div id="00:23:58.180" class="transcript_line"> you worked on the first street fest with me being one of the public judges.</div><div id="00:24:03.680" class="transcript_line"> And he looked at me, said,</div><div id="00:24:05.620" class="transcript_line"> how did you remember that?</div><div id="00:24:08.020" class="transcript_line"> Because you remember good things, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:24:10.120" class="transcript_line"> Good moments. Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:12.920" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s and lots of people over the years,</div><div id="00:24:16.300" class="transcript_line"> especially people of my age, like I&#039;m nearly 60 now.</div><div id="00:24:20.100" class="transcript_line"> They say, oh, we remember that.</div><div id="00:24:22.040" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:24:22.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you know that kids don&#039;t remember it?</div><div id="00:24:24.440" class="transcript_line"> And you talk about history, and this is why this project is so good.</div><div id="00:24:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, there was a time there was a time when Cardiff was buzzing</div><div id="00:24:32.920" class="transcript_line"> and its streets were extremely vibrant.</div><div id="00:24:34.980" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. And now it&#039;s just full of David&#039;s to center</div><div id="00:24:39.820" class="transcript_line"> and which owns some of the land that used to be ours.</div><div id="00:24:43.480" class="transcript_line"> And you can&#039;t you can&#039;t use it without their permission.</div><div id="00:24:46.440" class="transcript_line"> We know that we&#039;re not allowed to use it either.</div><div id="00:24:48.580" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s unbelievable.</div><div id="00:24:49.480" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t support the carnival anyway.</div><div id="00:24:51.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s absolutely unbelievable.</div><div id="00:24:52.620" class="transcript_line"> They won&#039;t even give us a free use of the hoop site.</div><div id="00:24:54.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s unbelievable.</div><div id="00:24:55.720" class="transcript_line"> We could buy it off them for two to four thousand pounds, which we don&#039;t own.</div><div id="00:24:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Which is a hoop site now.</div><div id="00:24:59.860" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the one outside of the new library.</div><div id="00:25:01.460" class="transcript_line"> All right. That&#039;s the one where the there&#039;s that big burger bar in the summer.</div><div id="00:25:06.260" class="transcript_line"> Either way, I mean, it&#039;s their land.</div><div id="00:25:07.800" class="transcript_line"> If you want to be there, you pay.</div><div id="00:25:09.940" class="transcript_line"> Right. Well, I mean,</div><div id="00:25:12.900" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not dreadful that we I remember when I when I moved to Birmingham,</div><div id="00:25:18.740" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff City Council or County Council.</div><div id="00:25:23.540" class="transcript_line"> Had an arts policy to create an arts policy.</div><div id="00:25:26.880" class="transcript_line"> And the week after that, they got rid of all the community grants,</div><div id="00:25:29.320" class="transcript_line"> community arts grants.</div><div id="00:25:30.660" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, what sort of bloody policy is that?</div><div id="00:25:33.320" class="transcript_line"> They haven&#039;t followed it through.</div><div id="00:25:35.260" class="transcript_line"> Nothing&#039;s been followed through.</div><div id="00:25:36.560" class="transcript_line"> There is no policy document.</div><div id="00:25:38.720" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing that people can in different departments can work towards.</div><div id="00:25:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that what you were trying to achieve and achieved,</div><div id="00:25:46.960" class="transcript_line"> certainly in the early days, which have been lost in your absence,</div><div id="00:25:50.460" class="transcript_line"> that some of that might have been easier to secure?</div><div id="00:25:53.200" class="transcript_line"> Had Cardiff is unusual as a local authority.</div><div id="00:25:56.360" class="transcript_line"> Those has been in the from ninety one onwards,</div><div id="00:26:01.140" class="transcript_line"> for instance, all the other valleys, local authorities would have had a dedicated</div><div id="00:26:06.840" class="transcript_line"> arts development officer and team in post.</div><div id="00:26:09.440" class="transcript_line"> Of course, none of those things existed and still don&#039;t exist in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:26:13.960" class="transcript_line"> So it was left to say Mavericks in the best sense of the word,</div><div id="00:26:17.400" class="transcript_line"> like yourself, to to take on.</div><div id="00:26:19.740" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, imagine you had an arts development team to plug your</div><div id="00:26:23.680" class="transcript_line"> celebration vision into it would have been a lot easier.</div><div id="00:26:26.420" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, that wasn&#039;t the case in Cardiff, was it?</div><div id="00:26:28.580" class="transcript_line"> I had one. I had one. But it was under adventure play.</div><div id="00:26:32.120" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s where Tracy Harding started in the arts team.</div><div id="00:26:35.120" class="transcript_line"> And Emma Gellert was on the arts team as well.</div><div id="00:26:39.180" class="transcript_line"> And the building team and there was an outdoor pursuits team.</div><div id="00:26:41.820" class="transcript_line"> And when when there was what&#039;s urban aid, you know, an urban aid came in.</div><div id="00:26:46.620" class="transcript_line"> I talk about the golden days when the lottery came on board.</div><div id="00:26:49.960" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s so much money. Urban aid.</div><div id="00:26:51.740" class="transcript_line"> I had so many more staff working with these kids.</div><div id="00:26:56.400" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I think to answer the question.</div><div id="00:26:59.640" class="transcript_line"> A position gives you a certain degree of position.</div><div id="00:27:05.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, people saying, you know, that</div><div id="00:27:07.540" class="transcript_line"> I was always known as a maverick because basically was created out of nothing.</div><div id="00:27:11.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it wasn&#039;t it wasn&#039;t intentional.</div><div id="00:27:13.680" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think it&#039;s rather wonderful that that&#039;s how this all came about.</div><div id="00:27:17.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was it was organic.</div><div id="00:27:19.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Which is very you can&#039;t do that these days.</div><div id="00:27:21.320" class="transcript_line"> No, at all. Because everything or you do it voluntary or you&#039;re expected to do it</div><div id="00:27:26.620" class="transcript_line"> voluntary, which was the way the council are going.</div><div id="00:27:29.160" class="transcript_line"> Everything is going to be voluntary and, you know, you&#039;re going to be left with no</div><div id="00:27:32.700" class="transcript_line"> services whatsoever.</div><div id="00:27:33.860" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a shame that the arts have arts have always suffered, haven&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:27:38.300" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been the poor, the poor.</div><div id="00:27:40.800" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a non statutory. Yes.</div><div id="00:27:42.500" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Times authority, local authorities, I mean, statutory provision, arts and</div><div id="00:27:47.780" class="transcript_line"> culture, non statutory.</div><div id="00:27:49.080" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it&#039;s the first to go to the wall.</div><div id="00:27:50.380" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I mean, I always said to Kate, my wife, that if I ever win the lottery, if</div><div id="00:27:55.820" class="transcript_line"> I do it for every lottery and I win a serious amount of money, I am going to set</div><div id="00:27:59.760" class="transcript_line"> the festival up and do it.</div><div id="00:28:01.060" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s excellent.</div><div id="00:28:02.060" class="transcript_line"> Yes. But whether or not to be in Cardiff, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:28:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Wherever it is at some point in the future.</div><div id="00:28:09.320" class="transcript_line"> Watch this space.</div><div id="00:28:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Watch this space.</div><div id="00:28:11.320" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d like to. Mike, can I just thank you for that wonderful interview?</div><div id="00:28:16.240" class="transcript_line"> And I think at this point, we have to for future generations who are listening out</div><div id="00:28:20.040" class="transcript_line"> there, I&#039;m sure, point out that Mike is an unsung hero of the Cardiff Carnival and</div><div id="00:28:26.440" class="transcript_line"> learning about those early days about getting started from scratch and kicking</div><div id="00:28:36.440" class="transcript_line"> open the doors of bureaucracy.
