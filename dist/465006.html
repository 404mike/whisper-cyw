    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do. I think I was probably at work in college here because it broke the news,</div><div id="00:00:16.400" class="transcript_line"> broke sort of first thing in the morning. And as it happened one of my colleagues, one</div><div id="00:00:21.120" class="transcript_line"> of the other lecturers, came from Aberfan and actually lived in the area where the land</div><div id="00:00:29.840" class="transcript_line"> slip occurred. And so, you know, there was this immediate link which heightened the</div><div id="00:00:46.120" class="transcript_line"> impact of it. But yes, I can remember it very clearly. I can remember the pictures and so</div><div id="00:00:52.640" class="transcript_line"> forth. And as it happened, a few years afterwards, a colleague and I were going down for an academic</div><div id="00:01:02.400" class="transcript_line"> board in Cardiff and we went via Aberfan to have a look at the site and where she had</div><div id="00:01:11.600" class="transcript_line"> lived and to see, you know, the relationship to the landslips. Yes, that made a great impact.</div><div id="00:01:24.320" class="transcript_line"> I think it was bound to do. I mean, it was such an appalling tragedy involving all those</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> children. Yes. And I think you needed the visual impact particularly to appreciate how</div><div id="00:01:44.720" class="transcript_line"> destructive it was. Can you remember anything specific that you saw in the coverage? Well,</div><div id="00:01:54.960" class="transcript_line"> I can remember seeing obviously shots of the slip itself which actually came literally</div><div id="00:02:03.920" class="transcript_line"> to the road where this colleague lived or had the family house. I can remember certain incidents</div><div id="00:02:19.680" class="transcript_line"> like, for example, there was a minister from one of the non-conformist chapels who lost his children</div><div id="00:02:28.720" class="transcript_line"> in this disaster but who went round other bereaved families consistently and obviously tried to</div><div id="00:02:38.640" class="transcript_line"> help in the attempts to rescue, you know. And also later on, the cemetery which was</div><div id="00:02:53.440" class="transcript_line"> built for them or set up for them on the hillside above the town where all the children were</div><div id="00:03:01.640" class="transcript_line"> buried together. And there was, of course, a lot of follow-up about the collection in</div><div id="00:03:10.520" class="transcript_line"> aid for the families and what was going to happen to it and so forth. So it was something</div><div id="00:03:15.040" class="transcript_line"> which was constantly in the news for quite a considerable time. The coverage brought</div><div id="00:03:23.960" class="transcript_line"> Aberfan to the world&#039;s attention. Yes. What effect did you think that had? Well, I suppose</div><div id="00:03:30.280" class="transcript_line"> it must have had a greater awareness of the need for precautions to prevent this happening</div><div id="00:03:38.840" class="transcript_line"> again. Whether, in fact, I mean how effective that was, I don&#039;t know, but it must have had</div><div id="00:03:48.440" class="transcript_line"> that effect and presumably not only in this country because the same thing could very</div><div id="00:03:55.040" class="transcript_line"> easily happen and similar things have happened elsewhere, haven&#039;t they? I can&#039;t think of</div><div id="00:04:03.680" class="transcript_line"> any specific examples because I didn&#039;t know anybody in that world, so to speak. Do you</div><div id="00:04:10.360" class="transcript_line"> think the coverage conveyed the feeling in Aberfan? Oh yes, I think it did. I think there</div><div id="00:04:16.360" class="transcript_line"> was a very powerful impact. I mean people reporting from there were obviously, presenters</div><div id="00:04:24.520" class="transcript_line"> were obviously upset themselves and you could hardly fail to be, could you, in the circumstances.</div><div id="00:04:31.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I thought that atmosphere came over very powerfully.</div></div></p>
