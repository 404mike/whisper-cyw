    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Vicki MacDonald at Holy Trinity Church, Flandernow, during the longest yarn.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m with Brian, who is going to talk to me about his father and the war.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was born on the 4th of December 1942, and I was born in Bedford, in the county of Bedfordshire.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And the reason was, is that if you had a pregnant wife during the war, and your husband worked and was in the REF 138 Squadron,</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Thamesford, which was the spy squadron, you were never allowed to leave the squadron.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> If you wish to see an offspring that was about to be born, the only chance of seeing it is if your wife,</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> wherever she lived in the country, was prepared to risk coming to Bedford Hospital and the child being born there.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mother decided to take the risk from living in Trinton, Manchester, and took the train heavily pregnant to the hospital in Bedford, where I was born.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And my dad, who was a leading aircraftman in the squadron, was escorted from the squadron by two military police to Bedford Hospital to see me,</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> then taken back to the base. He spent the whole of his war in 138 Squadron.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> They flew Lysander aircraft over occupied Europe, and they dropped the spies.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So they would take someone like a Winston Churchill to a secret meeting in France or Germany.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The meeting would take place. The flight would be overnight by moonlight into a field that had three lights of different colors to say,</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> safe to land or not safe to land. The meeting would take place maybe in a barn.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> The meeting would be finished. The spy would then be back into the Lysander. Lysander would fly back to Thamesford.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> At Thamesford, there is a very large barn, still there with no windows, and the agent would then be taken from the aircraft at dark to the barn,</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> where they would have 48 hours of debriefing and given their new orders.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And then at the end of the 48 hours, the agent would then at night be taken from the barn, put into the Lysander and flown back to occupied Europe.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> If they were captured, and some of them unfortunately were, then they would be interrogated and they never knew where they were taken to,</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> because it was only ever in the dark into a barn with no windows.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> 48 hours interrogation, new orders back to the aircraft and then flown into occupied Europe.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was what happened. And Brian Lever, born in Bedford Hospital on the 4th of December, 42, left Bedford after one week.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And mum went back to Manchester. And then I spent all the war years with my granny, granddad and mum living in Shrinter, Manchester.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And every evening my granddad took me into his Anderson shelter, where he had a steep garden.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And he dug the Anderson shelter so it was right into the earth. And I can remember my first recollection, I was probably about three years old.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember the little tea light that my granny lit every night to keep you safe.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So when dad arrived at the end of 45, I&#039;d never met him and never knew him.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And who was this person who came in the middle of my triangle of granny, granddad and mum?</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a very tough time for the first six months of me and this person getting to know each other.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously thousands of children during the Second World War had the same problem.</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> If you were born early in the war, you never saw your father, you were lucky if he came back.</div><div id="00:03:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And if he did came back, he came into an established, normally your grandparents and your mother.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And the arrangement then became this person arrived and you didn&#039;t know who it was.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really interesting. Can I ask you, how did you know about what he did? Did he tell you or did you find his records later in life?</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I can tell you a particular story which happened in 1944.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I build and fly model aircraft and I have a modeling room at home just for making and building the aircraft.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got a King&#039;s Order commendation on the wall.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And this was my father in 1944.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Lye Sanders, there were six of this particular aircraft that did the night flights.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a fighter pilot who had had a mental breakdown.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And the idea of helping him recover was to put him onto bombers rather than fighters, you can imagine.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So the aircraft, the Lye Sanders were on the perimeter of the airfield adjacent to the main runway.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And the Stirling bomber was loaded up for a bombing raid that night.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And the particular pilot who had the breakdown went to the aircraft, he was going to fly it.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was fiddling around and he dropped the whole bomb load.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So there was an emergency in the air and everybody had to run to the opposite side because there was a full bomb load, 10 tons of bombs on the perimeter track.</div><div id="00:05:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And my dad, God bless him, he couldn&#039;t bear the thought of these Lye Sanders all getting blown up to bits.</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So he ran and got a tractor and one by one he towed them 150 yards away from where the bombs were without really thinking about it.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> As it was, the bombs never went off.</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I hope he got a DSO for this.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So he didn&#039;t get a DSO for it, but he got a commendation from the King, from the King to say, you know, God bless you for saving all of our Lye Sanders.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And I still have that.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So how do I know all this?</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Because in the latter years of my father&#039;s life, 138 Squadron had an annual reunion.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you had children from that era, you were allowed to accompany your parents.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was very honoured over 12 years of my father&#039;s life to go to the annual commemoration of the Squadron and what it did.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So I met all these amazing people.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And you heard all their stories?</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I heard all their stories, yes.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Amazing.</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> It was fantastic.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Oh, Brian, thank you so much.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have the last Squadron reunion, I think, was in something like, perhaps it was 2002, something like that.</div><div id="00:06:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And the format of it was that you met in a pub, you went to a church and we had a church service in Thamesford.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you went to the Village Hall.</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And for the last one, they managed to get some of the ladies of the era to dress up in their little tiny black uniforms and serve as the meal.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we went to the airfield.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of my aeromodelling friends, who&#039;s a full-size pilot, he flew the Lysander from near Tuxford Airfield.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And they did 10 minutes of flying over us.</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember everybody was weeping.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I can imagine crying, absolutely.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, lovely, lovely memories.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you so much.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so pleased that we met.</div></div></p>
