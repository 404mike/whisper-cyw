    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Track three, I&#039;d much rather have the fresh air of the mountains.</div><div id="00:00:07.200" class="transcript_line"> As you can see, it&#039;s not much of a forest yet. Not too many tall trees to speak of.</div><div id="00:00:13.620" class="transcript_line"> What with the German submarines, the U-boats, targeting our merchant ships, we&#039;ve got to</div><div id="00:00:18.200" class="transcript_line"> become more self-sufficient, they say, even though the wars ended.</div><div id="00:00:22.960" class="transcript_line"> The girls from the forestry commission are busy planting this up with softwoods. Quick</div><div id="00:00:27.520" class="transcript_line"> growers from Scandinavia.</div><div id="00:00:29.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, the trees, that is.</div><div id="00:00:32.200" class="transcript_line"> The forestry girls are local. Most of them are only young, 15, 16 or so. They didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:00:38.200" class="transcript_line"> join the land army, just got a job with the forestry. They weren&#039;t best pleased to find</div><div id="00:00:43.080" class="transcript_line"> out they were getting paid half what we did. And they don&#039;t get the beret either.</div><div id="00:00:48.520" class="transcript_line"> It was an easy choice for me, you know, joining the timber corps. I&#039;d much rather have the</div><div id="00:00:52.760" class="transcript_line"> fresh air of the mountains than the confines of a munitions factory.</div><div id="00:00:57.080" class="transcript_line"> And the uniform? Rather fetching, don&#039;t you think?</div><div id="00:01:01.480" class="transcript_line"> I remember a big brown paper parcel being delivered just a few days after passing my</div><div id="00:01:05.680" class="transcript_line"> medical. I spread everything across the bed, then proceeded to try it all on. Green jerseys,</div><div id="00:01:12.680" class="transcript_line"> riding breeches, dungarees, woolen knee socks, beige knit shirts and a tie.</div><div id="00:01:19.380" class="transcript_line"> We had a pair of boots, brown shoes and gum boots, plus overall coats, one melting overcoat</div><div id="00:01:25.880" class="transcript_line"> and a macintosh. And there at the bottom in a separate wrapping was my green armlet,</div><div id="00:01:31.400" class="transcript_line"> a metal badge and the bakelite badge for my green beret. I felt really important.</div><div id="00:01:38.040" class="transcript_line"> To this day, Mrs Lloyd, my landlady, even scrubs my boots. They&#039;re a lovely couple,</div><div id="00:01:43.240" class="transcript_line"> they are. It&#039;s a good thing though, because there&#039;s just one room downstairs, no kitchen</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and the toilet is down steps by the river. Upstairs has two bedrooms, a single room that</div><div id="00:01:53.960" class="transcript_line"> Mr and Mrs Lloyd are in and a double bedroom for me. And as it turned out, Lily. We had</div><div id="00:02:00.160" class="transcript_line"> to share the small space, sleeping head to toe. She was a lovely lass too, but like all</div><div id="00:02:05.560" class="transcript_line"> the other girls, they were only here for a few months before moving on. Oh, I just need</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to nip over to Violet, one of the forestry girls planting just over there. Hold that</div><div id="00:02:14.480" class="transcript_line"> thought and I&#039;ll catch up with you later.</div></div></p>
