    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first question is if you&#039;d like to tell me about your experience of coming to Wales.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very nice coming to Wales. I came from East Africa, direct to Wales.</div><div id="00:00:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was a seven-hours travel, two flights, changed in Amsterdam, then I got here.</div><div id="00:00:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But I arrived in Wales very late, because there was a delay. I came in 2022 December.</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So from 2022 December to date, I&#039;ve been around.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So about a year and a half.</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a year and a half.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And what were your first impressions of Wales?</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Wales is very cold. Oh my God, Wales is very cold.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I always feel like, come out of the house, it&#039;s warm, with no time, it&#039;s raining.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So the weather is unpredictable. But I like it because it&#039;s quiet. It&#039;s a quiet place here.</div><div id="00:01:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales is very quiet. It doesn&#039;t have too much activity like London compared to London.</div><div id="00:01:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I like this kind of environment.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And over the year and a half that you&#039;ve been here, have your impressions of living in Wales changed?</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Like wanting to live in Wales?</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Or just what it&#039;s like to live in Wales?</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, of course. I came from abroad, and this was my first experience of leaving my home country to UK and Wales.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Definitely I&#039;m trying to adjust to very many things, especially the dress code.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You have to put on a lot of things to cover yourself from cold.</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> When I had just arrived, I froze. I was not told that I&#039;m supposed to have a warm shoe on me and diaper clothes, stuff like that.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Our country is very warm. So these things of freezing on the street, I didn&#039;t have any clue.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I suffered. That day I had to go to the shop and I explained to the lady in the shop.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> She told me next time, don&#039;t come out of the house when you dress like this.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how I started adjusting. And you know, if it is winter, you don&#039;t dress up like you in Africa.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you don&#039;t dress up like you in Africa. You have to really cover yourself nicely.</div><div id="00:02:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The cold can frustrate you. I couldn&#039;t lift my legs. It was that bad. I couldn&#039;t lift my legs.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But this time, this year, I knew how to dress up. And I&#039;m actually fine.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have a favourite item of clothing that you would save for the day?</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I have my favourite goods. My favourite trousers, my favourite jacket, my favourite cardigan.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I put on my cardigan. I put on a jacket on top and a nice trouser.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Shoes that are covering my legs properly. Yeah, I think I&#039;m now fine.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;ve got your Welsh footwear.</div><div id="00:03:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I&#039;ve got it. But I learnt the hard way. It wasn&#039;t easy. I learnt the hard way.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So last year, it was around 5th. We were still staying at the seaside.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where when I arrived in Wales, I went to work at the seaside.</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> We came out of the house. We went to the lodge where we used to stay.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> When we opened the door, oh my god, snow. First time we were seeing snow.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We were like, goodness me. We just came out, stepped in the snow, took pictures.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It was interesting. It was really fun.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You say that&#039;s the first time you&#039;d seen snow.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, first time to see snow in my life. Africa doesn&#039;t have snow. East Africa doesn&#039;t have snow.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was amazing. They took pictures, sent them home. It was fun.</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was the reaction from them?</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They were like, oh, she&#039;s experiencing the snow now. But this year, the snow has not appeared.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I think the weather has changed. I kept on waiting this time to go for it. Nothing.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fabulous. Thank you.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve talked about you came and you were at the seaside. Have you moved from the seaside now?</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I moved from the seaside to the centre now.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;ve lived in a variety of places since you&#039;ve been here.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I left the seaside. Now I&#039;m at up here in town.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So does that give you a sense of having lived in a different, a series of different places in the last year and a half,</div><div id="00:05:19.000" class="transcript_line"> do you have a place that feels home?</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Of the three?</div><div id="00:05:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Or just what it is that makes it feel home?</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s shared accommodation and different cultures, different ways of doing things.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So to me, the three places, none of them has felt like home because the two were for workplace.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Then this one where I am currently, it&#039;s just a shared accommodation for working stroke students.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m not a student.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> When I&#039;m living with students and it is six people, totally different.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So when I&#039;m in my room, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> When I come out, I have to go to a common bathroom. I go to a common kitchen.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a way like looking at my things when I&#039;m at home. It&#039;s totally different here.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> There are adults, you can&#039;t tell them do this.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a time I was told to keep in my lens.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was like, OK, I think I have to slow down a bit.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Hygiene wise, I think I was looking at it, having the background that I told you all.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I was looking at hygiene, getting off my lens.</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was like, guys, can you try to be adults and look neat?</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Now I look at it the way it is.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I just pray that maybe before this year ends, I get a house which is one room.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I have my own bathroom. I have my own kitchen.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when I feel like I&#039;m home because I can do what I want there.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you have... So you&#039;ve got your room, which you said feels OK?</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my room feels OK. But you see, my room is not complete.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> If I don&#039;t have where I can cook from, if I don&#039;t have my own shower,</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to shower at a certain time. When you want to go and shower, you find a tochupai.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you have to postpone. Your brain is already set to go and shower.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you want to cook, you&#039;re hungry, go to the kitchen, you find the stove already full.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So my room doesn&#039;t... Just because there&#039;s a bed that I feel I&#039;m comfortable with, that&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So that&#039;s it with the home arrangement and accommodation.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But home will be when you&#039;ve got your own space.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> If I have my own space, I really, really would want it to be like home in the UK.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. I want to look at my dining, my kitchen, my everything. I want to look at it neat.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I can&#039;t do it now. I only make my room neat, my bed neat, my room, and that&#039;s it. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that&#039;s a challenge, isn&#039;t it, Shad? It&#039;s a huge challenge.</div><div id="00:08:38.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a big challenge because accommodation here is very, very difficult.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The nine months I spent, they would never afford to give us accommodation.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They tell us, unless you&#039;re a student, you can get studio accommodation, you can get one room,</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> unless you&#039;re a student, but I&#039;m not a student.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I asked them, even those that have got offices that get people accommodation,</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> you walk in there, they tell you, you have got property for students, yes,</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> but those of you that are working, not in city.</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So the priority here is for students because they are majority, actually.</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> The universities have taken quite a lot of good accommodation.</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I even told the landlady she has properties.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I told her, could you please get me one room house that has a sitting area?</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to be like home. She said, no, it&#039;s not available.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You just can&#039;t fit in the shared accommodation for now.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Fingers crossed it comes through quickly. Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s one and a half years now.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, you come from work.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You want to be relaxed a bit, sit in the city, watch TV.</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Where would you watch TV from?</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> The common room, the common area, you can&#039;t put your TV there.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Some other person will come and break it.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You do not know. It&#039;s so and so and so.</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> In your room, it&#039;s a small room. It&#039;s not a big one.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t put all the things there.</div><div id="00:10:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But anyway, slowly, like you said, fingers crossed.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> One day, one morning, I&#039;ll wake up and get the house.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;ll get it.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m still having high hopes of getting that one that will make me feel like home.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So if we think a little bit about any point in your life you want to focus on,</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> so it doesn&#039;t just have to be the last year and a bit since you&#039;ve been in Wales,</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> but anywhere, is there a place that&#039;s felt home to you?</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Before I came to the UK, no, I&#039;d never left my country.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to move within my country.</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I used to move within my country, doing whatever studies and so on,</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I would get accommodation that would feel like home.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I would get accommodation that would feel like home because I was facilitated for that.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So they would know I&#039;m coming.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d get me a place that I would be comfortable so that I&#039;d do my work when I&#039;m happy.</div><div id="00:11:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And thinking about, again, across your whole life,</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> is there a place or a time that is very important to you?</div><div id="00:11:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So it might be a really happy memory or it might be a childhood memory</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> or it might be just a place that you&#039;ve been that feels like somewhere you&#039;d like to tell me about.</div><div id="00:12:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Maybe when I was doing the studies, there&#039;s a place where I went and I climbed a very steep hill near the equator.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The hill was too steep, but we didn&#039;t walk up the hill.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> We went up the hill with small bikes.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So there were expert people that rode us to that steep hill.</div><div id="00:12:39.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d look down and you&#039;re like, my gosh, if I go off this bike and roll down, they&#039;ll never see me again.</div><div id="00:12:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was interesting.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went there for five days.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The first day was terrifying.</div><div id="00:12:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The second day, but the fifth day, we were used.</div><div id="00:12:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Just sit on the bike, one and a half hours going uphill.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was interesting.</div><div id="00:13:04.000" class="transcript_line"> What was the...</div><div id="00:13:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So if you were to take me there, can you tell me what I would say if I was a bit on my own?</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, if you were to go there, because our district, our home district, is a tourist attraction place.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> There are plenty of things to look at.</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d really feel nice going uphill on a small bike, meandering around the hill.</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you see yourself on the hilltop and you&#039;d be like, he rode me all through here and he didn&#039;t trip off.</div><div id="00:13:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be very nice. You&#039;d really enjoy it.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We get very many people that come from this side and come for holiday there.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> There are many things to look at. That would be one.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Then there would be another one where you go there.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Stones that drip like breasts.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s next to that place, that hilly place.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> It is still within the same vicinity.</div><div id="00:14:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It would be very interesting for you.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s like a breast milk.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, like real boob of a woman.</div><div id="00:14:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It comes out like real breast milk.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So we even call it breast of a certain woman.</div><div id="00:14:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This was a historical woman.</div><div id="00:14:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So they say that these are when they were moving, they stopped there and they became like monuments.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So people, very many tourists go there.</div><div id="00:14:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a cave you go in, but you find the breast, the milk like that stuff dripping.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It drips year in, year out.</div><div id="00:14:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a tourist attraction.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very nice.</div><div id="00:14:47.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d love to take pictures, call others to come and look at it.</div><div id="00:14:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that is it.</div><div id="00:14:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It sounds wonderful.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s really nice. It&#039;s really nice.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I always tell people here, East Africa is a place to be.</div><div id="00:15:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And is there a time that you&#039;ve been, have you been many times or once or?</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, every time you go, if you want to, if when I&#039;m home and I want to change environment,</div><div id="00:15:17.000" class="transcript_line"> you actually can go there and sit.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> The trees are so refreshing.</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> You just, people take tents there and camp there.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You just go there.</div><div id="00:15:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a home away from home.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then you hear the birds singing on top of you in the trees.</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a really quiet place, nice place to stay.</div><div id="00:15:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Not the hilltop, but that other one where there are like breasts.</div><div id="00:15:44.000" class="transcript_line"> What the colour&#039;s like?</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a tree. It&#039;s green. It&#039;s green.</div><div id="00:15:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The colour of that one that drips is like a stone. It&#039;s brown.</div><div id="00:15:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a stone, but you really see it dripping like a breast of a mother.</div><div id="00:15:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it sounds wonderful.</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s really interesting.</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to tell me a bit about what your life was like growing up?</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was growing up, I at around five, I developed asthma.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> They first told, they first kept on saying I had bronchitis.</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Then from bronchitis, they said asthma.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It really disturbed me from five years up to 16.</div><div id="00:16:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I had to do it.</div><div id="00:16:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I had to leave my home district.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I came to the capital city.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I came to the capital city, the asthma checked out.</div><div id="00:16:45.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to say you can take some local medicine.</div><div id="00:16:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It will heal, but it didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:16:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But when I left the cold place and came to a warmer one, it went.</div><div id="00:16:57.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve come back to the cold and wet.</div><div id="00:17:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but the cold one now, I completely healed.</div><div id="00:17:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, my mum, because my dad does not exist anymore,</div><div id="00:17:07.000" class="transcript_line"> my mum was worried. She was like, oh, you&#039;re now going to the UK, the winter.</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I said no.</div><div id="00:17:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m no longer asthmatic. I outgrew it.</div><div id="00:17:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I outgrew it completely.</div><div id="00:17:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I had the same actually.</div><div id="00:17:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I was asthmatic.</div><div id="00:17:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when I got pregnant, it went.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you can outgrow it.</div><div id="00:17:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You can outgrow it.</div><div id="00:17:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Some people don&#039;t believe that certain things happen, but it&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:17:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s possible.</div><div id="00:17:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I just changed.</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, it was the pediatrician who advised my parents then that this child, try this.</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve given her plenty of meds.</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s not responding.</div><div id="00:17:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Just remove her from this cold weather, take her to the capital city and see how she will be.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> As soon as I stepped in the city, the asthma checked out.</div><div id="00:17:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a big move for you and your family, though.</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. They brought me and kept me with my mum&#039;s sister.</div><div id="00:18:07.000" class="transcript_line"> They remained there, but I stayed with my mum&#039;s sister.</div><div id="00:18:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t have asthma anymore.</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:16.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was it.</div><div id="00:18:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So your mum and your mum&#039;s sister have been important people for you.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Very important.</div><div id="00:18:25.000" class="transcript_line"> My mum&#039;s sister, I call her mum.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I call her mum because from the time I was young, she was living with my mum.</div><div id="00:18:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So when she got married, she came to the capital city.</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They were living in the capital city.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> My family remained back in our home district.</div><div id="00:18:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I came and lived with my mum.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> I call her mum, my young mum, my auntie.</div><div id="00:18:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So she&#039;s really, really good.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s my friend.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And everybody knows she&#039;s my friend.</div><div id="00:19:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;ve been a very, very, very strong rock to my growth.</div><div id="00:19:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And do you want to talk a little bit about that?</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned your studies a few times.</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you like to tell us a bit?</div><div id="00:19:13.000" class="transcript_line"> My studies? Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually, when I came to live with my auntie, she took me to the hospital.</div><div id="00:19:21.000" class="transcript_line"> She went with me.</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> She told me, come, let&#039;s go to the hospital together.</div><div id="00:19:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I think she was going for Auntie Nento.</div><div id="00:19:29.000" class="transcript_line"> She was going for Auntie Nento, if I&#039;m not forgetting.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Then when I reached there, I looked at the nurses.</div><div id="00:19:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Very smart.</div><div id="00:19:37.000" class="transcript_line"> They were putting on a uniform that was white, red, and it was ironed with plates.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Very neat.</div><div id="00:19:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I told my auntie, I have to put on that uniform.</div><div id="00:19:51.000" class="transcript_line"> I like it.</div><div id="00:19:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was like, oh.</div><div id="00:19:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, no, I have to put on that uniform.</div><div id="00:19:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I like it.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I want to become a nurse now because I like the uniform.</div><div id="00:19:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how I became a nurse.</div><div id="00:20:03.000" class="transcript_line"> I actually went to that same school and I did the nursing.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I put on that uniform.</div><div id="00:20:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I really used to iron it nicely.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I would feel nice when I&#039;m sitting.</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I put all the plates together.</div><div id="00:20:16.000" class="transcript_line"> No wrinkles.</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s me.</div><div id="00:20:19.000" class="transcript_line"> For three years, I did the general nursing.</div><div id="00:20:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then you specialized?</div><div id="00:20:25.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m a general nurse.</div><div id="00:20:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Then after that, I started doing the studies.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I started doing the studies after that.</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m a senior nurse.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Of general nursing, I did not specialize in anything, but the studies, we do them according to the seniority back home.</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re a senior of a certain level, you can do studies with the people who are current-night researchers.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have a research specialism?</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I have certificates of participation and so on.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there a topic that you particularly loved working on?</div><div id="00:21:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I worked basically on, like in my field.</div><div id="00:21:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I never went out of my field.</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was basically HIV.</div><div id="00:21:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Then I go to pediatrics.</div><div id="00:21:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Then, yeah, it was medical basically.</div><div id="00:21:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But in the community, when I was doing my research, I would come across people who have got like domestic problems.</div><div id="00:21:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I was trained to do counseling.</div><div id="00:21:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So I would do that also.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I would do counseling because that one also I specialized in it.</div><div id="00:21:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And is that something you do right?</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Very much.</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I do it even now.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Someone can be low, feeling really bad and so on.</div><div id="00:22:07.000" class="transcript_line"> When I talk to that person, the person really feels, they still hope even after this, I still can make it.</div><div id="00:22:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve spoken to many people who have challenges and they tell me, yeah, your conversation with me has impacted me.</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So I feel proud of that.</div><div id="00:22:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Really proud.</div><div id="00:22:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:22:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That actually leads into a question that I have here, which is we talk a lot about magic moments.</div><div id="00:22:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So a moment when something changed.</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a magic moment in your life you&#039;d like to, you&#039;ve obviously provided them lots for other people, but is there one that you would like to talk about?</div><div id="00:22:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Something changed.</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Something changed.</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> When I came to Wales, I didn&#039;t have anybody I knew here.</div><div id="00:23:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite challenging.</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But through work place and church, there&#039;s a lady who told me, there&#039;s a lady from East Africa.</div><div id="00:23:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I will get her contacts.</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You meet with her.</div><div id="00:23:23.000" class="transcript_line"> She could be from your home district.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> To me, that was magic.</div><div id="00:23:27.000" class="transcript_line"> She changed everything.</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I was like, wow, I even have somebody who&#039;s from East Africa, even if she&#039;s not from my home district.</div><div id="00:23:37.000" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s Christian.</div><div id="00:23:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That one was so nice to me.</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> It really made me feel really good.</div><div id="00:23:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And what was it about that that was so important for you?</div><div id="00:23:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So important for me.</div><div id="00:23:52.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sitting with you because of her.</div><div id="00:23:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t have known that you exist if it were not for her.</div><div id="00:24:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s why I call her magic.</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And another thing, I was, I had challenges with my first job.</div><div id="00:24:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She still spoke, told me, go speak to certain certain people.</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And right now I&#039;m working.</div><div id="00:24:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So to me, she&#039;s magic.</div><div id="00:24:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s magic.</div><div id="00:24:19.000" class="transcript_line"> She turned around things for me in a joking way.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s a simple lady, but she&#039;s I don&#039;t know how we can mention it, but she came timely to me.</div><div id="00:24:32.000" class="transcript_line"> She came timely because it was like going to be a challenge.</div><div id="00:24:37.000" class="transcript_line"> But all of a sudden she had just a small sentiment.</div><div id="00:24:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Go to such a place.</div><div id="00:24:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:24:45.000" class="transcript_line"> The story changed completely.</div><div id="00:24:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And today I&#039;m here with you.</div><div id="00:24:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t have known that you are here even if it were not for her.</div><div id="00:24:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve talked a little bit about your hopes, which are around having another having a place where that can be tidy and your own.</div><div id="00:25:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:25:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything else you&#039;d like to say about if you imagine the future, what you&#039;d like it to look like?</div><div id="00:25:12.000" class="transcript_line"> The future in Wales could be in Wales.</div><div id="00:25:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Could be in Wales.</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know what your future&#039;s going to look like.</div><div id="00:25:19.000" class="transcript_line"> My future I would like it to be because I&#039;m a mother of two and my children are not young.</div><div id="00:25:25.000" class="transcript_line"> They are young adults.</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So in future, maybe if I settled down here, I&#039;d like them to come to Wales and live with me.</div><div id="00:25:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Though my son told me, Mom, I can&#039;t handle the cold.</div><div id="00:25:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I told him, you will get to know that people dress up like this and they handle.</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was still there.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Even if you&#039;re talking of me coming to visit, maybe when it&#039;s not cold.</div><div id="00:25:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But with the cold, no.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So my future, I look at it like settling down here, having my children come if they want to stay because you can&#039;t force an adult to do something.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> They can stay if they want to visit.</div><div id="00:26:10.000" class="transcript_line"> They visit.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So me, I&#039;ll be happy to stay here.</div><div id="00:26:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I like Wales.</div><div id="00:26:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I like Wales.</div><div id="00:26:18.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic. Thank you.</div><div id="00:26:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything that, thinking about this as a story that will, your story will be informing how future generations of people think about Wales.</div><div id="00:26:31.000" class="transcript_line"> If it goes into the museum, it&#039;s about who are the people that live in Wales now.</div><div id="00:26:35.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s what we want to know.</div><div id="00:26:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you haven&#039;t said that you would like to say that you would like to be noted or for people to know about?</div><div id="00:26:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Living in Wales?</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Who you are living in Wales now, yeah.</div><div id="00:26:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, me.</div><div id="00:26:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m here.</div><div id="00:26:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t settled in very well.</div><div id="00:26:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m hoping to settle in because I came to work.</div><div id="00:27:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And the job got some challenges, but like I told you, she was magic to me.</div><div id="00:27:08.000" class="transcript_line"> She turned everything.</div><div id="00:27:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m hoping to see myself settle in when I settle in.</div><div id="00:27:14.000" class="transcript_line"> In future, I don&#039;t know whether I can buy property here and I feel comfortable and I stop renting.</div><div id="00:27:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s possible, but that would be a very good option for me.</div><div id="00:27:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Buy property and stop renting.</div><div id="00:27:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:27:38.000" class="transcript_line"> When people have had workmates, about two, they came from England.</div><div id="00:27:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I even have a friend who came from England.</div><div id="00:27:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When they come here, they don&#039;t want to go back.</div><div id="00:27:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So they say Wales is very good.</div><div id="00:27:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales is very quiet.</div><div id="00:27:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Wales does not have too much traffic.</div><div id="00:27:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve also witnessed it.</div><div id="00:27:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t have too much traffic.</div><div id="00:28:01.000" class="transcript_line"> The few times I&#039;ve been to
