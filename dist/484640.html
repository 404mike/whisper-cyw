And you got it right, you&#039;d be glad to know.</div><div id="00:00:31.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Excellent.</div><div id="00:00:33.240" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s your first recollection of the Cardiff Mass Carnival</div><div id="00:00:36.960" class="transcript_line"> as it was then?</div><div id="00:00:39.200" class="transcript_line"> I first recall the carnival</div><div id="00:00:43.640" class="transcript_line"> with young people wearing sailor costumes,</div><div id="00:00:47.480" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t particularly,</div><div id="00:00:48.560" class="transcript_line"> I think it was in Queen Street and Cardiff Castle,</div><div id="00:00:53.680" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t specifically remember that,</div><div id="00:00:55.840" class="transcript_line"> but I was working for what was Cardiff City Council then</div><div id="00:01:01.400" class="transcript_line"> and would have been working at the Children&#039;s Festival,</div><div id="00:01:03.640" class="transcript_line"> which I believe they took part in.</div><div id="00:01:08.120" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. That would be the very, very first one in 1990</div><div id="00:01:12.400" class="transcript_line"> and it was led by an artist from Trinidad called Katherine Chan,</div><div id="00:01:17.120" class="transcript_line"> who thought it would be a good idea</div><div id="00:01:18.400" class="transcript_line"> to introduce Wales and Cardiff to carnival</div><div id="00:01:20.800" class="transcript_line"> by recreating our own version</div><div id="00:01:23.120" class="transcript_line"> of a traditional Trinidadian masquerade,</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> which was based on sailors.</div><div id="00:01:28.520" class="transcript_line"> So it was a sailor bar, so you quite like it.</div><div id="00:01:30.240" class="transcript_line"> I can remember those costumes distinctly.</div><div id="00:01:32.840" class="transcript_line"> What was quite interesting for me is that,</div><div id="00:01:34.960" class="transcript_line"> in fact, we didn&#039;t go, the route wasn&#039;t Queen Street,</div><div id="00:01:37.440" class="transcript_line"> but in fact, it was St. Mary&#039;s Street.</div><div id="00:01:40.600" class="transcript_line"> At that point, St. Mary&#039;s Street wasn&#039;t pedestrianized</div><div id="00:01:45.080" class="transcript_line"> and also had a divider down the middle</div><div id="00:01:48.920" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;d managed to close one side of the road.</div><div id="00:01:51.800" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;re parading up one side of the road,</div><div id="00:01:54.360" class="transcript_line"> whilst the other side of the road actually had cars in it.</div><div id="00:01:58.040" class="transcript_line"> And I just remember thinking, very dangerous.</div><div id="00:02:00.280" class="transcript_line"> No, it didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:01.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it meant that half our potential audience</div><div id="00:02:03.600" class="transcript_line"> in that area couldn&#039;t see what we were doing</div><div id="00:02:06.240" class="transcript_line"> because there were cars passing in front of them.</div><div id="00:02:08.120" class="transcript_line"> But there we are.</div><div id="00:02:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Early days, we sort of evolved and developed from there.</div><div id="00:02:13.920" class="transcript_line"> So having seen it in its original formation</div><div id="00:02:17.080" class="transcript_line"> when it wasn&#039;t intergenerational just for kids,</div><div id="00:02:20.120" class="transcript_line"> you then, of course, took the carnival plunge</div><div id="00:02:22.280" class="transcript_line"> and became a participant, am I right?</div><div id="00:02:25.520" class="transcript_line"> I did.</div><div id="00:02:26.400" class="transcript_line"> And I think, actually, it was through that children&#039;s event</div><div id="00:02:31.960" class="transcript_line"> and I worked with children</div><div id="00:02:33.080" class="transcript_line"> at Time in the Play Service in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:36.800" class="transcript_line"> I became involved by making gigantes,</div><div id="00:02:41.520" class="transcript_line"> which are huge, huge puppets.</div><div id="00:02:44.400" class="transcript_line"> I think they were about 20 foot tall.</div><div id="00:02:48.400" class="transcript_line"> And I remember one of them was a fish</div><div id="00:02:50.440" class="transcript_line"> and I think the other one was a lion.</div><div id="00:02:52.360" class="transcript_line"> And we made them with the children of withies</div><div id="00:02:55.320" class="transcript_line"> that we soaked and then used this very thick cling film</div><div id="00:03:00.600" class="transcript_line"> that had to go and buy specially</div><div id="00:03:04.560" class="transcript_line"> and sort of thick tissue paper as well that we covered.</div><div id="00:03:10.080" class="transcript_line"> So it created quite a strong structure.</div><div id="00:03:13.840" class="transcript_line"> And then we painted the whole thing.</div><div id="00:03:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And paraded through Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:19.840" class="transcript_line"> I think we ended up on the museum steps</div><div id="00:03:23.400" class="transcript_line"> and the children carried these huge, huge puppets</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> together with myself and another play worker called Wes</div><div id="00:03:31.360" class="transcript_line"> who came from the Riverside Play Center at the time.</div><div id="00:03:34.800" class="transcript_line"> And I think it was the Riverside Play Center</div><div id="00:03:36.640" class="transcript_line"> that we worked with particularly</div><div id="00:03:37.800" class="transcript_line"> and possibly Grangetown as well.</div><div id="00:03:39.840" class="transcript_line"> Was Wes also known as West Ham?</div><div id="00:03:41.640" class="transcript_line"> He was, that was West Ham, yeah.</div><div id="00:03:42.960" class="transcript_line"> That was West Ham, I mean,</div><div id="00:03:44.480" class="transcript_line"> the man with the loudest voice in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:03:46.880" class="transcript_line"> He only had one tone of voice.</div><div id="00:03:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Even if he was whispering a secret or,</div><div id="00:03:50.880" class="transcript_line"> he could only bellow,</div><div id="00:03:52.320" class="transcript_line"> which was rather fascinating to me.</div><div id="00:03:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Even when a bellow wasn&#039;t required, it was very loud.</div><div id="00:03:58.480" class="transcript_line"> No, I remember him well and affectionately.</div><div id="00:04:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so Westy and I took the kids through Cardiff</div><div id="00:04:04.920" class="transcript_line"> and there were these huge, huge puppets.</div><div id="00:04:07.360" class="transcript_line"> And nobody died.</div><div id="00:04:08.520" class="transcript_line"> No, thankfully.</div><div id="00:04:11.280" class="transcript_line"> Not carrying those.</div><div id="00:04:12.280" class="transcript_line"> They were quite weighty things.</div><div id="00:04:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Can&#039;t really remember what happened to them afterwards,</div><div id="00:04:17.880" class="transcript_line"> but they were quite spectacular at the time.</div><div id="00:04:21.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure everybody applauded.</div><div id="00:04:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got good memories that I associate with them.</div><div id="00:04:25.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:26.600" class="transcript_line"> What happened next in your carnival journey?</div><div id="00:04:29.600" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think,</div><div id="00:04:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I think I then became a terrorist banker from hell</div><div id="00:04:37.160" class="transcript_line"> and worked with Warped and Twisted with Tom and Ali</div><div id="00:04:41.200" class="transcript_line"> and Marega Pulsar, I remember particularly.</div><div id="00:04:47.800" class="transcript_line"> And we created these costumes</div><div id="00:04:49.640" class="transcript_line"> that were like big black clown trousers</div><div id="00:04:52.760" class="transcript_line"> and they had a wire right through the waist</div><div id="00:04:54.400" class="transcript_line"> so they stood out from your body</div><div id="00:04:57.240" class="transcript_line"> and they have braces to keep them on you.</div><div id="00:05:01.280" class="transcript_line"> And we had white vests and black bowler hats</div><div id="00:05:05.760" class="transcript_line"> with white horns curling out of the bowler hats.</div><div id="00:05:09.520" class="transcript_line"> I think our faces were painted</div><div id="00:05:10.880" class="transcript_line"> like skeletons or something like that.</div><div id="00:05:13.680" class="transcript_line"> And we were wearing roller skates</div><div id="00:05:17.600" class="transcript_line"> and we made the costumes in Kutais Community Centre.</div><div id="00:05:24.080" class="transcript_line"> And then we had to roller skate</div><div id="00:05:25.800" class="transcript_line"> from Kutais Community Centre around the corner</div><div id="00:05:30.560" class="transcript_line"> and over the bridge to head into Cardiff City Centre.</div><div id="00:05:34.640" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember coming to the bridge</div><div id="00:05:36.920" class="transcript_line"> and thinking, goodness, how am I gonna skate</div><div id="00:05:40.240" class="transcript_line"> down the other side of this bridge</div><div id="00:05:43.320" class="transcript_line"> without crashing into somebody in front of me?</div><div id="00:05:46.520" class="transcript_line"> So I then quickly realised that actually the way to do it</div><div id="00:05:49.160" class="transcript_line"> was to skate from side to side</div><div id="00:05:51.040" class="transcript_line"> rather than just to go straight down</div><div id="00:05:52.920" class="transcript_line"> and plough through the rest of the carnival.</div><div id="00:05:56.040" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what I did.</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> I managed to get to the sort of bottom of that bridge safely.</div><div id="00:06:01.640" class="transcript_line"> And then the idea really was to sort of skate around</div><div id="00:06:06.920" class="transcript_line"> and kind of skate up to the crowd</div><div id="00:06:09.560" class="transcript_line"> and almost kind of like terrorise them</div><div id="00:06:13.360" class="transcript_line"> as a terrorist banker.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And kind of just skate around doing that really.</div><div id="00:06:19.560" class="transcript_line"> It was great fun.</div><div id="00:06:21.880" class="transcript_line"> Thoroughly enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:06:23.720" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, I loved roller skating.</div><div id="00:06:26.760" class="transcript_line"> So it was brilliant for me</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was quite a good roller skater.</div><div id="00:06:29.520" class="transcript_line"> So you could do turns and everything.</div><div id="00:06:32.360" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it was good fun actually that one.</div><div id="00:06:34.800" class="transcript_line"> I enjoyed that.</div><div id="00:06:37.280" class="transcript_line"> It sounds wonderful.</div><div id="00:06:38.120" class="transcript_line"> And of course, this is all social comments about,</div><div id="00:06:41.440" class="transcript_line"> well, some of the downsides of banking</div><div id="00:06:42.920" class="transcript_line"> well before they introduced these austere times to us.</div><div id="00:06:45.880" class="transcript_line"> So I think you probably foresaw that in some way, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, obviously, you know, predictions</div><div id="00:06:51.760" class="transcript_line"> of capitalism gone wrong.</div><div id="00:06:53.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely, definitely.</div><div id="00:06:56.520" class="transcript_line"> I think there was an alternative name for those as well,</div><div id="00:06:58.560" class="transcript_line"> which I can&#039;t really say for the record</div><div id="00:07:00.760" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s a bit rude.</div><div id="00:07:02.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure we can work it out.</div><div id="00:07:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Is it rhyming slang?</div><div id="00:07:04.640" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:07:05.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can imagine.</div><div id="00:07:06.960" class="transcript_line"> It began with the letter W if you&#039;re listening to the future.</div><div id="00:07:09.280" class="transcript_line"> You can work that out for yourselves.</div><div id="00:07:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But yes, it was very much about all that.</div><div id="00:07:16.800" class="transcript_line"> So having skated in 1995,</div><div id="00:07:22.840" class="transcript_line"> you took your skates off and became a carnival dancer.</div><div id="00:07:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Am I right?</div><div id="00:07:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I did, yes.</div><div id="00:07:28.680" class="transcript_line"> And became a leaf, I think.</div><div id="00:07:31.880" class="transcript_line"> So from a terrace banker to a leaf is quite extreme.</div><div id="00:07:36.040" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, wore a big green pointed leafy hat</div><div id="00:07:42.160" class="transcript_line"> and danced with some of the other professional dancers</div><div id="00:07:48.480" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff, because that&#039;s what I did at the time.</div><div id="00:07:50.680" class="transcript_line"> I was a dancer, danced professionally and taught dance.</div><div id="00:07:56.320" class="transcript_line"> And I danced with June Campbell, Janet Fieldsend,</div><div id="00:08:02.440" class="transcript_line"> Mareaga, Polzar, Miranda, Fernandez,</div><div id="00:08:10.320" class="transcript_line"> Sally McLennan, Sally Verrell.</div><div id="00:08:12.400" class="transcript_line"> There were a few of us that were sort of in a group</div><div id="00:08:16.480" class="transcript_line"> and we all sort of danced together</div><div id="00:08:18.800" class="transcript_line"> and choreographed this particular dance</div><div id="00:08:22.080" class="transcript_line"> that we then as part of the carnival,</div><div id="00:08:26.280" class="transcript_line"> danced and paraded through.</div><div id="00:08:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Would you have been parading to the music</div><div id="00:08:29.560" class="transcript_line"> of one of the samba bands powering you along the streets?</div><div id="00:08:32.360" class="transcript_line"> I think it was.</div><div id="00:08:33.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not quite sure which samba band it was.</div><div id="00:08:35.600" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it was Cardiff Samba or Adrian Samba Band.</div><div id="00:08:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the name of it.</div><div id="00:08:43.880" class="transcript_line"> No, they were basically Brecon.</div><div id="00:08:45.480" class="transcript_line"> They used to come down.</div><div id="00:08:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, maybe Brecon, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:48.120" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, there were a few samba bands,</div><div id="00:08:50.600" class="transcript_line"> but yeah, we definitely would have done it.</div><div id="00:08:52.200" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:08:53.040" class="transcript_line"> Would your group have performed on the finale</div><div id="00:08:55.800" class="transcript_line"> on the steps of the National Museum as well?</div><div id="00:08:59.680" class="transcript_line"> We did.</div><div id="00:09:03.480" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it was,</div><div id="00:09:04.320" class="transcript_line"> was there a stage there at that time?</div><div id="00:09:06.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, the steps themselves actually formed a stage,</div><div id="00:09:09.360" class="transcript_line"> but for that year,</div><div id="00:09:11.040" class="transcript_line"> we actually even brought a flatbed truck in front of it.</div><div id="00:09:14.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:09:14.960" class="transcript_line"> To give another, to add an addition.</div><div id="00:09:16.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we danced on the flatbed truck.</div><div id="00:09:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Fantastic.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember doing that.</div><div id="00:09:21.240" class="transcript_line"> Lovely, and I don&#039;t believe anything fell off, did they?</div><div id="00:09:23.280" class="transcript_line"> Which is- No, no.</div><div id="00:09:25.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I remember there was some kind of staging</div><div id="00:09:27.440" class="transcript_line"> and yeah, it was the flatbed truck.</div><div id="00:09:28.280" class="transcript_line"> It was the flatbed truck.</div><div id="00:09:29.280" class="transcript_line"> It was all we could think of.</div><div id="00:09:30.240" class="transcript_line"> How can we, it&#039;s a functioning museum until five o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:09:34.720" class="transcript_line"> How can we actually introduce another element into it?</div><div id="00:09:37.240" class="transcript_line"> And the only thing I could think of</div><div id="00:09:38.720" class="transcript_line"> was actually to bring a flatbed truck in.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we added, you know,</div><div id="00:09:42.280" class="transcript_line"> you had all the other surfaces</div><div id="00:09:44.400" class="transcript_line"> that people could work off and show there.</div><div id="00:09:46.280" class="transcript_line"> So I thought, hang on, let&#039;s try that.</div><div id="00:09:48.360" class="transcript_line"> It worked reasonably well.</div><div id="00:09:50.080" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:09:50.920" class="transcript_line"> And we used to get big audiences as well.</div><div id="00:09:52.400" class="transcript_line"> We did massive audiences.</div><div id="00:09:53.240" class="transcript_line"> And I know, very appreciative.</div><div id="00:09:54.800" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the cheers for the costumes.</div><div id="00:09:56.560" class="transcript_line"> And then particularly at the end,</div><div id="00:09:57.600" class="transcript_line"> when we tried to pick out the name of the theme,</div><div id="00:10:00.960" class="transcript_line"> the overarching theme of that year in fireworks</div><div id="00:10:04.360" class="transcript_line"> from the top of the museum.</div><div id="00:10:06.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was the final moment.</div><div id="00:10:08.040" class="transcript_line"> And people used to go completely ape-frozen.</div><div id="00:10:10.480" class="transcript_line"> And you know, well, those were the days,</div><div id="00:10:13.280" class="transcript_line"> is all I can say.</div><div id="00:10:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:14.960" class="transcript_line"> You were better.</div><div id="00:10:16.240" class="transcript_line"> You probably wouldn&#039;t be able to do the flatbed truck</div><div id="00:10:19.360" class="transcript_line"> staging now.</div><div id="00:10:20.200" class="transcript_line"> And the paratheques are largely out of the question as well.</div><div id="00:10:22.840" class="transcript_line"> I mean, those are the days where health and safety</div><div id="00:10:24.600" class="transcript_line"> was a bit more lenient.</div><div id="00:10:25.840" class="transcript_line"> Whereas now, it probably wouldn&#039;t be allowed.</div><div id="00:10:28.440" class="transcript_line"> So I remember we had a particular dance sequence,</div><div id="00:10:30.960" class="transcript_line"> which is why we performed that on the back of that truck.</div><div id="00:10:34.720" class="transcript_line"> Got it.</div><div id="00:10:35.560" class="transcript_line"> So I remember distinctly, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And being professional dancers,</div><div id="00:10:39.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, what you had to offer was of a high order.</div><div id="00:10:41.520" class="transcript_line"> It was, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:42.360" class="transcript_line"> I mean, the whole point of that car would be that</div><div id="00:10:44.160" class="transcript_line"> there are people who have no previous experience.</div><div id="00:10:46.520" class="transcript_line"> There are people who are experienced dancers.</div><div id="00:10:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:49.320" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s room for everyone.</div><div id="00:10:50.160" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s one of the good things about the carnival</div><div id="00:10:52.840" class="transcript_line"> is that everybody could take part.</div><div id="00:10:55.040" class="transcript_line"> There was no restriction in any way.</div><div id="00:10:57.640" class="transcript_line"> And it didn&#039;t matter whether you were professional</div><div id="00:11:00.480" class="transcript_line"> or you weren&#039;t professional</div><div id="00:11:01.640" class="transcript_line"> and you just wanted to be part of it.</div><div id="00:11:03.240" class="transcript_line"> You could take part in that.</div><div id="00:11:04.440" class="transcript_line"> I think the joy of it is voluntary, you know.</div><div id="00:11:06.600" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve always made it quite plain from day one</div><div id="00:11:09.480" class="transcript_line"> that nobody should ever do anything</div><div id="00:11:11.160" class="transcript_line"> that they don&#039;t care to do.</div><div id="00:11:12.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there are people who&#039;ve contributed</div><div id="00:11:15.120" class="transcript_line"> to the making of costumes over many years, but whom,</div><div id="00:11:19.480" class="transcript_line"> some have then come over to the performance,</div><div id="00:11:21.640" class="transcript_line"> but who&#039;ve said, I don&#039;t care to you.</div><div id="00:11:23.200" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s like, that&#039;s absolutely fine.</div><div id="00:11:25.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;s no right or wrong in carnival.</div><div id="00:11:27.160" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s just right.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So everyone is free to do what they want to do, you know,</div><div id="00:11:31.040" class="transcript_line"> which is good.</div><div id="00:11:31.880" class="transcript_line"> It was good.</div><div id="00:11:33.720" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so, and they were great fun.</div><div id="00:11:36.440" class="transcript_line"> I mean, they were just, you know, you met new people.</div><div id="00:11:39.720" class="transcript_line"> It was, and it was just fun.</div><div id="00:11:42.120" class="transcript_line"> The whole process was fun and exciting and colorful.</div><div id="00:11:45.920" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, just, it was great.</div><div id="00:11:49.480" class="transcript_line"> It was just, you know, just something to enjoy really.</div><div id="00:11:52.280" class="transcript_line"> I look at the smile on your face.</div><div id="00:11:53.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all coming back to you, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:54.760" class="transcript_line"> I know, yeah, it was.</div><div id="00:11:55.600" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it was high energy.</div><div id="00:11:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely, it was really high energy.</div><div id="00:11:58.760" class="transcript_line"> And it was just, it was just great fun.</div><div id="00:12:00.560" class="transcript_line"> It was brilliant.</div><div id="00:12:01.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, really good.</div><div id="00:12:03.640" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, so I did that.</div><div id="00:12:05.680" class="transcript_line"> And I kind of changed my job there</div><div id="00:12:08.640" class="transcript_line"> or changed what I was doing.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I became the Arts Development Officer</div><div id="00:12:12.280" class="transcript_line"> for the Vale of Glamorgan Council,</div><div id="00:12:15.400" class="transcript_line"> which I&#039;m still doing quite some years later,</div><div id="00:12:19.040" class="transcript_line"> I think 18 years.</div><div id="00:12:20.160" class="transcript_line"> 18 years later, there we are.</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Bit of a time gem.</div><div id="00:12:25.960" class="transcript_line"> But I think early on, I think because of my contacts</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> that I had in Cardiff and stuff,</div><div id="00:12:32.040" class="transcript_line"> I was able to sort of draw some of that</div><div id="00:12:34.400" class="transcript_line"> into the Vale of Glamorgan.</div><div id="00:12:35.880" class="transcript_line"> And I can recall that we did some work</div><div id="00:12:41.040" class="transcript_line"> with Barry Carnival,</div><div id="00:12:44.600" class="transcript_line"> which had kind of dissipated really.</div><div id="00:12:47.440" class="transcript_line"> It had sort of come to the end of its life</div><div id="00:12:51.320" class="transcript_line"> being a lot of flatbed lorries.</div><div id="00:12:53.320" class="transcript_line"> There were lots of legal issues with that at the time.</div><div id="00:12:56.120" class="transcript_line"> Health and safety issues as well.</div><div id="00:12:56.960" class="transcript_line"> And times were changing.</div><div id="00:12:58.200" class="transcript_line"> The health and safety, the insurance.</div><div id="00:12:59.960" class="transcript_line"> There was loads of sort of issues.</div><div id="00:13:02.280" class="transcript_line"> So they couldn&#039;t do what they&#039;d done before sort of thing.</div><div id="00:13:05.920" class="transcript_line"> So we sort of introduced the mass carnival</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> to Barry really, and did a big workshop</div><div id="00:13:14.280" class="transcript_line"> and with a lot of the community there,</div><div id="00:13:18.120" class="transcript_line"> all ages, young people, older people,</div><div id="00:13:21.280" class="transcript_line"> and ended up parading through Barry Town Centre</div><div id="00:13:25.880" class="transcript_line"> along Holton Road and right down to Romney Park,</div><div id="00:13:31.200" class="transcript_line"> I think where the parade sort of culminated</div><div id="00:13:34.840" class="transcript_line"> with small performances and different shows</div><div id="00:13:41.040" class="transcript_line"> and just showing the costumes</div><div id="00:13:43.080" class="transcript_line"> that people had made and everything.</div><div id="00:13:44.840" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:13:45.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember you had very good weather as well.</div><div id="00:13:46.520" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely.</div><div id="00:13:47.340" class="transcript_line"> It was very good.</div><div id="00:13:48.180" class="transcript_line"> In our 25 years in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> we have suffered the odd damage, as you can imagine.</div><div id="00:13:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Definitely.</div><div id="00:13:54.360" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, yeah, I think it was pretty good weather</div><div id="00:13:56.400" class="transcript_line"> on that day as well.</div><div id="00:13:57.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got some quite, some good photographs</div><div id="00:13:59.840" class="transcript_line"> of that as well, which I&#039;ll have to dig out for you.</div><div id="00:14:02.240" class="transcript_line"> I look forward to harvesting those</div><div id="00:14:03.080" class="transcript_line"> and putting them online in the archive.</div><div id="00:14:04.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:14:06.760" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the Barry carnival where, as you say,</div><div id="00:14:10.800" class="transcript_line"> Swicker had sort of been invited in</div><div id="00:14:13.280" class="transcript_line"> and encouraged by yourself to try and put some new impetus</div><div id="00:14:17.240" class="transcript_line"> and sort of, you know, intergenerational</div><div id="00:14:19.640" class="transcript_line"> and community arts approach into it.</div><div id="00:14:23.280" class="transcript_line"> And some of the old guard who were actually</div><div id="00:14:27.440" class="transcript_line"> in their 60s and 70s found it very hard</div><div id="00:14:30.400" class="transcript_line"> to accept this approach.</div><div id="00:14:34.160" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite sad on one level</div><div id="00:14:37.440" class="transcript_line"> because I remember they used to meet on a Sunday morning</div><div id="00:14:40.400" class="transcript_line"> and it took me a long while to encourage</div><div id="00:14:42.960" class="transcript_line"> some local teenagers from Barry to join me</div><div id="00:14:45.640" class="transcript_line"> to come to potentially be on this committee.</div><div id="00:14:49.440" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, some of the elders on this committee</div><div id="00:14:53.560" class="transcript_line"> were so horrible to them that after one meeting,</div><div id="00:14:56.160" class="transcript_line"> they said that whilst they loved what we were doing</div><div id="00:14:59.040" class="transcript_line"> and would continue doing that,</div><div id="00:15:00.440" class="transcript_line"> they weren&#039;t prepared to sit in a room</div><div id="00:15:02.800" class="transcript_line"> and effectively be abused by some old guard</div><div id="00:15:06.920" class="transcript_line"> who didn&#039;t understand that things change.</div><div id="00:15:09.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:10.520" class="transcript_line"> So, I mean, and ultimately, sadly,</div><div id="00:15:13.480" class="transcript_line"> the Barry carnival died out, didn&#039;t it, Mealy?</div><div id="00:15:16.160" class="transcript_line"> It has really.</div><div id="00:15:17.480" class="transcript_line"> I think in the last couple of years,</div><div id="00:15:20.560" class="transcript_line"> some of the local groups, theater groups,</div><div id="00:15:23.360" class="transcript_line"> and some people from the community have started</div><div id="00:15:26.120" class="transcript_line"> to rekindle a similar sort of event,</div><div id="00:15:33.080" class="transcript_line"> but sort of parading and walking through the town center</div><div id="00:15:38.920" class="transcript_line"> and creating a sort of bit of an arts festival,</div><div id="00:15:41.040" class="transcript_line"> which is now Barry Arts Festival.</div><div id="00:15:42.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been running for about three years, probably,</div><div id="00:15:46.720" class="transcript_line"> where they have sort of evenings of music, entertainment,</div><div id="00:15:50.080" class="transcript_line"> workshops for young people,</div><div id="00:15:54.320" class="transcript_line"> and they do have a little parade</div><div id="00:15:56.720" class="transcript_line"> that comes through the town center as well.</div><div id="00:15:59.760" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s only sort of rekindled itself</div><div id="00:16:01.920" class="transcript_line"> in the last few years.</div><div id="00:16:03.680" class="transcript_line"> But there was a big time period, really,</div><div id="00:16:06.880" class="transcript_line"> where there wasn&#039;t a carnival, really, as such.</div><div id="00:16:11.720" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve had other events and things.</div><div id="00:16:13.600" class="transcript_line"> It was motorized, whereas our approach</div><div id="00:16:15.920" class="transcript_line"> has always been walking and.</div><div id="00:16:19.160" class="transcript_line"> Or pedestrians.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, pedestrians.</div><div id="00:16:20.840" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it did help us to make it accessible to people</div><div id="00:16:24.320" class="transcript_line"> and to avoid pumping out diesel fumes all over everything.</div><div id="00:16:29.160" class="transcript_line"> And all the legalities, like we&#039;ve mentioned.</div><div id="00:16:31.480" class="transcript_line"> And I think, so the traditional carnival,</div><div id="00:16:35.560" class="transcript_line"> I think, took quite a long time to kind of peter out, really,</div><div id="00:16:40.720" class="transcript_line"> and it was difficult for people</div><div id="00:16:42.280" class="transcript_line"> to accept something new and different</div><div id="00:16:45.040" class="transcript_line"> and something that really hadn&#039;t happened</div><div id="00:16:47.240" class="transcript_line"> in Barry ever before.</div><div id="00:16:48.680" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite a big thing to kind of take on.</div><div id="00:16:53.240" class="transcript_line"> And for those older people as well,</div><div id="00:16:57.240" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve been used to organizing something very specific</div><div id="00:17:00.160" class="transcript_line"> that they knew how to manage,</div><div id="00:17:04.640" class="transcript_line"> whereas that was quite new to them.</div><div id="00:17:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And people don&#039;t accept change very well very often.</div><div id="00:17:11.400" class="transcript_line"> They say, oh, it&#039;s like me.</div><div id="00:17:13.080" class="transcript_line"> You know, so, like my.</div><div id="00:17:16.240" class="transcript_line"> You know, yeah, I think it worked really well.</div><div id="00:17:20.040" class="transcript_line"> What did happen in the end did work really well.</div><div id="00:17:22.920" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, it was a lovely event,</div><div id="00:17:24.840" class="transcript_line"> but, you know, times change and things have moved on now.</div><div id="00:17:28.520" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:31.160" class="transcript_line"> Tracy, thank you for all your carnival stories.</div><div id="00:17:34.720" class="transcript_line"> I wish to award you verbally the badge of merit</div><div id="00:17:38.880" class="transcript_line"> of carnival hero.</div><div id="00:17:39.920" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, thank you very much indeed.</div><div id="00:17:43.200" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
