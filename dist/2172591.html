I&#039;ve come to Ilford in London</div><div id="00:00:13.540" class="transcript_line"> to talk to Anil Pabari who also came from Uganda in 1972 and he is the son of Indu Ben</div><div id="00:00:23.920" class="transcript_line"> Pabari.</div><div id="00:00:24.920" class="transcript_line"> Hello.</div><div id="00:00:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Hi Anil.</div><div id="00:00:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Hi.</div><div id="00:00:27.920" class="transcript_line"> So tell me, how old were you? Do you remember Uganda at all?</div><div id="00:00:32.480" class="transcript_line"> Very well.</div><div id="00:00:33.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, tell me about it. What was life like?</div><div id="00:00:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Well, we were just happy-go-lucky. You know, there we were just sort of no stress, just</div><div id="00:00:47.160" class="transcript_line"> playing outside. Yeah. Obviously no toys to play. We just sort of kids were just playing</div><div id="00:00:54.760" class="transcript_line"> outside.</div><div id="00:00:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. You found your own games.</div><div id="00:00:57.600" class="transcript_line"> We found our own games with people around us. Obviously we had our own friends.</div><div id="00:01:01.760" class="transcript_line"> And you were in Saroti, yeah?</div><div id="00:01:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Saroti. The only problem now is that keeping in touch with all the friends we missed.</div><div id="00:01:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. All the people you missed.</div><div id="00:01:12.880" class="transcript_line"> Although I have kept in touch with a few, but it&#039;s been a long time.</div><div id="00:01:18.040" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Do you remember when you were expelled?</div><div id="00:01:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:21.040" class="transcript_line"> What was it like for you when you heard that you have to leave?</div><div id="00:01:26.320" class="transcript_line"> Initially, I didn&#039;t understand. But then when we started packing, I think that bit of trauma</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> was there when we saw my friends just moving away. I remember that bit.</div><div id="00:01:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So one minute they were there and the next they were gone.</div><div id="00:01:43.400" class="transcript_line"> And then next they were all gone and then we were moving as well. And actually the journey</div><div id="00:01:51.560" class="transcript_line"> from Saroti to Kampala, we felt it. I felt it.</div><div id="00:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:01:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I remember.</div><div id="00:01:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it scary a little bit?</div><div id="00:01:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It was scary a little bit. Because at that time I still remember the army in between.</div><div id="00:02:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. The checkpoints.</div><div id="00:02:09.280" class="transcript_line"> The checkpoints and the army. The army lorries, yeah?</div><div id="00:02:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:02:13.280" class="transcript_line"> But luckily we managed to get to Kampala.</div><div id="00:02:16.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:17.760" class="transcript_line"> But obviously didn&#039;t understand why, for what reason.</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Was there any excitement at all?</div><div id="00:02:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Not really. Not really.</div><div id="00:02:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Because the idea of coming to London, that thought wasn&#039;t there yet.</div><div id="00:02:37.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:02:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It wasn&#039;t there yet.</div><div id="00:02:42.240" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember roughly, sort of, were you travelling at daytime or evening?</div><div id="00:02:47.240" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.

I think it was evening time.</div><div id="00:02:54.240" class="transcript_line"> And your flights came to which airport?</div><div id="00:02:57.240" class="transcript_line"> I think it was Stansted.</div><div id="00:02:58.240" class="transcript_line"> Stansted. Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:59.240" class="transcript_line"> Stansted.</div><div id="00:03:00.240" class="transcript_line"> And what happened?

class="transcript_line"> And after that, why did you choose to be housed in Dharonda or you just took whatever</div><div id="00:07:24.800" class="transcript_line"> was offered?</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I could feel we just took whatever was offered.</div><div id="00:07:28.680" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:07:29.680"

class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:07:42.720" class="transcript_line"> Because she knew we&#039;ll be...</div><div id="00:07:43.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:07:44.720" class="transcript_line"> ...in a propaganda.</div><div id="00:07:45.720" class="transcript_line"> So they just wanted a little more freedom, right?</div><div id="00:07:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Freedom, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:49.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:50.720" class="transcript_line"> So she just chose...</div><div id="00:07:51.720"

class="transcript_line"> Because Hitesh was here before the exodus.</div><div id="00:09:32.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:09:48.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Because we left Uganda.</div><div id="00:09:50.320" class="transcript_line"> So he was not entitled to free education.</div><div id="00:09:51.320" class="transcript_line"> To free education.</div><div id="00:09:52.720" class="transcript_line"> But Miss

class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:02.720" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s what they wanted him to pay as an overseas passer.</div><div id="00:10:05.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it, yes.</div><div id="00:10:06.720" class="transcript_line"> And she basically sorted that out.</div><div id="00:10:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes,

id="00:10:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:26.120" class="transcript_line"> But after obviously going back and she passed away and...</div><div id="00:10:29.120"

class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think she had anyone.</div><div id="00:10:35.120" class="transcript_line"> No, she didn&#039;t have anyone.</div><div id="00:10:36.120" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:10:37.120" class="transcript_line"> So, no, no.</div><div id="00:10:38.120" class="transcript_line"> She had some kind of family.</div><div id="00:10:39.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:40.120" class="transcript_line"> We tried to get in touch with her.</div><div id="00:10:41.120" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s a row she&#039;s passed away.</div><div id="00:10:42.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:43.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:44.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, obviously.</div><div id="00:10:45.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:46.120" class="transcript_line"> So initially, she was a Miss Harding.</div><div id="00:10:47.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:48.120" class="transcript_line"> So initially, she was a Miss Harding.</div><div id="00:10:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:50.120" class="transcript_line"> You know, obviously.</div><div id="00:10:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Initially, you thought, oh, the house is really nice.</div><div id="00:10:54.520" class="transcript_line"> But, you know, what were the drawbacks?</div><div id="00:10:57.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, severe damp conditions.</div><div id="00:10:58.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was really damp.</div><div id="00:10:59.520" class="transcript_line"> It was freezing.</div><div id="00:11:00.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:01.520" class="transcript_line"> It was freezing.</div><div id="00:11:02.520" class="transcript_line"> There was no heating?</div><div id="00:11:03.520" class="transcript_line"> Just that one room coal fire.</div><div id="00:11:06.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you had an open coal fire.</div><div id="00:11:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Open coal fire in just one room.</div><div id="00:11:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:11:11.520" class="transcript_line"> And that was the only warm place in that whole house.</div><div id="00:11:13.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the only warm place.</div><div id="00:11:14.520" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:15.920" class="transcript_line"> So, you had to buy this fuel there?</div><div id="00:11:20.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:21.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, they actually used to provide that.</div><div id="00:11:24.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:11:25.920" class="transcript_line"> Like, color gas.</div><div id="00:11:26.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:27.920" class="transcript_line"> Color gas.</div><div id="00:11:28.920" class="transcript_line"> But I think it was more...</div><div id="00:11:29.920" class="transcript_line"> It was liquid, was it?</div><div id="00:11:30.920" class="transcript_line"> It was liquid.</div><div id="00:11:31.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:32.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:33.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:34.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:35.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:36.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:37.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:38.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:39.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:40.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:41.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:42.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:43.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:11:45.320" class="transcript_line"> It was liquid, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:46.320" class="transcript_line"> That bit I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:11:47.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:11:48.320" class="transcript_line"> But the oil heaters or whatever.</div><div id="00:11:49.320" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:11:50.320" class="transcript_line"> And you were all very young then.</div><div id="00:11:51.320" class="transcript_line"> We were kids.</div><div id="00:11:52.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:53.320" class="transcript_line"> So, you went to primary school.</div><div id="00:11:54.320" class="transcript_line"> You were in primary school to start with?</div><div id="00:11:55.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:56.320" class="transcript_line"> Initially, I went to comprehensive school.</div><div id="00:11:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you were put in comprehensive straight away.</div><div id="00:11:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Initially.</div><div id="00:11:59.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:00.320" class="transcript_line"> And then, obviously, they gave me...</div><div id="00:12:01.320" class="transcript_line"> On the first day, they gave me some kind of test.</div><div id="00:12:02.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:03.320" class="transcript_line"> And obviously, I passed the test, like maths test, easily.</div><div id="00:12:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:05.320" class="transcript_line"> And then, one of the teachers said,</div><div id="00:12:06.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go to the math test.</div><div id="00:12:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go to the math test.</div><div id="00:12:08.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go to the math test.</div><div id="00:12:09.720" class="transcript_line"> And obviously, I passed the test, like maths test, easily.</div><div id="00:12:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:12.720" class="transcript_line"> And the one of the teachers said,</div><div id="00:12:13.720" class="transcript_line"> I shouldn&#039;t be here.</div><div id="00:12:14.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Because, I became...</div><div id="00:12:16.720" class="transcript_line"> I was one of the top one.</div><div id="00:12:17.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:18.720" class="transcript_line"> They said, oh you should go to grammar school.</div><div id="00:12:19.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:20.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:21.720" class="transcript_line"> And they straight away changed me to a grammar school.</div><div id="00:12:22.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:12:23.720" class="transcript_line"> So, that&#039;s why I went to post grammar school.</div><div id="00:12:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s why you went to post grammar.</div><div id="00:12:25.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:26.720" class="transcript_line"> And you went...</div><div id="00:12:27.720" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:12:28.720" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, okay.</div><div id="00:12:29.720" class="transcript_line"> So, I went to post grammar there.</div><div id="00:12:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:31.720" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:12:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:33.720" class="transcript_line"> So...</div><div id="00:12:34.720" class="transcript_line"> So, I went to post grammar there.</div><div id="00:12:35.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:36.720" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:12:37.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:38.720" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, initially, the accent was different.</div><div id="00:12:44.440" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, English was.</div><div id="00:12:46.040" class="transcript_line"> Our accent would have been different as well.</div><div id="00:12:48.120" class="transcript_line"> So how did you find the school?</div><div id="00:12:50.240" class="transcript_line"> The school was okay.</div><div id="00:12:53.240" class="transcript_line"> They could see.</div><div id="00:12:54.240" class="transcript_line"> The teachers were really very accommodating.</div><div id="00:12:57.240" class="transcript_line"> They knew we&#039;d come from abroad.</div><div id="00:12:59.800" class="transcript_line"> They knew we were refugees.</div><div id="00:13:04.120" class="transcript_line"> They knew our background that way.</div><div id="00:13:07.920" class="transcript_line"> Plus, I knew I was doing well in school compared to their own students.</div><div id="00:13:16.480" class="transcript_line"> So they were quite surprised that way.</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember that.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh really, I see.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And I still remember one of the friends and lunchtime, you know, mom used to give me food</div><div id="00:13:33.480" class="transcript_line"> and I used to share it with them.</div><div id="00:13:34.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did you?</div><div id="00:13:35.960" class="transcript_line"> Did they like it?</div><div id="00:13:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:13:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember a particular guy, he still remembers me.</div><div id="00:13:41.520" class="transcript_line"> I remember phoning him the other day.</div><div id="00:13:43.760" class="transcript_line"> He said, I remember you.</div><div id="00:13:45.800" class="transcript_line"> Oh really?</div><div id="00:13:46.800" class="transcript_line"> Because he met my youngest brother, my brother Surin, somewhere in a pub.</div><div id="00:13:53.240" class="transcript_line"> And just talking about Wales.</div><div id="00:13:54.880" class="transcript_line"> And he said, oh, I used to have an Indian friend called Anil Papari.</div><div id="00:14:00.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god.</div><div id="00:14:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Under the blue.</div><div id="00:14:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh my god.</div><div id="00:14:03.200" class="transcript_line"> And Surin didn&#039;t say anything for a minute.</div><div id="00:14:08.280" class="transcript_line"> And then after a while, because that&#039;s my brother.</div><div id="00:14:11.720" class="transcript_line"> Good to god.</div><div id="00:14:14.360" class="transcript_line"> What a coincidence.</div><div id="00:14:15.360" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:14:16.360" class="transcript_line"> And then I phoned him.</div><div id="00:14:17.360" class="transcript_line"> He said, did you?</div><div id="00:14:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I remember you know why?</div><div id="00:14:21.680" class="transcript_line"> You were so kind.</div><div id="00:14:22.680" class="transcript_line"> I said, why?</div><div id="00:14:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Okay, I used to share your food with me.</div><div id="00:14:27.680" class="transcript_line"> How sweet.</div><div id="00:14:29.280" class="transcript_line"> How sweet.</div><div id="00:14:30.280" class="transcript_line"> And I used to help him in his maths homework.</div><div id="00:14:33.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, okay.</div><div id="00:14:34.080" class="transcript_line"> Because people used to bully him.</div><div id="00:14:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Oh, did they?</div><div id="00:14:37.080" class="transcript_line"> At school.</div><div id="00:14:38.080" class="transcript_line"> And I used to share my food with him and help him with his homework.</div><div id="00:14:44.880" class="transcript_line"> So that impression, I haven&#039;t seen him since 1978 when I left for university.</div><div id="00:14:55.560" class="transcript_line"> But he still remembers me that way.</div><div id="00:14:58.480" class="transcript_line"> So school wise.</div><div id="00:15:00.480" class="transcript_line"> After my story.</div><div id="00:15:02.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the school was good.</div><div id="00:15:04.480" class="transcript_line"> The school was good.</div><div id="00:15:05.480" class="transcript_line"> For me, good.</div><div id="00:15:06.480" class="transcript_line"> And it became more comprehensive.</div><div id="00:15:09.480" class="transcript_line"> Later.</div><div id="00:15:10.480" class="transcript_line"> I think after I must have gone.</div><div id="00:15:12.480" class="transcript_line"> After I did.</div><div id="00:15:13.480" class="transcript_line"> And while I was there, the students actually chose me to become the head boy there.</div><div id="00:15:19.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh, why you say head boy?</div><div id="00:15:20.480" class="transcript_line"> So I became the head boy when I was in sixth form.</div><div id="00:15:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow.</div><div id="00:15:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:25.880" class="transcript_line"> So I still remember the teachers making me a role model for them.</div><div id="00:15:29.880" class="transcript_line"> Look, you should be like him.</div><div id="00:15:31.880" class="transcript_line"> Really, like Anil Babari?</div><div id="00:15:33.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:34.880" class="transcript_line"> Gosh.</div><div id="00:15:35.880" class="transcript_line"> And then you left in 78 to go to university?</div><div id="00:15:38.880" class="transcript_line"> To go to university.</div><div id="00:15:39.880" class="transcript_line"> And what did you study?</div><div id="00:15:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Computing.</div><div id="00:15:41.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow.</div><div id="00:15:42.880" class="transcript_line"> So I went to Norwich.</div><div id="00:15:43.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:44.880" class="transcript_line"> And parents were still in Benwick, right?</div><div id="00:15:46.880" class="transcript_line"> When you went to Norwich, right?</div><div id="00:15:47.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:15:48.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:15:49.880" class="transcript_line"> And?</div><div id="00:15:51.280" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s when, I think after a year later they came to London.</div><div id="00:15:55.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a year later they came to London, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:15:57.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:15:58.280" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:15:59.280" class="transcript_line"> So tell me a little bit how mum&#039;s contribution towards, mum and dad&#039;s contribution towards</div><div id="00:16:06.780" class="transcript_line"> setting up a business from nothing.</div><div id="00:16:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you see, it gives you inspiration, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:16:14.280" class="transcript_line"> But how their hard work.</div><div id="00:16:17.280" class="transcript_line"> Very hard work.</div><div id="00:16:19.280" class="transcript_line"> Builds into you.</div><div id="00:16:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So they set it up from nothing.</div><div id="00:16:22.680" class="transcript_line"> From nothing.</div><div id="00:16:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:24.680" class="transcript_line"> Literally nothing.</div><div id="00:16:25.680" class="transcript_line"> From nothing.</div><div id="00:16:26.680" class="transcript_line"> Literally from nothing.</div><div id="00:16:27.680" class="transcript_line"> Because we didn&#039;t have anything to start off with.</div><div id="00:16:28.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:16:29.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:30.680" class="transcript_line"> So the good thing is that we have unity in our family.</div><div id="00:16:36.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:37.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:38.680" class="transcript_line"> So the whole idea is to help each other.</div><div id="00:16:39.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:40.680" class="transcript_line"> You know, it&#039;s not like mine and yours.</div><div id="00:16:43.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s ours.</div><div id="00:16:44.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:45.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s always been ours.</div><div id="00:16:46.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:49.080" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what they&#039;ve taught us.</div><div id="00:16:52.080" class="transcript_line"> Families come first.</div><div id="00:16:53.080" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ve seen them work hard.</div><div id="00:16:55.080" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve seen them work hard.</div><div id="00:16:56.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:57.080" class="transcript_line"> Both mum and dad.</div><div id="00:16:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:16:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:00.080" class="transcript_line"> When did mum stop working in the cooking?</div><div id="00:17:03.080" class="transcript_line"> Well, she...</div><div id="00:17:04.080" class="transcript_line"> In commercial cooking.</div><div id="00:17:05.080" class="transcript_line"> I think after she had a stroke.</div><div id="00:17:08.080" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:17:09.080" class="transcript_line"> But we still, we still then just to keep her active, we wanted her to come in.</div><div id="00:17:15.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:16.080" class="transcript_line"> You have a shop, yeah?</div><div id="00:17:17.080" class="transcript_line"> You have a shop.</div><div id="00:17:18.480" class="transcript_line"> We just...</div><div id="00:17:19.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I formally retired last year, first of November last year.</div><div id="00:17:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:17:24.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:25.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:26.480" class="transcript_line"> For the shop, we just now listed out.</div><div id="00:17:27.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:28.480" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:17:29.480" class="transcript_line"> From first of November last year, yeah.</div><div id="00:17:32.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:33.480" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately, in 1998, I was diagnosed with epilepsy.</div><div id="00:17:40.480" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:17:41.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:42.480" class="transcript_line"> Out of the blue.</div><div id="00:17:43.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:44.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:45.480" class="transcript_line"> So that changed your life really?</div><div id="00:17:46.480" class="transcript_line"> That changed my life.</div><div id="00:17:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:48.880" class="transcript_line"> So then luckily the shop helped me.</div><div id="00:17:53.880" class="transcript_line"> Because you had your own professional career, didn&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:17:55.880" class="transcript_line"> I did.</div><div id="00:17:56.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:57.880" class="transcript_line"> So I was hoping...</div><div id="00:17:58.880" class="transcript_line"> You had to stop that with 1998 after the epileptic attacks?</div><div id="00:18:01.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:02.880" class="transcript_line"> A little bit, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:04.880" class="transcript_line"> Because in 2003, I had to leave my job.</div><div id="00:18:07.880" class="transcript_line"> 2003, you had to leave, right?</div><div id="00:18:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:10.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:11.880" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously with epilepsy, they take your license away.</div><div id="00:18:13.880" class="transcript_line"> All right.</div><div id="00:18:14.880" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:18:16.280" class="transcript_line"> So you had to travel by tubes and trains.</div><div id="00:18:18.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:19.280" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s not an easy job to do.</div><div id="00:18:21.280" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:18:22.280" class="transcript_line"> So one thing I don&#039;t like is too much noise and too many people around me.</div><div id="00:18:27.280" class="transcript_line"> But luckily, like you say, we had family support.</div><div id="00:18:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:33.280" class="transcript_line"> And something to fall back on this business, yeah.</div><div id="00:18:37.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:38.280" class="transcript_line"> You have children?</div><div id="00:18:39.280" class="transcript_line"> Two daughters.</div><div id="00:18:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Two daughters.</div><div id="00:18:41.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Although my daughters came slightly late, but they came straight after.</div><div id="00:18:46.680" class="transcript_line"> One after each other.</div><div id="00:18:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Literally 10 months apart.</div><div id="00:18:49.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, 10 months apart.</div><div id="00:18:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fantastic.</div><div id="00:18:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:52.680" class="transcript_line"> Two fantastic girls.</div><div id="00:18:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Especially the older one.</div><div id="00:18:56.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:18:57.680" class="transcript_line"> The one&#039;s getting engaged tomorrow.</div><div id="00:18:58.680" class="transcript_line"> The one is getting engaged.</div><div id="00:18:59.680" class="transcript_line"> Tomorrow.</div><div id="00:19:00.680" class="transcript_line"> The one is married already.</div><div id="00:19:01.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:02.680" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:19:03.680" class="transcript_line"> The other one&#039;s younger than her.</div><div id="00:19:04.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh, righty.</div><div id="00:19:05.680" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s younger.</div><div id="00:19:06.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:07.680" class="transcript_line"> My older one&#039;s married.</div><div id="00:19:08.680" class="transcript_line"> Older one is married, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:09.680" class="transcript_line"> I always say I got four daughters.</div><div id="00:19:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Four daughters, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:12.080" class="transcript_line"> Because the two are your brothers, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:15.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:16.080" class="transcript_line"> And you really look at your brother as your family.</div><div id="00:19:19.080" class="transcript_line"> Exactly.</div><div id="00:19:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Because they always see them grow up together.</div><div id="00:19:22.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:23.080" class="transcript_line"> The all four are so close, yeah.</div><div id="00:19:24.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:25.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:27.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:28.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:29.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:30.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:31.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:32.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:33.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:34.080"

class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:44.480" class="transcript_line"> And she...</div><div id="00:19:45.480" class="transcript_line"> Because now she&#039;s become a pharmacist.</div><div id="00:19:46.480" class="transcript_line"> But I always wanted to push her away.</div><div id="00:19:47.480" class="transcript_line"> Right, right.</div><div id="00:19:48.480" class="transcript_line"> You can look.</div><div id="00:19:49.480" class="transcript_line"> You be on your own.</div><div id="00:19:50.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:19:51.480" class="transcript_line"> And she looks after me.</div><div id="00:19:52.480" class="transcript_line"> She does, doesn&#039;t she?</div><div id="00:19:53.480" class="transcript_line"> Since she was

class="transcript_line"> Bite into my tongue.</div><div id="00:20:01.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:02.480" class="transcript_line"> And I bleed a lot.</div><div id="00:20:03.480" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:04.480" class="transcript_line"> And she used to clean me at that young age.</div><div id="00:20:05.480" class="transcript_line">
