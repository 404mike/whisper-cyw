I&#039;d go for it if I was you.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;d like to think that I started something new in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And the thing that I found that was initially tricky was a lot of people didn&#039;t know what Lindy Hop was.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> When you say that word, people don&#039;t recognise it as a dance form that&#039;s in the public consciousness.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a bit of effort to introduce it to Cardiff, to really show what it was.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Even saying swing dance to people, people sometimes don&#039;t really get whether it&#039;s rock and roll or jive.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s actually something different. It predates those type of dances.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s got a real, the real spirit of Lindy Hop really lent itself really well to the carnival</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s all about joy and fun and inclusivity and community.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not just a performance style. It&#039;s not about showing off.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about a way of connecting with other people in a creative way and in a way that you do through an art form,</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> through music and dance rather than just showcasing and showing off and being a performer.</div><div id="00:02:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s more inclusive than that.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I can remember back in 2012 that the year before we were trying to think how we could help grow the carnival.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We had this idea of having a broad church definition.</div><div id="00:02:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And whilst the carnival camp, the free workshops and the parade are always like the spine of what we do and have done for well over a quarter of a century.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The idea was then to try and breathe some life into the city centre.</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But probably more importantly, to provide a platform, a showcase, to show on this one day all these participatory arts opportunities</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> from capoeira to belly dance to Lindy Hop.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> There was all this going on in the samba galettes, the drumming group who are looking for, who have an open door policy, who want to welcome other people on board.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And you&#039;ll still meet people who will say, well, I don&#039;t know then.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And the idea was to actually, as I say, provide a platform for those.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I was delighted when Cardiff Lindy Hop joined us on that first occasion.</div><div id="00:03:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I&#039;m right, you&#039;re thinking you were dancing in the haze, is that right?</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, the haze was a really great place to do it with all.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just so central to Cardiff and flat and a nice big open space for us to dance around in.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Lindy Hop takes up quite a lot of space, so it was really good to have that opportunity.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, you say about inviting along all different types of art groups.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was something we really enjoyed because we realized there were people in our dance group even that we noticed were in these other groups.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So we were able to go along and support them as well.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Like we had someone in samba galettes and also a band I used to play with, Wunder Brass, were playing.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was really nice to see not only that we had all these different groups,</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> but that they weren&#039;t isolated and that we all actually interconnected and supported each other.</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And again, with Wunder Brass was great because I remember you scheduled it often that we went on after Wunder Brass,</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> which was really nice to me because it kind of connected my two interests of music and dance.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I remember last the year before last 2014, I had a really good memory where we&#039;d been asked to come on and dance to their final track.</div><div id="00:05:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought it would just be me and my dance partner, Olly, because it&#039;s quite intimidating just to go on and start dancing.</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And so us two got up and we were like, yeah, let&#039;s go take to the floor for the band.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then without me realizing, all of my dancers joined in until so everyone took to the floor, completely no fear.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was really nice because they didn&#039;t know the track.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So just spontaneously to be able to improvise, it kind of made me proud of them to think how much confidence they&#039;d gained in such a short space of time,</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> just to be able to get up in front of a whole haze full of people to dance to and we&#039;re all band and friends was really nice.</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, it was just a really positive event to be involved with.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And like I say, it kind of tied in well with the ethos of what we&#039;re doing as well with our dance group and everything.</div><div id="00:05:57.000" class="transcript_line"> What can I say other than Anna Rogers, I hereby award you the totally unbankable but invisible but nevertheless real award of you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, thank you. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you.</div></div></p>
