And he took his talus, which was in a talus bag with him wherever he went,</div><div id="00:00:47.360" class="transcript_line"> and he went to North Africa, he went all over the world literally, but he always took his talus bag with him,</div><div id="00:00:54.480" class="transcript_line"> and he was in some far-flung place and he realized he&#039;d lost his talus, and he was really really upset about this.</div><div id="00:01:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Anyway he sort of carried on and apparently a few weeks went by and a young army private came and said,</div><div id="00:01:10.640" class="transcript_line"> oh Sergeant Muscovich I found your table runner, and this private must have thought why is this man carrying his table?</div><div id="00:01:18.960" class="transcript_line"> But I do remember that, I do remember obviously both my parents telling me that my dad was sent to an army camp in Cornwall,</div><div id="00:01:27.280" class="transcript_line"> St Morgan, St Morgan I think it was in Cornwall, and they went to this particular army camp,</div><div id="00:01:33.920" class="transcript_line"> and a few days after they arrived there some young wafts arrived to do a show,</div><div id="00:01:41.120" class="transcript_line"> of course my mum was one of the wafts, and after a whirlwind romance he proposed to this young waft.</div><div id="00:01:48.640" class="transcript_line"> So really I mean it was tough for my dad, it was a hard war for my dad, but those are some of my memories.</div></div></p>
