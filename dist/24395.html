    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, Paul Robeson. This is Will Painter, President of the South Wales Miners, speaking.</div><div id="00:00:08.500" class="transcript_line"> On behalf of the South Wales Miners and all the people gathered at this ice stepward,</div><div id="00:00:13.620" class="transcript_line"> I extend to you warm greetings of friendship and respect. We are happy that it has been</div><div id="00:00:20.220" class="transcript_line"> possible for us to arrange that you speak and sing to us today. We would be far happier</div><div id="00:00:26.620" class="transcript_line"> if you were with us in person. Our people deplore the continued refusal of your government</div><div id="00:00:33.820" class="transcript_line"> to return your passport and to deny you the right to join with us in our festival of song.</div><div id="00:00:40.540" class="transcript_line"> We shall continue to exert what influence we can to overcome this position. We look</div><div id="00:00:46.820" class="transcript_line"> forward to the day when we shall again shake you by the hand and hear you sing with us</div><div id="00:00:52.660" class="transcript_line"> in these valleys of music and song. As one of our Welsh songs puts it, and we dedicate</div><div id="00:00:59.300" class="transcript_line"> it to you, we&#039;ll keep a welcome in the hillsides. We&#039;ll keep a welcome in the vales. This land</div><div id="00:01:06.220" class="transcript_line"> of ours will still be singing when you come back again to Wales. And now, Paul, for the</div><div id="00:01:12.500" class="transcript_line"> procedure for this evening. We would like you to give a message of greetings to the</div><div id="00:01:21.300" class="transcript_line"> Welsh miners and the great audience here assembled in this ice stepward. And after</div><div id="00:01:28.620" class="transcript_line"> that, to sing to us. And after you have sung, we have here on the platform the Triochi Male</div><div id="00:01:36.980" class="transcript_line"> Voice Choir, which is one of the premier male voice choirs in Wales. And they will sing</div><div id="00:01:43.420" class="transcript_line"> to you a very beautiful Welsh song, A Dealin Eyre. Over to you, Paul.</div></div></p>
