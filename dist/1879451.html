    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well the Stranglers were brilliant, you know, like probably on Newport twice actually.</div><div id="00:00:14.280" class="transcript_line"> The first time was at the Alexandria Club, which is over by the centre after Newport.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a great old nightclub called the Alexandria Club.</div><div id="00:00:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s no longer there, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:00:28.680" class="transcript_line"> It was one of the last remaining nightclubs in Newport.</div><div id="00:00:32.680" class="transcript_line"> And they had the right atmosphere because they had ladies in the night frequenting the place.</div><div id="00:00:36.680" class="transcript_line"> And bouncers on the door, they&#039;d chuck you out if you looked at them wrong.</div><div id="00:00:40.680" class="transcript_line"> But it was quite a quiet affair but they went on really well.</div><div id="00:00:48.680" class="transcript_line"> The crowd liked them so I booked them for a second gig, which was at the Roundabout Club,</div><div id="00:00:56.680" class="transcript_line"> also known as the Magic Roundabout.</div><div id="00:01:00.680" class="transcript_line"> But Glenn wasn&#039;t too happy with it because it was too posh for him.</div><div id="00:01:05.680" class="transcript_line"> Because it was also called the Pullmans, which was named after a posh train coach.</div><div id="00:01:11.680" class="transcript_line"> And Glenn thought posh was one of them so he wasn&#039;t too happy with that.</div><div id="00:01:16.680" class="transcript_line"> But the crowd was happy with him, I was happy with him and memorable gig.</div><div id="00:01:21.680" class="transcript_line"> They were both pretty similar and probably the same audience turned out twice.</div><div id="00:01:26.680" class="transcript_line"> But the first venue was more suited in the surroundings and the fact that the band was happier there than they were at the Roundabout.</div><div id="00:01:38.680" class="transcript_line"> The Jam was the best band I&#039;d put on. The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful.</div><div id="00:01:42.680" class="transcript_line"> They were electric, they were, you know, for a three piece.</div><div id="00:01:45.680" class="transcript_line"> They had high energy, full on.</div><div id="00:01:48.680" class="transcript_line"> The crowd was loving it. Probably the best atmosphere out of all the bands that I had in those at the Roundabout.</div><div id="00:01:54.680" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately though there was a little incident towards the end.</div><div id="00:01:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Some of their equipment got pinched and the police was called in and I&#039;m not quite sure what was missing, an amplifier or something.</div><div id="00:02:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not sure if it was retrieved or not even.</div><div id="00:02:09.680" class="transcript_line"> But someone went in to see the band and I had to leave the room a bit quick because there was a few ladies in the room.</div><div id="00:02:18.680" class="transcript_line"> With the boys and they had to call back ten minutes later.</div><div id="00:02:22.680" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t seem too bothered, it was more down to the father who managed the band.</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> The father of, was it Weller&#039;s father? One of the boys&#039; father managed the band.</div><div id="00:02:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And he was more concerned about sorting out the problem.</div><div id="00:02:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And I left it to him and the police really because I didn&#039;t know anything about it except the fact that it happened, you know.</div><div id="00:02:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Typical of Newport though.</div><div id="00:02:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Well another gig that I put on was that crazy guy from America, Wayne County, before he came to Jane County.</div><div id="00:02:57.680" class="transcript_line"> He was in the process of going through the hormone treatment and I had him at the Alexandria Club.</div><div id="00:03:02.680" class="transcript_line"> He was doing one of his songs called Toilet Love or something, whatever.</div><div id="00:03:06.680" class="transcript_line"> And he had his trousers down around his ankles and he was sending the whiteboard bum and everything that with toilet paper.</div><div id="00:03:12.680" class="transcript_line"> And one of the ladies of the night came out of the toilet and seen him and she was a bit, I gassed about it all a bit.</div><div id="00:03:19.680" class="transcript_line"> She was like, blah blah blah blah. And he threw the toilet paper at her.</div><div id="00:03:23.680" class="transcript_line"> She went swinging his handbag at him.</div><div id="00:03:26.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was just a kerfuffle about nothing and whatever but it was quite a funny moment.</div><div id="00:03:32.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember when I was doing a gig at the St. Morris Church Hall.</div><div id="00:03:37.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the band but the band that I had booked didn&#039;t turn up.</div><div id="00:03:41.680" class="transcript_line"> So I say to the crowd that did turn up, I played extra time.</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> Next thing I know I&#039;m playing Edgar Bolton&#039;s Out Demons Out.</div><div id="00:03:50.680" class="transcript_line"> And then through the mist I seen the priest from the cathedral come marching into the hall.</div><div id="00:03:57.680" class="transcript_line"> Robes flowing with Edgar Bolton blasting Out Demons Out.</div><div id="00:04:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And I looked at my watch and I was like, oh shit.</div><div id="00:04:05.680" class="transcript_line"> He was like half an hour later than I should have been.</div><div id="00:04:08.680" class="transcript_line"> He came up and said, you&#039;re playing extra time, we&#039;ve had complaints about the noise, blah blah blah.</div><div id="00:04:14.680" class="transcript_line"> And I thought it was just hilarious that he should come in at that particular time and give me a bolligan.</div><div id="00:04:22.680" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s another time where two bands turned up at the St. Wallace Hall.</div><div id="00:04:27.680" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the band that I had booked but I do know that another band turned up called Gentle Giant.</div><div id="00:04:33.680" class="transcript_line"> They were a brilliant band. They made one album I believe back in the late 60s.</div><div id="00:04:39.680" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d been double booked by the agent in London.</div><div id="00:04:45.680" class="transcript_line"> And so I explained and they were quite happy to accept it.</div><div id="00:04:51.680" class="transcript_line"> It was the agent&#039;s fault.</div><div id="00:04:53.680" class="transcript_line"> But I did say that come on board and let&#039;s see what can be done and we&#039;ll split the money and whatever.</div><div id="00:04:59.680" class="transcript_line"> But they said the stage was too small to get their equipment on and the other band.</div><div id="00:05:04.680" class="transcript_line"> So it works either way. It&#039;s just show business. Shit happens.</div><div id="00:05:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Well my biggest claim to fame is the fact that I brought Cherry Vanellaton who bought.</div><div id="00:05:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And she&#039;s a lady from America.</div><div id="00:05:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Well that night, yes, she did bring the police with her to use as a backing band I believe.</div><div id="00:05:25.680" class="transcript_line"> It was the first ever British gig.</div><div id="00:05:28.680" class="transcript_line"> She couldn&#039;t afford to bring her own band over.</div><div id="00:05:31.680" class="transcript_line"> I believe the guitarist came with them.</div><div id="00:05:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And the police was looking for work and she was looking for British musicians.</div><div id="00:05:39.680" class="transcript_line"> So the police came with her.</div><div id="00:05:41.680" class="transcript_line"> The police didn&#039;t have their sound at the time.</div><div id="00:05:44.680" class="transcript_line"> They was like a jazz trio.</div><div id="00:05:47.680" class="transcript_line"> And they went on that night and played first.</div><div id="00:05:51.680" class="transcript_line"> And then Cherry came on with the guitarist and they all played together.</div><div id="00:05:55.680" class="transcript_line"> She went off. The police came on and did another little set, another little jazz set.</div><div id="00:06:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And then to finish it off, Cherry came back on and the police finished off the evening.</div><div id="00:06:06.680" class="transcript_line"> They just had their single out called Fall Out.</div><div id="00:06:10.680" class="transcript_line"> But they couldn&#039;t get much work on anything like that.</div><div id="00:06:13.680" class="transcript_line"> The Argus wouldn&#039;t advertise them as known.</div><div id="00:06:15.680" class="transcript_line"> They said we can&#039;t advertise that the police are going to be appearing at some club tonight.</div><div id="00:06:20.680" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ll have the chief constable down our neck.</div><div id="00:06:23.680" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t put them on the poster because basically they were just a backing band.</div><div id="00:06:28.680" class="transcript_line"> I paid her around a pound that night.</div><div id="00:06:30.680" class="transcript_line"> She paid the band, the police, 15 quid.</div><div id="00:06:34.680" class="transcript_line"> And they backed her on the first tour.</div><div id="00:06:38.680" class="transcript_line"> But Newport was the first date.</div><div id="00:06:41.680" class="transcript_line"> And it was their first ever gig.</div><div id="00:06:50.680" class="transcript_line"> .</div></div></p>
