    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name&#039;s Jamie Baker and I&#039;m from the Horn Development Association, HDA, which is a project</div><div id="00:00:08.800" class="transcript_line"> in Cardiff that works with local communities and in this case working with Heritage, the</div><div id="00:00:18.680" class="transcript_line"> history of black and minority people in Cardiff, focusing on the 1919 race riots, which we</div><div id="00:00:27.280" class="transcript_line"> call the Year of Revolt. Hopefully you&#039;ll grasp that as we go forward. We&#039;re funded</div><div id="00:00:32.960" class="transcript_line"> by the Heritage Fund in Wales. Up to now we&#039;ve developed a number of projects. We&#039;ve managed</div><div id="00:00:40.160" class="transcript_line"> to create databases and we&#039;re glad to share those databases where it will advance knowledge</div><div id="00:00:47.160" class="transcript_line"> and help people undertaking their own family research. Those databases are number one,</div><div id="00:00:53.280" class="transcript_line"> 1900 Somalian Yemeni seamen that served on the UK Merchant Navy, 1918 to 21. 50% of those</div><div id="00:01:02.960" class="transcript_line"> have pictures. Number two, every Welsh-born or Welsh-based seaman that died in World War</div><div id="00:01:08.080" class="transcript_line"> II on the UK Merchant Navy. Three, every Caribbean-born seaman that died on the UK Merchant Navy</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> in World War II. And number four, every Arab seaman that&#039;s from the Gulf of Aden. So Yemeni,</div><div id="00:01:23.680" class="transcript_line"> Yemen, Djibouti, Somalia, etc. as we now see them that died on the UK Merchant Navy in World War II.</div><div id="00:01:31.360" class="transcript_line"> Now we&#039;re going to be undertaking some work which is part of nine months funding from the Heritage</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Fund focusing on the race riots in 1919 in Wales. But to understand them we believe you&#039;ve got to</div><div id="00:01:46.960" class="transcript_line"> link them to UK and worldwide events. The project will be number one to try and show the full</div><div id="00:01:52.960" class="transcript_line"> context of the events in Wales, UK and worldwide. Two, to train volunteers. This is always central</div><div id="00:02:00.960" class="transcript_line"> to what we do. Three, enable local communities to tell their stories about how the families</div><div id="00:02:07.160" class="transcript_line"> were affected by the events. Four, tell the story in as available and approachable a way as possible</div><div id="00:02:14.600" class="transcript_line"> using podcasts, YouTube channel and People&#039;s Collection Wales, Facebook and our own website.</div><div id="00:02:22.520" class="transcript_line"> Five, the podcast will be weekly and our hope is that this will enable us to interview people</div><div id="00:02:28.360" class="transcript_line"> from all over the world. The intention is to show the global context. And six, never easy,</div><div id="00:02:37.400" class="transcript_line"> involve education. Now the race riots in the UK started in January in 1919 in Brumelaw Street,</div><div id="00:02:47.480" class="transcript_line"> Glasgow outside the signing on office where Merchant Seaman signed on to get a ship. And in</div><div id="00:02:54.440" class="transcript_line"> February it was in South Shields that largely involved Yemeni and Somali Merchant Seaman who</div><div id="00:03:01.320" class="transcript_line"> were the victims. In March it was a brief fracas in Salford in England. In April it was East London</div><div id="00:03:10.040" class="transcript_line"> where the Chinese were the major victims of the attacks. 5th of June it was Liverpool in England</div><div id="00:03:18.120" class="transcript_line"> where we had eight days of attacks against black people by a white mob and all of these riots</div><div id="00:03:26.440" class="transcript_line"> were white mobs attacking black and minority people. In Liverpool the most notable and for</div><div id="00:03:31.960" class="transcript_line"> many people was the event of Charles Wooden being pursued by a crowd of thousands beaten and thrown</div><div id="00:03:38.760" class="transcript_line"> into the River Mersey to drown. 6th of June was when it started in Wales in Newport and then on</div><div id="00:03:46.200" class="transcript_line"> the 11th of June it had started in Barry and Cardiff. Now the role of the press in 1919 was</div><div id="00:03:54.600" class="transcript_line"> there was no radio that was 1926 it started the BBC or TV the BBC started in 1936 and the press</div><div id="00:04:03.720" class="transcript_line"> set their position on what was happening in Wales. The riots in Barry according to the press started</div><div id="00:04:10.280" class="transcript_line"> because quote the black way laid him Fred Longman seized him by the throat pinned him against the</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> wall and stabbed him under the heart. In Newport the riots started because quote a coloured man</div><div id="00:04:22.680" class="transcript_line"> accosted a white woman and a soldier intervened. The Cardiff riots were said to have started</div><div id="00:04:27.320" class="transcript_line"> because quote blacks in a superior number set upon a lone white man unquote. So the tone was set</div><div id="00:04:35.480" class="transcript_line"> blacks are the aggressors and the child&#039;s game of whispers begins to be followed by exaggeration.</div><div id="00:04:42.200" class="transcript_line"> Now a constant theme during this period and previously and also right up until the middle</div><div id="00:04:49.800" class="transcript_line"> of the period after the Second World War was sex and protection of the white race was always</div><div id="00:04:57.720" class="transcript_line"> part of the mob&#039;s chance and justification during 1919. This is a quote from the chief constable of</div><div id="00:05:04.920" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff at the time which may say much more about him than it does about the actual context but</div><div id="00:05:10.760" class="transcript_line"> nonetheless white flannels are more revealing than corduroys and make black men more attractive to</div><div id="00:05:17.400" class="transcript_line"> white girls, Cardiff girls, who should not be allowed to admire such beasts. This was the</div><div id="00:05:23.880" class="transcript_line"> sight of black men playing cricket in a church league. However there was nothing light-hearted</div><div id="00:05:30.680" class="transcript_line"> about the quotes that were also in the press. The chief constable again, the coloured seamen who live</div><div id="00:05:38.520" class="transcript_line"> in our midst are not imbued with our moral code and have not assimilated our conventions. They</div><div id="00:05:45.240" class="transcript_line"> come into contact with the female sex of the white race and their progeny are half-caste with</div><div id="00:05:51.800" class="transcript_line"> the vicious hereditary taint of their parents. A theme picked up by the western male newspaper.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> The sex problem, black men with white women, which obtrudes upon the matter is one with which the</div><div id="00:06:05.400" class="transcript_line"> legislative is unlikely to interfere. Such consorting is ill-assorting. It exhibits either</div><div id="00:06:12.520" class="transcript_line"> a depravity or a squalid infatuation. It is repugnant to our finer instincts in which pride of race</div><div id="00:06:20.360" class="transcript_line"> occupies a just and inevitable place. The only answer at the time from the British government</div><div id="00:06:26.840" class="transcript_line"> of Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his minister Winston Churchill was repatriation of</div><div id="00:06:33.800" class="transcript_line"> the black and other races back to their countries of origin and they offered them, the repatriates,</div><div id="00:06:41.720" class="transcript_line"> two to five pound plus five pound when they landed back home. However, according to those who were</div><div id="00:06:49.720" class="transcript_line"> repatriated and sailed on the SS Orca, they never received the money. An estimated three thousand</div><div id="00:06:56.040" class="transcript_line"> were repatriated from the UK, including 200 from Cardiff who were put on a boat in Plymouth.</div><div id="00:07:03.080" class="transcript_line"> According to some writers and academics, the riots were caused by unemployment and poverty.</div><div id="00:07:09.480" class="transcript_line"> Well, that may be so in their eyes, but how does that explain the over-brutalization of white women</div><div id="00:07:17.320" class="transcript_line"> who were stripped and beaten by the mob if it was discovered they were in any kind of relationship</div><div id="00:07:25.080" class="transcript_line"> with a black man? The lies published by the press. The fact that the reason the number of</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> black and minority people had increased in Cardiff, etc. was because Britain had asked them to come</div><div id="00:07:38.200" class="transcript_line"> as they were needed during the war. The only solution offered, as I said, was repatriation.</div><div id="00:07:44.200" class="transcript_line"> Brutal events across the world that year cannot be explained by unemployment and poverty,</div><div id="00:07:49.960" class="transcript_line"> such as the Amritsar massacre in the Punjab in India, legislation to stop freedom of expression</div><div id="00:07:57.800" class="transcript_line"> in India and the wave of 37 riots, racial attacks and lynchings being part of them, across America</div><div id="00:08:07.080" class="transcript_line"> known as the Red Summer. But in a state of political unrest nationally in the UK,</div><div id="00:08:13.160" class="transcript_line"> what happened in places where there were no black or other minorities to blame? Well,</div><div id="00:08:17.720" class="transcript_line"> there was still violence and politicians were blamed. For example, Luton Town Hall was burnt</div><div id="00:08:24.760" class="transcript_line"> down in July 1919. Let&#039;s move forward very briefly. Can it happen again? First, there is a need for</div><div id="00:08:31.880" class="transcript_line"> ammunition, then the confidence that, quote, you are on the side of the right, and then there is</div><div id="00:08:37.640" class="transcript_line"> the mob. Well, the UK has had a referendum to decide whether it would be part of the European</div><div id="00:08:44.840" class="transcript_line"> Union or it would be totally independent. And the newspaper headlines that, as we considered whether</div><div id="00:08:52.360" class="transcript_line"> to leave Europe, well, some of those have been the subject of press complaints investigations.</div><div id="00:08:58.120" class="transcript_line"> And since 2015-16, when these press were covering and encouraging people to leave Europe,</div><div id="00:09:07.640" class="transcript_line"> there has been a 10% increase in racial discrimination, according to surveys,</div><div id="00:09:12.600" class="transcript_line"> and a significant rise in all types of hate crime, from attacks on disabled people through to</div><div id="00:09:19.320" class="transcript_line"> attacks on lesbian, gay and trans people. Just to quote some headlines,</div><div id="00:09:26.440" class="transcript_line"> The Sun, November 2015, one in five British Muslims have sympathy for jihadis.</div><div id="00:09:34.360" class="transcript_line"> The Daily Express, July 2016, migrant crisis, sort it now, new home secretary urged to get grip</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> on borders. The Daily Star, Sunday, 4th of September 2016, one of the most infamous murderers</div><div id="00:09:52.200" class="transcript_line"> in Britain&#039;s history, the Yorkshire Ripper, Sutcliffe, his surname was, was mentioned.</div><div id="00:09:58.200" class="transcript_line"> Yorkshire Ripper turns to Islam. Muslims protect Sutcliffe in jail. The Daily Express, 3rd of August</div><div id="00:10:06.280" class="transcript_line"> 2016, EU&#039;s migrant crisis is colossal. The Express website, 23rd of May 2016, the National Health</div><div id="00:10:15.880" class="transcript_line"> Service will be 10 billion in the red in three years time, creaking under weight of migrants.</div><div id="00:10:22.280" class="transcript_line"> Daily Express, 16th of May 2016, soaring cost of teaching migrant children, £3 billion bill,</div><div id="00:10:31.000" class="transcript_line"> another reason to quit EU. The Daily Express, 12th of November 2015, 75% of new jobs go to EU</div><div id="00:10:41.320" class="transcript_line"> migrants in one year. Mail online, report shows the NHS is nearly at breaking point as massive</div><div id="00:10:48.520" class="transcript_line"> influx of EU migrants forces doctors to take on 1.5 million extra patients in just three years</div><div id="00:10:57.400" class="transcript_line"> and migrants spark housing crisis. Now many of those comments were investigated by the</div><div id="00:11:06.600" class="transcript_line"> Press Complaints Authority and some were found to be based upon no facts at all and some were</div><div id="00:11:13.320" class="transcript_line"> found to be based upon facts that actually didn&#039;t say what the paper said. Retractions in the British</div><div id="00:11:22.680" class="transcript_line"> press are never made on the front page so page seven, page eight, etc you would see an apology</div><div id="00:11:31.240" class="transcript_line"> some time later. Now one of the questions we&#039;ve been asked is why does forgotten</div><div id="00:11:36.040" class="transcript_line"> history need to be told? This is a quote from Martin Nymuller that I was taught when I was a child.</div><div id="00:11:44.680" class="transcript_line"> First they came for the communists and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a communist.</div><div id="00:11:50.200" class="transcript_line"> Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a trade unionist.</div><div id="00:11:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And then they came for the Jews and I didn&#039;t speak out because I wasn&#039;t a Jew.</div><div id="00:12:01.480" class="transcript_line"> And then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me,</div><div id="00:12:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Pastor Martin Nymuller. And as Edmund Burke said, those who don&#039;t know history are destined to</div><div id="00:12:15.560" class="transcript_line"> repeat it. Now many stories are forgotten by history and ignored in our classrooms. Hopefully</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> by telling this story in more detail over eight or nine months we can show the global picture of</div><div id="00:12:29.240" class="transcript_line"> the First World War and the allies fear of revolution. How that affected non-white people</div><div id="00:12:36.680" class="transcript_line"> globally and how that affected Wales. It is important to understand fear of communism</div><div id="00:12:45.720" class="transcript_line"> and Bolshevik uprising and the trade unions and for the first time a potential global perspective</div><div id="00:12:57.400" class="transcript_line"> amongst ordinary people, particularly those who were working people and soldiers, merchant navy,</div><div id="00:13:07.000" class="transcript_line"> etc. who were returning from war was a common concern across all of the democratic nations.</div><div id="00:13:19.880" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jamie Baker. I represent HDA Cardiff and this was recorded in June 2019,</div><div id="00:13:27.480" class="transcript_line"> which is the anniversary month of the riots in Wales. We will follow this with a number of</div><div id="00:13:36.840" class="transcript_line"> related stories which will be more detailed about individual events and individual places.</div><div id="00:13:44.040" class="transcript_line"> Hopefully you&#039;ll contact us if there is a part of this story you can contribute to. Thank you.</div></div></p>
