I don&#039;t know the story behind that.</div><div id="00:00:47.440" class="transcript_line"> He qualified as a doctor and went off to the South Pacific, to Fiji, to become a district</div><div id="00:00:57.440" class="transcript_line"> medical officer. He travelled throughout the Middle East. He came back to this country.</div><div id="00:01:08.320" class="transcript_line"> He did his FRCS in Edinburgh.</div><div id="00:01:10.880" class="transcript_line"> He did his FRCS in Edinburgh.</div><div id="00:01:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Then did general practice in London.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And when the war broke out, he joined up and he served in North Africa, where he was captured</div><div id="00:01:30.560" class="transcript_line"> at the siege of Tobruk. He escaped from prisoner of war camp and nearly made it</div><div id="00:01:37.760" class="transcript_line"> to Switzerland, but was captured on the border.</div><div id="00:01:43.040" class="transcript_line"> He escaped again and was caught. And when Italy surrendered in 1943,</div><div id="00:01:52.320" class="transcript_line"> he wasn&#039;t in the southern part of Italy, he was in the northern part where the Germans were,</div><div id="00:01:59.200" class="transcript_line"> and they were taking him to prisoner of war camp somewhere and he escaped from that.</div><div id="00:02:05.840" class="transcript_line"> And he could have made it back to Allied lines, but he heard that the partisans in the Yugoslav</div><div id="00:02:10.800" class="transcript_line"> mountains needed medical help. So he went there and ran field hospitals and the Germans bombed</div><div id="00:02:23.200" class="transcript_line"> one of them and he was caught in a blast and suffered injuries from which he died.</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got letters in the files to describe what sort of person he was and how he looked after the</div><div id="00:02:37.600" class="transcript_line"> partisans. So you wrote an article about this for Bimmer? Yes, I did. What was the origin? How did</div><div id="00:02:46.160" class="transcript_line"> you come to write the article? I had a letter from a social historian in Oxford who had, he&#039;d put an</div><div id="00:02:55.520" class="transcript_line"> advert in the Jewish Chronicle. He was doing research into what medical officers did in the war</div><div id="00:03:05.440" class="transcript_line"> and a relative of mine in London got hold of him and put him in touch with my aunt who lived in</div><div id="00:03:12.160" class="transcript_line"> Bournemouth, that was the widow of my father&#039;s younger brother, and from there he got put in</div><div id="00:03:20.800" class="transcript_line"> touch with me. So you helped fill in that part of the story? Yes, yes. And also produced the article as well? That&#039;s right.</div></div></p>
