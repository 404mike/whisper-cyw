    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How did your football career progress then after not being the goalie for Merthyr?</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Fine. Played for the school team in Cantonian.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Also played for the rugby team as well the first fifteen.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> But I reckon it was because when I was seventeen I was the only one who had a car.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So rather than pick somebody else and have to get everybody over there on a bus,</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> they took advantage of me being able to ferry because rugby wasn&#039;t my sport.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But I ended up playing for Cardiff Schools as a goalkeeper apart from the school team.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And you played for the Maccabees as well?</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was fortunate enough to play for Great Britain Maccabee as well in various tournaments,</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> be them in London, Brussels.</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell me about the Maccabee team in Cardiff then?</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had a Maccabee team.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to play on a Sunday in the Sunday league.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think originally played just friendlies.</div><div id="00:01:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And then had the opportunity of participating in the Maccabee league in London,</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> which was very onerous. It was the days before the M4 was built.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And every fortnight we would go up to London and play in very good places like Hackney Marshes.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Very joyous. But they were great, great fun.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And that lasted for about four or five years.</div><div id="00:01:35.000" class="transcript_line"> How did you get to London?</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> On a coach, on a coach.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And it wasn&#039;t just London, there was a team south end and Brighton were in it as well.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite a long day to say the least. But great fun.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were just playing on Sundays?</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very much so. Just on Sunday.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a professional manager at that time?</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. All different ones. Cardiff City players. Quite a number, well known at the time.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a guy called Ronnie Bird, a very good favourite of the Jewish community.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Steve Derrott, who ended up playing for Wales.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> A guy called Roger Hoy.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We ensured that if we had a coach, he had to be one of the professionals at Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know how Maccabi&#039;s club was run? Who organised it, who ran it?</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well in the end, me to a certain extent.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But initially when I played, I was one of the youngest playing.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had a Jewish manager, Leslie Feldman, apart from the coaches.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t have any club premises as such.</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was all phone calls or meetings in people&#039;s houses.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> But it ran and it was on a shoestring. But good fun.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen the minutes when a Maccabi club, there was a reference in there to an altercation between a manager and a referee.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Apparently so, yes.</div><div id="00:03:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you around at that time?</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Vaguely.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I was on the outside at the time, I think it was only 14 or 15.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was a little bit young to be involved with it.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> But what I do remember is that his behaviour wasn&#039;t acceptable.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was sacked from being our manager, which considering he wasn&#039;t paid, it was a bit of a financial loss to him.</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> On another theme, on a personal basis, what interesting happened with me was we had this one manager, Ronnie Byrd, who played for what was known as the charity team made up of exporting people.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And on one Sunday morning we&#039;re playing a local Maccabi game now in the local Sunday league.</div><div id="00:04:17.000" class="transcript_line"> He had to go off because he&#039;s playing this football match against, I&#039;m not quite sure, anyway he was playing for this, ex-professionals etc.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And when I got home from playing our game, my wife told me there was a phone call from Ronnie, they needed a goalkeeper, would I go and help out?</div><div id="00:04:39.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went down to this local private pitch and there were people there like Barry John and Gareth Edwards, ex-Wales rugby internationals.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was asked to play with them.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember the match was kicked off by a girl called Helen Morgan who had previous year been from Pernaf who was the current Miss World, although she got sacked from it because it transpired.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> She was an unmarried mother and that went against the rules.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But following from that, I regularly played for a couple of years while this team still existed.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I was the non-famous one who engulfed for them playing with people like Gareth Edwards, Tommy David, Barry John, Lyn Davies, Lyn O&#039;Leep.</div><div id="00:05:36.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a wonderful experience but highly embarrassing when people would walk up to me and say, can I have your autograph, who are you?</div><div id="00:05:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But that was the highlight of my football career.</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was charity matches.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Very much so, yes.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me about how you got to play for the National Maccabee team.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We played in the Maccabee League and we had a particular Maccabee Cup game one year where we played a team called NAL, Maccabee Association of London, from London.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> We played them in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Their manager happened to be the manager of the National Maccabee team, a guy called Barnett, John Barnett.</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Although we lost 5-1 in Maccabee, I also played outfield.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a defender as well, apart from a goalkeeper.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I was playing centre half that day and he saw me.</div><div id="00:06:35.000" class="transcript_line"> He had me selected for the national team, which was a great honour and great fun.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> In fact it was quite unique because the first international tournament we went to in Brussels, the team was made up of MAL players, his team and Scottish players in the main, and me as well.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was good.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Who would they play then, the national team? They were playing competitions?</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we played that European tournament. In fact one year we won it, playing teams from all over Europe.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The other Jewish teams?</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh very much so, yes.</div></div></p>
