    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the Venetians are taking a few of these phrases.</div><div id="00:00:02.800" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ll just mention a few of these terms, if I may.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> In a word which is very often used in the Welsh is top,</div><div id="00:00:09.920" class="transcript_line"> which is what I am for being up here.</div><div id="00:00:12.400" class="transcript_line"> That means being silly.</div><div id="00:00:14.920" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I&#039;ve taken a real fancy to her, they go, and...</div><div id="00:00:19.720" class="transcript_line"> She was out there like a winky.</div><div id="00:00:22.200" class="transcript_line"> These are terms which they use,</div><div id="00:00:23.600" class="transcript_line"> and of course you have to understand these connotations.</div><div id="00:00:27.400" class="transcript_line"> For example, it&#039;s the last thing I am now,</div><div id="00:00:29.760" class="transcript_line"> but when somebody is excited, they say,</div><div id="00:00:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, he&#039;s over the moon, he is.</div><div id="00:00:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Ha!</div><div id="00:00:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Shukum rynchid.</div><div id="00:00:40.160" class="transcript_line"> A real blemmer.</div><div id="00:00:42.160" class="transcript_line"> Waretig, waretig.</div><div id="00:00:44.560" class="transcript_line"> We should be fair play in Welsh.</div><div id="00:00:46.160" class="transcript_line"> These are words which cover the language here,</div><div id="00:00:49.160" class="transcript_line"> catryl and gwa&#039;dab and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:00:52.360" class="transcript_line"> The one with the kind of term which would...</div><div id="00:00:55.760" class="transcript_line"> One of the ones which I really take a fancy to is that</div><div id="00:00:59.360" class="transcript_line"> the kind of thing when somebody asks you,</div><div id="00:01:01.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, how&#039;s your sister?</div><div id="00:01:03.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very poor.</div><div id="00:01:04.960" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s under the doctor, she is.</div><div id="00:01:06.960" class="transcript_line"> Ha!</div><div id="00:01:15.360" class="transcript_line"> It strikes me as a sure case of malpractice, eh?</div><div id="00:01:18.360" class="transcript_line"> Ha!</div><div id="00:01:22.160" class="transcript_line"> When a little boy was asked why he...</div><div id="00:01:24.960" class="transcript_line"> He was given some seeds by his teacher,</div><div id="00:01:28.360" class="transcript_line"> and he was asked where he planted them, he says,</div><div id="00:01:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I planted them down my gran&#039;s back.</div><div id="00:01:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Ha!</div><div id="00:01:35.560" class="transcript_line"> This is not a reference to some senior citizens or manomy folks,</div><div id="00:01:39.560" class="transcript_line"> it means that he&#039;s talking about in the backyard,</div><div id="00:01:42.160" class="transcript_line"> but this is the kind of language they have.</div><div id="00:01:44.160" class="transcript_line"> God knows what happens when the local council comes and digs up gran&#039;s front.</div><div id="00:01:48.960" class="transcript_line"> Ha!</div><div id="00:01:53.760" class="transcript_line"> There is...</div><div id="00:01:55.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s also, you know, in the...</div><div id="00:01:57.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lovely...</div><div id="00:02:00.760" class="transcript_line"> The language has got some lovely Welsh words in it.</div><div id="00:02:04.760" class="transcript_line"> I wonder how many of you here remember the word, kuch?</div><div id="00:02:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Kuch.</div><div id="00:02:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Kuch in Wales, in South Wales particularly, has four delightful meanings,</div><div id="00:02:16.760" class="transcript_line"> as John Edwards goes to some pains to explain in his tape.</div><div id="00:02:20.760" class="transcript_line"> He says, kuch under...</div><div id="00:02:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Kuch, do you remember the kuch under the star?</div><div id="00:02:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Where you used to store stuff?</div><div id="00:02:27.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a lot of heads, not in a way, folks.</div><div id="00:02:30.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s the kuch it away, keep it safe.</div><div id="00:02:34.760" class="transcript_line"> I used to say to the dog, remember, she was a faithful dog, kuch!</div><div id="00:02:38.760" class="transcript_line"> And the dog would come to heel.</div><div id="00:02:40.760" class="transcript_line"> But you know, the most beautiful kuch of all</div><div id="00:02:44.760" class="transcript_line"> was when you used to kuch up to your man.</div><div id="00:02:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Back in Wales, if you thought you were going to love folks,</div><div id="00:02:50.760" class="transcript_line"> you don&#039;t know what you&#039;ve missed.</div><div id="00:02:53.760" class="transcript_line"> In Wales, traditionally, I remember as a child,</div><div id="00:02:56.760" class="transcript_line"> whenever I used to fall and graze my knees,</div><div id="00:02:59.760" class="transcript_line"> I used to come and kuch up to me gran.</div><div id="00:03:01.760" class="transcript_line"> And kuching up to my gran meant you&#039;d put in a shawl</div><div id="00:03:06.760" class="transcript_line"> and wrapped around, and there you were.</div><div id="00:03:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Away from the world&#039;s worries and cares,</div><div id="00:03:12.760" class="transcript_line"> there you were, kuched up to your gran.</div><div id="00:03:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t that marvelous, wasn&#039;t it, eh?</div><div id="00:03:16.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s why we&#039;ve always grown up with a smile on our face.</div><div id="00:03:19.760" class="transcript_line"> I must admit, when I got on into little life,</div><div id="00:03:22.760" class="transcript_line"> I learned that you could kuch at other things too.</div><div id="00:03:32.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s also an aspect of wanglish,</div><div id="00:03:35.760" class="transcript_line"> which is the gross overuse of a word.</div><div id="00:03:38.760" class="transcript_line"> And one word which is grossly overused in Wales, of course, is tidy.</div><div id="00:03:44.760" class="transcript_line"> A conversation which John Edwards gives in his tapes is of this nature.</div><div id="00:04:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Or another one which he gives as well is but a gal being asked,</div><div id="00:04:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Tidy fellow, turn his hand to anything.</div><div id="00:04:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Makes the mind a bottle of everything.</div><div id="00:04:23.760" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d like to break away from wanglish</div><div id="00:04:26.760" class="transcript_line"> because I&#039;m of that peripheral region.</div><div id="00:04:30.760" class="transcript_line"> My ancestors actually came from, my father and mother came from Carmarthenshire.</div><div id="00:04:35.760" class="transcript_line"> And I was brought up to speak Welsh.</div><div id="00:04:38.760" class="transcript_line"> In actual fact, I was hospitalized when I was six in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:04:41.760" class="transcript_line"> I was there to find a nurse to translate from me because I couldn&#039;t speak in English.</div><div id="00:04:45.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s true, sorry, it&#039;s true.</div><div id="00:04:47.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s at the end of the part of Wales where I come from.</div><div id="00:04:50.760" class="transcript_line"> I was born in a farm in North of Swansea.</div><div id="00:04:53.760" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Swansea.</div><div id="00:04:56.760" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve almost got enough of a rugby side there, eh?</div><div id="00:05:02.760" class="transcript_line"> Just an aside before I come to the last things that I could do.</div><div id="00:05:06.760" class="transcript_line"> The farm we had, another aspect of Wales,</div><div id="00:05:10.760" class="transcript_line"> is that I was born in Cwm Cille Farm and our name was Thomas.</div><div id="00:05:14.760" class="transcript_line"> And therefore we went, Thomas Cwm Cille.</div><div id="00:05:17.760" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, all around us was Thomas Maes de Mawr,</div><div id="00:05:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Thomas Blank Cille, Thomas Fon de Vidman,</div><div id="00:05:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Thomas Ardors, Thomas Gwysigrond, Thomas Gwysidur,</div><div id="00:05:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Thomas Gwysigrond as well.</div><div id="00:05:32.760" class="transcript_line"> And you know, the incurious thing was, and really it&#039;s true honestly,</div><div id="00:05:36.760" class="transcript_line"> not one of us was interrelated and yet we were all Thomas&#039;</div><div id="00:05:40.760" class="transcript_line"> and really it&#039;s quite phenomenal.</div><div id="00:05:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Another local personage of Sir Stephen Wales,</div><div id="00:05:47.760" class="transcript_line"> actually a considerable Stephen Wales,</div><div id="00:05:49.760" class="transcript_line"> which we had was from a small village where I went to school,</div><div id="00:05:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Blackman Park, and he actually took his name,</div><div id="00:05:55.760" class="transcript_line"> and this will give you the clue of what we were referring to,</div><div id="00:05:58.760" class="transcript_line"> he actually took his name from the chapel where we went to as kids,</div><div id="00:06:02.760" class="transcript_line"> and to Croes.</div><div id="00:06:04.760" class="transcript_line"> Croes Williams was a local man, in actual fact his brother</div><div id="00:06:08.760" class="transcript_line"> used to repair the shoes for us, Thomas Williams the cleaver was a fellow.</div><div id="00:06:12.760" class="transcript_line"> And to conclude here, I don&#039;t know, maybe Bob would ask me later to come up</div><div id="00:06:16.760" class="transcript_line"> and do a Wenglish tale for you, but I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:06:18.760" class="transcript_line"> depends how much of that rain year I get in the Alba.</div><div id="00:06:22.760" class="transcript_line"> I do have one prepared, maybe later on.</div><div id="00:06:25.760" class="transcript_line"> But Croes Williams wrote many lovely delightful poems,</div><div id="00:06:30.760" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;d just like to finish by reading one of them,</div><div id="00:06:32.760" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s called William Treveen,</div><div id="00:06:34.760" class="transcript_line"> and it refers to of course the passage in time of a lot of things in Wales,</div><div id="00:06:40.760" class="transcript_line"> as there are in the West I suppose.</div><div id="00:07:42.760" class="transcript_line"> I hope that he worked in Bali, Akanmali, Malirtele, and Treveen, till then.</div></div></p>
