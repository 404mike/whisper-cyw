    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m David Ambrose. I work as a storyteller. I work as a promoter of storytelling. I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:00:13.360" class="transcript_line"> been an events promoter pretty much all my working life, with a deep interest in folklore,</div><div id="00:00:20.800" class="transcript_line"> folk song especially, but obviously folk stories. I&#039;ve got some Welsh background because</div><div id="00:00:27.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a Welsh mum born and brought up in Swansea and so she very much knew about the</div><div id="00:00:34.920" class="transcript_line"> Wasail tradition out on the gaur. So all of that has informed my storytelling and my singing.</div><div id="00:00:42.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to tell you a story. This is a story that I believe comes from the West Country,</div><div id="00:00:51.120" class="transcript_line"> but where I live on the coast, on the heritage coast as we now call it in the Vale of Glamorgan,</div><div id="00:00:57.320" class="transcript_line"> there are such strong links between that part of Wales and the West Country just across the water.</div><div id="00:01:03.720" class="transcript_line"> The Old Enemy as some of the old boys in my village still refer to England. You can see</div><div id="00:01:09.360" class="transcript_line"> it on a clear day. We don&#039;t get many of those, but you can see it. So this is a story from</div><div id="00:01:15.240" class="transcript_line"> there from Somerset. There was a farm and the farm was run by an old man and his two</div><div id="00:01:21.520" class="transcript_line"> sons. And then the time came, one midwinter, when the old man passed away. And so there</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> was a wake and there was a burial and then just before Christmas Eve the will was read out.</div><div id="00:01:38.280" class="transcript_line"> Now everybody knew really what the will was going to say because the old man didn&#039;t have</div><div id="00:01:45.000" class="transcript_line"> very much other than his fields and his farmhouse. And it was the custom in that place that that</div><div id="00:01:51.320" class="transcript_line"> time that it was the youngest who would inherit everything, inherited the property and the</div><div id="00:01:57.200" class="transcript_line"> oldest would get nothing. And so it was when the will was read out, the youngest brother</div><div id="00:02:03.640" class="transcript_line"> got the farmhouse and the fields and there was really nothing left for the eldest brother.</div><div id="00:02:10.080" class="transcript_line"> And the following morning, Christmas Eve, the youngest brother called his eldest brother</div><div id="00:02:14.160" class="transcript_line"> into the front room and he said, oh brother, what a sad day this is, eh? When you&#039;re going</div><div id="00:02:20.280" class="transcript_line"> to have to leave the family home, the home where you were born and brought up because</div><div id="00:02:24.760" class="transcript_line"> of course this is now mine. But I&#039;ll tell you what, you&#039;re my brother and I&#039;m not going</div><div id="00:02:30.520" class="transcript_line"> to see you out on your ear with no roof over your head. I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;m going to</div><div id="00:02:35.240" class="transcript_line"> do for you. Because you&#039;re my brother, I&#039;m going to let you stay in the old shepherd&#039;s</div><div id="00:02:39.600" class="transcript_line"> cottage. You know the one at the far end of our land, the other side of the hill? And</div><div id="00:02:43.320" class="transcript_line"> you can stay there for a whole year. And all I ask in return is in one year&#039;s time, you</div><div id="00:02:50.120" class="transcript_line"> give me a shilling for the rent. I can&#039;t say fairer than that. And the eldest brother,</div><div id="00:02:55.600" class="transcript_line"> he shook his head, but he knew it was what had to be. And so he went off and he packed</div><div id="00:03:00.160" class="transcript_line"> a few things that he owned and he put them in a bag. He slung his bag over his shoulder</div><div id="00:03:03.840" class="transcript_line"> and he walked over the hill and down. And the evening was already getting gloomy and</div><div id="00:03:08.880" class="transcript_line"> chilly by the time he stepped up to that old cottage. And he hadn&#039;t been there for a long</div><div id="00:03:13.560" class="transcript_line"> time. And I tell you, the years and the weather had not been kind to it. And the satch was</div><div id="00:03:19.320" class="transcript_line"> missing off the roof and the windows were broken and the front door was hanging off</div><div id="00:03:23.520" class="transcript_line"> its hinges. And he stepped inside and he picked his way across the rotten floorboards and</div><div id="00:03:29.520" class="transcript_line"> he went out into the backyard. Sheltering in the lee of an old apple tree, there was</div><div id="00:03:36.520" class="transcript_line"> a donkey and an ox, each side of the trunk of that tree. And he looked at the donkey</div><div id="00:03:42.920" class="transcript_line"> in the gathering gloom and he could see that the donkey had one leg up off the ground.</div><div id="00:03:47.600" class="transcript_line"> Looked in a bad way. And the fur of the donkey, it was mangy. And he looked at the ox and</div><div id="00:03:53.640" class="transcript_line"> the back of the ox, it was bending down, it didn&#039;t look good. And he looked at the tree</div><div id="00:03:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and the tree had three wizened old apples on it, each of them rotten. And the young</div><div id="00:04:04.920" class="transcript_line"> man, he turned back and he went into the house and he cleared the twigs and bits of dead</div><div id="00:04:09.720" class="transcript_line"> bird out of the grate and he managed to get a fire going and then he pulled his coat up</div><div id="00:04:14.400" class="transcript_line"> over himself and he went to sleep there on the floorboards. And the next morning he got</div><div id="00:04:19.400" class="transcript_line"> up and he knew what he was going to do. He walked out to the outskirts of the village,</div><div id="00:04:23.640" class="transcript_line"> up to the top of the hill where the wise old woman&#039;s cottage was. And he spoke to her and</div><div id="00:04:28.720" class="transcript_line"> he told her all his troubles. And she said, my son, listen to me. You look after those</div><div id="00:04:35.920" class="transcript_line"> beasts and those beasts will look after you. You&#039;ve got to restore their health with herbs.</div><div id="00:04:44.760" class="transcript_line"> And you will see what you will see. And if you do that, you will restore your own fortune.</div><div id="00:04:51.240" class="transcript_line"> So the young man, he took her advice. She told him which herbs to pick and what to do</div><div id="00:04:55.600" class="transcript_line"> with them, how to make them into a poultice. And day after day, he boiled up the herbs</div><div id="00:05:01.840" class="transcript_line"> and he applied the poultice to the donkey&#039;s fur and its gammy leg and he applied the hot</div><div id="00:05:08.360" class="transcript_line"> herby poultice to the back of the ox. And he did that all through the winter. By the</div><div id="00:05:13.960" class="transcript_line"> spring, well, you could see the difference because the donkey&#039;s fur, where it had been</div><div id="00:05:18.960" class="transcript_line"> mangy, it was now beginning to get a sleek gloss to it. And he began to put his leg down</div><div id="00:05:25.280" class="transcript_line"> on the ground, did the donkey. And the back of the ox that had been so bent down was</div><div id="00:05:30.560" class="transcript_line"> beginning to straighten up like a good sturdy oak tabletop. And not only that, but he was</div><div id="00:05:38.640" class="transcript_line"> coming back. Come May, the apple tree began to put out beautiful blossom because what</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> was happening was this, that poultice that the young man left on the ground after he</div><div id="00:05:49.200" class="transcript_line"> finished rubbing it into the ox and the donkey. Well, the ox and the donkey, they ate it.</div><div id="00:05:53.600" class="transcript_line"> And what goes in must come out. And that beautiful rich manure fed the roots of the apple tree</div><div id="00:06:01.600" class="transcript_line"> and now it was covered in sweet scented pink blossom. And come late summer, the branches</div><div id="00:06:08.960" class="transcript_line"> of the apple tree, they were bending down low, heavy with fruit. And the young man,</div><div id="00:06:15.040" class="transcript_line"> he picked that fruit and most of it he sold in the market, but some he kept for himself</div><div id="00:06:20.520" class="transcript_line"> and turned it into cider. And when the winter evenings drew in, he could light the fire,</div><div id="00:06:26.760" class="transcript_line"> he could pour himself a glass of his own cider and there he could sit and sup. And so it</div><div id="00:06:33.640" class="transcript_line"> came around to Christmas Eve. Just before Christmas Eve there&#039;s a knock at the door</div><div id="00:06:40.280" class="transcript_line"> and there&#039;s the youngest brother. Hello brother, how you doing, eh? I&#039;ve just come to remind</div><div id="00:06:46.280" class="transcript_line"> you about that little matter of the rent that you owe me. Tomorrow, a silver shilling, I</div><div id="00:06:52.640" class="transcript_line"> hope you&#039;ve got it. And the eldest brother said, well, I&#039;m sorry, you know, it&#039;s been</div><div id="00:06:57.320" class="transcript_line"> hard for me and I haven&#039;t got it. Can you let me off? Wow, brother, I thought it might</div><div id="00:07:03.280" class="transcript_line"> be like that. So I&#039;ll tell you what, I&#039;m going to make a bargain with you. You see, I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:07:09.600" class="transcript_line"> been talking to some of the old people in the village and they tell me that somewhere</div><div id="00:07:13.760" class="transcript_line"> around this cottage there&#039;s some treasure buried. And they also tell me that when you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:07:19.600" class="transcript_line"> got an ox and a donkey together on Christmas Eve, if you wait until the bells of midnight</div><div id="00:07:27.440" class="transcript_line"> start to ring out, you can hear what that ox and that donkey have to say to each other.</div><div id="00:07:33.920" class="transcript_line"> So brother, here&#039;s my proposal. Tomorrow night, Christmas Eve, you spend the night up at the</div><div id="00:07:40.240" class="transcript_line"> old farmhouse. I spend the night down here and I&#039;m going to listen to what your ox and</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> your donkey have to say about that buried treasure. And if you agree to that, I&#039;ll let</div><div id="00:07:51.920" class="transcript_line"> you off the rent. And the young man, once again, he just felt everything was against</div><div id="00:07:56.760" class="transcript_line"> him, but what else could he do but agree? And so the eldest brother, he&#039;s there in the</div><div id="00:08:01.720" class="transcript_line"> house, the youngest brother goes away up the hill, whistling, being very pleased with himself.</div><div id="00:08:06.320" class="transcript_line"> Eldest brother, he went to go over to the fire. Before he sat down, he poured himself</div><div id="00:08:11.680" class="transcript_line"> some cider and it was the very last drop and it was cloudy, but he lifted it up. He was</div><div id="00:08:17.960" class="transcript_line"> just about to drink when he remembered an old custom. And he went outside into the yard</div><div id="00:08:24.120" class="transcript_line"> and he stood under the clear glittering star-filled sky and he raised that glass up towards the</div><div id="00:08:31.840" class="transcript_line"> old apple tree. And he said, apple tree, apple tree, I will give back to thou what thou has</div><div id="00:08:41.360" class="transcript_line"> given to me. And let&#039;s have hatfuls and capfuls and three bushel bagfuls and little apples</div><div id="00:08:49.160" class="transcript_line"> under the stairs. Hip, hip, hooray. And with that, he poured that cider all around the</div><div id="00:08:56.240" class="transcript_line"> roots of the tree and he took away the empty glass and he started to walk back to the house,</div><div id="00:09:02.360" class="transcript_line"> to the cottage. And as he did so, from behind him, he heard a great big belch and he turned</div><div id="00:09:10.880" class="transcript_line"> around and he looked, but there was no one there. And he looked at the tree and he noticed</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> that the branches of the tree were beginning to bend down low to the ground and then rise</div><div id="00:09:21.520" class="transcript_line"> up and they bent down towards him three times. And when he looked again, he could see in</div><div id="00:09:29.480" class="transcript_line"> the folds of the trunk of the tree, something that looked like the face of an old man wrinkled</div><div id="00:09:39.800" class="transcript_line"> into a smile. And he said, apple tree, was that you? And the apple tree said, yes, it</div><div id="00:09:46.480" class="transcript_line"> was. And it&#039;s not every day that somebody gives me a taste of my own juice. Thank you</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> very much. You&#039;ve been good to me, I&#039;ll be good to you. Do you know what? If you were</div><div id="00:10:02.400" class="transcript_line"> dig down underneath my roots, you would find a great big box of treasure. And if I was</div><div id="00:10:09.840" class="transcript_line"> you, I&#039;d dig it up straight away and I&#039;d hide it somewhere where no one else could</div><div id="00:10:15.080" class="transcript_line"> find it. And the young man, he stood there amazed and he couldn&#039;t speak, but he had</div><div id="00:10:23.400" class="transcript_line"> heard and as he watched, it seemed to him that the face disappeared back into the trunk</div><div id="00:10:29.200" class="transcript_line"> of the tree and it was just a tree again. But he didn&#039;t hesitate. He turned, he went</div><div id="00:10:33.480" class="transcript_line"> back to the house, he got a spade, he began to dig and sure enough, the spade struck something</div><div id="00:10:37.160" class="transcript_line"> hard. There was the lid of a treasure chest. He broke it open, lifted the lid and it was</div><div id="00:10:42.720" class="transcript_line"> full of Roman gold. And he hefted that chest out of the ground and he hid it somewhere</div><div id="00:10:50.840" class="transcript_line"> very safe indeed. And then the next day, he went up to the big house and the youngest</div><div id="00:10:58.560" class="transcript_line"> brother came down and took his place behind the door, listening out for what the ox and</div><div id="00:11:05.680" class="transcript_line"> the donkey would have to say. And at the first stroke of midnight, when the church bells</div><div id="00:11:12.280" class="transcript_line"> all over the land began to ring out for Christmas Eve, this is what the youngest brother heard.</div><div id="00:11:20.500" class="transcript_line"> He heard the ox turn to the donkey and say, hello, donk, how you doing then? And the donkey</div><div id="00:11:28.940" class="transcript_line"> said to the ox, well, I&#039;m not too bad. I tell you what, the diet&#039;s improved, hasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:11:34.780" class="transcript_line"> So it has said the ox. And how you feeling, donk? How you doing? Well, I tell you what,</div><div id="00:11:41.900" class="transcript_line"> said the donkey, my leg, the articulation is right back in it. Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:11:48.700" class="transcript_line"> What about yourself, ox? Oh, said the ox, I&#039;m feeling so good. I&#039;m feeling so much better.</div><div id="00:11:55.260" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m feeling as strong as a, well, as strong as I&#039;ve ever felt. And I&#039;ll tell you</div><div id="00:12:01.700" class="transcript_line"> another thing, donkey, says the ox. If that fool behind the door thinks he&#039;s going to</div><div id="00:12:09.260" class="transcript_line"> hear any secrets from us, he&#039;s got another think coming. And with that, the last stroke</div><div id="00:12:18.460" class="transcript_line"> of midnight rang out and the ox and the donkey, they fell silent. And the youngest brother,</div><div id="00:12:27.460" class="transcript_line"> he walked away empty handed. But if he had looked and if he had seen, he might have noticed</div><div id="00:12:34.820" class="transcript_line"> just the faint trace of a wrinkled smile amongst the gnarled bark of the old apple tree. Three</div><div id="00:12:44.300" class="transcript_line"> golden apples fell from the sky. One for the one who told the story, one for those who</div><div id="00:12:51.820" class="transcript_line"> listened and one for those who came before so long ago, who they are we do not know.</div><div id="00:12:58.820" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the end of my story.</div></div></p>
