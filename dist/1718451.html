    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> but how did you organise those tapestries?</div><div id="00:00:03.840" class="transcript_line"> We had a general, there was a little working,</div><div id="00:00:09.920" class="transcript_line"> there was a little group of us who were sort of planning it.</div><div id="00:00:13.080" class="transcript_line"> We had an artist who lived at Broad Oak at the time,</div><div id="00:00:16.600" class="transcript_line"> Mary Strong, she was a brilliant artist.</div><div id="00:00:18.320" class="transcript_line"> And so we said, you know, let&#039;s do some,</div><div id="00:00:21.440" class="transcript_line"> cause I got some ideas and we needed everybody&#039;s input</div><div id="00:00:26.800" class="transcript_line"> to make it happen.</div><div id="00:00:29.100" class="transcript_line"> So we held an open event and just invited everybody</div><div id="00:00:34.300" class="transcript_line"> to come along who was interested.</div><div id="00:00:35.700" class="transcript_line"> And there was a lot of interest and we,</div><div id="00:00:38.820" class="transcript_line"> we probably had two or three of these.</div><div id="00:00:41.260" class="transcript_line"> One was sort of like the brainstorming session,</div><div id="00:00:44.020" class="transcript_line"> what sort of things should we put in, should we include?</div><div id="00:00:48.260" class="transcript_line"> And then we went away and did some sketches.</div><div id="00:00:52.620" class="transcript_line"> Jake did a lot of the sort of sketches as well.</div><div id="00:00:54.900" class="transcript_line"> Cause what we thought we needed to do was</div><div id="00:00:58.100" class="transcript_line"> put little packs together where people could just choose</div><div id="00:01:00.820" class="transcript_line"> what they wanted to do.</div><div id="00:01:03.020" class="transcript_line"> And it was open to everybody.</div><div id="00:01:04.980" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t dependent upon you being brilliant</div><div id="00:01:07.420" class="transcript_line"> with a needle and thread.</div><div id="00:01:09.040" class="transcript_line"> It was just, we wanted everybody to,</div><div id="00:01:11.160" class="transcript_line"> who wanted to get involved to be,</div><div id="00:01:13.020" class="transcript_line"> have an opportunity to be involved.</div><div id="00:01:15.060" class="transcript_line"> So we put together the drawing, the fabrics,</div><div id="00:01:20.380" class="transcript_line"> because of course we&#039;ve got this colour scheme going on</div><div id="00:01:22.380" class="transcript_line"> as well, which was seasonal.</div><div id="00:01:24.800" class="transcript_line"> And put more little packs.</div><div id="00:01:27.540" class="transcript_line"> And we did the first one and the last one, I think, first.</div><div id="00:01:32.260" class="transcript_line"> So we did the one with the monks</div><div id="00:01:34.740" class="transcript_line"> and the one with the village green.</div><div id="00:01:38.500" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, had an event in the village hall.</div><div id="00:01:43.860" class="transcript_line"> People would just, and I put,</div><div id="00:01:45.940" class="transcript_line"> I kind of tried to do a sketch of how I imagined</div><div id="00:01:48.660" class="transcript_line"> it would look, the size of it,</div><div id="00:01:51.060" class="transcript_line"> and then these sort of pictures on them.</div><div id="00:01:54.060" class="transcript_line"> So people just took, started taking them away.</div><div id="00:01:57.020" class="transcript_line"> And then they started coming back in.</div><div id="00:01:58.900" class="transcript_line"> Hugely exciting and, you know, beautiful pieces of work.</div><div id="00:02:02.740" class="transcript_line"> A lot of effort had been put in to,</div><div id="00:02:05.820" class="transcript_line"> people who hadn&#039;t got as much skill,</div><div id="00:02:07.620" class="transcript_line"> put as much time and effort into it.</div><div id="00:02:11.100" class="transcript_line"> And so they started to take shape.</div><div id="00:02:15.460" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d be meeting in the hall,</div><div id="00:02:19.980" class="transcript_line"> in Victoria&#039;s kitchen.</div><div id="00:02:21.820" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be, the slight core of us,</div><div id="00:02:23.900" class="transcript_line"> there must have been, I don&#039;t know,</div><div id="00:02:24.860" class="transcript_line"> about seven or eight, nine of us, maybe.</div><div id="00:02:28.180" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d be meeting every Tuesday evening in Victoria&#039;s kitchen.</div><div id="00:02:31.980" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a good excuse to have a nice glass of wine</div><div id="00:02:33.540" class="transcript_line"> and a chat, actually.</div><div id="00:02:34.380" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we did that.</div><div id="00:02:36.300" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think we did much by way of sewing,</div><div id="00:02:38.180" class="transcript_line"> but we were just having a nice little get together.</div><div id="00:02:40.460" class="transcript_line"> And that must have gone on for about two years,</div><div id="00:02:42.460" class="transcript_line"> I should think, because we got,</div><div id="00:02:46.500" class="transcript_line"> we got some help to sew it all together.</div><div id="00:02:48.860" class="transcript_line"> I think Val helped us to actually sew it all together.</div><div id="00:02:51.500" class="transcript_line"> Sew all the pieces together.</div><div id="00:02:52.780" class="transcript_line"> And the bits that were joining them,</div><div id="00:02:54.460" class="transcript_line"> we had ribbons and we had some lovely velvet ribbon.</div><div id="00:02:57.580" class="transcript_line"> It was really difficult to find ribbon the right width,</div><div id="00:03:02.460" class="transcript_line"> because I designed it to have this,</div><div id="00:03:07.620" class="transcript_line"> I think it was three inch ribbon,</div><div id="00:03:09.980" class="transcript_line"> not actually knowing that you couldn&#039;t get it anywhere.</div><div id="00:03:12.380" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t get ribbon that was three inches wide</div><div id="00:03:14.500" class="transcript_line"> for love nor money.</div><div id="00:03:16.260" class="transcript_line"> But while all this was going on,</div><div id="00:03:17.700" class="transcript_line"> I think we must have done a little press release</div><div id="00:03:19.780" class="transcript_line"> and somebody came to us,</div><div id="00:03:21.580" class="transcript_line"> I think it was the Prince&#039;s Trust came to us and said,</div><div id="00:03:23.620" class="transcript_line"> oh, I saw in the paper that you&#039;re doing this.</div><div id="00:03:25.700" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d like to, do you need any financial support?</div><div id="00:03:30.260" class="transcript_line"> I said, well, actually it would be really handy</div><div id="00:03:33.420" class="transcript_line"> to be able to buy some ribbon once we can find it</div><div id="00:03:37.900" class="transcript_line"> and maybe get it framed and pay a,</div><div id="00:03:45.540" class="transcript_line"> we needed help with various things anyway.</div><div id="00:03:48.580" class="transcript_line"> So we then had a little bit of money.</div><div id="00:03:50.460" class="transcript_line"> So I put this bit together to apply</div><div id="00:03:53.900" class="transcript_line"> and receive some money back.</div><div id="00:03:56.780" class="transcript_line"> And then found eventually after a lot of searching,</div><div id="00:04:00.580" class="transcript_line"> ribbon of the right size.</div><div id="00:04:02.020" class="transcript_line"> And it was velvet ribbon, it was beautiful ribbon,</div><div id="00:04:04.020" class="transcript_line"> but it was really expensive,</div><div id="00:04:05.420" class="transcript_line"> far more than I&#039;d anticipated in my little sort of like</div><div id="00:04:08.260" class="transcript_line"> calculations on the back of the fact packet type thing.</div><div id="00:04:11.380" class="transcript_line"> So I went back to the Prince&#039;s Trust and said,</div><div id="00:04:13.980" class="transcript_line"> actually this ribbon is a lot more expensive</div><div id="00:04:16.580" class="transcript_line"> than we budgeted for because we didn&#039;t realize</div><div id="00:04:18.740" class="transcript_line"> we couldn&#039;t find ribbon of the right size,</div><div id="00:04:20.500" class="transcript_line"> you know, in the local shop.</div><div id="00:04:22.460" class="transcript_line"> So we had to order it and bless them.</div><div id="00:04:25.140" class="transcript_line"> They said, oh, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:04:26.980" class="transcript_line"> We can accommodate that.</div><div id="00:04:28.700" class="transcript_line"> So we managed to get the ribbon that we wanted bought.</div><div id="00:04:32.900" class="transcript_line"> And if you go and see them, the colors</div><div id="00:04:35.580" class="transcript_line"> and the style of the ribbon is just absolutely beautiful.</div><div id="00:04:38.380" class="transcript_line"> And we only bought as much as we needed</div><div id="00:04:40.100" class="transcript_line"> because we haven&#039;t got any, because it was so expensive.</div><div id="00:04:45.300" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so that came, it was a company called VV Rulo.</div><div id="00:04:48.180" class="transcript_line"> I remember it vividly because Victoria found it</div><div id="00:04:50.700" class="transcript_line"> in one of her interior design magazines.</div><div id="00:04:54.500" class="transcript_line"> She, in all the adverts in the back of these sort of</div><div id="00:04:58.980" class="transcript_line"> magazine sheets, she found this ribbon company.</div><div id="00:05:02.260" class="transcript_line"> Cause of course we didn&#039;t have the internet in those days.</div><div id="00:05:06.180" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t any way like that.</div><div id="00:05:07.260" class="transcript_line"> We were pouring over the yellow pages</div><div id="00:05:08.980" class="transcript_line"> trying to find, you know, ribbon.</div><div id="00:05:11.980" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, so we got it from this shop,</div><div id="00:05:14.380" class="transcript_line"> VV Rulo based down in London.</div><div id="00:05:17.500" class="transcript_line"> Got this beautiful ribbon.</div><div id="00:05:19.860" class="transcript_line"> And we got it framed by somebody,</div><div id="00:05:23.820" class="transcript_line"> a little framer in Kidderminster.</div><div id="00:05:25.460" class="transcript_line"> Cause Jake and I were living in the week</div><div id="00:05:28.020" class="transcript_line"> in Kidderminster at the time.</div><div id="00:05:29.740" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d be going backwards and forwards.</div><div id="00:05:31.140" class="transcript_line"> On a Wednesday morning, I&#039;d go after the,</div><div id="00:05:32.940" class="transcript_line"> cause I wasn&#039;t going to give up the Tuesday nights</div><div id="00:05:35.340" class="transcript_line"> in Victoria&#039;s kitchen.</div><div id="00:05:37.300" class="transcript_line"> So we got this little framer who lived a bit further</div><div id="00:05:42.420" class="transcript_line"> along the road from where we were living</div><div id="00:05:44.820" class="transcript_line"> to frame these wall hangings.</div><div id="00:05:47.580" class="transcript_line"> And we did two first and then we did another two.</div><div id="00:05:49.540" class="transcript_line"> So when we did two, we put them up and we had a party</div><div id="00:05:53.180" class="transcript_line"> because we were still fundraising.</div><div id="00:05:54.540" class="transcript_line"> We did a lot of fundraising ourselves to pay for</div><div id="00:05:57.980" class="transcript_line"> these events and the wall hangings in particular.</div><div id="00:06:00.260" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;re also raising money for the big party,</div><div id="00:06:04.460" class="transcript_line"> New Year&#039;s Eve.</div><div id="00:06:05.780" class="transcript_line"> So we had cake sales.</div><div id="00:06:07.380" class="transcript_line"> I remember standing, selling cakes and pittled onions</div><div id="00:06:12.740" class="transcript_line"> and various things outside the station on Good Friday</div><div id="00:06:15.940" class="transcript_line"> in Landerendod.</div><div id="00:06:16.980" class="transcript_line"> And we got quite a lot, cause somebody in Boots,</div><div id="00:06:20.100" class="transcript_line"> somebody who worked in Boots said,</div><div id="00:06:21.340" class="transcript_line"> actually the busiest day for us in Boots is Good Friday.</div><div id="00:06:27.500" class="transcript_line"> So we thought that is what supplies.</div><div id="00:06:30.500" class="transcript_line"> So we thought, well, a Good Friday is the day to,</div><div id="00:06:33.260" class="transcript_line"> you know, have a cake sale.</div><div id="00:06:34.340" class="transcript_line"> And isn&#039;t it, if that&#039;s the busiest day in Landerendod.</div><div id="00:06:37.300" class="transcript_line"> So we did that and we did various fundraising events</div><div id="00:06:42.940" class="transcript_line"> in the village hall.</div><div id="00:06:43.940" class="transcript_line"> We had a line dancing night, which was hilariously good fun.</div><div id="00:06:49.060" class="transcript_line"> A line dancing night, which was to show off the two</div><div id="00:06:52.660" class="transcript_line"> wall hangings that we&#039;d done and to raise a bit of money</div><div id="00:06:55.940" class="transcript_line"> to pay for the next two and to pay for all these other</div><div id="00:07:01.020" class="transcript_line"> events that we&#039;d got lined up, including the village green.</div><div id="00:07:06.300" class="transcript_line"> So it was a very busy time, the lead up to millennium</div><div id="00:07:09.620" class="transcript_line"> and a few years after that, because we hadn&#039;t finished</div><div id="00:07:13.500" class="transcript_line"> the wall hangings by the time of the,</div><div id="00:07:15.860" class="transcript_line"> I think we finished them in 2001.</div><div id="00:07:18.980" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s kind of carried on.</div><div id="00:07:22.260" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t remember if we finished the,</div><div id="00:07:24.100" class="transcript_line"> I think we were still doing the village green,</div><div id="00:07:26.100" class="transcript_line"> doing some planting and, you know, making it,</div><div id="00:07:28.940" class="transcript_line"> finishing it off in the years after the millennium.</div><div id="00:07:31.980" class="transcript_line"> But that was a really busy time period and really sort of</div><div id="00:07:35.340" class="transcript_line"> good community sort of spirit going on at that time.</div><div id="00:07:44.180" class="transcript_line"> And of course we&#039;ve got those beautiful wall hangings</div><div id="00:07:46.100" class="transcript_line"> to show for and a beautiful village green,</div><div id="00:07:48.340" class="transcript_line"> which is cared for now by the community council.</div></div></p>
