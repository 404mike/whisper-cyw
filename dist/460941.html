    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So the long answer, that was a very long answer</div><div id="00:00:02.840" class="transcript_line"> to your question, right?</div><div id="00:00:04.080" class="transcript_line"> Very long answer.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What I was trying to say was this.</div><div id="00:00:07.440" class="transcript_line"> In those years, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83,</div><div id="00:00:12.820" class="transcript_line"> we learned a lot about how to present our case on television.</div><div id="00:00:18.240" class="transcript_line"> And this was a strike that was in large part</div><div id="00:00:24.100" class="transcript_line"> handled through the medium of television.</div><div id="00:00:27.100" class="transcript_line"> And the South Wales executive told me,</div><div id="00:00:33.900" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re gonna be our spokesman,</div><div id="00:00:36.100" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re gonna handle the press.</div><div id="00:00:39.100" class="transcript_line"> And it was done with tremendous discipline.</div><div id="00:00:41.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there were lots of people who were shouting</div><div id="00:00:44.860" class="transcript_line"> the odds about going back to work,</div><div id="00:00:46.340" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve had enough of this,</div><div id="00:00:47.900" class="transcript_line"> and Scargill&#039;s bloody useless,</div><div id="00:00:49.540" class="transcript_line"> and we just belonged before the terrible deprivation</div><div id="00:00:54.100" class="transcript_line"> of the autumn and the winter.</div><div id="00:00:57.060" class="transcript_line"> But we maintained the discipline and held the line.</div><div id="00:01:03.380" class="transcript_line"> And it was all about having a real media strategy.</div><div id="00:01:09.340" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what we did.</div><div id="00:01:11.820" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that the miners&#039; side was handled</div><div id="00:01:15.180" class="transcript_line"> as well as the government&#039;s side?</div><div id="00:01:17.580" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think so.</div><div id="00:01:22.140" class="transcript_line"> The co-op of management were just rubbish.</div><div id="00:01:25.060" class="transcript_line"> They were useless.</div><div id="00:01:26.620" class="transcript_line"> And Phil Weeks was pretty good,</div><div id="00:01:29.980" class="transcript_line"> who was the director of the South Wales Call Field.</div><div id="00:01:33.860" class="transcript_line"> He had a very nice way with him,</div><div id="00:01:35.660" class="transcript_line"> but he didn&#039;t like doing media.</div><div id="00:01:38.940" class="transcript_line"> He could have been much more effective than he was,</div><div id="00:01:43.340" class="transcript_line"> but I think that&#039;s because Phil never really believed</div><div id="00:01:45.860" class="transcript_line"> in what the Call Board was doing.</div><div id="00:01:50.140" class="transcript_line"> The bosses of the Call Board themselves came across</div><div id="00:01:52.420" class="transcript_line"> as out of touch, arrogant, grad grinds.</div><div id="00:01:59.940" class="transcript_line"> Thatcher was pretty dreadful.</div><div id="00:02:03.300" class="transcript_line"> Peter Walker was much more skillful.</div><div id="00:02:06.140" class="transcript_line"> And in fact, they started to learn very quickly.</div><div id="00:02:10.700" class="transcript_line"> We could see them getting better on the television.</div><div id="00:02:15.540" class="transcript_line"> And they certainly beat us to the punch</div><div id="00:02:19.020" class="transcript_line"> by the Christmas and the New Year of the strike.</div><div id="00:02:25.660" class="transcript_line"> And that really upset me.</div><div id="00:02:30.260" class="transcript_line"> Scargill was a real enigma in a way.</div><div id="00:02:36.420" class="transcript_line"> He was terrific, a morborator.</div><div id="00:02:39.380" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve always hated morborators.</div><div id="00:02:41.260" class="transcript_line"> I never trusted them, and I don&#039;t trust them, no.</div><div id="00:02:46.100" class="transcript_line"> But he was...</div><div id="00:02:48.940" class="transcript_line"> And one of the most frightening things</div><div id="00:02:50.460" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve ever been part of really was the huge rally</div><div id="00:02:54.260" class="transcript_line"> in Aberavon, in the hall in Aberavon.</div><div id="00:02:59.260" class="transcript_line"> God, it was unbelievable.</div><div id="00:03:00.860" class="transcript_line"> It was like one of these terrible totalitarian rallies.</div><div id="00:03:05.860" class="transcript_line"> But he also had this other side to him,</div><div id="00:03:08.860" class="transcript_line"> which was a kind of inability to say things,</div><div id="00:03:17.780" class="transcript_line"> which acknowledged that there was another argument.</div><div id="00:03:21.780" class="transcript_line"> And that was a fatal weakness.</div><div id="00:03:26.340" class="transcript_line"> What about the portrayals of the</div><div id="00:03:32.440" class="transcript_line"> miners themselves on television?</div><div id="00:03:33.440" class="transcript_line"> Was it a fair portrayal, do you think?</div><div id="00:03:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, I think we had a very, very good media image.</div><div id="00:03:45.120" class="transcript_line"> And that was partly because so many miners</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> are so articulate.</div><div id="00:03:50.440" class="transcript_line"> They could express this stuff so beautifully</div><div id="00:03:53.240" class="transcript_line"> and in such a kind of apposite way.</div><div id="00:03:57.240" class="transcript_line"> And I think that was a very, very good portrayal.</div><div id="00:04:00.560" class="transcript_line"> In such a kind of apposite and timely way,</div><div id="00:04:03.400" class="transcript_line"> they were good at it.</div><div id="00:04:05.720" class="transcript_line"> And they would always be on almost every picket line,</div><div id="00:04:08.920" class="transcript_line"> certainly the kind of the big trouble spots.</div><div id="00:04:12.960" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;d always be somebody who was...</div><div id="00:04:15.520" class="transcript_line"> Ivor England, for example.</div><div id="00:04:17.080" class="transcript_line"> Ivor was absolutely brilliant.</div><div id="00:04:21.080" class="transcript_line"> Ivor had this genius of disguising the fact</div><div id="00:04:24.160" class="transcript_line"> that he was a highly intelligent guy</div><div id="00:04:26.560" class="transcript_line"> by sounding as if he just came out from the pit</div><div id="00:04:29.960" class="transcript_line"> and his mother hadn&#039;t let him out for 10 years or something.</div><div id="00:04:33.320" class="transcript_line"> Well, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on here.</div><div id="00:04:35.480" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t understand him.</div><div id="00:04:36.520" class="transcript_line"> He just work in men who wanna work.</div><div id="00:04:39.600" class="transcript_line"> He was brilliant.</div><div id="00:04:42.120" class="transcript_line"> And Arfon Evans, who was the chairman of the Marty Lodge,</div><div id="00:04:47.280" class="transcript_line"> he was another one.</div><div id="00:04:48.680" class="transcript_line"> But there were loads and loads of marvelous,</div><div id="00:04:52.720" class="transcript_line"> very articulate guys.</div><div id="00:04:54.760" class="transcript_line"> And women, of course.</div><div id="00:04:56.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, God, some of the best explanations</div><div id="00:05:01.960" class="transcript_line"> of what this was about came from women.</div></div></p>
