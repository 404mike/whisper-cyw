It was awful. I mean it was awful to hear it, but when you saw the television pictures it was awful, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me when you see pictures now. Television is good from that point of view. We realize what goes on much more than we would have.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Because years ago you would have heard it a week later when you were writing a newspaper, wouldn&#039;t you? But now you live with it, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:00:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Like the earthquake in New Zealand, you sort of see buildings falling. Well years ago you wouldn&#039;t have done that.</div></div></p>
