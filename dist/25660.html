It was empty during the winter.</div><div id="00:00:35.000" class="transcript_line"> The six-bedroom mansion provided accommodation for paying guests to fish and shoot game.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> During the early 20th century it was the job of Gwen Rees&#039; father to ensure both were in plentiful supply.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Now there is very little game left because the Heather Moreland has been all but destroyed,</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> but the lake is kept well stocked.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in 1917. And I was born and brought up in Beguiling.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It was lovely there.

Making big places in the ground and cutting them and doing them up ourselves.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Putting them into a stack. And then in about September carrying them all into a big shed.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was enough for us for the whole winter and summer like.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> For some of the men who worked here, a peat fire was the perfect opportunity to dry out.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> One other chap who apparently he never possessed an overcoat.</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And so more often than not if you met him in somebody else&#039;s house it was basically a cloud of steam in the corner from the fire.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Although all the moisture from his clothes rising as he was drying out.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> By the time Gwen had reached 17, her family moved to a farm in Aberhossan a few miles away.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> But she will always have fond memories.</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a lovely place because that&#039;s what I had started living in.</div><div id="00:02:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I nearly broke my heart when I came from there.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> It was great you know, though we are far walking nearly five minutes to chapel and back.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And if we went to the shop it was still near in Aberhossan.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes and going up the rocks over there.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, all weathers.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a long way to carry food and over back you know.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But my father was ordering a lot of things at the beginning of the winter.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Five sacks of flour and a big bag of tea.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t know how much of sugar, everything like that.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they were in the house for the whole winter.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was snowed in for a few days.</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Then we had to make tracks to go out to the shed and things you know.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> At our final stop we will not only discover what is being done to support today&#039;s farmers.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But what is also in store for their grandchildren too.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Retrace your steps back uphill through the gate.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And continue to follow the track for vehicles round to the right.</div><div id="00:04:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Beyond where you joined it when you came up from the cattle pasture.</div><div id="00:04:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Soon Glasslinn Lake will come into view on your left.</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Listen to track 10 after passing through another metal field gate.</div></div></p>
