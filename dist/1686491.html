    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> work when you started work so yeah you&#039;re saying about starting work</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> musicals and you know the technical elements of the stopwatch. So I worked there for a few years. I loved it. Then I went to work in Jacob&#039;s for Doolies for Wings. I had my first child when I worked there. I worked right up until I was about to drop.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> When I left and when she was a few months old I went back because my mother looked after my daughter. And when I was having my son, he was only two years younger than me, I did the same again. So my boss kept taking me back.</div><div id="00:01:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I went there again. This is a different matter now. My youngest son is my second son. And I went back after I had the same problem as well. I got on well with my boss but it&#039;s not fair anymore. It&#039;s all gone, it&#039;s all changed on the haze. I don&#039;t go to town.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t walk around, I can&#039;t walk that far anyway. You know I&#039;m going to be old before I wish I could. So I can&#039;t walk that far.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love work. I love work.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Well Dana worked for me. And one of the girls had a few part time jobs and I enjoyed it because of the music and everything. It was like a night out. And Dana&#039;s mother, she used to come over and she wanted a drink but she&#039;d come with Carly. Do you know Carly? She used to come with Jolene, Dana&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what I miss about it. I miss all the old people.</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, pubs are different as well aren&#039;t they? You know pubs were as much like a community center. I always used to laugh about the old guy in the corner at one pint all night. But everybody was nice to him.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And on a good night you&#039;d have half a dozen pints because somebody would be celebrating and they&#039;d give him a pint.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah of course. That always happened. Like some of my friends would never taste the food in the shop. You know I used to bring them food gum and the lard you know. Make them a couple of cheese rolls.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the difference isn&#039;t it? If those people would now, and you&#039;ll know some like it, who are indoors who never go anywhere.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Well I&#039;ve become one of those people who goes anywhere. They go to Tesco&#039;s or Asda&#039;s but there&#039;s nothing out there anyway. I&#039;m just waiting for the world to change.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But if you go to Tesco&#039;s or Asda&#039;s, and this is what my nan used to say in the old days, she could go 100 yards down the middle of Barry I Street and take her all afternoon.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, if he stood up. Yeah, yeah. A lot of old boys used to come down the dark and they used to come to the down street and that.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well yeah I would have been one of them. I&#039;m 72 this year so I used to spend a lot of time down the bay with the boys Casablanca and other places.</div><div id="00:04:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh that was a guy for Casablanca. You couldn&#039;t see anybody in there. That wasn&#039;t a bad thing though.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, no, it was alright. That wasn&#039;t much fun. I&#039;m not the fullest down there but it was a nice year and I would get on with this year.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> But people say about atmosphere, some places have got atmosphere because you can&#039;t see anything.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> No, but you&#039;ve got to create the atmosphere. The world has run in this. You&#039;ve got to create the atmosphere.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you know, and it&#039;s another nice picture because there was a few locks we used to go in and come out at 4 o&#039;clock in the morning.</div><div id="00:05:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, the shit is lovely. So that&#039;s how it goes and we&#039;ve also got too much down there.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well there&#039;s only one original pub left. What&#039;s it?</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> That would be The Pocket. Yeah, it&#039;s a pub I never liked.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I thought Paddle Steam and Oboe&#039;s were both good pubs, I have to say.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they were. After they were the ones that grew. Oh yeah, yeah. I used to have a lot of good time, honestly.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved it. It was hard life, man. It&#039;s not easy when you&#039;re in a pub, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I love the people. I used to say they&#039;re my people, you know. They&#039;re my people. And they were lovely.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;re not as well-bound.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s a sign of a good landlady, isn&#039;t it? You know, they&#039;re my people.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were. They were causing the problems.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then some of you wanted to stay on with telemarketing, right? What are you acting like that for?</div><div id="00:06:27.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, don&#039;t spoil yourself and everybody, that type of thing, you know.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and it was lovely.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s the other thing, isn&#039;t it? You&#039;ve got local people wouldn&#039;t put up with some types of behavior.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> No, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> One of the things a lot of young people, a lot of people, I say young people, they&#039;re not young now,</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> but a lot of people have talked about is things like Chalky White&#039;s youth club.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I remember Chalky. He was a dentist, didn&#039;t he? Chalky.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s funny, I knew about Chalky White. I never went there.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t know his first name until recently, and I never knew he was a dentist.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, he was a dentist. I don&#039;t know, he came down there when Oliver said he was there.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was nice, Chalky, wasn&#039;t he? I don&#039;t know his first name. What&#039;s his first name?</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Vivian.</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right, yeah, Vivian. I&#039;ve known him all my life.</div><div id="00:07:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was nice, because he tried to get a son of a cheeky to him as well.</div><div id="00:07:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was good to the kids there. Yeah, he was on a Chalky.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I think his life story was in Granstown.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> His life and kids.</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t know that name until recently, right, you know?</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, another name that appears a lot, of course, he&#039;s, I&#039;m getting old.</div><div id="00:08:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Betty Campbell.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Betty? Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, she&#039;s a lovely Betty. Yeah, well, she was a couple years older than me.</div><div id="00:08:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I know all the family, they&#039;re nice people, and she was lovely, Betty.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> She did a lot of the community, Betty did.</div><div id="00:08:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I could get that school book, which was, you know, a giant pillar.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, my school was a school. And also it was nice, Betty.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And she used to teach kids things that they&#039;d have not learned elsewhere about their own backgrounds.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, she&#039;d go into everything, Betty, but she wasn&#039;t prejudiced or anything like that.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> She had people friends in her walks, maybe.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes you&#039;d get a bit of a reward prejudice.</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> But she wasn&#039;t. None of us knew her down there, anyway, none of us were prejudiced.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We just didn&#039;t think, we didn&#039;t think, any notice.</div><div id="00:09:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, that&#039;s one of the things people have said about it. It doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> There were so many races, so many languages and so many faiths, and yet everyone got on.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, yes. Yeah, they did.</div><div id="00:09:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, my grandfather could speak about seven languages, but I never learned Egyptian, but they all learned English, didn&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, they are, too. It was a nice place to live, man.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I feel back to my life as like it was.</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I know what you mean.</div><div id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> What was it like, I mean, you&#039;ll know, what was it like when they started knocking it all down?</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Judgment. Judgment. People would look down at the warehouses when they were asked to go out.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d be in the middle of the street, they&#039;d all be looking back down.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> At the warehouse. Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, places like Loudoun Square, I mean, amazing place.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, they were fabulous when I was a kid, some of those houses were.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially the ones with the steps, haven&#039;t you heard me, then?</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They were big, big houses.</div><div id="00:10:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So, it was a nice, it was a good little building.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it is. It&#039;s just, I mean, one thing that...</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you go down the... Sorry, lovely. Did you go down the Chalky Scull?</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t, because when I was in Wales, I was in Barrie.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I lived next door to a finale board, and I was in another street.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were fabulous, the way you should have it. And now you could be down the floor.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And the same men, when they come on, can see us, they stay there.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s regular, so I came up, and they were lovely, they were gentle.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But then...</div><div id="00:10:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you should show them. Yeah, they were lovely.</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s one of the things about the Bay as well, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> One of my first recollections of walking with my uncle through the Bay was the smells of food from everywhere.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> From everywhere.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> From everywhere.</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, smells all over the world coming out of houses.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, my grandkid cooked everything on the mother, and she did for my grandkid.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And she was a fabulous cook.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandfather, he was a cook on the ship when we used to go to sea.</div><div id="00:11:27.000" class="transcript_line"> He was a ship&#039;s cook.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> But then he&#039;d come home, and we&#039;d cook home as well, and my grandma used to loan us, and she&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> My matcha darling, Barney, we used to use your fish sauce, and we&#039;d go in the kitchen.</div><div id="00:11:44.000" class="transcript_line"> See, Mr. Disco.</div><div id="00:11:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s a funnier difference.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> My nan used to be what I would call a one pot cook.</div><div id="00:11:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like we&#039;ve got all this stuff, all of these root vegetables and everything else,</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> they can go in here and we&#039;ll make a proper stew.</div><div id="00:12:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And other people, I need a pot for everything.</div><div id="00:12:05.000" class="transcript_line"> My nan said, I don&#039;t get that.</div><div id="00:12:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it goes into...</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Just buy a bath site.</div><div id="00:12:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Like, come Christmas and all the while there was no turkeys.</div><div id="00:12:20.000" class="transcript_line"> When I was a kid, it was always chickens.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where turkey came from.</div><div id="00:12:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:12:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never ate turkey, ever.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:12:32.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather used to kill about three chickens.</div><div id="00:12:36.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d buy them, young.</div><div id="00:12:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I wouldn&#039;t buy them either.</div><div id="00:12:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;d feed them there.</div><div id="00:12:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And on Christmas, can they jump out of their tree and clean them?</div><div id="00:12:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I wish I&#039;d left this truck in there.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> So my mother had me on Saturday through, too.</div><div id="00:12:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I could never thank God for not being hungry.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I could not.</div><div id="00:13:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But your expectations would have been different as well.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, that thing, I mean, my grandkids do it,</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not having a go at it, but my grandkids do it.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t eat that. I don&#039;t like that.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because you know what it is.</div><div id="00:13:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d have starved.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but we didn&#039;t have lunches, did we?</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Like McDonald&#039;s and all the while, I mean, we never had that, did we?</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:13:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The kids, they are the ones who ask me on McDonald&#039;s.</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was also what you cook.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, we used to eat a lot of mutton.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And now people talk about, you know, and then it was all the fancier lamb joints.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But we used to eat a lot of mutton.</div><div id="00:13:41.000" class="transcript_line"> You just had to cook it better.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I only did.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and we cooked it slower.</div><div id="00:13:45.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all.</div><div id="00:13:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It tasted like lamb, but it was nothing.</div><div id="00:13:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was all a guess.</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a butter.</div><div id="00:13:52.000" class="transcript_line"> We had a fargin on mutton.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We only had mutton.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> We don&#039;t even change our meat anymore.</div><div id="00:13:59.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s those cheaper joints, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You just got to know how to cook them.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you got to cook them up and slow.</div><div id="00:14:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Especially with garlic and slow roast.</div><div id="00:14:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Like a vegan meal.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> See, that&#039;s the thing, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You can, when you talk about it, you can smell it.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:14:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like I talk about the Nans bread pudding or, you know, as you say, you know, the Welsh cakes.</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I can smell them the minute I think of them.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I&#039;m no bread pudding man again.</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t tell me that joke because I&#039;ll be round your house.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a thing about bread pudding.</div><div
