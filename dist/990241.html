    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And her songs, they just rolled out across this lake.</div><div id="00:00:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was something about this lake that she got to get to by going now into a farm of roads with all these gates and stuff.</div><div id="00:00:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re sort of encapsulated for her what truly held a part of her heart in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And after all this time, I&#039;m going to come up with about a two minute poem, but anyway, that&#039;s the whole story behind it.</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> The pocket of peace in a maddened world, amid folds of worn green, great gaps of film it extends from day to day.</div><div id="00:00:39.000" class="transcript_line"> All in a moment, the scene rises in white, and the blooms in green, then from day to day, gives her cool refreshments.</div><div id="00:00:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Her perpetual gifts.</div><div id="00:00:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Uh oh.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, songs spawned a fisherman rolled out across her, tone gives birth to tone, unrehearsed creations born of stillness.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Close gently the gates, so when time and distance grows large between you and Cwmdeus, the vision of that fragile moment can remain to become a symbol of your genesis.</div><div id="00:01:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry I missed that.</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> ...and especially for tonight.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called the North American Northamallan, but it&#039;s really meant to be Seattle&#039;s first Northamallan in many, many years.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a vision of what I had for tonight, and the vision was born mostly of Northamallans that I&#039;ve known in Vancouver.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s one character in particular, called the Dark-eyed Melissa with sparrot tone in here, and most of you will recognize Alan Jones from Vancouver.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, we have two sisters, the Alton and Soprano over there, the Wingate sisters.</div><div id="00:02:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And we also have somebody who left his wealthness like an undervalued trinket among old buttons in a drawer, and that&#039;s Phil Humphreys.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And you might recognize other people in here, but there&#039;s nothing crude, rude, or unrefined.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> One man stands to welcome his old friends and strangers look for comfortable places.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> He calls out, inviting all to sing, voices join, weak and unblended.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Then a glass is raised, a sip, a smile, a word exchanged, and a song finds its pride, filling itself with mountain and valley, and a hush, brooding beauty.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It plays itself against itself in an age-old game, running from pure heart to mountain sides full of wildly colored goats.</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> The thought turns boiling over and dieboxes the soldier faster and faster than some speed, almost outside of itself until it settles into the comfort of a well-worn hymn.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Out of that billowing blended sound comes silence, followed by a story of, I remember what I remember when I was a little boy.</div><div id="00:03:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Then a dark-lipped, malithluous baritone resurrects the boyhood of that wild, word-worshipping welshman who captured each right and smell and sound,</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> that left a heart within us all and made us each king of our own little apple towns.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Dylan&#039;s boywood vanishes in a new dance of flute and fiddle, strings and wind.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Two sisters follow, a lyric teased between also and soprano.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So one by one, each comes to offer a talent to the whole.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Some timid, some easy, and some who until this night have left their welshness like an undervalued trinket among old buttons in a drawer.</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> They bring up their awkward offering until there is no more.</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Then those who are hungry eat, the thirsty drink and the tired go home to sleep, while the unsatisfied nest against the piano to sing.</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Of mountain and valley, shadow and light, of loving and dying and anxiety and flight, of mothers and fathers and time beyond time,</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> passionate spirits, tempered in righteousness, carry three winters and blankets of faith.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Tonight each has been a giver, each a taker.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Happy this night for the love of that ancient land.</div></div></p>
