    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Track 2, Voil Vadyan Trigpoint. There can be all sorts of colours. Two audio stops,</div><div id="00:00:10.920" class="transcript_line"> two very impressive views, don&#039;t you think? You are now standing 564 metres above sea</div><div id="00:00:18.080" class="transcript_line"> level, 1850 feet in old money. Until your right, north, you can see across the Davi</div><div id="00:00:27.520" class="transcript_line"> Valley to Cadrydris and other Snowdonia peaks as before from the memorial, and now the view</div><div id="00:00:33.680" class="transcript_line"> is almost 360 degrees. And ahead, slightly to your left, at the south west, you can now</div><div id="00:00:40.920" class="transcript_line"> see the long humped whale back of Pymlemann, meaning five peaks in Welsh, and the rail</div><div id="00:00:47.920" class="transcript_line"> focal point in the north Cambrian&#039;s landscape. Below can be seen Glyndwr&#039;s Way, which snakes</div><div id="00:00:57.040" class="transcript_line"> its way towards the almost lifeless Glaslyne Lake that we will learn about at stop four.</div><div id="00:01:01.800" class="transcript_line"> Throughout the year, the patchwork of hues you can see from this vantage point is always changing,</div><div id="00:01:07.840" class="transcript_line"> as Emir Lewis, a local farmer for over 30 years, recalls. Well, I think it&#039;s just the different</div><div id="00:01:14.920" class="transcript_line"> colours that you have looking from there. You&#039;re looking down at the Davi Valley, and the colours,</div><div id="00:01:20.440" class="transcript_line"> all the greenery and the different pieces that have been ploughed and reseeded over the years,</div><div id="00:01:26.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a different green to where the old pastures are. And then you look across to the hills,</div><div id="00:01:32.480" class="transcript_line"> and they can be all sorts of colours, depending on the weather conditions.</div><div id="00:01:37.920" class="transcript_line"> The Davi Valley is not just a pretty place to look at. It is one of only a handful of biosphere</div><div id="00:01:44.880" class="transcript_line"> reserves in the UK, an international conservation designation created to promote and demonstrate a</div><div id="00:01:52.400" class="transcript_line"> balanced relationship between humans and the biosphere. From the Cessail Oak woodlands in the</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> valley tops to the estuary below, the area is rich in wildlife. And as Clive Faulkner,</div><div id="00:02:04.480" class="transcript_line"> Conservation Manager for the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, explains,</div><div id="00:02:08.320" class="transcript_line"> for a major estuary it is curiously underdeveloped. Unusually, there aren&#039;t actually buildings. There</div><div id="00:02:15.840" class="transcript_line"> isn&#039;t a marina, there isn&#039;t a factory, there isn&#039;t a town. Most, if you look at most of the valleys,</div><div id="00:02:20.080" class="transcript_line"> most of the estuaries in the UK, they end in a town, they end in an oil refinery, they end in</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> a marina. And it&#039;s not the case there. So actually, if you look at the whole valley as a unit,</div><div id="00:02:32.800" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a beautiful, unique place. And it&#039;s basically unspoiled. And yet there are people there who are</div><div id="00:02:39.440" class="transcript_line"> living with the landscape. And that&#039;s a really special thing. Retrace your steps back to the new</div><div id="00:02:46.480" class="transcript_line"> style. But do not cross it. Instead turn right and head downhill. When the slope eases, bear right</div><div id="00:02:53.280" class="transcript_line"> towards the left hand side of Glaslin Lake, rather than following the fence line. And your route down</div><div id="00:02:59.120" class="transcript_line"> and across open moorland to join Glyndua&#039;s Way will become clear. Upon reaching the National Trail,</div><div id="00:03:06.240" class="transcript_line"> turn left and listen to track three, when this path crosses the track for vehicles.</div></div></p>
