And what did you do?</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I did a couple of things.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought I&#039;d have loads of time, like lots of people thought they&#039;d have tons of time to do all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:01:33.000" class="transcript_line"> The two things I really committed to were I transcribed five interviews that I&#039;d done with some colleagues in my other job.</div><div id="00:01:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And I knew needed to do.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I like transcription.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I do voluntary transcription for the National Library of Wales.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And I just hadn&#039;t been I hadn&#039;t had time to do anything like that for a very long time.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So I really enjoyed just doing that for sort of about half a day because it takes much, much longer than you think.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s about an hour to do 10 minutes worth of conversation.</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the other thing that I really put my efforts into was drawing.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So you taught me you started giving me some lessons in drawing, which I&#039;ve never done before.</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I tried to do a little bit of that each day.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> But at the same time, it was also really sunny.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hot. It was like March and April.</div><div id="00:02:21.000" class="transcript_line"> So was it March? No, it was April. It was April and May.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It was really sunny.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And also our dog, Millie, who features elsewhere on this site, was pretty poorly.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were looking after her.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s the word to describe palliative care?</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And she absolutely adored the sunshine.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So every spare minute we&#039;d have to get her outside and sit in the sunshine and let her roll around on the grass.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, just spending lots of time with her.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And did the drawing relax you at all?</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Or was it a surprise that you enjoyed it so much because you became very good at it?</div><div id="00:03:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Not relaxing. I sort of thought of it as work.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But I did very I really enjoyed it. I was very slow at it.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I was very slow at most things, but I did enjoy it.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a challenge? Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> What have you missed on furlough?</div><div id="00:03:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I really missed anything.</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It did though, I suppose.</div><div id="00:03:28.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt a bit that we had a WhatsApp group with all the furloughed staff.</div><div id="00:03:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So we wouldn&#039;t literally none of us looked at any emails, except on the specific days and times we had been told we were going to get a message.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And the WhatsApp was nice because I as a remote worker, I don&#039;t know many of the other people.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So I didn&#039;t contribute much, but it was really nice to kind of hear from everybody and know, you know, feel like you&#039;re you weren&#039;t alone.</div><div id="00:03:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, feeling quite bad for the people who were still in the office who had to carry a lot of the weight of the work that we weren&#039;t doing.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you think there&#039;s been any lasting effects to having to change how you work?</div><div id="00:04:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I think what&#039;s interesting about the experience is that it was like this lovely opportunity to have all this time,</div><div id="00:04:18.000" class="transcript_line"> but that that also makes you think about your career and what you spend your time doing in the office normally and how important it is or isn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And then kind of how much of that is your identity?</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I suspect lots of people have have thought about those, especially people who didn&#039;t have a job and another job like I did.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> It was probably in a meta sort of way, a bit discombobulating.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Is that the word? Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> OK, thank you.</div></div></p>
