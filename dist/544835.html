Maybe it took a couple of days or something.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And the morning it arrived in 10B, we walked down to the seafront and just looked at these crowds of people</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> all ages, everybody was there. And people were crying, that was the main thing.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> You could see people had tears rolling down their faces, old men, teenagers, children.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone was just so horrified and grieving. They were shocked and it was horrible.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve never experienced grief at that scale. Just feeling that grief and feeling the natural response to grief</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> which is to gather up and talk with people and comfort each other.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the same way as if somebody had died, it felt like a natural thing to want to be together.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And not just together in our houses, but together by the sea because it felt that there were all these animals</div><div id="00:02:03.000" class="transcript_line"> that had died, millions of things, big and small, and birds and shells.</div><div id="00:02:13.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very strong, that feeling that there had been a massive death of creatures.</div><div id="00:02:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously for us humans, the consequences of that, that we understood or didn&#039;t understand or knew about or didn&#039;t know about,</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> but we could feel the impact.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And so I went home and took my... it was before computers, before we had computers in our own homes,</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> before we had mobile phones. So I just took my diary and my phone book and just ran every single number that was on there</div><div id="00:03:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and told people if they wanted to meet up on Castle Hill. Maybe a couple of nights from then.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in the fun all day.
