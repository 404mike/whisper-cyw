    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Track 4. Let&#039;s face it, we were townies.</div><div id="00:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Sorry about that. Now where was I? Oh yes, the other girls. Well, you see, we were all</div><div id="00:00:11.880" class="transcript_line"> sent here for training originally, to break us in, you know. No one was meant to be here</div><div id="00:00:16.600" class="transcript_line"> for more than a month or so, but the district officer, Owen his name was, he offered me</div><div id="00:00:21.800" class="transcript_line"> a job looking after the office. I&#039;d been doing some clerical work back home, see.</div><div id="00:00:27.600" class="transcript_line"> Fifteen of us came for the training and our first job was to go up to Pennlan on the other</div><div id="00:00:32.120" class="transcript_line"> side of the road. Somebody had already felled the trees so that they could be used for telegraph</div><div id="00:00:37.260" class="transcript_line"> poles. We then had to cut off the brash, you know, the branches, so they were just left</div><div id="00:00:42.520" class="transcript_line"> with the long trunks. At the end of each day we had to burn the brash and bury the ashes</div><div id="00:00:47.680" class="transcript_line"> in the ground. Oh, we&#039;d come back to our dates with bloodshot eyes from the smoke and</div><div id="00:00:52.900" class="transcript_line"> hands blackened with a mixture of soil, ash and resin. Well, as the days went on, the</div><div id="00:00:59.700" class="transcript_line"> weather got hotter and hotter and Charlie Williams, who was in charge of us, he saw</div><div id="00:01:04.720" class="transcript_line"> that we buried it correctly each day. Now, I remember there being some dispute that it</div><div id="00:01:10.260" class="transcript_line"> was getting too dry to burn, but the powers that be said carry on. So we went up this</div><div id="00:01:16.180" class="transcript_line"> particular Saturday morning and we burned and we buried and Charlie made sure it was</div><div id="00:01:20.640" class="transcript_line"> buried correctly. Well, it was the postman that spotted the fire later that afternoon.</div><div id="00:01:28.200" class="transcript_line"> Being so dry, it had gone underneath the ground and there was little anybody could do. Oh,</div><div id="00:01:34.200" class="transcript_line"> it went up like tinder and right across the top of the mountain. Being so dry, there was</div><div id="00:01:39.440" class="transcript_line"> nothing you could do to stop it. It burnt for nearly a week it did. It was a disaster,</div><div id="00:01:45.200" class="transcript_line"> even made the national news. They couldn&#039;t put it out with water. There was no water.</div><div id="00:01:51.380" class="transcript_line"> The Aberglesrch was just a small stream. A lot of the people in the village went up to</div><div id="00:01:56.800" class="transcript_line"> help, including the forestry girls. Some cycled up on their bicycles, beating at the fire</div><div id="00:02:02.080" class="transcript_line"> with their coats. They claimed overtime for it too. We didn&#039;t go up, but someone told</div><div id="00:02:08.500" class="transcript_line"> me later that fire engines from Birkenhead and Birmingham came and the army too. It</div><div id="00:02:14.160" class="transcript_line"> was a wonderful sight, I have to say, but the land girls got the blame for it. We shouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:19.400" class="transcript_line"> have been burning, but we were under orders, you know. Let&#039;s face it, we were townies and</div><div id="00:02:24.600" class="transcript_line"> didn&#039;t know any better, but Charlie decided that it had been buried properly. I felt awful</div><div id="00:02:30.640" class="transcript_line"> and it didn&#039;t help our relations with the locals. But one silver lining, if you can</div><div id="00:02:35.480" class="transcript_line"> call it that, is that the whole mountainside, you know where the fire was, has been awash</div><div id="00:02:40.540" class="transcript_line"> with bilberries for the last couple of summers. Listen to me chatting on. We&#039;d better keep</div><div id="00:02:46.340" class="transcript_line"> walking so you can see everything.</div></div></p>
