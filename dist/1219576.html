    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is Caroline Hunter interviewing Mark O&#039;Connor at 11.51, no 1.51 on the 17th of April 2018.</div><div id="00:00:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Mark has signed the project consent form. This interview is being recorded for Wonderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So Mark, what was your first instrument?</div><div id="00:00:28.000" class="transcript_line"> First instrument is drums, as always been.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I started later than I wanted to.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I wanted to play drums from, I don&#039;t know, probably around six or maybe even before.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But I got held back.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then later on, many years later, age 13, I got my drums.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s been the constant really. That&#039;s been there all the time.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you get a drum kit or did you buy them steadily?</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> I got a kit. I went out. We couldn&#039;t afford a drum kit, you know, my mum and dad.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So they said, look, you know, if you can save, then they&#039;ll match me.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So I went out and I got a paper round.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and I saved up all my money.</div><div id="00:01:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they matched me and I got my first kit.</div><div id="00:01:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I loved it for a good while. And then I left it for a little while.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> As kids do, they get into things, they get out of things.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And then luckily I wasn&#039;t out of it for too long.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I was back into it after sort of a year.</div><div id="00:02:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And then yeah, and then it&#039;s been a constant ever since really.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I think definitely constant from age 14.</div><div id="00:02:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you learn any other instruments after that? So drums was from about 14.</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I did at college at age 16.</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We had to do keyboard skills as part of the performing arts course I was on at the time.</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I did two years of keyboard skills, which I think was brilliant, most useful.</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And also we had to choose an instrument for our second study.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And on that course was a fantastic musician and tutor called Lee Goodall.</div><div id="00:03:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was, yeah, I felt very lucky to be around him and to be being taught by him.</div><div id="00:03:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, that&#039;s going to be my second instrument. I&#039;m going to learn alto saxophone.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And so yeah, that quickly became my second study in college.</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> How old were you when you started? That was about 18, was it?</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> That was 16.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> 16?</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I went and did a performing arts BTEC national diploma straight after GCSEs.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and that was, yeah, that was the sort of really the start of my music education really.</div><div id="00:03:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fantastic. So how did you hear about Wunderbros?</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, first of all, I guess I used my feet and followed my ears really,</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> because I was in, I can remember playing in Brecon Festival, I think the year was 94 or 95, something like that, around that day.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember hearing a big sound down on the street and I walked up to it.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was, I later found out it was Wunderbros all stood in a formation that I have never really seen Wunderbros adopt ever since.</div><div id="00:04:47.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a big circle from what I can remember.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think maybe Jess or Rob in the middle, I can&#039;t quite remember which.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and that was my first encounter with Wunderbros.</div><div id="00:05:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was, yeah, it was like I heard them live first.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, definitely.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, and then I didn&#039;t follow it up or anything after that.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, that was my first encounter with the band.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I was out on the street listening to them and I think they were playing Michael Jackson&#039;s Thriller.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, were they? That was before my time.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Mine too.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> When did you choose to join the band or how did that come about?</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the year was 97 and it was October.</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, yeah, it came about by, I can&#039;t remember who got in touch.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a feeling it might have been Denise.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But it came about because Jess, the original drummer in the band, he was relocating to Germany, I think.</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pretty sure it was Germany.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, the drum chair needed filling.</div><div id="00:06:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, they asked me in 97 and I said yes.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And then it&#039;s been, yeah, it&#039;s been like a regular, a constant in my life ever since really.</div><div id="00:06:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> How do you think your musical experiences have changed with Wanderbass as part of your life?</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think musical experiences, well, they&#039;re all very different.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there&#039;s no, for a number of reasons, there&#039;s a lot of variables in Wanderbass.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think a big part of that also is no two gigs really are ever the same.</div><div id="00:07:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So the experiences are always quite different.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think, so the question was how the musical experiences affected.</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, how did the experiences of having Wanderbass as part of your musical life,</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> how have those experiences enhanced it, changed it, added to it maybe?</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely added to it.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like with most Wanderbass encounters, you&#039;re always finding things out.</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re always mixing with an amazing group of people.</div><div id="00:08:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s quite a large group.</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, more often than not, very large.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> The times when we&#039;ve been small, so few and far between, you know.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I think that has shaped me quite a lot, I feel.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I guess on one level, being a musician, I guess I find in my life,</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s very often the case that I meet more musicians.</div><div id="00:09:13.000" class="transcript_line"> When I go to Wanderbass, I find myself not so much meeting musicians,</div><div id="00:09:21.000" class="transcript_line"> but meeting a much broader cross-section of society.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, of course I&#039;m intrigued by that.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I find the people there very interesting.</div><div id="00:09:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think for me, that&#039;s a big part of the charm of Wanderbass.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s part of the pull, I think, is that great mix that you get.</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I think over the years, I couldn&#039;t tell you exactly how I feel it shaped me,</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> but I know it has and I know it&#039;s in there.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So can you tell me what experiences in particular stand out for you?</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> What particular projects maybe?</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, there&#039;s been a lot.</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say the big ones are, I think the King Django was a big project for me.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I felt like the band went through quite a big change in that time.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Also, I think we got close to sort of forging a bit of a new band sound, if you like, I think at that time.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was brilliant, always brilliant to have a guest come in and just sort of take us to a new place.</div><div id="00:11:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that was really, really, really exciting.</div><div id="00:11:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s not the only time that that has happened, but I think for me that was definitely a bit of a personal highlight.</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But amongst many, I think the 10-year birthday celebration or 10-year anniversary was really good.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think, I guess, in terms of concerts live playing, there&#039;s one memory that goes back a long way.</div><div id="00:12:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t remember the year. I could probably find it out somehow.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember us doing a jamboree at Druidston.</div><div id="00:12:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the first one I&#039;d ever played. And we were outside in the marquee.</div><div id="00:12:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not quite sure what was taking place, but basically the band was just really playing up.</div><div id="00:12:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And the audience there at the Druidston, the crowd at that jamboree were then meeting the band.</div><div id="00:12:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And then that made the band want to play up even more.</div><div id="00:12:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can just remember that very particular gig was, it was pretty powerful for me.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And just kind of feeling, I was at the first time where I felt some sort of wonder brass fire, where I felt, whoa, you know, that felt,</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> it felt like it was on the verge of out of control in a very good way.</div><div id="00:13:11.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a standout memory for me. I&#039;m imagining I see the very late 90s or very early 2000s.</div><div id="00:13:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the other one that I think back to quite a bit is the first time travelling with the band, which was in 1999.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And we went to Cork Festival. And that was the first time for me to be away with wonder brass and also to be away with a big band.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been away, you know, travelling with smaller units, smaller bands, but never with that kind of entourage or numbers.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was amazing, you know.</div><div id="00:13:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, just arriving in a city, there just to play music and have fun with a group of that.</div><div id="00:14:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So there, that number was amazing really for me.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s again a really big memory, you know.</div><div id="00:14:22.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s lots, there&#039;s lots. That&#039;s definitely two, you know, which I think big live experiences for me, you know, with the playing.</div><div id="00:14:38.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, whenever you&#039;re away in a land and you&#039;re in another country and your connection to that country is to play music.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s quite an amazing starting point for being somewhere, you know.</div><div id="00:14:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I think I took that opportunity with both hands really.</div><div id="00:15:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So obviously you feel very much part of the band now.</div><div id="00:15:11.000" class="transcript_line"> When do you think was the time when you began or how long did it take you to feel sort of, you know, part of the wonder brass family?</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:15:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Is it quite early on? Did it take you a while?</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know. That&#039;s an interesting one.</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it must have happened quite early on because I can&#039;t remember really thinking, oh, I don&#039;t feel like I belong.</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t never remember thinking that feeling. So it must have been quite soon.</div><div id="00:15:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, by the same token, I can never remember a point where I&#039;ve gone. It&#039;s now, you know, I&#039;m in.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I felt quite in from the beginning really.</div><div id="00:16:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember other things about joining the band which weren&#039;t quite so immediate stuff.</div><div id="00:16:19.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, like the enormous repertoire that there was to learn and, you know, I think even that there is now.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, for anyone who&#039;s to come and join now would have probably the exact same feeling.</div><div id="00:16:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, I can remember, you know, much like just like now, we would meet every Tuesday and you would learn and learn and learn songs.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, four or five months later, you&#039;re still learning more songs and you just, you know, maybe I was too preoccupied with that to think, crumbs, am I in the band yet?</div><div id="00:17:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I was, yeah, I was always knocked over at how just how long it took to really to feel like I was, yeah, I was on top of the repertoire, you know.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> That felt like it took a year, if not more.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So what particularly are you looking forward to in the coming months and years through this project or where do you see further projects going?</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I guess with this project, I think it&#039;s, for me, part of the excitement is kind of, you know, looking back, kind of marking the distance and going, you know, because it&#039;s, I&#039;ve been nearly 21 years in the band.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And so, you know, when I think back as much as I think of it in musical terms, also a lot of it is, you know, on very much social terms as well, you know.</div><div id="00:18:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think for this project, a lot of it will be the chat, really, seeing old friends and, yeah, you know, just having good chat and catching up and then hopefully, you know, playing some music and</div><div id="00:18:53.000" class="transcript_line"> and, yeah, sort of reliving the good times and making new times as well, you know, because the band changes so much, you know.</div><div id="00:19:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d say nearly, you know, obviously we&#039;ve spoken about gigs change all the time, setups and, you know, variables, but year on year, it feels like the band changes shape in some form, you know.</div><div id="00:19:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, I think catching up, seeing some friends, some old friends and also, I guess the other thing with this is the music, you know, some new songs and, you know, yeah, just getting on the sort of celebratory level of, you know,</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> everyone coming to play some new music and some old tunes as well.</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think, yeah, I think that&#039;s my excitement for this project.</div><div id="00:20:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, fantastic. Is there anything else that you want to add?</div><div id="00:20:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose, I mean, I&#039;d love to say a massive thank you to Wunderbrass really for an incredible 20 years and, you know, there&#039;s no other situation like it and there&#039;s no other feeling like it.</div><div id="00:20:44.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no other feeling like it either, really.</div><div id="00:20:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so thanks for that really. I&#039;ve loved it.</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you, Mark.</div></div></p>
