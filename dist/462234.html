    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> You say sometimes you watch with friends, particularly sports.</div><div id="00:00:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Would you ever watch in a public place or is it still home-based?</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> I have done, on occasion. A couple of years ago, I think it was either the Lions or the World Cup, I can&#039;t remember now.</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> We went down in the morning to the local pub and watched the games.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, was it the Lions or was it Wales? I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But I went down a few times and I have gone for some home internationals to the pub.</div><div id="00:00:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t particularly like it. I prefer watching it at home.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> When I&#039;m in a pub, you know, you have a couple of drinks, even if it was early in the morning, you have a couple of drinks.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And you really don&#039;t concentrate. I like being at home. I like concentrating.</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> You listen to the comments at half-time. So I prefer watching at home, but with friends. A few of us together.</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> How does watching at home compare with actually being in the game?</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s not the same. When I was younger, I would certainly never choose to watch it at home as opposed to going to the game.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I loved going to the game. And even now, you know, it is great being there.</div><div id="00:01:27.000" class="transcript_line"> But as I&#039;m getting older, I&#039;m getting more inclined now to stay at home.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And with the prices of the tickets, it&#039;s crazy.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> It really is hitting the ordinary rugby supporter who supports his local club week after week.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And that costs money. And then to have to pay Â£70 or so to go and see Wales, I think it&#039;s unfair.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s too much, but that&#039;s my personal opinion.</div></div></p>
