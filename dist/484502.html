And, you know, and just to think that that there was,</div><div id="00:06:44.960" class="transcript_line"> you know, these communities are out there and there&#039;s actually</div><div id="00:06:47.240" class="transcript_line"> not nothing that&#039;s scary about them.</div><div id="00:06:48.720" class="transcript_line"> But you got this perceived sense of threat or unknown.</div><div id="00:06:52.680" class="transcript_line"> And, yeah, it really broke down some barriers for me about, you know, working</div><div id="00:06:57.280" class="transcript_line"> outside my comfort zone.</div><div id="00:06:58.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think Fatima&#039;s ultimate sanction was I&#039;m going to go and tell your parents</div><div id="00:07:03.400" class="transcript_line"> because she could, you know, and they would listen to her and share that.</div><div id="00:07:07.680" class="transcript_line"> Her concerns.</div><div id="00:07:08.520" class="transcript_line"> I think she probably she threatened me that went to do whatever I was told.</div><div id="00:07:14.040" class="transcript_line"> Dear, dear, dear.</div><div id="00:07:14.960" class="transcript_line"> And obviously, Carnival Day itself is affected by the weather.</div><div id="00:07:18.520" class="transcript_line"> I mean, in the period you were with Swicker, did we have one of those Carnival</div><div id="00:07:22.440" class="transcript_line"> Days where it was deluge or were you blessed by good weather on Carnival Day?</div><div id="00:07:26.880" class="transcript_line"> You know what?</div><div id="00:07:28.600" class="transcript_line"> I think one of them was wet and I&#039;m not.</div><div id="00:07:32.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it must have been too bad, because I&#039;m not sure it even mattered.</div><div id="00:07:35.080" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve dried out now. That much.</div><div id="00:07:37.120" class="transcript_line"> I remember certainly one or two beautiful, scorching hot Carnival Days,</div><div id="00:07:43.680" class="transcript_line"> which is, you know, a rarity in Cardiff on its own.</div><div id="00:07:46.480" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m trying to I think there was one where it rained quite heavily in the morning,</div><div id="00:07:50.400" class="transcript_line"> but maybe it actually had dried up by parade time.</div><div id="00:07:53.120" class="transcript_line"> And I think as long as it had actually dried up by parade time,</div><div id="00:07:57.200" class="transcript_line"> everyone was so ecstatic that it stopped absolutely pouring down.</div><div id="00:08:00.560" class="transcript_line"> I think a lot of.</div><div id="00:08:02.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, a lot was forgiven for that.</div><div id="00:08:03.640" class="transcript_line"> So, no, just just dry ones, I think.</div><div id="00:08:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I think you were very lucky then.</div><div id="00:08:07.600" class="transcript_line"> I think it was. Yes.</div><div id="00:08:08.560" class="transcript_line"> 2005, six and seven were the famous trilogy where we got completely soaked</div><div id="00:08:13.440" class="transcript_line"> from all day till the end of the day.</div><div id="00:08:16.440" class="transcript_line"> In terms of carnival creations and costumes,</div><div id="00:08:19.920" class="transcript_line"> are there any that stick in your mind, if a particular fondness or?</div><div id="00:08:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you know what? I&#039;m going to I&#039;m going to sing out for the end of the year.</div><div id="00:08:26.160" class="transcript_line"> I before I joined Swicker, I worked as a theatrical costumier.</div><div id="00:08:31.440" class="transcript_line"> My mother owned Marigold Costumes, which was based in Bute Town.</div><div id="00:08:34.960" class="transcript_line"> She did for many years and I worked there solidly during</div><div id="00:08:38.680" class="transcript_line"> university holidays and the summer holidays.</div><div id="00:08:41.120" class="transcript_line"> And I got pretty proficient using a sewing machine.</div><div id="00:08:44.920" class="transcript_line"> And then I joined the mass camp and I would come after my,</div><div id="00:08:48.600" class="transcript_line"> you know, nine to five at Swicker, I would go straight down to the mass camp.</div><div id="00:08:51.720" class="transcript_line"> And there I was greeted with overlockers and I&#039;d never, ever,</div><div id="00:08:55.520" class="transcript_line"> ever seen an overlocker before.</div><div id="00:08:57.880" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve wanted one ever since.</div><div id="00:08:59.480" class="transcript_line"> And I was put to work.</div><div id="00:09:01.240" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going to ignore the feathers and the sequins.</div><div id="00:09:04.960" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t care those because I made hundreds and hundreds</div><div id="00:09:08.680" class="transcript_line"> and hundreds of trousers and tunics,</div><div id="00:09:12.080" class="transcript_line"> the boring stuff that goes underneath all the beautiful base costume,</div><div id="00:09:16.120" class="transcript_line"> the base costumes.
