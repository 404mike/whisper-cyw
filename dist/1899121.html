And many of them were multilingual, but they all spoke German together.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve been brought up in a German speaking environment, but I don&#039;t really speak German like a native.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t speak Welsh. I don&#039;t speak any Hungarian.</div><div id="00:00:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you feel as though you belong to those identities, but it&#039;s very tenuous somehow.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s something a bit, if you don&#039;t actually speak the language, your relationship with the identity is much more tenuous, I think.</div><div id="00:01:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you feel I feel a bit of a fraud because if I&#039;m in a lift with people who speak Hungarian to each other, I know they&#039;re speaking Hungarian.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> I can recognize Hungarian, but I can&#039;t say anything to them.</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Hungarian, mate. But, you know, so you feel as though you&#039;re a little bit.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all a bit intangible.</div></div></p>
