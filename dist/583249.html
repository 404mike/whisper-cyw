    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> ì˜¬</div><div id="00:00:28.140" class="transcript_line"> Good morning. Everything has its beginning in thought. The invasion of Kuwait first began</div><div id="00:00:36.500" class="transcript_line"> in the mind of Saddam Hussein. And people everywhere have been horrified, and rightly</div><div id="00:00:42.620" class="transcript_line"> so, at the subsequent violence and terror and the dehumanizing atrocities inflicted</div><div id="00:00:49.800" class="transcript_line"> on the Kuwaiti people. And while we may remind ourselves that violence, murder, rape and</div><div id="00:00:58.100" class="transcript_line"> plunder occur in the towns and cities of Britain and America, even in peacetime, it makes the</div><div id="00:01:05.540" class="transcript_line"> agony of Kuwait no less horrifying. But no doubt it&#039;s also true that there were many</div><div id="00:01:14.540" class="transcript_line"> kindnesses shown by Iraqis to people in Kuwait. Some, not all, of the hostages who returned to</div><div id="00:01:22.820" class="transcript_line"> this country before Christmas had such favorable stories to tell. It&#039;s sometimes forgotten that</div><div id="00:01:32.100" class="transcript_line"> Jesus lived the whole of his life on this earth in an occupied country. He never experienced freedom</div><div id="00:01:40.900" class="transcript_line"> and independence from the rule and yoke of the occupying power. We know that power could be brutal</div><div id="00:01:49.580" class="transcript_line"> and ruthless, especially when its law and authority were questioned. We also know that</div><div id="00:01:56.900" class="transcript_line"> individual Romans could show considerable kindness and consideration to the Jewish people. Now the</div><div id="00:02:05.020" class="transcript_line"> Jews were fervent nationalists. The presence of the Romans was not only an affront to their nation,</div><div id="00:02:13.820" class="transcript_line"> but also an insult to their God. It is then of interest how Jesus, a Jew, responded. What was</div><div id="00:02:26.300" class="transcript_line"> his thinking in this situation? Jesus advocated neither appeasement nor violence, but rather the</div><div id="00:02:37.580" class="transcript_line"> use of a positive spirit that would radically change the whole situation. If the Roman soldier</div><div id="00:02:45.380" class="transcript_line"> commands you to carry his kit for one mile, as the law entitled him to do, carry it for two miles.</div><div id="00:02:53.700" class="transcript_line"> Many of his contemporaries advocated the overthrow of Rome by violence. We know that violence did</div><div id="00:03:02.220" class="transcript_line"> break out from time to time and that Jesus made enemies because he refused to be associated with</div><div id="00:03:08.780" class="transcript_line"> the terrorists. Less than a week before his crucifixion, he wept over Jerusalem, saying</div><div id="00:03:18.660" class="transcript_line"> that the way of violence could only bring about the destruction of the city and widespread misery</div><div id="00:03:25.420" class="transcript_line"> to its people. And all because, he said, you do not understand the things that make for peace.</div><div id="00:03:34.540" class="transcript_line"> In 70 A.D., Jerusalem was destroyed. Have we yet learned the things that make for peace? Well,</div><div id="00:03:50.260" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s a thought.</div></div></p>
