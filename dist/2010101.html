    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Okay, Ashok da, he is one of our past chairmen and trustee. How did you get involved in festival, Ashok da, and when it was?</div><div id="00:00:21.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been in this country for the past 35 years and I got involved directly with the Welsh Pooja Committee and Durga Puja in 1984-85.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Puja in those days was held at the parade on a lot smaller scale than it is held now.</div><div id="00:00:41.000" class="transcript_line"> My association with the puja was because of friends who were involved in the puja and I became part of the group and put my efforts into helping with the functions and the puja.</div><div id="00:01:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Who were the people at that time when you started attending the puja? Can you remember that?</div><div id="00:01:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I can recall a lot of people actually. The senior members, we used to have a purohit, Mr Banerjee, I remember him quite vividly.</div><div id="00:01:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had the older members like Rupen Majumdar and his wife, we had Deepak and his wife, we had Ashit Haldar and his family.</div><div id="00:01:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And then the younger lot came in afterwards and then unfortunately around that time I left the country, I went away for five years and I lost complete touch till I came back again in 1994.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember where did you go to see the first puja? What was the venue? Can you remember the venue?</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think my first venue I recall is at the parade which was in the early 80s and then I also remember having moved from the parade to the swimming pool.</div><div id="00:02:08.000" class="transcript_line"> There was an Empire swimming pool which is not non-existent now. It was built in the late 70s for the Olympics.</div><div id="00:02:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had several years of pujas done there which was a mammoth task as the prathima had to be lifted on the lift all the way to the third floor and it was seriously physically very challenging.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And when you attended the puja in parade which I think is before Empire swimming pool, what type of image was it then? Can you remember the image?</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We had an image. I know before that I am told that we had hanging on a piece of cloth but we did have an image.</div><div id="00:02:50.000" class="transcript_line"> And if I remember correctly, they were all on one piece of artwork which included Durga and her daughters and son on one piece of single unit.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that image may have been made by Mr. Kamal Ghatak.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think Kamal Ghatak made previous images. I am not aware of the ones that he made.</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember a specific event or event or events which sticks out in your mind about Durga puja throughout the time you have been attending Durga puja?</div><div id="00:03:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I know there may be more than one.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. The experiences are very varied depending upon which time of the period.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And my experience lasts for about 20 years in reality because I was away for five.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So the early experiences are different from those of the new ones.</div><div id="00:03:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And among the early experiences that I mentioned earlier that when we were at the parade, it was a smaller group.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And simultaneously we also had a function that was done by another community, a Hindu community.</div><div id="00:04:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a big mix-up with people coming and going and it appeared to be a huge function.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was a lot of very chaotic at the end of the night when the food was served.</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I think it continued reasonably well till the day of Visharja and we had to remove everything and take them away using the lift.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I am confusing with the two now.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think was your contribution in Durga puja? Not in the beginning I am talking about, but even now and over the years.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning I was never a pure spectator.</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, even for the first time when we went, we did participate in little events that was possible to participate in</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> because there were a lot of older members who were involved in this.</div><div id="00:05:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we had to make our place in that society.</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we eventually did. The children were involved with functions and cultural programs which included naturally the parents.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And therefore I think I was involved to a large extent throughout my experience here with the pujas.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And your children were involved as well at some stage?</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, my children along with similar age group children in our community were involved in cultural programs, dances.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And they were truly part of the puja function in every way you can think of.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s great. Thank you.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think, if I can ask this, that what do you think is holding the group together now?</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh Puja Committee and the Royal Puja Festival.</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> That is extremely interesting and I have to mention here that actually our group has shrunk a little to start with.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the Welsh Puja Committee which was a single entity has now split into three groups.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yet the current Welsh Puja Committee is now a very solid group of friends who are committed to the cause of Welsh Puja Committee.</div><div id="00:06:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And are constantly increasing in their numbers.</div><div id="00:06:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the last few years we have had a footfall of over a thousand people over the five days of the pujas.</div><div id="00:06:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And these people are consistently with us and are part of the community and are of help both financially and participating in the needs of the committee and the pujas.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And would you like to talk about anything else, what you have said, anything else you feel about the festival and the image making?</div><div id="00:06:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that the entire Puja Committee is a thing that has grown over the years.</div><div id="00:07:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have seen this immense change and growth in not just celebrating the five days of Durga Puja.</div><div id="00:07:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But in general with the community, our various diverse programs that we have over the years.</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think we are part of the community in a large way and quite conspicuous by our involvement.</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And we are virtually known to the local Welsh people as people who are participating in functions which we try and include them in as well.</div><div id="00:07:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we are well and truly a part of this Indian Welsh community and extremely well accepted.</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And I see no reason why this will not grow from year to year and maybe someday we will get local involvement as well.</div><div id="00:07:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s great. Thank you very much Ashok. Thank you.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
