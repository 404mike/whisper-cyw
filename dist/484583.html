And Katie, over to you.</div><div id="00:00:35.560" class="transcript_line"> K-A-T-I-E-G-R-I-F-F-I-T-H-S.</div><div id="00:00:41.240" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic.</div><div id="00:00:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m very much looking forward to this interview because between you, you&#039;ve wrapped up,</div><div id="00:00:47.160" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s got to be going on for at least 20 carnivals.</div><div id="00:00:51.400" class="transcript_line"> How did it all begin?</div><div id="00:00:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Well, I first started working as a youth worker at the Tan in the grounds of Ninnium Park School,</div><div id="00:01:00.560" class="transcript_line"> where there was a workshop open to adults and kids from the youth club</div><div id="00:01:06.840" class="transcript_line"> to go along and learn how to play some steel pans.</div><div id="00:01:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I went along with some of my youth club kids, no adults turned up.</div><div id="00:01:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And as I recall, the guy said,</div><div id="00:01:20.320" class="transcript_line"> why don&#039;t you have a go woman and pick up them sticks and play the hell out of them?</div><div id="00:01:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And I tried and then ended up in the Swicker All-Star Steel Pan Band.</div><div id="00:01:33.680" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m actually thinking that you were the traditional woman on the bass that you were playing,</div><div id="00:01:39.800" class="transcript_line"> what some would say is the hardest part of a steel pan orchestra,</div><div id="00:01:43.200" class="transcript_line"> which is six full tuned oil drums at one time.</div><div id="00:01:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Is that right? You&#039;re a bass player.</div><div id="00:01:50.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. 45 gallon oil drums.</div><div id="00:01:52.920" class="transcript_line"> I started with five and went on to play six and ended up actually being a guest at Notting Hill Panorama</div><div id="00:02:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Steel Orchestra Festival.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was Steel Pan. That&#039;s how you first met Carla Carnival and Swicker.</div><div id="00:02:10.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:11.040" class="transcript_line"> But obviously, costumes soon loomed fresh in your life.</div><div id="00:02:14.840" class="transcript_line"> So what was the first Cardiff Mask Carnival as it was then that you came to the carnival camp</div><div id="00:02:20.280" class="transcript_line"> and got involved with your children, one of whom, of course, is Katie and is with us today.</div><div id="00:02:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Hello. I was like waves, like in an orange and yellow little pants and like fire was it almost.</div><div id="00:02:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Ninnian Park School.</div><div id="00:02:39.760" class="transcript_line"> How old would you have been at the time?</div><div id="00:02:42.840" class="transcript_line"> 1991. So I would have been six.</div><div id="00:02:45.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fantastic. It&#039;s a very young age to get involved.</div><div id="00:02:47.960" class="transcript_line"> And right early at the beginning as well.</div><div id="00:02:51.440" class="transcript_line"> And so, Marion, what do you remember of that carnival camp?</div><div id="00:02:54.480" class="transcript_line"> I remember that I roped a couple of friends in and one was actually eight months pregnant at the time.</div><div id="00:03:00.520" class="transcript_line"> And she turned out to be dressed as waves while the children went on to be dressed as other characters.</div><div id="00:03:07.600" class="transcript_line"> And I ended up on the back of a float playing my heart off with the Swicker All-Star Steel Band.</div><div id="00:03:16.360" class="transcript_line"> 1991 was the year, of course, that we put the Cardiff Mask Carnival together with the Butetown Carnival.</div><div id="00:03:21.680" class="transcript_line"> So I have memories of you being on the back of a lorry in your red t-shirt playing like a demon.</div><div id="00:03:29.280" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, wonderful, wonderful carnival music on steel pans.</div><div id="00:03:33.440" class="transcript_line"> One, because you&#039;re not huge, are you?</div><div id="00:03:35.360" class="transcript_line"> One, virtually challenged lady surrounded by six of gigantic bass bins,</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> bass steel pans and just moving across them. You were like, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:47.840" class="transcript_line"> There was a blur. You were in motion all the time and dancing as you were doing it.</div><div id="00:03:51.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes. And I also broke my finger playing them.</div><div id="00:03:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And my elbows took a couple of cracks.</div><div id="00:03:59.320" class="transcript_line"> So I started wearing skateboarders elbow pads because I moved around so much to get from my front notes to my back.</div><div id="00:04:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I often bash my elbows, thus bruising them and chipping them a couple of times.</div><div id="00:04:14.320" class="transcript_line"> So the skateboarders elbow pads were fab.</div><div id="00:04:18.960" class="transcript_line"> If I say the word pom pom, will you leave the room screaming in horror?</div><div id="00:04:24.360" class="transcript_line"> So pom pom horror. What does that involve?</div><div id="00:04:26.800" class="transcript_line"> Making thousands upon thousands upon thousands for one costume alone,</div><div id="00:04:32.800" class="transcript_line"> which was a huge backpack costume depicting sort of the sun and the vibrance of the sun and its rays.</div><div id="00:04:42.080" class="transcript_line"> We had to make one thousand inch long yellow pom poms of a certain firmness</div><div id="00:04:49.320" class="transcript_line"> that were literally sewn on the entire costume.</div><div id="00:04:54.920" class="transcript_line"> And a woman called Monica wore the costume and looked absolutely amazing.</div><div id="00:05:00.680" class="transcript_line"> And I can&#039;t tell you how high it was or wide it was.</div><div id="00:05:03.800" class="transcript_line"> But those pom poms, I used to be in charge of asking people to make them in their spare time.</div><div id="00:05:09.760" class="transcript_line"> And people used to literally run away from me and scream in horror if they saw me even pick up a little round cardboard circle and some wool.</div><div id="00:05:20.240" class="transcript_line"> People wore them in their ears, on their shoes.</div><div id="00:05:22.800" class="transcript_line"> We made jumbo size ones and people just got to dislike me intensely.</div><div id="00:05:30.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the pop girl queen. Run for it.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Oh, God. So, Katie, I mean, you were very much grew up with at the mass camp, the carnival camp and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:05:40.720" class="transcript_line"> What was it like? What sort of freedoms did you have?</div><div id="00:05:42.680" class="transcript_line"> Because we were there for a purpose, but we were also there socially and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:05:46.720" class="transcript_line"> And I just remember you being part of a, what can I say, sort of like a gang of urchins who were part of the inner circle.</div><div id="00:05:55.080" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re very much part of the family of creativity.</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah, what comes to mind?</div><div id="00:05:59.320" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I understand that upon occasion, you may have even slept in the carnival camp.</div><div id="00:06:03.480" class="transcript_line"> Is that right? Yeah, we&#039;ve slept in material boxes in the foam room, anywhere, really.</div><div id="00:06:10.320" class="transcript_line"> They had soft soft materials.</div><div id="00:06:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. And we just put a bit of material on us and just sleep in the boxes while men were still making costumes and whatever else.</div><div id="00:06:21.680" class="transcript_line"> It was just like one big family.</div><div id="00:06:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Everyone knew each other and it was it was amazing to be a part of.</div><div id="00:06:26.880" class="transcript_line"> But it was the best three weeks of freedom that I have had in my life.</div><div id="00:06:31.440" class="transcript_line"> Just once a year.</div><div id="00:06:33.080" class="transcript_line"> And of course, you both got involved in the very first times that we tried to extend the carnival experience by by having a pre carnival.</div><div id="00:06:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Events based on that which you find in Trinidad and the Caribbean.</div><div id="00:06:48.520" class="transcript_line"> Jouvet, which is short for the French, the Jouvet, the day opens.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s a pre carnival event and it&#039;s very much based on dirty mass.</div><div id="00:06:59.720" class="transcript_line"> What what what what can you tell us about the very first ever Jouvet?</div><div id="00:07:03.960" class="transcript_line"> The the yeah. Tell us what comes to mind.</div><div id="00:07:06.160" class="transcript_line"> I think it was mud that we covered ourselves in and it was literally just put your hair in whatever style you wanted.</div><div id="00:07:13.600" class="transcript_line"> I think I wrapped mine around coils of metal, so it looked like lots of snakes.</div><div id="00:07:19.080" class="transcript_line"> And then we literally just grabbed handfuls of mud and water and just smeared it all over ourselves.</div><div id="00:07:27.320" class="transcript_line"> So we were covered. It was everywhere.</div><div id="00:07:29.200" class="transcript_line"> And then we just went out and just sang jab jab and just ran.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Advertised the carnival to come.</div><div id="00:07:38.600" class="transcript_line"> Try and get as many people to come.</div><div id="00:07:40.200" class="transcript_line"> And I remember you and your brother actually saying to me, are we really allowed?</div><div id="00:07:46.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. As somebody said, I didn&#039;t quite have enough mud on me.</div><div id="00:07:50.520" class="transcript_line"> And absolutely, I believe, tipped a bucket full over me until all you could see were my eyes.</div><div id="00:07:57.120" class="transcript_line"> And it was a wonderful feeling, especially when it dried.</div><div id="00:08:00.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to try something now.</div><div id="00:08:01.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to give it a chance.</div><div id="00:08:02.960" class="transcript_line"> See if you can respond. You know me well.</div><div id="00:08:05.480" class="transcript_line"> Jab jab. I come from hell.</div><div id="00:08:07.360" class="transcript_line"> Jab jab. There we have it.</div><div id="00:08:09.560" class="transcript_line"> The very first chart for the famous you.</div><div id="00:08:11.960" class="transcript_line"> You know, the jab jabs, the traditional devils that you find in the rest of it.</div><div id="00:08:17.800" class="transcript_line"> Marion, you&#039;re a legend.</div><div id="00:08:23.040" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re carnival carnival legend, obviously.</div><div id="00:08:25.120" class="transcript_line"> But amongst the many legendary things you have done,</div><div id="00:08:29.120" class="transcript_line"> you had a very interesting performance relationship with an Irish lady</div><div id="00:08:34.720" class="transcript_line"> for at least a couple of years called Dawn.</div><div id="00:08:37.440" class="transcript_line"> Could you care to tell us about you and Dawn, particularly</div><div id="00:08:42.760" class="transcript_line"> if I were to say snakes?</div><div id="00:08:44.520" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes.</div><div id="00:08:47.400" class="transcript_line"> For future generations, this is a good one.</div><div id="00:08:50.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, I only ever saw dear Dawn, who was Irish, once a year at carnival time,</div><div id="00:08:55.600" class="transcript_line"> and then we never got in contact or saw each other again.</div><div id="00:08:58.840" class="transcript_line"> And we were told that we were born to be free spirits.</div><div id="00:09:01.640" class="transcript_line"> So we kind of instead of staying in line, we were allowed to go</div><div id="00:09:05.200" class="transcript_line"> and kind of be the fools, the clowns and to get people laughing and smiling</div><div id="00:09:09.760" class="transcript_line"> and go amongst the the the crowd and everything.</div><div id="00:09:13.520" class="transcript_line"> And also send messages at one time from one end of the carnival to the other.</div><div id="00:09:17.800" class="transcript_line"> So we did quite a lot of running and slowly but surely we started off</div><div id="00:09:21.960" class="transcript_line"> quite clad in bright costumes.</div><div id="00:09:24.320" class="transcript_line"> And then the clothes seemed to get less and the paint got more.</div><div id="00:09:28.480" class="transcript_line"> I had the pleasure.</div><div id="00:09:30.240" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not ashamed to say at the age of 40</div><div id="00:09:34.120" class="transcript_line"> was our</div><div id="00:09:37.240" class="transcript_line"> the best year of my life.</div><div id="00:09:39.200" class="transcript_line"> I think I have never felt so liberated is when a body artist</div><div id="00:09:44.880" class="transcript_line"> painted us in black and vibrant blue.</div><div id="00:09:49.280" class="transcript_line"> And we were symbolizing snakes.</div><div id="00:09:51.480" class="transcript_line"> And I remember gyrating, which is a wonderful word,</div><div id="00:09:55.680" class="transcript_line"> dancing on the museum steps</div><div id="00:09:58.840" class="transcript_line"> and running through town with no clothes on, just body paint.</div><div id="00:10:02.680" class="transcript_line"> And people don&#039;t believe you&#039;re going to be as you run past them.</div><div id="00:10:07.320" class="transcript_line"> They don&#039;t quite their brains don&#039;t think that person hasn&#039;t got any clothes on</div><div id="00:10:11.640" class="transcript_line"> until you&#039;re already past them.</div><div id="00:10:14.120" class="transcript_line"> And they kind of look and they say,</div><div id="00:10:18.160" class="transcript_line"> well, she or wasn&#039;t she wearing clothes?</div><div id="00:10:21.040" class="transcript_line"> And I remember that being the best experience of my life</div><div id="00:10:25.480" class="transcript_line"> from somebody that wouldn&#039;t even go topless on a beach</div><div id="00:10:29.160" class="transcript_line"> or wear a bikini, let alone anything else.</div><div id="00:10:32.600" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s what mass did to me.</div><div id="00:10:36.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s an extraordinary experience.</div><div id="00:10:38.120" class="transcript_line"> Of course, I can&#039;t be with us today.</div><div id="00:10:40.480" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s a resident in Milton Keynes.</div><div id="00:10:42.840" class="transcript_line"> But your son, David, was very much part of</div><div id="00:10:45.840" class="transcript_line"> what the whole carnival experience and the crew, as it were.</div><div id="00:10:50.600" class="transcript_line"> One costume in particular comes to mind.</div><div id="00:10:52.960" class="transcript_line"> If I mentioned David as a frog,</div><div id="00:10:55.920" class="transcript_line"> and if I mentioned Jelly, would you care to explain how</div><div id="00:10:58.880" class="transcript_line"> how David brought his frog costume literally to life?</div><div id="00:11:02.160" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, a lovely guy called Rob Davie</div><div id="00:11:06.560" class="transcript_line"> helped David and a friend of his make these wonderful frog costumes.</div><div id="00:11:11.760" class="transcript_line"> And they actually appeared in South Wales Echo,</div><div id="00:11:15.400" class="transcript_line"> making the costumes and everything.</div><div id="00:11:18.200" class="transcript_line"> And I found out afterwards that</div><div id="00:11:23.640" class="transcript_line"> they decided to make their costumes are a little bit extra special for the crowd.</div><div id="00:11:28.200" class="transcript_line"> And it managed to install some sort of contraption.</div><div id="00:11:31.360" class="transcript_line"> They held jelly about their person at which they spawned</div><div id="00:11:35.760" class="transcript_line"> at various times in the carnival at the delight of a lot of the crowd.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> They produced this jelly from either squirty bottles</div><div id="00:11:44.480" class="transcript_line"> or at one time their own mouths and water guns</div><div id="00:11:49.360" class="transcript_line"> and sort of fired this jelly, obviously quite safe jelly</div><div id="00:11:53.000" class="transcript_line"> that didn&#039;t stay enclosed.</div><div id="00:11:54.240" class="transcript_line"> Thank goodness.
