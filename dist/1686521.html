    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is part of a series of recollections, memories, stories about Tiger Bay, Cardiff</div><div id="00:00:11.260" class="transcript_line"> Docks, Bute Town, that area that has generated so much wealth and culture for Cardiff and</div><div id="00:00:25.060" class="transcript_line"> Wales.</div><div id="00:00:26.620" class="transcript_line"> Firstly let us say thank you here from HDA for the contribution of Heritage Lottery Wales</div><div id="00:00:35.060" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s enabled us to undertake this short project.</div><div id="00:00:39.740" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s stop for a moment and think about horse racing, which you may think has nothing to</div><div id="00:00:46.860" class="transcript_line"> do with the docks.</div><div id="00:00:48.980" class="transcript_line"> Well, in horse racing, bloodlines are everything.</div><div id="00:00:54.220" class="transcript_line"> A good bloodline can make a horse worth millions.</div><div id="00:00:58.500" class="transcript_line"> Research in 2005 showed that virtually all half a million of the world&#039;s thoroughbred</div><div id="00:01:06.820" class="transcript_line"> racehorses are descended from 28 ancestors born in the 18th and 19th centuries and up</div><div id="00:01:15.900" class="transcript_line"> to 95% of male thoroughbreds can be traced back to just one stallion, that was the Dali</div><div id="00:01:24.900" class="transcript_line"> Arabian born in 1700.</div><div id="00:01:30.060" class="transcript_line"> So in horse racing just three stallions are said to be the founding fathers of all modern</div><div id="00:01:35.940" class="transcript_line"> day thoroughbred bloodlines.</div><div id="00:01:38.980" class="transcript_line"> The first was Bayerly Turk, followed by Dali Arabian and Godolphin Arabian.</div><div id="00:01:45.500" class="transcript_line"> All three were imported into Britain.</div><div id="00:01:48.780" class="transcript_line"> What does that have to do with Tiger Bay?</div><div id="00:01:52.700" class="transcript_line"> Well, Tiger Bay does not have an Arabian desert, but it certainly has enough people from Arab</div><div id="00:02:01.700" class="transcript_line"> countries, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti, etc.</div><div id="00:02:06.420" class="transcript_line"> But it has sporting bloodlines that have made Welsh history, driven Welsh pride and made</div><div id="00:02:12.980" class="transcript_line"> sing the names of those black mixed race descendants of the bay.</div><div id="00:02:20.820" class="transcript_line"> Not just black, let me be clear, and not just mixed race.</div><div id="00:02:25.860" class="transcript_line"> Consider a Jamaican man born in 1876 who got on board a merchant ship and ended up in Cardiff</div><div id="00:02:32.900" class="transcript_line"> Docks.</div><div id="00:02:34.020" class="transcript_line"> His name was Uriah Erskine.</div><div id="00:02:36.460" class="transcript_line"> He settled in Cardiff and had children.</div><div id="00:02:39.300" class="transcript_line"> Two of his grandsons were the boxer Joe Erskine who won the British heavyweight title in 1956</div><div id="00:02:48.780" class="transcript_line"> in the main stadium in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:02:51.300" class="transcript_line"> Then he won the British Empire Commonwealth title in 1967, beating Henry Cooper.</div><div id="00:02:58.300" class="transcript_line"> Another of Uriah&#039;s grandsons was Johnny Freeman.</div><div id="00:03:03.460" class="transcript_line"> Because of racism in Rugby Union in Wales, Johnny was to change codes from Rugby Union</div><div id="00:03:09.180" class="transcript_line"> and play rugby league for Halifax.</div><div id="00:03:11.740" class="transcript_line"> He still holds the record for the highest number of tries scored in a single season</div><div id="00:03:16.940" class="transcript_line"> for Halifax.</div><div id="00:03:18.140" class="transcript_line"> 48 tries in 1956-1957.</div><div id="00:03:23.020" class="transcript_line"> He represented Wales.</div><div id="00:03:26.700" class="transcript_line"> Both Joe Erskine and Johnny Freeman were born in 1934.</div><div id="00:03:32.140" class="transcript_line"> Both were born in Tiger Bay Bute Town and both have families still living locally.</div><div id="00:03:39.500" class="transcript_line"> Maybe bloodlines can be measured by the school you went to.</div><div id="00:03:43.500" class="transcript_line"> South Church Street School, for example, the school of Bute Town has a long list of sporting</div><div id="00:03:50.580" class="transcript_line"> icons that studied there.</div><div id="00:03:53.260" class="transcript_line"> Such as Colin Dixon, Bute Town boy that ended up playing for Halifax alongside Johnny Freeman</div><div id="00:04:00.340" class="transcript_line"> Colin was his captain.</div><div id="00:04:02.740" class="transcript_line"> He also played for Salford and Hull Kingston Rovers and Wales.</div><div id="00:04:09.740" class="transcript_line"> Also William John Boston from 7 Angelina Street.</div><div id="00:04:14.380" class="transcript_line"> Four doors from Joe Erskine in number 11.</div><div id="00:04:17.500" class="transcript_line"> Also born in 1934.</div><div id="00:04:19.700" class="transcript_line"> He went to South Church Street School.</div><div id="00:04:21.900" class="transcript_line"> He played rugby league for Wigan, Blackpool and Great Britain.</div><div id="00:04:25.820" class="transcript_line"> He scored a record 478 tries for Wigan.</div><div id="00:04:29.620" class="transcript_line"> It is said that he went north in part because he wanted to play for Cardiff Rugby Football</div><div id="00:04:36.020" class="transcript_line"> Club and knew in the end no black player was going to play for them.</div><div id="00:04:41.220" class="transcript_line"> And then there was Gus Risman born in Sophia Street.</div><div id="00:04:45.380" class="transcript_line"> Went to South Church Street School before moving to Barry.</div><div id="00:04:48.540" class="transcript_line"> He played for Workington and Great Britain and has a street named after him in Salford</div><div id="00:04:54.140" class="transcript_line"> and Workington.</div><div id="00:04:55.300" class="transcript_line"> Now Gus had two sons who went into rugby league.</div><div id="00:04:59.340" class="transcript_line"> Bev who was an England and British Lion international and John, former Workington player and Welsh</div><div id="00:05:07.220" class="transcript_line"> international.</div><div id="00:05:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Johnny Freeman, Joe Erskine, Dennis Brown, the Wales Rugby League international and many</div><div id="00:05:15.540" class="transcript_line"> others went to South Church Street.</div><div id="00:05:19.020" class="transcript_line"> These are Bute Town names.</div><div id="00:05:20.900" class="transcript_line"> Tiger Bay names and there are many others with family links to Bute Town, to the bay.</div><div id="00:05:27.900" class="transcript_line"> Such as Lewis Reese Zamit.</div><div id="00:05:32.020" class="transcript_line"> The fact of the matter is it&#039;s a small place.</div><div id="00:05:36.620" class="transcript_line"> A place with a big heart but hard working working class people who also made a massive</div><div id="00:05:44.620" class="transcript_line"> contribution to Wales.</div><div id="00:05:47.620" class="transcript_line"> Through sport certainly but also through many many other endeavours.</div><div id="00:05:55.620" class="transcript_line"> So if bloodlines are relevant in horse racing why aren&#039;t they recognised in terms of people</div><div id="00:06:05.620" class="transcript_line"> and their contribution to the country they became citizens of?</div><div id="00:06:10.620" class="transcript_line"> .</div></div></p>
