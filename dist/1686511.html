place</div><div id="00:01:25.340" class="transcript_line"> dominated by the coal exchange which took a piece of land away from</div><div id="00:01:31.540" class="transcript_line"> Mount Stewart Square and</div><div id="00:01:34.180" class="transcript_line"> That because it occupied the once open central space</div><div id="00:01:39.020" class="transcript_line"> The square contains a high</div><div

the east</div><div id="00:02:44.300" class="transcript_line"> the Glamorganshire Canal was drained in December 1951 when a</div><div id="00:02:51.460" class="transcript_line"> steam suction dredger crashed into the inner lock gates</div><div id="00:02:56.500" class="transcript_line"> Forcing them to collapse and all the water was released into the estuary</div><div id="00:03:01.660" class="transcript_line"> that actually resolved a problem for the council because</div><div id="00:03:06.620" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t know what to do with it and it was too expensive to</div><div id="00:03:11.700" class="transcript_line"> to resolve its faults</div><div id="00:03:14.460" class="transcript_line"> Well, the gates were never repaired and for a number of years the canal remained dry</div><div id="00:03:19.780" class="transcript_line"> Until the land was filled in and converted to parkland</div><div id="00:03:24.020" class="transcript_line"> namely</div><div id="00:03:25.060" class="transcript_line"> Canal Park the square lies approximately half a mile to the south of Loudoun Square</div><div id="00:03:31.740" class="transcript_line"> Which was also built as a residential square, but never actually developed into a commercial hub</div><div id="00:03:38.620" class="transcript_line"> It junctions with James Street and West Bute Street</div><div

Mount Stewart Square has a distinctive form with buildings on four sides facing the Cardiff Coal Exchange in the centre</div><div id="00:04:04.540" class="transcript_line"> It is not a square in the true sense</div><div id="00:04:07.860" class="transcript_line"> because the building there was limited by the physical restrictions of</div><div id="00:04:12.140" class="transcript_line"> the canal</div><div id="00:04:13.980" class="transcript_line"> Now Mount Stewart Square is closely linked to its its development is closely linked to that the coal industry in South Wales</div><div id="00:04:21.620" class="transcript_line"> the mining of coal in the South Wales valleys in the</div><div id="00:04:24.980" class="transcript_line"> 1790s onward meant that card developed into a port through which the coal was shipped and exported worldwide</div><div id="00:04:32.900" class="transcript_line"> It was initially transported using the Glenorchinshire Canal and later by rail on the Taft Vale Railway</div><div id="00:04:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Both of which terminated close to the site of the square a number of docks were constructed to</div><div id="00:04:46.860" class="transcript_line"> Filosylate the movement of this coal and the entire Bute town area of Cardiff was transformed to accommodate the new industry</div><div id="00:04:55.300" class="transcript_line"> and by the 1830s</div><div id="00:04:57.420" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff became the preeminent iron exporting port</div><div id="00:05:01.620" class="transcript_line"> shipping almost half of Britain&#039;s overseas iron exports between</div><div id="00:05:07.020" class="transcript_line"> 1840 and</div><div id="00:05:08.220" class="transcript_line"> 1870 and</div><div id="00:05:09.620" class="transcript_line"> then coal began to dominate and</div><div id="00:05:14.060" class="transcript_line"> the population of the area increased accordingly and</div><div id="00:05:18.340" class="transcript_line"> The grid pattern residential suburb for port related workers was built on land which included the site of the square</div><div id="00:05:29.740" class="transcript_line"> Now Mount Stewart Square was constructed in</div><div id="00:05:33.060" class="transcript_line"> 1855 as a very select resident residential enclave around ornamental gardens</div><div id="00:05:39.780" class="transcript_line"> merchants and sea captains and originally consisted of 45 stuccoed three-story townhouses</div><div id="00:05:47.900" class="transcript_line"> The land was originally mud fat, but later the Cardiff glassworks had partly occupied the area as</div><div id="00:05:55.740" class="transcript_line"> A result the underlying soil was a mixture of mud and slag from the glass which</div><div id="00:06:01.900" class="transcript_line"> Which required 30 feet of concrete shafts to be constructed</div><div id="00:06:07.300" class="transcript_line"> That rested on a bed of hard gravel in order to construct the foundations of the square</div><div id="00:06:13.460" class="transcript_line"> In the period immediately before construction of the square commenced the land was used as a stables for canal horses</div><div id="00:06:22.500" class="transcript_line"> Named after Lord Mount Stewart the area was the vision of the second Marquis</div><div id="00:06:28.820" class="transcript_line"> John Crichton Stewart</div><div id="00:06:31.140" class="transcript_line"> Second Marquis of Bute who wanted to create a grand Georgian space to rival</div><div id="00:06:37.740" class="transcript_line"> Barclay Square in London</div><div id="00:06:40.140" class="transcript_line"> The development of the square was part of his vision to transform</div><div id="00:06:44.260" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff into a major port</div><div id="00:06:47.300" class="transcript_line"> improve the value of his own lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields</div><div id="00:06:55.260" class="transcript_line"> As the docks rose in prominent wealthy residents moved out and it became a commercial centre</div><div id="00:07:01.460" class="transcript_line"> the construction of the coal exchange building</div><div id="00:07:05.740" class="transcript_line"> Solidified the change in focus to commercial and it became central to the coal trade activity</div><div id="00:07:11.340" class="transcript_line"> the coal exchange area meant that</div><div id="00:07:14.380" class="transcript_line"> Those of the original townhouses not converted were replaced by purpose-built offices for coal and shipping agents</div><div id="00:07:22.300" class="transcript_line"> The</div><div id="00:07:26.300" class="transcript_line"> Building surrounded the coal exchange housed coal companies banks and agents</div><div id="00:07:32.300" class="transcript_line"> most of</div><div id="00:07:33.500" class="transcript_line"> Cardiff&#039;s notable architects of the period are represented</div><div id="00:07:38.260" class="transcript_line"> including Alexander roots</div><div id="00:07:40.380" class="transcript_line"> architect of the Bute state Edwin Seward EWM Corbett Percy Thomas and Henry Budging</div><div id="00:07:47.620" class="transcript_line"> The impact of World War one was significant on the square</div><div id="00:07:51.740" class="transcript_line"> Having a damaging effect on the coal industry</div><div id="00:07:55.380" class="transcript_line"> By 1921 only six of the 52 companies operating in 1898 were still in business</div><div id="00:08:02.460" class="transcript_line"> with the industry never recovering</div><div id="00:08:06.460" class="transcript_line"> The coal exchange closed</div><div id="00:08:08.500" class="transcript_line"> Which in reduced which in turn reduced the demand for commercial premises on the square and allowed boarding houses to be established</div><div id="00:08:16.700" class="transcript_line"> And by the early early 20th century all banks had vacated their properties on the square</div><div id="00:08:22.220" class="transcript_line"> The western side of the square saw a gradual demolition of original properties and by the</div><div id="00:08:28.500" class="transcript_line"> 1990s was no longer enclosed on its border with a canal much of the land was being used at open-air car parks</div><div id="00:08:36.500" class="transcript_line"> Until the construction of st. James and st. Stephen&#039;s mansions which once again enclosed the square</div><div id="00:08:43.540" class="transcript_line"> Mount Stewart Square has been home to a number of religious buildings in addition to its function as a</div><div id="00:08:50.540" class="transcript_line"> residential and commercial space the only remaining building st.
