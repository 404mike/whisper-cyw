Well, I started being a participant in 1996, but I actually came across Carnival a couple of years before that.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> When I first moved to Cardiff, I was out with my brother in town and the Carnival literally came across us and sort of started, well, trooping past us.</div><div id="00:01:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We must have been sort of in the Park Place area and I can just remember being completely wowed by it.</div><div id="00:01:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I recognised a couple of people in the parade, a friend Kimmy and Meg dancing past with a big, I think it was a big black umbrella she had.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So then we sort of got swept away by it and sort of went up to the museum steps where the finale part of the parade was happening.</div><div id="00:01:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I think Benjamin Zephaniah was involved that year and there was sort of a big anti-drugs type chant going on with, don&#039;t chase the dragon, chase the something.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Repeated over and over again, but it was really high energy.</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> It was sort of obviously, you know, the Carnival colours and dances and it was just really lively, really enjoyed sort of being, you know, watching it and being part of the crowd and was really wowed by it.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And didn&#039;t think anything of it really until a couple of years later when I met my then boyfriend Guy, who&#039;d been a participant in the Carnival for a few years and he dragged me along to the mass camp to have a look, see what was going on and to get me involved.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So back then I was just 21 and my eldest son was three.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So we both got involved and I just really enjoyed it.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Back then it was in Cotets Community Centre and it was much more about the mass camp.</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the part that I really enjoyed.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the kind of three weeks of going every day, socialising, making new friends, lots of quirky new friends, people like Keith and, you know, Marilyn Marion.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to remember back those days, sort of those there was a big group of kids as well as parents, young people, also getting involved, sort of making things.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And back then it was, you couldn&#039;t do it now, but everyone was sort of sharing fags and having a drink, a lager, etc.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the community centre, obviously doesn&#039;t happen now in mass camp, but that was the sort of what it was like back then where it was sort of three weeks of almost sort of nonstop socialising and partying and making costumes at the same time.</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I also, that&#039;s the first time I ever got on stilts as well, a guy persuaded me to have a go and I never thought I would let go.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But he gave me to Kevin, who was then teaching people to do stilts and who automatically let go and made me go on my own.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the scariest thing ever, but it was indoors as well.</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was quite mad. So just tried lots and lots of different things.</div><div id="00:04:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And my son sort of tried lots of different things as well.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Back then, I didn&#039;t do a lot in the way of adventurous costume making.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I can remember Guy making a big Egyptian sort of dog mask thing.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas Tathan, my son, was a monkey, so just needed minimal tail making, etc.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was a desert nomad. So again, didn&#039;t, didn&#039;t, you know, turban, smock, didn&#039;t need a lot of work.</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was more about the socialising, having a go at different things.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And that year we were doing singing because the sections that year were sort of split into desert, sea.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the other ones, but we were in the desert section where there were some people with kind of incredible Egyptian themed costumes</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and then others with sort of simple sort of desert type things or post apocalyptic kind of Mad Max looking kind of costumes as well.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But each section had a song that Mohammed had sort of given each section a song.</div><div id="00:05:54.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was me, Guy, Sally McLennan, who I&#039;d first met there, didn&#039;t see for years again until years later.</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;ve become good friends now. But and I think there might have been one other person, but it was a small group of us who were doing the singing.</div><div id="00:06:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But Guy neglected to tell Mohammed, who&#039;s the artistic director, that he was actually going to be on stilts.</div><div id="00:06:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously myself and Sally were not on stilts.</div><div id="00:06:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So it became this big logistical problem with regard to the microphone and where we were going to be positioned.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> So in the end, he managed to work something around on the museum steps where by Guy could be right at the side, a few steps below us.</div><div id="00:06:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we were we were above so we could still share one microphone.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And that year was the year of the car where Ben and his group had this sort of</div><div id="00:06:55.000" class="transcript_line"> kind of rust bucket that they were trying to turn into a mobile sound system.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s been weeks and weeks turning into this mobile sound system.</div><div id="00:07:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And our cue for the singing at the end of the parade, when our section lined up on the museum steps, was the car coming across the bottom.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And once we saw the car move into place, then we would start singing.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was this chant that was when I started with in the shadow of the dunes.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So they were waiting and waiting and waiting for a car which never ended up appearing.</div><div id="00:07:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And someone in the end, I think, ran up to us and said, just sing, just sing.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> You can&#039;t get through. You can&#039;t get through because it was stuck.</div><div id="00:07:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there were some bollards or something in the way, which meant this car was never going to come through and be our cue.</div><div id="00:07:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But at the end of the night, it did end up being a party, a central feature in town where we all danced around it at the end in the nighttime after the parade was finished.</div><div id="00:08:01.000" class="transcript_line"> But I really enjoyed that year and it got me hooked.</div><div id="00:08:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted to participate thereon, really.</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> The following year was still Cotet&#039;s Community Centre.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s still, you know, I still see Cotet&#039;s Community Centre as being where kind of Carnival is or was, or, you know, it&#039;s still sort of the place.</div><div id="00:08:26.000" class="transcript_line"> If I think Carnival, I think Cotet&#039;s Community Centre.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the five senses year where there was lots of the sixth sense was added and that included lots of aliens.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> All the little boys wanted to be sort of alien things.</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember David, one of the boys crossing the food in the food section, they had cupcakes and big cupcake skirts.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And David decided he wanted to be an alien jumping out of a cupcake.</div><div id="00:08:57.000" class="transcript_line"> So he had made this elaborate costume.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was the first year I started actually sort of making sort of any serious costumes.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was doing an alien for my little boy.</div><div id="00:09:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was with a dance group and we were red hot chilli peppers.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So I made these kind of tapered red dresses with kind of and we were printing them ourselves with kind of pepper designs.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in a group with June then, June Campbell Davis and we for that year.</div><div id="00:09:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And I had a couple of years off then because of having babies and came back into it in 2000.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d moved then. Cotet&#039;s Community Centre was no more.</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was a bit sad. But we were at chapter here.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the first year that Fred was in it.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So Fred was he&#039;s my second son and Fred was two, I think. Yeah, must have been two.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s sort of those the years following, I was always kind of in sections with the children rather than in a dance section,</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but always trying to sort of do something a little bit different and do my own thing as well as herding children or herding cats.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And so that was the first year was the shaman section.</div><div id="00:10:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And so we did a big elaborate dressing up of a push chair for Fred.</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And we sort of were all purple and white with feathers and and things.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And that year started down the bay as well, if I remember rightly, instead, because we started in Mount Stewart Primary School.</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a different route as well.</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Again, year after we were back here in chapter and it was a low budget year, I&#039;d say,</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> where everything was made out of with these and sticky back plastic that must have got a job lot from somewhere.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was Ben and Jude then who were kind of helping helping the kids sort of create their own creations.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And we were in the rights of spring section and a little bit rather tough and wanted to be a dragon.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And Fred wanted to be sheep.</div><div id="00:11:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was then tasked with helping them create these these animals, which were then paraded.</div><div id="00:11:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I decided I&#039;d be a massive daisy.</div><div id="00:11:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, but I made a kind of a winged jobby from day based on daisy flower.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And again, the following year, there was the rat racers.</div><div id="00:11:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They had they they were making cars again out of sticky back plastic and each sort of individualizing their own cars to race each other.</div><div id="00:11:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I made this dress out of car parts, so I had sort of headlights, bra, that kind of thing and steering wheel type headpiece and various things.</div><div id="00:12:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I had these big flags and was trying to control lots of little boys in cars who had been told they were rat racers and wanted to race.</div><div id="00:12:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So but in a parade, then trying to hold them back and without them running away, it was sort of like a lot a lot of juggling, juggling with kids and sort of that.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Always good friend. And I had a similar similar problem the following year, because they were they were I was with a group of kids being airplanes.</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Who again, wanted to fly all over the place, so needing to be controlled.</div><div id="00:12:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But I was I&#039;d I&#039;d I&#039;d done a dress that was sort of on the theme of a runway with a headpiece that was like an airplane.</div><div id="00:13:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So I was again trying to control lots of children, one of which was Caroline&#039;s daughter, who in the lineup informed me, I think I might be allergic to face paint scratching.</div><div id="00:13:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Quickly having to sort of rush to the bathroom and kind of wash everything off.</div><div id="00:13:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had a bit of a panic attack.</div><div id="00:13:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So I think that that was for a sort of few years I was sort of in children&#039;s sections.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Until 2005, when it was the Blue Devils year when Spooky and Catcher came over from Trinidad and myself and Fred.</div><div id="00:13:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Fred was seven years old.</div><div id="00:13:43.000" class="transcript_line"> We just loved it.</div><div id="00:13:44.000" class="transcript_line"> We went to every single workshop because we loved it.</div><div id="00:13:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We just thought it was fantastic.</div><div id="00:13:49.000" class="transcript_line"> The whole sort of well, spooky and his kind of menacing presence and the whole dance.</div><div id="00:13:54.000" class="transcript_line"> We just loved it.</div><div id="00:13:55.000" class="transcript_line"> We went to every single one because we thought we would, you know, we were really taken by the kind of Blue Devils concept.</div><div id="00:14:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that was probably one of my favourite parades despite pouring rain because obviously the costume involves very little clothing,</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> but being head to toe in blue body paint.</div><div id="00:14:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think that was one of my favourite parades despite pouring rain because obviously the costume involves very little clothing,</div><div id="00:14:30.000" class="transcript_line"> but being head to toe in blue body paint with some horns, a tail, maybe a pitchfork.</div><div id="00:14:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Did we have wings? We must have had wings. We must have had some blue wings as well.</div><div id="00:14:45.000" class="transcript_line"> But mostly it was being painted head to foot in blue.</div><div id="00:14:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the costume.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, that year it poured with rain.</div><div id="00:14:54.000" class="transcript_line"> It was chucking it down.</div><div id="00:14:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember going through the bay because the parade went through the bay that year and it pouring with rain that with the body paint running off us</div><div id="00:15:10.000" class="transcript_line"> because we were going from blue to green and then swicker volunteers kind of running up with big buckets of body paint.</div><div id="00:15:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So we could splash it over us again and sort of keep touching up and keep touching up.</div><div id="00:15:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was like running off us and the street was running with like blue water.</div><div id="00:15:29.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was really good fun. It was really good fun kind of because it was the first year really of trying to...</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Previously, I think in the parades we&#039;d been sort of entertaining people,</div><div id="00:15:43.000" class="transcript_line"> but with the Blue Devils you&#039;re actually trying to scare people and sort of shock and surprise.</div><div id="00:15:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And so it was a really different way to play carnival.</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was kind of jumping at people, kind of being menacing, kind of making babies cry.</div><div id="00:16:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It was there was a really different sort of style of carnival from what we&#039;d been sort of doing in the years leading up to that.</div><div id="00:16:08.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was really good fun.</div><div id="00:16:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And plus, I think that year was the first year I met Kath Leggett and we were Blue Devils together and we were being very naughty.</div><div id="00:16:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And we did have a little bit of a drink to keep out the cold before we started, which helped in keeping us going.</div><div id="00:16:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And we just had such a ball that year kind of running around and yes, causing trouble.</div><div id="00:16:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And Fred Levim, he really enjoyed it that year as well because, you know, how can you go wrong?</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Kind of little boys with pitchforks, you know, they had a great time.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> The following year, I made a bit of a mistake costume wise.</div><div id="00:16:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d been asked whether myself and the boys wanted to be in a big Chinese dragon costume, which was in separate sections, but joined together.</div><div id="00:17:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And I found that one really restricting because I&#039;ve always liked sort of playing, dancing with the crowd and sort of, yeah, just doing my own thing.</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas that year just felt a bit tied in and a bit, yeah, very restricted in my movement.</div><div id="00:17:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So I kind of decided at that point that I&#039;d never do a massive costume again.</div><div id="00:17:37.000" class="transcript_line"> My eldest son Tathland started doing steel pans that year as well.</div><div id="00:17:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And he kind of he sort of carried on doing that for a few years with with them Rocco until he kind of got to the sort of teenage age where he didn&#039;t you know, he didn&#039;t want to dress up anymore.</div><div id="00:17:55.000" class="transcript_line"> He was sort of sort of I think the last parade he did was part of it.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Let me have a look. I think it was in 2007.</div><div id="00:18:03.000" class="transcript_line"> And as soon as the parade finished, he whipped off his costume, threw it at me and sort of like ran off to join the big weekend with his friends.</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, so I thought, yeah, I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to be doing it again until he&#039;s kind of grown out of that and comes back as a sort of as a grown up.</div><div id="00:18:23.000" class="transcript_line"> But the following year after that was the first year that Aylir, my youngest son, was involved because Aylir was born in 2005.</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So he was a spectator in the crowd 2005, 2006 and then 2007.</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> He joined for the first time and he and myself were dancing diseases.</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was the theme. The theme was linked to the anniversary of the abolition of slavery so that we represented the disease that sort of had wiped out so many people.</div><div id="00:18:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Fred was in a different section as a bloodhound with Bud.</div><div id="00:19:02.000" class="transcript_line"> They joined up together and they were bloodhounds again being menacing and naughty in the crowd.</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, suits suits both both both them.</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But Aylir did love him. He did the whole thing on foot.</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No push chair this time. It was just him on foot and apart from a little bit of carrying now and again.</div><div id="00:19:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But he was hooked from from from the off and he&#039;s never missed the carnival since.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So from that year, he&#039;s been in it every year.</div><div id="00:19:32.000" class="transcript_line"> The year after that was the first dragon section within the carnival, which became a recurring theme.</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And myself and Aylir were dragons.</div><div id="00:19:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember making so many dragon masks.</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a bit of a production line that year because it was quite a big section.</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> But there were quite a few first time participants who didn&#039;t really know what they were doing.</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So I ended up sort of well with Caroline making sort of 10 head pieces in a row for various people.</div><div id="00:20:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I made a lot of dragon head pieces that year.</div><div id="00:20:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And and then the following year was the year that everyone was a dragon.</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the Here Be Dragons Carnival.</div><div id="00:20:24.000" class="transcript_line"> But that year we were I was in what was the sort of start of what&#039;s now Carnival Crew.</div><div id="00:20:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So we had our own dragon section.</div><div id="00:20:33.000" class="transcript_line"> But Aylir wasn&#039;t part of that group.</div><div id="00:20:37.000" class="transcript_line"> So it meant that I had to ask my husband, Rickson, to be part of the carnival and to be with Aylir</div><div id="00:20:48.000" class="transcript_line"> because Aylir really, really wanted to join in and be involved, but couldn&#039;t do it on his own.</div><div id="00:20:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And so by default, Rickson had to be in it.</div><div id="00:21:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And he wasn&#039;t interested in making costumes or anything like that.</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had to make all the costumes and he just turned up on the day.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But really, really enjoyed himself once he did it.</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s done it every year since.</div><div id="00:21:17.000" class="transcript_line"> But on the basic stipulation that I make him a costume and the costume has to make him anonymous.</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So either some sort of mask or headpiece that sort of hides his identity.</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> And once he&#039;s hidden, he&#039;s quite happy to kind of play a role and be a full part of the carnival.</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So all dragons.</div><div id="00:21:48.000" class="transcript_line"> But from my participation then in that initial dragon carnival group,</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I got asked and invited to join Samba Galez&#039;s dance group.</div><div id="00:22:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So from that year onwards, I&#039;ve always been part of the Samba Galez dance group, which is great.</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s sort of more choreographed compared to what I was doing before.</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I always danced in the carnival, but not in a choreographed way.</div><div id="00:22:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas now I&#039;m in a group where it&#039;s structured and choreographed.</div><div id="00:22:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite high energy.</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done lots of parades in the rain since then, which sometimes is welcome to us</div><div id="00:22:33.000" class="transcript_line"> because we&#039;ve got really hot and bothered dancing and then we can cool off in the rain.</div><div id="00:22:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve also started making since then, making bigger and bigger costumes every year</div><div id="00:22:47.000" class="transcript_line"> because as Ayler has grown up, he&#039;s become more and more demanding and more creative in his thinking</div><div id="00:22:53.000" class="transcript_line"> with regards to what he&#039;d like to be.</div><div id="00:22:57.000" class="transcript_line"> For years, he talks about being a turtle.</div><div id="00:23:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So the first year that there was an Anything Goes theme,</div><div id="00:23:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I said, all right, then you can be a turtle.</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But I hadn&#039;t a clue where to start with making a turtle.</div><div id="00:23:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But luckily, again, I&#039;d met people at carnival camp.</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There was Jude, who does a lot of basket weaving, who helped me with the shell for the turtle.</div><div id="00:23:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And also Ray, who helped me with the</div><div id="00:23:30.400" class="transcript_line"> actually sort of making a frame and a backpack for Ayler.</div><div id="00:23:35.400" class="transcript_line"> So that was the first massive costume that I made.</div><div id="00:23:40.400" class="transcript_line"> And then every year since then, Ayler has got bigger and better ideas of what he wants to be.</div><div id="00:23:46.400" class="transcript_line"> So the following year was a rain cloud.</div><div id="00:23:48.400" class="transcript_line"> And then last year was a massive, this year rather, was a massive rain cloud.</div><div id="00:23:54.400" class="transcript_line"> He wanted sort of almost like a totem pole of African masks, as you do.</div><div id="00:23:59.400" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d researched it, found the types of masks he&#039;d wanted on the Internet.</div><div id="00:24:04.400" class="transcript_line"> So again, it was this big challenge to try and sort of match Ayler&#039;s vision</div><div id="00:24:11.400" class="transcript_line"> and what I could make in the three weeks available with the results.</div><div id="00:24:16.400" class="transcript_line"> And then he was able to do that.</div><div id="00:24:19.400" class="transcript_line"> And so that was the first big challenge.</div><div id="00:24:22.400" class="transcript_line"> And then last year was a massive,</div><div id="00:24:25.400" class="transcript_line"> I think, big challenge to try and match Ayler&#039;s vision</div><div id="00:24:30.400" class="transcript_line"> and what I could make in the three weeks available with the results available.</div><div id="00:24:34.400" class="transcript_line"> And I think we did a pretty good job.</div><div id="00:24:37.400" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m dreading what he comes up with next year.</div><div id="00:24:40.400" class="transcript_line"> Because it&#039;s just going to be, oh no, what next?</div><div id="00:24:44.400" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s in terms of emphasis, I suppose.</div><div id="00:24:49.400" class="transcript_line"> I think I started off, it was more of a go along for a social.</div><div id="00:24:55.400" class="transcript_line"> And I had no experience of making anything at all, really.</div><div id="00:24:59.400" class="transcript_line"> And in the first years I didn&#039;t really make much.</div><div id="00:25:02.400" class="transcript_line"> Or I followed other people&#039;s instructions.</div><div id="00:25:04.400" class="transcript_line"> If someone told me to print this there, then I did that.</div><div id="00:25:08.400" class="transcript_line"> Or stick this there.</div><div id="00:25:10.400" class="transcript_line"> I just followed orders, as it were.</div><div id="00:25:13.400" class="transcript_line"> Whereas now I do a lot more of my own design and making work</div><div id="00:25:19.400" class="transcript_line"> with a bit of support from those who know what will fall over</div><div id="00:25:24.400" class="transcript_line"> and what won&#039;t fall over, or what materials I should be using</div><div id="00:25:27.400" class="transcript_line"> and what I shouldn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:25:28.400" class="transcript_line"> But otherwise, a lot of the making I do myself,</div><div id="00:25:32.400" class="transcript_line"> and the bigger and better.</div><div id="00:25:34.400" class="transcript_line"> Also, obviously I started off with singing.</div><div id="00:25:38.400" class="transcript_line"> Did a little bit of dance.</div><div id="00:25:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Then was mostly in kid sections.</div><div id="00:25:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Whereas now I&#039;m back to what I wanted to do originally,</div><div id="00:25:49.400" class="transcript_line"> which was dance.</div><div id="00:25:50.400" class="transcript_line"> But then the making for the rest of the family,</div><div id="00:25:54.400" class="transcript_line"> so that they can participate as well.</div><div id="00:25:57.400" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, it&#039;s changed over the years.</div><div id="00:26:00.400" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;d thoroughly recommend it.</div><div id="00:26:03.400" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the high point of the summer every year.</div><div id="00:26:07.400" class="transcript_line"> Kath McShane with an impressive 17 Cardiff Carnivals under your belt.</div><div id="00:26:13.400" class="transcript_line"> I wish to formally declare for posterity,</div><div id="00:26:15.400" class="transcript_line"> you are indeed a Cardiff Carnival hero.</div><div id="00:26:18.400" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:26:19.400" class="transcript_line"> Thank you.</div></div></p>
