Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s when I first met you, was up in that little office.</div><div id="00:00:49.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s smashing. I remember in early July 1990</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> being invited to a meeting by key movers and shakers in the Bute Town,</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> the Docks community, to decide whether or not, even at this late stage,</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> there should be a carnival, a Bute Town carnival for 1990.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I was in a lucky position of being able to say,</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> in terms of a parade, Swicker can provide.</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> We had the first ever Cardiff Mars Carnival that year</div><div id="00:01:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and over half the participants, all of whom were aged 14 and under,</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> were from the Bute Town area.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And if there were to be a carnival, I remember Swicker offering</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> to remount at no cost to the Bute Town carnival the parade.</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And as I recall, you were in that meeting, always a voice of positivity</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> and we can and the rest of it.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course the Bute Town carnival happened in 1990</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and Swicker effectively provided the parade,</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> which led us to our cunning plan, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> It was.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> After you Ray, what was the cunning plan?</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the plan was to sort of broaden it, actually to broaden it,</div><div id="00:02:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s where Cardiff Bay Development Company came in,</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> which they were very, very helpful.</div><div id="00:02:15.000" class="transcript_line"> I must agree, you could agree on that,</div><div id="00:02:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because they did a wonderful job of funding.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely. So back in the day, of course, the docks of detail...</div><div id="00:02:27.000" class="transcript_line"> The 1990 carnival was not... it was good, it was very good actually,</div><div id="00:02:34.000" class="transcript_line"> but I think both you and both the carnival, the Bute Town carnival,</div><div id="00:02:40.000" class="transcript_line"> were based on the learning curve to try to improve it,</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> which was, it did improve, very much so, it did very much improve.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> But then 1991, that was when Cardiff Bay,</div><div id="00:02:58.000" class="transcript_line"> it was Cardiff Bay Development Corporation&#039;s carnival.</div><div id="00:03:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So CBDC, as it was known, the acronym,</div><div id="00:03:07.000" class="transcript_line"> we were able to persuade them, so in 1991, two separate carnivals,</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> the Cardiff Maast carnival, run by Swickert,</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> and the Bute Town carnival, run by the Bute Town carnival committee,</div><div id="00:03:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and particularly, well you were in the chair, weren&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but I didn&#039;t have...</div><div id="00:03:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So you spent the whole time at the community centre and everything.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was chairman at that particular time,</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> but I didn&#039;t have that much input into the carnival itself,</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> because the carnival committee itself was running it,</div><div id="00:03:39.000" class="transcript_line"> well it was running it, you know, so,</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> and they said both the Bute Town community centre,</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> carnival committee and Swickert sort of merged together,</div><div id="00:03:52.000" class="transcript_line"> which was, I was hoping that there would be a very good collaboration</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> between the two of us.</div><div id="00:03:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> But unfortunately, it didn&#039;t work out that way.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think what we can say to future generations is that in 1991,</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> effectively, Swickert was acting as producers for a joint carnival,</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Swickert&#039;s always been keen to be open to everybody on a city-wide basis,</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> and of course, the remit of the Bute Town carnival was quite rightly</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> to celebrate the Docks community and its heritage and its future in particular,</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> but we were able to bridge those for one year,</div><div id="00:04:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was, you know, very much at the forefront of persuading CBDC</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> to invest in this new vision, a city-wide carnival,</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> but one based in and around Bute Town, so they were first among equals,</div><div id="00:04:48.000" class="transcript_line"> and CBDC came up with a funding line of Â£25,000,</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> which back in those days was reasonable,</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was certainly obviously a multi-billion pound operation,</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> to put it mildly, and in 1991, for one year only,</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> we were able to put both carnivals together</div><div id="00:05:07.000" class="transcript_line"> and effectively bring it off and produce the biggest and best.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it wasn&#039;t the best at that particular time.</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely, yes, in that era, of course,</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> because Bute Town Carnival has got a very different era.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it over, and then after that, 1991,</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> then Bute Town Carnival committee sort of disappeared.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> There was a slow, gradual decline,</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> and the two carnivals separated and went their separate ways, as it were.</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was, I thought, at that particular time, which was wrong,</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t like the idea of the partnership parting.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> No, looking back, I mean, we had a moment there,</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> and we certainly have shown that it could work.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose if we could get back in time,</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I think that&#039;s probably a decision both of us would like to change.</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, looking back in retrospect, yes, it would be fine.</div><div id="00:06:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps we wouldn&#039;t be in the position that we&#039;re in today.</div><div id="00:06:09.000" class="transcript_line"> No, precisely, you just can&#039;t say.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously, you and your personal history is closely linked to the DOCS community,</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and I wonder if you care to tell us a bit about,</div><div id="00:06:21.000" class="transcript_line"> and also obviously your roots in terms of Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you tell us a bit about your background?</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, both my parents were from Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother came over just before the end of the 1800s, 1890s.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> She came over.</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The people who brought my mother over from Cape Verde</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> was the Millers of Millers and Corry, the coal people.</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:06:58.000" class="transcript_line"> She lived in Bristol.</div><div id="00:07:01.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where they came, when they came back from Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:07:05.000" class="transcript_line"> They lived in Bath, Bristol.</div><div id="00:07:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But then she came into Cardiff because her friend,</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> who was also brought over by the, I don&#039;t say the Millers and Corry company,</div><div id="00:07:23.000" class="transcript_line"> but the persons who worked for them, which was the, the family name was Rice.</div><div id="00:07:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And they brought her over, and she had a shop in Angelina Street.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s called Mrs. Lopes, and it was renowned for the parrot that was hanging out there.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> She kept in the shop, you know, and everybody knows Mrs. Lopes.</div><div id="00:07:51.000" class="transcript_line"> They say Mrs. Lopes, and they always say, mention the parrot.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite a local character.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how she met my father, because my father, being a seaman,</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> he was in and out of Cardiff.</div><div id="00:08:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I have a discharge book of my father&#039;s, which was a continuation of a discharge book.</div><div id="00:08:15.000" class="transcript_line"> And the first date in that discharge book was 1902.</div><div id="00:08:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So obviously he must have been back and forth on the ships before 1902, you know,</div><div id="00:08:28.000" class="transcript_line"> which I found to be very interesting, you know.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, they met, they got married, and they settled down in Sapphire Street,</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> 34 Sapphire Street, and that&#039;s where the family home.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> That was the family home.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We did move once to Loudoun Square.</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And that would be how long in terms of distance from one to another?</div><div id="00:08:49.000" class="transcript_line"> This was not a...</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, it was only about 300, 400 yards.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I was about to say.</div><div id="00:08:55.000" class="transcript_line"> It was, I&#039;d say, two streets away.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Two streets away, that sounds right.</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We only stayed there for one night, that whole night,</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and we could move back down into our old family home.</div><div id="00:09:07.000" class="transcript_line"> For what reasons, I don&#039;t know, because I was only speaking.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no, that&#039;s how interesting.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s where my parents, they were from the island of Santa Clara.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And of course, the Bute Island community had a Cape Verde society.</div><div id="00:09:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell us a bit about that.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Society, well, the society was formed in 1987.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was the year that the Cape Verdes had their independence from Portugal.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> In July 5th, 1987.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> As late as that, that&#039;s incredible when you think about it, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> And have you had a chance to ever visit?</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I have not visited.</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately, I have not visited.</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> My son has been.</div><div id="00:09:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And what did he report back?</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> What did he make of it?</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, he went, because now the islands are being tourist, made for tourists now.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So the island he went to, which was Boa Vista, it&#039;s all tourist, you know.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, right. Tourist.</div><div id="00:10:13.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve said, if you want to go, is to go to St. Vincent itself,</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because that is not the island of St. Vincent.</div><div id="00:10:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Mindello is the capital of St. Vincent.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not the capital of the Cape Verde Islands.</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Interesting.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And the capital of Cape Verde Islands is on Santiago, a place called Praia.</div><div id="00:10:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;ve learned a lot about geography in a short period of time there.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the capital.
