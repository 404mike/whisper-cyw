Yes, yes. I went along for an interview.</div><div id="00:03:13.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I did anyway. I can&#039;t remember to be honest. I must have had an interview or the decision must have been made.</div><div id="00:03:22.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, you went along and asked for a job. And you went into a training school then to train as a machinist.</div><div id="00:03:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So how long was the training for? I think it was about six weeks. I think it was about six weeks.</div><div id="00:03:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Where you only made collars and cuffs. That&#039;s all you did. You were taught how to use the machine.</div><div id="00:03:49.560" class="transcript_line"> And they made all the collars and cuffs for the blouses we were making. So it was quite boring, you know, just making those. Same thing.</div><div id="00:04:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, was it a good training though, do you think? Oh yes, yes, excellent. Yes, it was.</div><div id="00:04:09.560" class="transcript_line"> So describe to me then that first day you walked into the factory, what was it like? What was the sound, the smell, the, you know, everything like?</div><div id="00:04:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Very overwhelming. It was absolutely nerve-racking. You had to be in the factory by 7.30 to start work.</div><div id="00:04:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And you had to be sitting at your machine at 7.30. And I can remember, I can remember it must have been either the first or the first week anyway.</div><div id="00:04:37.560" class="transcript_line"> I kept looking at the clock and thinking, you know, the day was never going to end. It seemed such a long, long day.</div><div id="00:04:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Because we didn&#039;t finish work until 5 o&#039;clock in the evening. We had a 10 minute break in the morning, half an hour for lunch and then a 10 minute break in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:04:59.560" class="transcript_line"> But each time the break, you only went when the bell rang and you had to be back on your machine by the time the finishing bell for the break to be over.</div><div id="00:05:11.560" class="transcript_line"> You had to be back on your machine. If you wanted to go to the loo, you had to put your hand up. If there was someone else in the loo, then you had to wait until that person came back.</div><div id="00:05:23.560" class="transcript_line"> So you couldn&#039;t go to the loo the same time as anyone else off that line. You had to wait your turn.</div><div id="00:05:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So were they quite strict, you think?</div><div id="00:05:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, very strict, yes. Yes. No swearing. You weren&#039;t allowed to swear. If anyone was caught swearing, they were sent home.</div><div id="00:05:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Forever or just?</div><div id="00:05:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, no. No, but they would be sent home. Yes, yes. It was very strict. It was very prim and proper.</div><div id="00:05:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:05:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Everyone wore overalls and everyone...</div><div id="00:06:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m not saying... Oh, the singing. We used to sing all day because we&#039;d listen to the radio in the morning and the radio would come on.</div><div id="00:06:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I think it was around about eight o&#039;clock the radio came on and at nine o&#039;clock it was a programme with all the local pop music.</div><div id="00:06:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d all sing along to that. Then the radio would go off at eleven o&#039;clock and come back on at one o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:06:27.560" class="transcript_line"> And at one o&#039;clock it was... I think it was called Worker&#039;s Playtime at one o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:06:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;d be a comedian or a local artist, you know, well, quite famous artist, not local, at one o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:06:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So everybody would enjoy that. Then it would go off again then. And I don&#039;t think it came back on in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:06:52.560" class="transcript_line"> That was all we were allowed on the radio. But the radio took off the monotony of the work, you know.</div><div id="00:06:59.560" class="transcript_line"> So do you think it helped then?</div><div id="00:07:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, very much so.</div><div id="00:07:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you allowed to talk when you were on the machines?</div><div id="00:07:06.560" class="transcript_line"> No, you weren&#039;t allowed to talk. You weren&#039;t allowed to chat. That was taboo.</div><div id="00:07:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember one particular day I was standing at the side of the machine because the girl that I was talking to was doing buttonholes.</div><div id="00:07:24.560" class="transcript_line"> She was buttonholing. Then she would hand the garment to me and I would mark for the buttons.</div><div id="00:07:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So we were chatting away, working at the same time, but chatting away and laughing.</div><div id="00:07:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And I looked up and I caught the eye of the managed dress, Mrs. Taylor her name was.</div><div id="00:07:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And she came to work in a navy blue suit with a white blouse every day in a taxi.</div><div id="00:07:49.560" class="transcript_line"> And her office had glass windows all the way around it. So she could see every part of the factory floor from her office.</div><div id="00:07:58.560" class="transcript_line"> And I looked up like that and caught her eye. And she came straight out of the office, straight over to me and said,</div><div id="00:08:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Go back to your machine. She said and stopped laughing and giggling.</div><div id="00:08:11.560" class="transcript_line"> I was shaking my shoes.</div><div id="00:08:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I was going to say, how did you feel that somebody had been talking to you?</div><div id="00:08:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it was terrible, terrible. And of course then the supervisor came up and she told me off because the supervisor also had a telling off from the managed dress because I was laughing.</div><div id="00:08:29.560" class="transcript_line"> But you were just simply passing the time of day, you were still working.</div><div id="00:08:33.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the kind of atmosphere it was, you know, very strict.</div><div id="00:08:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you worry about losing your job?</div><div id="00:08:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes you did.</div><div id="00:08:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Did people lose their jobs for being disruptive or laughing?</div><div id="00:08:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. Yes, if you didn&#039;t do your work, you know, if you weren&#039;t pulling your weight, then you would lose your job, yes.</div><div id="00:09:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you had to keep up on a line, you see, on a production line.</div><div id="00:09:07.560" class="transcript_line"> So if you didn&#039;t keep up, or you were chatting and laughing or not keeping up on the line, then you would lose your job.</div><div id="00:09:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Because it was a production line. There was a belt running down the middle of the production line and the garment came down on the belt.</div><div id="00:09:25.560" class="transcript_line"> You took it off, did you a part of the work on it, put it back on the belt for the next person.</div><div id="00:09:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was a continuous line all the time. You had to keep up.</div><div id="00:09:40.560" class="transcript_line"> So you did these collars and cuffs for six weeks.</div><div id="00:09:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:09:44.560" class="transcript_line"> What did you do then?</div><div id="00:09:45.560" class="transcript_line"> I went out onto the finishing line then, where the garment was actually finished.</div><div id="00:09:51.560" class="transcript_line"> The garment went onto a production line to be made up, the side seams, all of those sleeves put in, everything like that.</div><div id="00:09:59.560" class="transcript_line"> But then it came to the finishing line where I was working because I was just starting out.</div><div id="00:10:06.560" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t go on the actual production line until you&#039;d been working there quite some time and that you were really proficient then.</div><div id="00:10:16.560" class="transcript_line"> So on the finishing line it was a much easier sort of work.</div><div id="00:10:21.560" class="transcript_line"> You had a machine sewing the buttons on, a machine doing the button holes, a machine doing the bottom hems, all that kind of thing.</div><div id="00:10:32.560" class="transcript_line"> The whole garment would be examined and the ends all cut off. It would go on to be pressed.</div><div id="00:10:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Then a final examination on a model.</div><div id="00:10:45.560" class="transcript_line"> A live model?</div><div id="00:10:47.560" class="transcript_line"> No, a mannequin.</div><div id="00:10:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know who you were making these for? What were you making and who were you making them for?</div><div id="00:11:00.560" class="transcript_line"> They were blouses made out of a print called Liberty Loan and Viola.</div><div id="00:11:11.560" class="transcript_line"> They were four, well it was a very upmarket garment.</div><div id="00:11:17.560" class="transcript_line"> They went to all the big stores in London because at that time they were costing something like £60, the blouse,</div><div id="00:11:27.560" class="transcript_line"> which would be expensive now. But at that time it was a fortune.</div><div id="00:11:33.560" class="transcript_line"> How much were you earning?</div><div id="00:11:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Well when I started work, I&#039;ve asked my friend this now and we&#039;ve discussed it and we think it was £1.076.</div><div id="00:11:45.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how much we started work on.</div><div id="00:11:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember the hours now. It would be over 40 hours a week. But it was £1.76.</div><div id="00:12:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Out of that we had to pay bus fare and give my mum some and then what was left was mine, which wasn&#039;t much.</div><div id="00:12:12.560" class="transcript_line"> They were long hours weren&#039;t they? You said you started at half seven?</div><div id="00:12:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, half seven until five in the evening.</div><div id="00:12:21.560" class="transcript_line"> How much of a lunch break did you have?</div><div id="00:12:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Half an hour.</div><div id="00:12:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Very long hours.</div><div id="00:12:28.560" class="transcript_line"> It was very long hours.</div><div id="00:12:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So did your wages go up when you stopped being a trainee?</div><div id="00:12:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Slightly, yes you did. You had a small amount more then.</div><div id="00:12:43.560" class="transcript_line"> I think when you went on to the full production line you earned a little bit more as well.</div><div id="00:12:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you on piecework at all?</div><div id="00:12:55.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it wasn&#039;t a piecework. It was flat wage.</div><div id="00:13:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you all on the same wage or were you aware of some people having more?</div><div id="00:13:08.560" class="transcript_line"> No, everybody was on the same.</div><div id="00:13:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And did your wages go up every year then?</div><div id="00:13:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Not every year, no. I can&#039;t remember it going up every year.</div><div id="00:13:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t. I can&#039;t remember it going up every year.</div><div id="00:13:24.560" class="transcript_line"> The one incident I can remember though, because the company was owned by, I think they were a London based, and it was a Jewish company.</div><div id="00:13:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was the anniversary of the owner.</div><div id="00:13:40.560" class="transcript_line"> So they sent around a box for us to put money in to buy an anniversary present for the owner.</div><div id="00:13:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember that they bought a silver candelabra for the owner of the factory for their anniversary.</div><div id="00:13:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Incredible.</div><div id="00:14:00.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to read it from the 1.7 and 6 that we&#039;re doing here.</div><div id="00:14:04.560" class="transcript_line"> So, when you went to work at London Pride, did you know anybody working there?</div><div id="00:14:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you know any girls from school or any other members of the family?</div><div id="00:14:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it was my friend and I started together. We both went, and we both started on the same day.</div><div id="00:14:29.560" class="transcript_line"> And a school friend?</div><div id="00:14:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:14:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:14:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so I had company.</div><div id="00:14:35.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, no, I don&#039;t think I did know anyone else working there.</div><div id="00:14:38.560" class="transcript_line"> It was just that we must have known that they were taking on people, and we both wanted to do so.</div><div id="00:14:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And we just both started work together.</div><div id="00:14:52.560" class="transcript_line"> How many people worked there when you went to work there?</div><div id="00:14:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think there was about four lines of 50 people, so that would have been about 200.</div><div id="00:15:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Then there would have been the training school. I expect there was about 300 people working there.</div><div id="00:15:08.560" class="transcript_line"> And these were mainly women, were they?</div><div id="00:15:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Mainly women, yes.</div><div id="00:15:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And were there any men working there then?</div><div id="00:15:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Only the mechanics who looked after the machinery and the people in the kitchen room.</div><div id="00:15:23.560" class="transcript_line"> There were men working in the kitchen room and in the dispatch area, where the products went out to the factory.</div><div id="00:15:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Were they all men in the kitchen room?</div><div id="00:15:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Mostly, yes, mostly. The odd girls. In fact, my friend did end up working in the kitchen room.</div><div id="00:15:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Because she never went onto the machine.</div><div id="00:15:47.560" class="transcript_line"> So did your job remain kind of the same while you were there?</div><div id="00:15:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:15:55.560" class="transcript_line"> And did you find the work, you know, was it satisfying or was it...?</div><div id="00:16:02.560" class="transcript_line"> No, far from it. It was so boring.</div><div id="00:16:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it?</div><div id="00:16:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because you only did one part of it. You know, you didn&#039;t do a complete item. It was so boring. Yeah, bored me to death.</div><div id="00:16:20.560" class="transcript_line"> What kept you going then? Was it the other women?</div><div id="00:16:24.560" class="transcript_line"> The money. The thought at the end of the week we&#039;d have our wages.</div><div id="00:16:30.560" class="transcript_line"> But what about the other women? Was there a good gang working there?</div><div id="00:16:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Very, yes, yes, there were. Yes, the camaraderie was brilliant in those kind of places.</div><div id="00:16:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you all went to the same dance halls on the weekend. We&#039;d go to the Palais in Bridgend and we&#039;d all meet each other there.</div><div id="00:16:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a lovely camaraderie.</div><div id="00:16:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Was there any social events arranged by the factory?</div><div id="00:16:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Not in that particular factory. I never remembered going to any there. Not at that particular one.</div><div id="00:17:06.560" class="transcript_line"> What about day trips and stuff like that?</div><div id="00:17:09.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no. I can&#039;t remember ever going on anything organised through the factory.</div><div id="00:17:16.560" class="transcript_line"> What about your holidays then? Were you given paid holidays and do you remember what they were?</div><div id="00:17:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we were. We were given paid holidays.</div><div id="00:17:27.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure, but I think it was bank holiday. You&#039;d have one day for bank holidays.</div><div id="00:17:34.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think Christmas time, we used to have two days for Christmas.</div><div id="00:17:41.560" class="transcript_line"> What about an annual summer holiday then?</div><div id="00:17:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think it was a week. I think it was seven days, yeah, one week.</div><div id="00:17:51.560" class="transcript_line"> And did you have a choice when to take it or did the factory shut down?</div><div id="00:17:56.560" class="transcript_line"> The factory shut down. Completely. Everybody took the same. I&#039;m not sure if it was two weeks.</div><div id="00:18:03.560" class="transcript_line"> The same time as the miners&#039; holiday?</div><div id="00:18:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:18:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what you did on those holidays? Do you remember going anywhere?</div><div id="00:18:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Not in particular, no. Only perhaps on the train. We&#039;d go on the train to Puthcol or to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:18:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we used to go to—I can remember going on the train, getting on the train in Llanharren and going to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:18:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And going to Rhoath Park on the lake.</div><div id="00:18:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Rhoath Park for a holiday.</div><div id="00:18:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Barry Island. We used to go to Barry Island, yes. We did.</div><div id="00:18:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps a group of us would meet up and go.</div><div id="00:18:52.560" class="transcript_line"> So you went with friends from work, did you?</div><div id="00:18:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Not particularly from work, no. My one best friend, we always went together.</div><div id="00:19:01.560" class="transcript_line"> But there might have been perhaps a group of 10, 12 of us go. All from the same sort of social group.</div><div id="00:19:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And how did you go then, did you say?</div><div id="00:19:14.560" class="transcript_line"> On the train, yes. Because the train was actually stopping in Llanharren then.</div><div id="00:19:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d go on the train.</div><div id="00:19:23.560" class="transcript_line"> All the way to Barry Island?</div><div id="00:19:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. And Puthcol. It actually went into Puthcol then.</div><div id="00:19:31.560" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only places I can remember going.</div><div id="00:19:36.560" class="transcript_line"> And my friend and I did go to Liverpool to my sister.</div><div id="00:19:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And we stayed with her. I think we stayed there a week. With my sister and her husband.</div><div id="00:19:48.560" class="transcript_line"> We went up on the train on our own, which was a huge adventure then.</div><div id="00:19:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Because we had to change in crew.</div><div id="00:19:57.560" class="transcript_line"> How on earth we got to Liverpool, I&#039;ll never know.</div><div id="00:20:03.560" class="transcript_line"> So tell me then about unions. Were there any unions in the factory?</div><div id="00:20:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you all members?</div><div id="00:20:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:20:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And can you remember any disputes or anything?</div><div id="00:20:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Not in the first, not in London Pride, no. Later on, yes later on, sorry towards the 70s, but not when I first started work.</div><div id="00:20:30.560" class="transcript_line"> So what were the conditions like in London Pride?</div><div id="00:20:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, it was clean. And it was clean work.</div><div id="00:20:42.560" class="transcript_line"> There was a canteen where you could go and eat and it was a nice clean atmosphere.</div><div id="00:20:48.560" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t, you didn&#039;t come home filthy dirty or anything.</div><div id="00:20:54.560" class="transcript_line"> And you could buy, you could actually buy the material.</div><div id="00:20:58.560" class="transcript_line"> So my friend and I, if they were selling the material, we&#039;d buy the material and we&#039;d go home and we&#039;d make a new outfit to go out on Saturday.</div><div id="00:21:07.560" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d have a, we loved it. We&#039;d have a new outfit nearly every week because we bought the material, quite reasonable off cuts.</div><div id="00:21:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And went home and sold it and had a new outfit to go out.</div><div id="00:21:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And was it good material?</div><div id="00:21:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Very, yes.</div><div id="00:21:23.560" class="transcript_line"> What about the actual garments? Were they ever, you know, were there any sort of seconds of garments you could, you know?</div><div id="00:21:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you could, I think. You could buy the garments, the seconds, but they were still too expensive for us to buy.</div><div id="00:21:40.560" class="transcript_line"> We couldn&#039;t afford to buy the seconds even.</div><div id="00:21:44.560" class="transcript_line"> No, we&#039;d buy the material and make them ourselves.</div><div id="00:21:53.560" class="transcript_line"> You said it was a clean factory, but was it too hot or too cold or anything? Do you remember any issues like that?</div><div id="00:22:00.560" class="transcript_line"> No, not really. In the summer, we&#039;d open all the windows.</div><div id="00:22:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember it being, I mean, in the mornings, it was very cold in the mornings going to work because it was so early.</div><div id="00:22:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And when you went into the factory, obviously it was cold going into the factory in the morning.</div><div id="00:22:20.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was never, it never seemed to be overly cold or overly hot. Not that particular factory.</div><div id="00:22:29.560" class="transcript_line"> The conditions were quite good.</div><div id="00:22:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And what about the facilities, the toilets, the things?</div><div id="00:22:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:22:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Was that quite good as well?</div><div id="00:22:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. Compared to what I experienced further on in my working life, yes.</div><div id="00:22:49.560" class="transcript_line"> And were you aware, was the work at all dangerous?</div><div id="00:22:56.560" class="transcript_line"> No. Only in the fact that you watched your fingers, getting your fingers caught in the needles and things like that, you know.</div><div id="00:23:06.560" class="transcript_line"> You could get your finger caught in the needle because there were electric-operated machines, particularly the sort of the buttonhole machine.</div><div id="00:23:16.560" class="transcript_line"> You made sure you kept your fingers away.</div><div id="00:23:19.560" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t remember any bad accidents or anything?</div><div id="00:23:21.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:23:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you made aware of health and safety?</div><div id="00:23:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, no. No, there was unheard of then in those days.</div><div id="00:23:30.560" class="transcript_line"> We did have a restroom in London Pride, though. There was a restroom there for people who were really ill and they&#039;d take you there.</div><div id="00:23:38.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember one particular day I must have had a migraine headache.</div><div id="00:23:44.560" class="transcript_line"> And I ended up, I went to the toilet and I was so ill I started, I must have started crying and they took me to the restroom.</div><div id="00:23:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And I stayed in the restroom for an hour.</div><div id="00:23:56.560" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, the conditions weren&#039;t horrendous or anything there.</div><div id="00:24:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Did they pay you for that hour?</div><div id="00:24:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes they did. Yes.</div><div id="00:24:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Was there any other kind of sick pay or if you know?</div><div id="00:24:14.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no. You didn&#039;t go to work, you didn&#039;t have money.</div><div id="00:24:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:24:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:24:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Anything else you want to say about London Pride?</div><div id="00:24:26.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll just...</div><div id="00:24:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I wanted to ask you about, like...</div><div id="00:24:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you mainly younger women in London Pride or were there older women and were there married women?</div><div id="00:24:46.560" class="transcript_line"> No, it was quite a mixed age group.</div><div id="00:24:50.560" class="transcript_line"> There were older women there.</div><div id="00:24:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And I can particularly remember older single women.</div><div id="00:24:58.560" class="transcript_line"> There were a number of older single women there.</div><div id="00:25:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Not so much married as single.</div><div id="00:25:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:25:09.560" class="transcript_line"> And did you all do the same kind of work?</div><div id="00:25:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, they all did the same kind of work.</div><div id="00:25:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Did they pick the supervisors out of the workforce or did they bring people in?</div><div id="00:25:21.560" class="transcript_line"> No, they were picked out of the workforce. Yes.</div><div id="00:25:25.560" class="transcript_line"> What about if you did have a family?</div><div id="00:25:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Were there childcare facilities there?</div><div id="00:25:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I knew it off.</div><div id="00:25:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Childcare? No one worked if they had children. No, there was no childcare.</div><div id="00:25:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Did anybody come back to work if they&#039;d had children?</div><div id="00:25:43.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:25:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Really? No.</div><div id="00:25:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Was that something that the management wouldn&#039;t have wanted or was it just...</div><div id="00:25:49.560" class="transcript_line"> They wouldn&#039;t have wanted and they wouldn&#039;t have cared for.</div><div id="00:25:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:25:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Because there would be no facilities.</div><div id="00:25:55.560" class="transcript_line"> And you wouldn&#039;t have been allowed to take time off if your children were ill or if there were school problems or anything like that.</div><div id="00:26:03.560" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t have been allowed to take time off.</div><div id="00:26:05.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I never knew anyone working with children.</div><div id="00:26:09.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t know anyone working with children.</div><div id="00:26:13.560" class="transcript_line"> What about if you had to take time off for a personal reason like a funeral, was that allowed?</div><div id="00:26:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you would have been able to take probably for funeral, I&#039;m not sure, but you wouldn&#039;t have been paid for it.</div><div id="00:26:29.560" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t have been paid for anything other than what you were working for.</div><div id="00:26:35.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:26:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Anything else was deducted from your weekly wage.</div><div id="00:26:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:26:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware, you said that a lot of the clothes were sent to big London shops.</div><div id="00:26:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of anyone else they were sent, like local stores down in Cardiff?</div><div id="00:27:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, the James Howell store in Cardiff stocked them.</div><div id="00:27:05.560" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember seeing advertisements in magazines and things like that.</div><div id="00:27:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And they would be advertised in the magazines, you know, in the expensive magazines.</div><div id="00:27:20.560" class="transcript_line"> If you were in maybe a dental surgery and you saw a magazine, they would be advertised in there.</div><div id="00:27:27.560" class="transcript_line"> So you were well aware of how much they cost, of the price of the garments.</div><div id="00:27:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the first time you realised how much they were?</div><div id="00:27:38.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, because I always knew that they were expensive.</div><div id="00:27:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Excitational.</div><div id="00:27:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:27:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:27:49.560" class="transcript_line"> So, how did you get to work?</div><div id="00:27:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, on the bus.</div><div id="00:27:55.560" class="transcript_line"> And how much of a trip was it?</div><div id="00:27:58.560" class="transcript_line"> It took approximately half an hour to get to work because the bus left Llanharren at half past six in the morning.</div><div id="00:28:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And you had to be at the bus stop to get the bus at half past six because London Pride was actually outside Bridgend.</div><div id="00:28:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So it wasn&#039;t on the normal bus route.</div><div id="00:28:23.560" class="transcript_line"> If you missed the bus that was going that way, you had to go into Bridgend and then out from Bridgend to Coiti, which took perhaps another half an hour.</div><div id="00:28:35.560" class="transcript_line"> So you were always aware that you had to catch the half past six bus.</div><div id="00:28:41.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was public transport, wasn&#039;t there?</div><div id="00:28:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Public transport, yes.</div><div id="00:28:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:46.560" class="transcript_line"> From the bus.</div><div id="00:28:47.560" class="transcript_line"> From the bus?</div><div id="00:28:48.560" class="transcript_line"> From the bus from Weston Welsh.</div><div id="00:28:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right.</div><div id="00:28:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:28:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, Weston Welsh.</div><div id="00:28:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And did people come from far and wide to London Pride?</div><div id="00:28:58.560" class="transcript_line"> More or less, I think, within a sort of, I would say, 20 mile radius.</div><div id="00:29:06.560" class="transcript_line"> There were people from right up Nanty Mall and Diogmobil Valleys, as far down as Brynceethyn, Pencoed, Llanharren.</div><div id="00:29:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No further than Llanharren, I would have thought.</div><div id="00:29:23.560" class="transcript_line"> So it would have been less than 20 mile radius.</div><div id="00:29:26.560" class="transcript_line"> So nobody from up Pantypridd?</div><div id="00:29:28.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:29:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So fairly local.</div><div id="00:29:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:29:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Fairly local, yes.</div><div id="00:29:36.560" class="transcript_line"> So, when did you decide to leave and why?</div><div id="00:29:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I left after about two years.</div><div id="00:29:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So I would have been 15, 16, coming up to 17.</div><div id="00:29:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And I wanted to earn more money.</div><div id="00:30:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And my other friend was working in the glove factory and she was on piecework.</div><div id="00:30:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And she earned more than what I did.</div><div id="00:30:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And she told me there was jobs going, so I applied.</div><div id="00:30:14.560" class="transcript_line"> And I went to work in the glove factory in Llanfairstdd, then, which was piecework.</div><div id="00:30:20.560" class="transcript_line"> So you only earned what you worked, you know, you had a piece rate for the job.</div><div id="00:30:29.560" class="transcript_line"> So if you worked hard, you&#039;d earn more.</div><div id="00:30:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a basic wage?</div><div id="00:30:36.560" class="transcript_line"> It wasn&#039;t called a basic wage.</div><div id="00:30:39.560" class="transcript_line"> In fact, there was a basic limit.</div><div id="00:30:45.560" class="transcript_line"> But if you didn&#039;t earn that basic limit, then, you know, you were in big trouble.</div><div id="00:30:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you had to earn the basic limit and then anything else on top was the bonus rate.</div><div id="00:31:00.560" class="transcript_line"> So what was it called, the glove factory?</div><div id="00:31:03.560" class="transcript_line"> It was called Planet Gloves.</div><div id="00:31:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was based in Llanfdrasant in the old model house.</div><div id="00:31:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And I worked on the top floor.</div><div id="00:31:15.560" class="transcript_line"> So that was, I think that was half past seven start again.</div><div id="00:31:23.560" class="transcript_line"> You had to be there for half past seven.</div><div id="00:31:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And I travelled by the local bus service that went up into Llanfdrasant.</div><div id="00:31:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d start work at half past seven, but the manageress didn&#039;t come until, I think it was eight o&#039;clock she started work.</div><div id="00:31:40.560" class="transcript_line"> So from half past seven until eight o&#039;clock, it was riots.</div><div id="00:31:45.560" class="transcript_line"> It was such good fun, laughing and joking.</div><div id="00:31:49.560" class="transcript_line"> But someone would always be on the lookout to see the manageress&#039; car coming up the street, because you could see it from the windows.</div><div id="00:31:57.560" class="transcript_line"> So they&#039;d shout, Mrs. Coat is on her way. That&#039;s it.</div><div id="00:32:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Heads down. And from the moment she walked in through the door, you&#039;re a pin drop.</div><div id="00:32:08.560" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t hear the hem of the machines going.</div><div id="00:32:12.560" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re like children.</div><div id="00:32:15.560" class="transcript_line"> So, how many of you worked in planet gloves then?</div><div id="00:32:20.560" class="transcript_line"> I think it was about 150 people, something like that, 200.</div><div id="00:32:28.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, still a lot of people.</div><div id="00:32:30.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, on different levels. Right the way through the, they cut the gloves on the bottom, you know, and brought in the leather and cut them.</div><div id="00:32:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And then they went up to another level where there were offices on one part.</div><div id="00:32:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And then there was different styles of gloves, ladies&#039; and men&#039;s gloves on different levels, you know, in different rooms.</div><div id="00:32:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:33:00.560" class="transcript_line"> So, did you have training to go and work in planet gloves, or could you use the training you&#039;d had already?</div><div id="00:33:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, the training I&#039;d had already opened the door for me to go to another place where I would use sewing machines,</div><div id="00:33:17.560" class="transcript_line"> because once you&#039;d been trained on one sewing machine, you could adapt to different kinds of machine,</div><div id="00:33:24.560" class="transcript_line"> because a glove-making machine is a specialised sewing machine in the fact that the one I was using, it had a sort of stem on it.</div><div id="00:33:36.560" class="transcript_line"> So you sort of sewed on the top of the stem for to be able to get the angle of the gloves, you know, to put the fingers in and the thumbs in.</div><div id="00:33:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Right, right. Did you have to go for an interview for that, or was it just sort of, you just applied and?</div><div id="00:33:56.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I just applied and they said start whatever it is.</div><div id="00:34:00.560" class="transcript_line"> What about references from the interviews?</div><div id="00:34:02.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:34:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Nothing like that?</div><div id="00:34:04.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no references.</div><div id="00:34:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Just left one and started another?</div><div id="00:34:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:34:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to give much notice in?</div><div id="00:34:11.560" class="transcript_line"> A week, you&#039;d have to give a week&#039;s notice.</div><div id="00:34:14.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite a mobile workforce then?</div><div id="00:34:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:34:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Can you describe your first day at planet gloves then, what was that like? I mean, how did it compare to London&#039;s time?</div><div id="00:34:26.560" class="transcript_line"> It was much more, the work was much harder. It was sort of, your hands became stained with the leather and the conditions in the factory,</div><div id="00:34:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Although it wasn&#039;t really dirty or anything, they weren&#039;t as clean as London Pride.</div><div id="00:34:52.560" class="transcript_line"> The work wasn&#039;t as nice, you know, in the fact that it was, I don&#039;t know how to describe this.</div><div id="00:35:00.560" class="transcript_line"> London Pride, you were making nice things, you know, feminine things, but in the glove factory it wasn&#039;t so feminine.</div><div id="00:35:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Leather&#039;s dirty, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:35:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. And the, I mean, you still, there was still a code of practice, you weren&#039;t allowed to swear.</div><div id="00:35:23.560" class="transcript_line"> In fact, the girl in the picture that I showed you there, we were talking about this last week, she swore and the manager heard her and sent her home.</div><div id="00:35:35.560" class="transcript_line"> She had to go home because she&#039;d sworn.</div><div id="00:35:39.560" class="transcript_line"> And how long was she at home for?</div><div id="00:35:41.560" class="transcript_line"> For the day.</div><div id="00:35:42.560" class="transcript_line"> For the day.</div><div id="00:35:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, she sent her home that day and she came back the next day, but that was because she was swearing.</div><div id="00:35:49.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was only two toilets, there was only two ladies&#039; toilets.</div><div id="00:35:55.560" class="transcript_line"> If you wanted to go to the toilet, you had to go, you had to put your hand up and go and get a key to open the door to go into the toilet.</div><div id="00:36:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, everyone smoked!</div><div id="00:36:08.560" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t supposed to smoke in the ladies&#039; toilets.</div><div id="00:36:12.560" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;d open the window, we&#039;d hang out to the window to smoke.</div><div id="00:36:17.560" class="transcript_line"> But in the toilets was the machine to dispose of the sanitary towels.</div><div id="00:36:23.560" class="transcript_line"> And the smoke coming off there and the smell was horrendous.</div><div id="00:36:28.560" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;d be hanging out to the window trying to smoke a cigarette with all the smoke coming off the towel machine.</div><div id="00:36:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you reckon the smell of the smell now? Oh, it was horrendous.</div><div id="00:36:41.560" class="transcript_line"> So the facilities there weren&#039;t as good then?</div><div id="00:36:43.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:36:44.560" class="transcript_line"> What about a canteen? Did you have a canteen?</div><div id="00:36:46.560" class="transcript_line"> The canteen was on the ground floor and we worked on the top floor.</div><div id="00:36:51.560" class="transcript_line"> You had ten minutes to come down three flights of stairs to the canteen.</div><div id="00:37:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And you know, it&#039;s a funny thing, but if I&#039;m faced with a long flight of stairs, even now, I&#039;ll still do it.</div><div id="00:37:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Hold onto the sides and slide down the stairs.</div><div id="00:37:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s how we used to come down, because it was the fastest way to get down.</div><div id="00:37:16.560" class="transcript_line"> So that you&#039;d get in the queue to have your tea and your toast, or whatever it is you&#039;d ordered.</div><div id="00:37:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you had to be back up on your machine by the time the buzzer went for the end of the break.</div><div id="00:37:29.560" class="transcript_line"> And how many flights up were you?</div><div id="00:37:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Another two flights up the stairs. Three, three flights. Three flights.</div><div id="00:37:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because there&#039;s three levels in Model House and the stairs are so narrow.</div><div id="00:37:41.560" class="transcript_line"> When I went there recently, because it&#039;s a craft shop now and I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever been in there.</div><div id="00:37:47.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I haven&#039;t.</div><div id="00:37:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, those narrow stairs are still there.</div><div id="00:37:53.560" class="transcript_line"> I was really tempted to slide down them.</div><div id="00:37:57.560" class="transcript_line"> So how much time did you have for lunch there?</div><div id="00:38:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Half an hour. Only half an hour.</div><div id="00:38:04.560" class="transcript_line"> And afternoon break?</div><div id="00:38:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, I don&#039;t think we had an afternoon break there.</div><div id="00:38:14.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I only had a morning break and a lunch break.</div><div id="00:38:19.560" class="transcript_line"> If we had an afternoon break, I think we used to sit at our machines.</div><div id="00:38:23.560" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t go down to—no, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:38:26.560" class="transcript_line"> If we wanted an afternoon break there, I think we sat at our machines and just had a break.</div><div id="00:38:33.560" class="transcript_line"> We never went to the canteen because—</div><div id="00:38:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Too far.</div><div id="00:38:36.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think it was open. I think it only did morning breaks and lunch.</div><div id="00:38:42.560" class="transcript_line"> I can never remember going there in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:38:46.560" class="transcript_line"> I can never remember having an afternoon break.</div><div id="00:38:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Not there.</div><div id="00:38:51.560" class="transcript_line"> How many hours did you work when you were at Planet Close?</div><div id="00:38:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, that would have been the same. Half past seven start until five o&#039;clock in the evening.</div><div id="00:39:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Long hours.</div><div id="00:39:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very long hours.</div><div id="00:39:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And was it unionized then?</div><div id="00:39:11.560" class="transcript_line"> No, there was no union there.</div><div id="00:39:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right. Okay. So what happened if there was a dispute?</div><div id="00:39:20.560" class="transcript_line"> How did you settle?</div><div id="00:39:22.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t ever remember there being a dispute.</div><div id="00:39:25.560" class="transcript_line"> If you didn&#039;t like something or you thought something wasn&#039;t right,</div><div id="00:39:31.560" class="transcript_line"> you just went to the manageress and explained the situation to her.</div><div id="00:39:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Or tried to—but it was very strict in the fact that if you didn&#039;t like what you had, then it&#039;s tough luck.</div><div id="00:39:47.560" class="transcript_line"> You take it or leave it.</div><div id="00:39:49.560" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t sympathetic at all then?</div><div id="00:39:51.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:39:52.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:39:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Would you say they were good employers on the whole, or were they not very good employers?</div><div id="00:39:59.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I wouldn&#039;t have said they were good employers.</div><div id="00:40:02.560" class="transcript_line"> The welfare of the employers were of no consequence.</div><div id="00:40:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t said that. I can&#039;t say they weren&#039;t really good.</div><div id="00:40:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Because Iris Williams, the singer, she worked there.</div><div id="00:40:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Now, Iris, when we started singing, because we always used to sing,</div><div id="00:40:20.560" class="transcript_line"> but Iris always wanted to sing something operatic.</div><div id="00:40:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And of course we always wanted to sing the pop songs.</div><div id="00:40:29.560" class="transcript_line"> So if Iris started to sing these to him or something like that, we drowned her out with the pop song.</div><div id="00:40:36.560" class="transcript_line"> But I did get to hear that the manageress had actually encouraged Iris to go to the Royal School of Music, you know, the Royal College.</div><div id="00:40:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:40:50.560" class="transcript_line"> So—</div><div id="00:40:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Had they backed her financially?</div><div id="00:40:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think so.</div><div id="00:40:53.560" class="transcript_line"> What, the firm or—</div><div id="00:40:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:40:56.560" class="transcript_line"> —personally?</div><div id="00:40:57.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I think it was her actually personally did it.</div><div id="00:41:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:41:02.560" class="transcript_line"> So, you know, she was quite nice, she was. Mrs. Cote her name was.</div><div id="00:41:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Mr. and Mrs. Cote, they were husband and wife.</div><div id="00:41:12.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think she would have been all right, but of course someone else owned the actual factory.</div><div id="00:41:19.560" class="transcript_line"> She was just the manageress.</div><div id="00:41:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:41:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Unless she had—I don&#039;t know. She may have had shares in the company, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:41:29.560" class="transcript_line"> What about—what about compared to London Pride? Do you think London Pride were good employers?</div><div id="00:41:38.560" class="transcript_line"> For the time, I suppose they were. For that time in history, you know.</div><div id="00:41:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Good but strict?</div><div id="00:41:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Oh, yes, there was a standard there, you know. If you worked there, it wasn&#039;t—you knew that you had to behave in a certain way.</div><div id="00:42:02.560" class="transcript_line"> So, tell me about Iris Williams, and where did she come from?</div><div id="00:42:07.560" class="transcript_line"> She came from Tonnerewil.</div><div id="00:42:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:42:10.560" class="transcript_line"> I think she was adopted or fostered in Tonnerewil.</div><div id="00:42:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And she was there for how long when you were there?</div><div id="00:42:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Two or three years, yes, two to three years.</div><div id="00:42:26.560" class="transcript_line"> And then did she go off to college then?</div><div id="00:42:28.560" class="transcript_line"> I think she went to college then because I think when I left there, I was there for about two years.</div><div id="00:42:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And then it was—it closed about two years after that, and Iris went from there then, and she did—she started her singing career then because that was her ambition.</div><div id="00:42:47.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was no doubt about it that Iris was going to sing. Yeah.</div><div id="00:42:53.560" class="transcript_line"> So were there more kind of girls from, like, Pontypridd way, Rhondda way in—</div><div id="00:42:59.560" class="transcript_line"> The Rhondda, mostly the Rhondda.</div><div id="00:43:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:43:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Tonnerewil, Llandrisund, byddai. Yes, that area.</div><div id="00:43:10.560" class="transcript_line"> And how did they get it?</div><div id="00:43:13.560" class="transcript_line"> All public transport.</div><div id="00:43:15.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:43:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:43:17.560" class="transcript_line"> And no one had a car then?</div><div id="00:43:20.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no. And it was all paid out of your own wages then?</div><div id="00:43:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:43:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what your wages were then? You said you were on piecework.</div><div id="00:43:29.560" class="transcript_line"> I think I went there and I had—I can remember my—I can remember taking home something like £3 to £4 from there because I worked on piecework.</div><div id="00:43:43.560" class="transcript_line"> And I was quite a fast worker. And I always only perhaps took 15 minutes for my lunch, and then I&#039;d go back and I&#039;d sit at my machine and do all the cutting and things.</div><div id="00:43:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d do the sewing and then leave those for my break for doing the cutting part.</div><div id="00:44:05.560" class="transcript_line"> So that would make it faster for me. So I earned more then.</div><div id="00:44:11.560" class="transcript_line"> So I was quite a fast worker and I was one of—I think I was one of the top earners.</div><div id="00:44:21.560" class="transcript_line"> I was going to say it suited you in a way then, the piecework.</div><div id="00:44:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes, it did. Because I wanted to earn more money.</div><div id="00:44:31.560" class="transcript_line"> So what about holidays and things there? Do you remember what the holidays were in Planniglefs?</div><div id="00:44:40.560" class="transcript_line"> It was the same as mine as holidays.</div><div id="00:44:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:44:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. But only sort of the bank holidays. You&#039;d only have the actual bank holiday past the two days.</div><div id="00:44:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And did you do the same kind of things?</div><div id="00:44:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes, we never went on holiday. I never ever went away on holiday.</div><div id="00:45:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you know any of the girls when you went to—oh, you said a friend here?</div><div id="00:45:05.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:45:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you know anybody else?</div><div id="00:45:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was quite a few local people. Not that I knew them personally, but I knew—I sort of acquainted with them.</div><div id="00:45:17.560" class="transcript_line"> What was the camaraderie like in Planniglefs?</div><div id="00:45:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, brilliant. Yes. They were a funny crowd, you know, so funny. Such good laughs.</div><div id="00:45:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Like I related the incident where if you went to the law, because you were sitting on a hard seat, you&#039;d have a cushion on the seat.</div><div id="00:45:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And there was one particular girl who, if you went to the law, she&#039;d put a needle in the cushion,</div><div id="00:45:44.560" class="transcript_line"> and you&#039;d come back from school to sit on the cushion, and you&#039;d shoot off that cushion a bit sharp.</div><div id="00:45:52.560" class="transcript_line"> But you just laughed about it, because although I&#039;m thinking about it now, they were quite sharp needles.</div><div id="00:46:00.560" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;d do things like that, you know, silly things. Pranks.</div><div id="00:46:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Pranks.</div><div id="00:46:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yeah. Always doing pranks.</div><div id="00:46:08.560" class="transcript_line"> So were you very close to your co-workers then?</div><div id="00:46:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think we were.</div><div id="00:46:14.560" class="transcript_line"> What kind of things did you do? Did you go out together?</div><div id="00:46:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, to the local dance halls.</div><div id="00:46:21.560" class="transcript_line"> The same dance halls as you went to before?</div><div id="00:46:24.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no. That was going towards Bridgen now. Now I changed my area, now we went to Llanhari.</div><div id="00:46:31.560" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes one particular person would organise the bus, and we&#039;d go to the Sapphire Gardens in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:46:40.560" class="transcript_line"> or the Padgett Runes in P&#039;n Arth, especially an organised coach, and we&#039;d go to dance halls like that.</div><div id="00:46:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember going to those.</div><div id="00:46:53.560" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember what year it was when you went to work in Planet Gloves?</div><div id="00:46:59.560" class="transcript_line"> It would have been, I would have been seventeen, eighteen.</div><div id="00:47:06.560" class="transcript_line"> So, my maths is not very good now.</div><div id="00:47:13.560" class="transcript_line"> It would have been about, if I left school, 43, 53.</div><div id="00:47:24.560" class="transcript_line"> It would have been about 1960, 59, 60.</div><div id="00:47:31.560" class="transcript_line"> The start of the Beatle era.</div><div id="00:47:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember what the music was like in Sapphire Gardens and the Padgett Runes?</div><div id="00:47:38.560" class="transcript_line"> In those places it was all the big bands.</div><div id="00:47:41.560" class="transcript_line"> So it was quite glamorous then?</div><div id="00:47:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:47:48.560" class="transcript_line"> And how did you go? Did you hire a bus?</div><div id="00:47:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, one particular person would hire the bus, and we&#039;d all pay our fares,</div><div id="00:47:58.560" class="transcript_line"> and it would be there waiting for us to come home.</div><div id="00:48:03.560" class="transcript_line"> Which was sometimes quite late, so my mother didn&#039;t like this.</div><div id="00:48:07.560" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d be quite annoyed if I got home late.</div><div id="00:48:10.560" class="transcript_line"> So, what did you do for clothes then? Did you still make your own clothes?</div><div id="00:48:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, always made my own clothes.</div><div id="00:48:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Occasionally I&#039;d buy clothes if I had enough money, but no, I mostly made my own clothes.</div><div id="00:48:29.560" class="transcript_line"> So, what kind of stuff did you use to wear to go to these dinner dances?</div><div id="00:48:34.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, you...</div><div id="00:48:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Or these big band dances?</div><div id="00:48:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, if you were going to one of those you&#039;d have something special.</div><div id="00:48:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you would buy something then.</div><div id="00:48:45.560" class="transcript_line"> So, were these arranged by the factory or just by one of the workers?</div><div id="00:48:51.560" class="transcript_line"> No, ordinary individuals.</div><div id="00:48:54.560" class="transcript_line"> But we did used to have a Christmas dinner dance that the factory would organise.</div><div id="00:49:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And where was that put on?</div><div id="00:49:03.560" class="transcript_line"> In the glove factory, it was Bindles in Barry.</div><div id="00:49:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:49:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And the bus would be put on, and you would go and buy a special dress then for that,</div><div id="00:49:14.560" class="transcript_line"> because that was a big event.</div><div id="00:49:16.560" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;d go down and you&#039;d sit in, you&#039;d have a meal,</div><div id="00:49:19.560" class="transcript_line"> and then there would be a big band afterwards to dance to.</div><div id="00:49:23.560" class="transcript_line"> So, that was a special event.</div><div id="00:49:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was every Christmas, was it?</div><div id="00:49:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Christmas time, yes.</div><div id="00:49:29.560" class="transcript_line"> So, how long did you stay at the Planet Gloves?</div><div id="00:49:33.560" class="transcript_line"> About two years, and then I went from there then,</div><div id="00:49:38.560" class="transcript_line"> because by that time now we were saving to get married,</div><div id="00:49:42.560" class="transcript_line"> and I wanted to earn more money.</div><div id="00:49:46.560" class="transcript_line"> And things were going down in the glove trade then.</div><div id="00:49:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Things were getting sort of not as easy to earn money.</div><div id="00:49:58.560" class="transcript_line"> So, I went from there back to Bridgend Estate,</div><div id="00:50:02.560" class="transcript_line"> to a place there where they were making shoes for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:50:08.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was really good money there.</div><div id="00:50:11.560" class="transcript_line"> And I worked there until I got married.</div><div id="00:50:14.560" class="transcript_line"> So, I earned quite a lot of money there.</div><div id="00:50:19.560" class="transcript_line"> I can remember I was earning quite a good wage there,</div><div id="00:50:23.560" class="transcript_line"> because I was able to save then to get married.</div><div id="00:50:27.560" class="transcript_line"> What was that called?</div><div id="00:50:29.560" class="transcript_line"> That was called Fiona Footwear.</div><div id="00:50:31.560" class="transcript_line"> And they made all the shoes and slippers for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:50:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And what did you do? Was that still sewing?</div><div id="00:50:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Still sewing. Still sewing. Sewing the shoes or the slippers.</div><div id="00:50:44.560" class="transcript_line"> But they had about, I think at one time, they had three factories on Bridgend Estate,</div><div id="00:50:52.560" class="transcript_line"> and they all made for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:50:56.560" class="transcript_line"> They only made shoes for Marks and Spencer&#039;s, or slippers.</div><div id="00:51:01.560" class="transcript_line"> And they would hold a sale at the end of the season.</div><div id="00:51:06.560" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d sell off the old season&#039;s shoes, so you could buy the shoes quite cheaply, or the slippers.</div><div id="00:51:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but they only worked for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:51:16.560" class="transcript_line"> In fact, Bridgend Estate at that time, most of the manufacturing, the lights manufacturing,</div><div id="00:51:23.560" class="transcript_line"> worked for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:51:27.560" class="transcript_line"> There was a factory there making clothes for them, and like I say, shoes and slippers.</div><div id="00:51:34.560" class="transcript_line"> The gloves were made for Marks and Spencer&#039;s.</div><div id="00:51:38.560" class="transcript_line"> So Marks and Spencer&#039;s had a lot to answer for when they took all their manufacturing out of this country.</div><div id="00:51:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So Planet Gloves made gloves for Marks and Spencer&#039;s?</div><div id="00:51:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they did.</div><div id="00:51:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So you went to Fiona Footwear, and you said the wages were...was that piecework as well?</div><div id="00:51:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. It was a basic wage, but anything you earned over that was added to it.</div><div id="00:52:07.560" class="transcript_line"> So you could earn...the harder you worked, the more you could earn.</div><div id="00:52:11.560" class="transcript_line"> So do you remember how much you worked there, or how much you earned there?</div><div id="00:52:14.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t remember, but I know it was a lot more than what I earned in the glove factory.</div><div id="00:52:22.560" class="transcript_line"> They were one of the top payers on the estate.</div><div id="00:52:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Right. And what year did you go there? Was it another...do you remember how long you were in Planet Gloves?</div><div id="00:52:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I must have been in the early 20s by then. It must have been the early 20s.</div><div id="00:52:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And I was there until I got married, and I got married when I was 22, 23. Yes, 22, 23. So I was there until I got married.</div><div id="00:53:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Right, right. Do you remember what...was that unionised there?</div><div id="00:53:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yes, that was a union there.</div><div id="00:53:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember which union it was?</div><div id="00:53:10.560" class="transcript_line"> No. I think it was something like the Showmakers Union or something like that. But there was a union there, yes.</div><div id="00:53:17.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. And what were the conditions in the factory like there?</div><div id="00:53:21.560" class="transcript_line"> They were quite good. They were quite good. There was a canteen and you could have, you know, you could eat in pleasant surroundings sort of thing.</div><div id="00:53:30.560" class="transcript_line"> But strict again, you know, with timekeeping, and you only got paid if you were in work, and you had to be on time.</div><div id="00:53:38.560" class="transcript_line"> You couldn&#039;t walk into the factory 10 minutes late from lunch or anything like that. You had to be there on time. And on time in the morning.</div><div id="00:53:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Was that clocking in and coming in?</div><div id="00:53:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. If you didn&#039;t clock in on time, they deducted. Like if you were one minute late over the time, you would lose half an hour&#039;s money.</div><div id="00:54:03.560" class="transcript_line"> So you made sure that you&#039;d clocked in within a certain time.</div><div id="00:54:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:54:08.560" class="transcript_line"> I think they allowed you three minutes. But after three minutes you lost a half an hour.</div><div id="00:54:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Right. And what time did you start there?</div><div id="00:54:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Half past seven again.</div><div id="00:54:20.560" class="transcript_line"> Right. Same hours of work?</div><div id="00:54:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes. I think that by the time I started there, I think we finished at half past four.</div><div id="00:54:29.560" class="transcript_line"> I think they&#039;d knocked off half an hour off the working time, the working week.</div><div id="00:54:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Was that something that happened because of legislation, or was it?</div><div id="00:54:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the working week was reduced.</div><div id="00:54:45.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:54:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:54:47.560" class="transcript_line"> That sounds a bit better, doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:54:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:54:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And what about the breaks? Were they the same?</div><div id="00:54:53.560" class="transcript_line"> The breaks were the same, yes. Only half an hour for lunch.</div><div id="00:54:56.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:54:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Ten minutes in the morning, half an hour for lunch. No afternoon break.</div><div id="00:55:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Because I think, if I remember rightly, when they knocked the half an hour off, or when they reduced the working week, they took off the afternoon break.</div><div id="00:55:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Because you were supposed to work so many hours before you have a break, and because we were working less hours, they took off the afternoon break.</div><div id="00:55:23.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t wait, can you?</div><div id="00:55:26.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:55:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. So, same holidays then?</div><div id="00:55:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. There was no increase in the holidays. Not that I&#039;m aware of anyway, not that I can remember.</div><div id="00:55:42.560" class="transcript_line"> And did your wages stay the same all the time you were there?</div><div id="00:55:48.560" class="transcript_line"> No, they didn&#039;t actually. Sometimes it depended on, I can remember them increasing the price, because you had a price for whatever you did.</div><div id="00:56:04.560" class="transcript_line"> For instance, if I was doing slippers, I&#039;d have so much per perhaps dozen, and they would increase the price per dozen.</div><div id="00:56:16.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember it happening many times, but I did get increases when I was there. It did increase.</div><div id="00:56:27.560" class="transcript_line"> So were you quite happy with the wages there?</div><div id="00:56:31.560" class="transcript_line"> We were never happy. We always wanted more. Yeah, we were never happy. We always wanted more money.</div><div id="00:56:40.560" class="transcript_line"> But you&#039;d apply for it. If you&#039;d refused, well, that was it. You&#039;d accept it.</div><div id="00:56:47.560" class="transcript_line"> So were the conditions there, you&#039;d say, were they quite good?</div><div id="00:56:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:56:52.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, facilities and heat cold.</div><div id="00:56:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, not too bad. Yes.</div><div id="00:56:57.560" class="transcript_line"> And any disputes then, do you remember?</div><div id="00:57:01.560" class="transcript_line"> No, no, I can&#039;t remember any disputes there.</div><div id="00:57:09.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t remember any disputes. The only disputes I can remember was later on, towards the 70s, when I worked part-time after I was married.</div><div id="00:57:21.560" class="transcript_line"> Where did you work then?</div><div id="00:57:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, once I got married and I had my first child, he was around about two, and we&#039;d already bought our own house then, which was unusual at that time.</div><div id="00:57:38.560" class="transcript_line"> And it was an old house, and it needed an awful lot to go into it.</div><div id="00:57:43.560" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d applied for an evening job in the local wella factory, making hair cosmetics.</div><div id="00:57:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:57:52.560" class="transcript_line"> And you worked from, I think it was five o&#039;clock until ten o&#039;clock.</div><div id="00:57:59.560" class="transcript_line"> So my husband would come home from work, I&#039;d have all the tea ready, and he would look after my son and put him to bed and everything, while I went to work.</div><div id="00:58:14.560" class="transcript_line"> So I worked from five o&#039;clock until ten o&#039;clock, and that was five evenings a week.</div><div id="00:58:20.560" class="transcript_line"> In the hair cosmetics, which I enjoyed. I think there was about 50 of us working on the production lines.</div><div id="00:58:30.560" class="transcript_line"> What did you enjoy about that then?</div><div id="00:58:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, I quite enjoyed it because you were sort of going out in the evening, and you were all in the same position.</div><div id="00:58:41.560" class="transcript_line"> They were all young married women. Most of us had children. There was very few without children.</div><div id="00:58:47.560" class="transcript_line"> It was mostly all people with children, because we couldn&#039;t work in the day because there was no childcare facilities.</div><div id="00:58:55.560" class="transcript_line"> There was absolutely no childcare facilities then. No nurseries, nothing. Your child didn&#039;t go to school until they were four.</div><div id="00:59:04.560" class="transcript_line"> So the only way you could work was to work in unsociable hours.</div><div id="00:59:12.560" class="transcript_line"> And there were many, many of the manufacturers who used to do the evening shift, what they would call the evening shifts, and social hours.</div><div id="00:59:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Wellers was the nearest one, but there were also people like AB Electronics where they used to weld circuit boards and things like that. They always did an evening shift.</div><div id="00:59:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you think they did those shifts to suit people like you?</div><div id="00:59:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, very much so.</div><div id="00:59:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Because they were aware.</div><div id="00:59:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Well, they did it because they needed the extra production, and they knew that they could develop on production by using it right from the day shift in the day right through until 10 o&#039;clock in the evening.</div><div id="00:59:58.560" class="transcript_line"> And they knew there was a whole workforce out there of women, I suppose.</div><div id="01:00:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was never any problem to recruit for the evenings.</div><div id="01:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you, do you think you liked going there for a bit of adult conversation after being with them?</div><div id="01:00:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I did, very much so. I mean, money was the first priority.</div><div id="01:00:15.560" class="transcript_line"> But yes, the adult conversation, and because we were all, we had a lot in common.</div><div id="01:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> And then we had a wonderful social life because we all organised things like we&#039;d go on a day trip to Tenby, and we&#039;d all go on the coach with the children and take the children.</div><div id="01:00:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;ve got photographs now of us all sitting on the beach, you know, in a circle on the beach with all the children.</div><div id="01:00:41.560" class="transcript_line"> We used to go out to dances and dinner dances. Yeah, it was really, really a good social life with that job.</div><div id="01:00:51.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it mainly, you know, you went on trips like that, was it mainly women and children or did your husbands go as well?</div><div id="01:00:57.560" class="transcript_line"> Only in the day if we went to the seaside or anything.</div><div id="01:01:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:01:01.560" class="transcript_line"> But no, if we went to the dinner dances, husbands would come along as well.</div><div id="01:01:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, no, but I mean the day trips like that.</div><div id="01:01:06.560" class="transcript_line"> The day trips, it was mostly women.</div><div id="01:01:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:01:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, women and children.</div><div id="01:01:11.560" class="transcript_line"> Did you make new friends in London?</div><div id="01:01:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, yes, I did.</div><div id="01:01:16.560" class="transcript_line"> People you didn&#039;t know, were there people there you knew when you got there?</div><div id="01:01:20.560" class="transcript_line"> There were one or two people that I did know, yes, from around the locality.</div><div id="01:01:26.560" class="transcript_line"> But I got to know a lot of different people there, but they were excellent employers.</div><div id="01:01:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, were they?</div><div id="01:01:33.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, they were.</div><div id="01:01:35.560" class="transcript_line"> Better than the road trade employers?</div><div id="01:01:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh, much, much better, yes.</div><div id="01:01:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Why do you think that was?</div><div id="01:01:41.560" class="transcript_line"> They just were, they were much more interested in the welfare of the workers.</div><div id="01:01:48.560" class="transcript_line"> It was a German company actually.</div><div id="01:01:52.560" class="transcript_line"> We always had a Christmas present.</div><div id="01:01:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="01:01:55.560" class="transcript_line"> If it was a Christmas, it would be a nice Christmas present.</div><div id="01:01:58.560" class="transcript_line"> I can think of different social events, you know, that were organised through the company.</div><div id="01:02:03.560" class="transcript_line"> No, they were excellent employers.</div><div id="01:02:06.560" class="transcript_line"> What kind of social events did they organise?</div><div id="01:02:09.560" class="transcript_line"> There was always a Christmas lunch, always Christmas parties.</div><div id="01:02:13.560" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember one particular time, a Formula, now I think it was a Formula One racing car.</div><div id="01:02:20.560" class="transcript_line"> It must have been a promotion for the company, and they brought the Formula One car to the company, in the company grounds.</div><div id="01:02:30.560" class="transcript_line"> And we all met the driver and we all had to sit in this Formula One car.</div><div id="01:02:36.560" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m assuming that it was an advertising car for the company.</div><div id="01:02:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it somebody famous, did it?</div><div id="01:02:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I think it was somebody famous.</div><div id="01:02:44.560" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember now because I wasn&#039;t too interested in racing drag cars.</div><div id="01:02:49.560" class="transcript_line"> But no, they were an excellent company to work for.</div><div id="01:02:52.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:02:53.560" class="transcript_line"> What about the work itself?</div><div id="01:02:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it dangerous, you know, working with chemicals?</div><div id="01:02:58.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, it could have been.</div><div id="01:03:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of anybody with any health issues or that kind of thing?</div><div id="01:03:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Not at the time, it&#039;s only since.</div><div id="01:03:08.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only since, because now I mean, I can remember the vats of hair products coming out of the labs to go on to the production line.</div><div id="01:03:21.560" class="transcript_line"> And when you started the shift, the work shift, because I was a supervisor on there, or the line leader they called it then,</div><div id="01:03:32.560" class="transcript_line"> you would check the product, so you&#039;d lift the lid on the vat of the product and you&#039;d smell it and you&#039;d look in it.</div><div id="01:03:40.560" class="transcript_line"> And I think of it now and I&#039;m thinking of all those chemicals that I&#039;ve inhaled.</div><div id="01:03:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:03:47.560" class="transcript_line"> And one particular line was glass bottles going through the line, you know, to be filled.</div><div id="01:03:55.560" class="transcript_line"> Like they would go on to a turntable and go through and be filled and capped and then on and labelled.</div><div id="01:04:01.560" class="transcript_line"> But if the machine wasn&#039;t set up properly or if there was a problem with the machine, the glass bottles would break, you know.</div><div id="01:04:11.560" class="transcript_line"> So it could have been quite dangerous.</div><div id="01:04:15.560" class="transcript_line"> The machines were quite, they could have been quite dangerous.</div><div id="01:04:22.560" class="transcript_line"> But in all fairness I have to say that the company were well aware of health and safety at that time.</div><div id="01:04:32.560" class="transcript_line"> It wouldn&#039;t have been called health and safety, but they were aware of the safety of the workers.</div><div id="01:04:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="01:04:38.560" class="transcript_line"> Like if you were filling anything.</div><div id="01:04:40.560" class="transcript_line"> So there was protection.</div><div id="01:04:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:04:42.560" class="transcript_line"> They would make sure you wore goggles if you were filling something that wasn&#039;t.</div><div id="01:04:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they were.</div><div id="01:04:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:04:50.560" class="transcript_line"> I think maybe that was the start of companies being more aware of the health in manufacturing of their workers.</div><div id="01:04:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of anybody with health issues from there afterwards or, you know?</div><div id="01:05:06.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:05:07.560" class="transcript_line"> I mean you said you thought of yourself.</div><div id="01:05:10.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="01:05:11.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="01:05:12.560" class="transcript_line"> Were there any disputes when you were there? Union disputes, that kind of thing?</div><div id="01:05:16.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, there was a strong union there.</div><div id="01:05:19.560" class="transcript_line"> There was a strong union there.</div><div id="01:05:21.560" class="transcript_line"> So the union would put forward for a pay rise.</div><div id="01:05:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:25.560" class="transcript_line"> And that would go through, you know, and if they didn&#039;t agree to the pay rise or then they would go on strike.</div><div id="01:05:33.560" class="transcript_line"> They would walk out.</div><div id="01:05:35.560" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember them picketing outside the factory.</div><div id="01:05:40.560" class="transcript_line"> Because we were evening workers, we were sort of on the fringe of the workforce, you know?</div><div id="01:05:47.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:05:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you members of the union?</div><div id="01:05:50.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, we had to be members of the union because there was great competition between the day workers and the evening workers.</div><div id="01:05:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Because apparently, because we only worked sort of five till ten, we could, the productivity from that small evening shift was much better than what a day worker would produce.</div><div id="01:06:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously you only worked a few hours.</div><div id="01:06:22.560" class="transcript_line"> So there was great competition between the day and the evening workers.</div><div id="01:06:26.560" class="transcript_line"> They didn&#039;t particularly like the evening workers.</div><div id="01:06:29.560" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of sort of time and motion people?</div><div id="01:06:32.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes.</div><div id="01:06:34.560" class="transcript_line"> In all the factories you worked?</div><div id="01:06:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. That was how your, the price for your item would be by time and you.</div><div id="01:06:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Particularly in the footwear trade, if a new style of shoe came out, it would be a time and motion person would stand by the side of you while you were doing, you were part of the job and they would time you.</div><div id="01:07:03.560" class="transcript_line"> And the time you took to do that piece of work would give you the price for the job.</div><div id="01:07:13.560" class="transcript_line"> Right, so the price for retail then?</div><div id="01:07:17.560" class="transcript_line"> No, the price that I would be paid for doing my part on the show.</div><div id="01:07:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Particularly in the shoe trade. There was always time and motion.</div><div id="01:07:27.560" class="transcript_line"> Every new style of shoe would be timed.</div><div id="01:07:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, you were talking about the Christmas parties. Were these for you and the kids?</div><div id="01:07:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there was a Christmas party for the other children but there was also a Christmas party for just the workers.</div><div id="01:07:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Right, so one in the day, one in the evening.</div><div id="01:07:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="01:07:51.560" class="transcript_line"> So would you say that was one of the best places you worked?</div><div id="01:07:54.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, one of the best companies, yes. In manufacturing, definitely.</div><div id="01:08:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Although it was hard in a way because you worked at night.</div><div id="01:08:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes. But they were an excellent company to work for.</div><div id="01:08:09.560" class="transcript_line"> Was that because they were German, do you think?</div><div id="01:08:11.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I wonder if it was.</div><div id="01:08:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Or perhaps maybe times had moved on.</div><div id="01:08:17.560" class="transcript_line"> It could have been that times had moved on.</div><div id="01:08:21.560" class="transcript_line"> However, from there I had the best job of all because after my children had started to grow up,</div><div id="01:08:31.560" class="transcript_line"> I went back to evening classes and I did an English all-ever and then I saw a job advertised in the University of Glamorgan.</div><div id="01:08:45.560" class="transcript_line"> But it was through my sewing experience that I got the job first. It was for a seamstress in the halls of residence.</div><div id="01:08:54.560" class="transcript_line"> I thought to myself, I think I&#039;ll try for that. I&#039;d been out of work now for about two years because my, no, I hadn&#039;t been out of work for two years.</div><div id="01:09:04.560" class="transcript_line"> I had been working but the evening work was drying up and I didn&#039;t really want to do evenings now because my children were getting older.</div><div id="01:09:13.560" class="transcript_line"> So I saw this job advertised and I thought, I&#039;ll apply for it. So I went and I had an interview and I got the job.</div><div id="01:09:22.560" class="transcript_line"> So I started out doing the laundry for the halls of residence because at that time there was actually maids working in the halls of residence who cleaned the rooms, made the beds, changed the beds, everything like that.</div><div id="01:09:40.560" class="transcript_line"> So I was in charge of all the laundry and different things like that. But from there I had a managed rest.</div><div id="01:09:50.560" class="transcript_line"> The managed rest was a young person who really encouraged me and she said to me, why don&#039;t you go to college and do City and Gills?</div><div id="01:10:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Because they knew they were building new halls of residence. So I said, yes, all right then.</div><div id="01:10:09.560" class="transcript_line"> So I went to Newport College and did a City and Gills because I already was doing an old ever.</div><div id="01:10:15.560" class="transcript_line"> And from there I never looked back because I started out in as the seamstress but then she promoted me and I had a manager&#039;s job in the halls of residence.</div><div id="01:10:28.560" class="transcript_line"> And I worked there until I retired and I absolutely loved it.</div><div id="01:10:32.560" class="transcript_line"> So how long was that for?</div><div id="01:10:34.560" class="transcript_line"> I worked there for about 15 years then.</div><div id="01:10:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="01:10:37.560" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. But oh, best job I ever had. I loved it. Working with the students.</div><div id="01:10:43.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="01:10:44.560" class="transcript_line"> Looking after all the cleaning side of it and the maintenance side of it.</div><div id="01:10:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:10:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I really enjoyed that. And of course they built new halls of residence.</div><div id="01:10:53.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:10:54.560" class="transcript_line"> I was on the campus so it became a huge, at one time there was about 1200 rooms there then.</div><div id="01:11:00.560" class="transcript_line"> Right, right.</div><div id="01:11:02.560" class="transcript_line"> And that was my whole career.</div><div id="01:11:06.560" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask you, actually when you were at Weller, did you miss doing the kind of skilled work that you&#039;ve been doing, you know sewing?</div><div id="01:11:16.560" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="01:11:17.560" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t?</div><div id="01:11:18.560" class="transcript_line"> No, I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="01:11:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Was it because you&#039;ve done so much of it?</div><div id="01:11:22.560" class="transcript_line"> Probably.</div><div id="01:11:23.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, probably. No, I didn&#039;t miss it at all. Because when I worked in Weller, because I was the line leader, I more or less organised all the line.</div><div id="01:11:36.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, and organised the workload.</div><div id="01:11:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so there was a different skill then.</div><div id="01:11:41.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="01:11:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was more of a kind of, organising and manager skill, yeah.</div><div id="01:11:48.560" class="transcript_line"> Okay, well I was going to ask you, just one last thing. Looking back now then, oh no, before I ask you that, are you in contact with any of your former workmates?</div><div id="01:12:01.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes, I still keep in touch with them.</div><div id="01:12:04.560" class="transcript_line"> From all the places of work?</div><div id="01:12:07.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, because this one here I&#039;m still in touch with, we&#039;ve been friends since we started school together.</div><div id="01:12:16.560" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s her name?</div><div id="01:12:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Her name is Joan.</div><div id="01:12:19.560" class="transcript_line"> Joan, yeah.</div><div id="01:12:20.560" class="transcript_line"> And Joan and I started school at five and we still meet up on a Saturday, perhaps once a month and go out and have lunch and so we&#039;re still in contact. So we&#039;ve been friends now for 70 years.</div><div id="01:12:36.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:12:37.560" class="transcript_line"> And that one is not alive anymore. But these I still keep in touch with because I&#039;m in the U3A, the University of the Third Age.</div><div id="01:12:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Oh right, yes.</div><div id="01:12:50.560" class="transcript_line"> And I started, I was a founder member of the University of the Third Age in Tonrever. And the craft class that we go to now, I meet this person here, through the University of the Third Age.</div><div id="01:13:04.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the one with the needles.</div><div id="01:13:06.560" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="01:13:07.560" class="transcript_line"> And what&#039;s her name?</div><div id="01:13:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Myr her name is. So I&#039;m in touch with her. And then the weller, evening, the evening shift, I&#039;m in touch with the person, she goes to the craft class there.</div><div id="01:13:24.560" class="transcript_line"> And we meet up occasionally. We go to leaks and have coffee and yeah, so I&#039;m in touch with all of them and the university one. I&#039;m still in touch with the people from the university. Yeah.</div><div id="01:13:39.560" class="transcript_line"> Great. And looking back, how do you feel about the time you&#039;ve spent working in factories now?</div><div id="01:13:49.560" class="transcript_line"> To be honest, when I look back on my working life, I just wish that I&#039;d had an education. I always wished I&#039;d had an education.</div><div id="01:14:00.560" class="transcript_line"> And when I worked in the university, I used to envy those students. Not particularly because it was a university, but because of all the knowledge that they had.</div><div id="01:14:09.560" class="transcript_line"> You know, when they had so many opportunities and I used to think, oh, what I would have given to have gone to university would have been wonderful.</div><div id="01:14:17.560" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s why I made sure that my own two children went to university. And I always used to say to them, you know, you must have an education because the world is your oyster.</div><div id="01:14:29.560" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve got an education, you can do anything you want to do in this world. I always say that to my children. It was my biggest regret that I didn&#039;t have an education. Yeah.</div></div></p>
