My father was born in Poland or somewhere in Eastern Europe.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So, had he been here long? Had he grown up? Or had he just come over when he met your mother?</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> No, he came over when he was 13. And I don&#039;t know what age he was when he met my mother.</div><div id="00:00:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But he knew her a while before they married.</div><div id="00:00:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Was he working?</div><div id="00:00:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. He had brothers and sisters who had come to this country. Most of them were in Merthyr.</div><div id="00:01:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And when he came, he couldn&#039;t speak a word of English. But they gave him a tray with handkerchiefs on it</div><div id="00:01:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and told him to say handkerchiefs penny each and to sell them at 13. That was...</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:01:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So, presumably the whole family had come over. He hadn&#039;t come on his own at 13.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> No, he was probably the last to come over on his own. He travelled on his own, I expect.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes. So, he travelled over to...but he had older siblings here already who gave him the tray and the handkerchiefs.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And they were in London. He came to London to start with.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if it was to start with or whether it was Merthyr.</div><div id="00:02:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Interesting that they came to Merthyr so early on.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know the reason and if I did, I&#039;ve forgotten it.</div><div id="00:02:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, Merthyr was a very busy, booming place because of the industry around the 1900s with the coal industry.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:02:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div></div></p>
