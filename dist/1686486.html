    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, this is a project about memories and the people who used to live in Tiger Bay,</div><div id="00:00:09.600" class="transcript_line"> Butown, Cardiff Docks.</div><div id="00:00:12.840" class="transcript_line"> And first of all let me say thank you on behalf of us at HDA for Heritage Lottery for providing</div><div id="00:00:20.800" class="transcript_line"> us with some funding for this short project.</div><div id="00:00:26.240" class="transcript_line"> This next conversation is with June Wagstaff and this is part one of three relatively short</div><div id="00:00:36.880" class="transcript_line"> clips 15 minutes odd with June.</div><div id="00:00:40.600" class="transcript_line"> And let me apologize for the quality of the recording.</div><div id="00:00:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Unfortunately because of Covid we had to do these conversations via mobile phone and</div><div id="00:00:57.040" class="transcript_line"> every now and then the quality is a bit of a problem and that was the case with this</div><div id="00:01:03.680" class="transcript_line"> interview.</div><div id="00:01:04.680" class="transcript_line"> But I hope you can still hear her and I hope you still spend the time listening.</div><div id="00:01:11.240" class="transcript_line"> She is an interesting character, a good person and part of what was the heart of the now</div><div id="00:01:21.880" class="transcript_line"> destroyed Tiger Bay.</div><div id="00:01:41.240" class="transcript_line"> So, right, so you&#039;re born and brought up in Nelson Street, yes.</div><div id="00:02:11.160" class="transcript_line"> Where were they from?</div><div id="00:02:19.560" class="transcript_line"> From the docks.</div><div id="00:02:23.320" class="transcript_line"> And their parents?</div><div id="00:02:26.320" class="transcript_line"> My grandparents have been, my father&#039;s father was from Egypt and my mother&#039;s father was</div><div id="00:02:34.120" class="transcript_line"> from Dominica.</div><div id="00:02:36.080" class="transcript_line"> So I got caught in the approach.</div><div id="00:02:39.080" class="transcript_line"> That perfectly sums up the bay doesn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:02:43.080" class="transcript_line"> You know one from Africa, one from the Caribbean, no chance they&#039;d meet except in the bay.</div><div id="00:02:52.080" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:02:53.080" class="transcript_line"> Yeah but I don&#039;t know if you could understand it.</div><div id="00:02:58.080" class="transcript_line"> Everybody comes from now.</div><div id="00:03:02.040" class="transcript_line"> Nobody settled up to value, said Gary was black or she was white or anything like that</div><div id="00:03:09.040" class="transcript_line"> you know.</div><div id="00:03:10.040" class="transcript_line"> We were all so close.</div><div id="00:03:11.040" class="transcript_line"> I suppose you&#039;ve spoken to Gary and everybody have you?</div><div id="00:03:16.040" class="transcript_line"> Everybody, you know Karen Ali and others.</div><div id="00:03:19.040" class="transcript_line"> But I mean what gets me, let me say my granddad arrived early 1900s from Barbados settled</div><div id="00:03:27.240" class="transcript_line"> in Bari.</div><div id="00:03:28.400" class="transcript_line"> I get entirely what you&#039;re saying but do you think everybody got on, because everybody,</div><div id="00:03:37.320" class="transcript_line"> even the white working class people, a lot of them were kind of from somewhere else,</div><div id="00:03:44.320" class="transcript_line"> do you know what I mean?</div><div id="00:03:45.320" class="transcript_line"> From the valleys, from wherever.</div><div id="00:03:46.320" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:03:47.320" class="transcript_line"> Well I can tell you my father&#039;s mother was from Dorset but my mother&#039;s mother was from</div><div id="00:03:56.400" class="transcript_line"> Grange Town.</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> She had quite a few families there you know and we were just a lovely family.</div><div id="00:04:09.400" class="transcript_line"> I never wanted to be anywhere else, I wasn&#039;t anybody else.</div><div id="00:04:16.400" class="transcript_line"> My parents were workers so we never went anywhere else.</div><div id="00:04:21.400" class="transcript_line"> People said they went without.</div><div id="00:04:22.480" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot of people went without since I could be, because everybody helped one another.</div><div id="00:04:29.480" class="transcript_line"> And you could always, if you were playing with one of the kids, one of the three diamond</div><div id="00:04:34.480" class="transcript_line"> arrows, you could have team one.</div><div id="00:04:35.480" class="transcript_line"> And like those, they could have team nine.</div><div id="00:04:38.480" class="transcript_line"> I always say I think the women used to cook for the street.</div><div id="00:04:44.480" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:46.560" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother used to, honestly, it would be either pancakes she&#039;d be making,</div><div id="00:04:55.560" class="transcript_line"> you call them Ralph&#039;s Cheesecakes, we used to call them Baked Storms,</div><div id="00:05:00.560" class="transcript_line"> and she&#039;d stand her always then doing a big plateful.</div><div id="00:05:04.560" class="transcript_line"> And Victor Park had always used to watch him on a chat,</div><div id="00:05:09.560" class="transcript_line"> and my grandmother would be there, we were there when he&#039;d be doing the bloody Baked Storms.</div><div id="00:05:14.640" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the guitarist, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:17.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, a bit of a legend, isn&#039;t he really?</div><div id="00:05:22.640" class="transcript_line"> Lovely, that&#039;s that. Lovely man.</div><div id="00:05:25.640" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother used to listen to it, but I don&#039;t mind you, I love you,</div><div id="00:05:30.640" class="transcript_line"> but grandma&#039;s all my kids too.</div><div id="00:05:37.640" class="transcript_line"> There were some characters down there that got off on now.</div><div id="00:05:41.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s just so excessive about it.</div><div id="00:05:44.720" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:45.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all the characters are gone.</div><div id="00:05:48.720" class="transcript_line"> You know, a lot of the people live where they were born,</div><div id="00:05:52.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know anybody wanted to leave.</div><div id="00:05:55.720" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve lived so many times.</div><div id="00:05:58.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got three parents in the back,</div><div id="00:06:00.720" class="transcript_line"> one of them is a woman, I have good father&#039;s children,</div><div id="00:06:03.720" class="transcript_line"> I have the coachman, I have the wife, I have the judge.</div><div id="00:06:07.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve run up the valley for a few years and I&#039;ve got that up there,</div><div id="00:06:11.800" class="transcript_line"> but I still love the dogs.</div><div id="00:06:15.800" class="transcript_line"> You had quality pubs though, didn&#039;t you? Legend pubs.</div><div id="00:06:18.800" class="transcript_line"> Well, they&#039;ve been there too, I never used to close.</div><div id="00:06:23.800" class="transcript_line"> Where&#039;s the cop closing?</div><div id="00:06:26.800" class="transcript_line"> I never used to close, and if I&#039;d build up</div><div id="00:06:29.800" class="transcript_line"> and his daughter was going out in the night after closing,</div><div id="00:06:32.800" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;d say, where are you going?</div><div id="00:06:34.880" class="transcript_line"> I say nowhere, well, we&#039;re all dressed up.</div><div id="00:06:37.880" class="transcript_line"> Well, I say it&#039;s nice to dress up, not when I can.</div><div id="00:06:40.880" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like to think I was going somewhere else.</div><div id="00:06:43.880" class="transcript_line"> But you set the tone.</div><div id="00:06:45.880" class="transcript_line"> You set the tone, you dressed up, you looked after yourself</div><div id="00:06:49.880" class="transcript_line"> and it said to all the customers,</div><div id="00:06:53.880" class="transcript_line"> there you go, me and you.</div><div id="00:06:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they gave a word to me, you know, at one time, in the pub.</div><div id="00:07:00.880" class="transcript_line"> Yay, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:07:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a lot of music played in your pub?</div><div id="00:07:05.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh, all live music, live music.</div><div id="00:07:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to have a friend who used to have the Welsh Jazz Orchestra play.</div><div id="00:07:13.960" class="transcript_line"> I used to play for free, but it was special every day</div><div id="00:07:16.960" class="transcript_line"> that I was out of steam.</div><div id="00:07:18.960" class="transcript_line"> It used to be compact and they had plenty of musicians</div><div id="00:07:22.960" class="transcript_line"> coming from all over the place.</div><div id="00:07:24.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, we had all kinds of music.</div><div id="00:07:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I love music.</div><div id="00:07:30.040" class="transcript_line"> But I think musicians attract musicians.</div><div id="00:07:34.040" class="transcript_line"> No one watches musicians better than other musicians.</div><div id="00:07:39.040" class="transcript_line"> Musicians, that&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:41.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to be working in the museum</div><div id="00:07:44.040" class="transcript_line"> in the functionary or something, in my room this week.</div><div id="00:07:47.040" class="transcript_line"> They come down, they do all the moon-making,</div><div id="00:07:50.040" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;re all on the clinic,</div><div id="00:07:51.040" class="transcript_line"> they&#039;ve got the only time I could be there, you know?</div><div id="00:07:54.040" class="transcript_line"> And play what they wanted to play.</div><div id="00:07:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and I&#039;m a bit of a singer myself, aren&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:08:03.120" class="transcript_line"> Are there?</div><div id="00:08:04.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a singer, yeah.</div><div id="00:08:06.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I love your favourite music.</div><div id="00:08:09.120" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;ve seen Clank&#039;s Immaculate, High Time,</div><div id="00:08:12.120" class="transcript_line"> the Sixth Sense, you know, and I&#039;ve done all of his songs.</div><div id="00:08:15.120" class="transcript_line"> Shadowborn is my uncle.</div><div id="00:08:17.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve seen lots and lots.</div><div id="00:08:20.120" class="transcript_line"> My musicals, of course, they&#039;re not as distilling</div><div id="00:08:23.120" class="transcript_line"> as anybody did then, but my lots are all gone, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:08:26.200" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:27.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to get this black business.</div><div id="00:08:30.200" class="transcript_line"> Why do they leave people alone?</div><div id="00:08:33.200" class="transcript_line"> I love my background, I love my race,</div><div id="00:08:37.200" class="transcript_line"> I love all the people I&#039;ve got.</div><div id="00:08:40.200" class="transcript_line"> Let me take you back a bit.

were buying and selling a few cars.</div><div id="00:12:45.920" class="transcript_line"> And we had a good education event at the Cathedral School.</div><div id="00:12:49.920" class="transcript_line"> And also, we had a couple of boys that had a hand,</div><div id="00:12:53.920" class="transcript_line"> but they were big.</div><div id="00:12:55.920" class="transcript_line"> But Lewis was a child in the sport.</div><div id="00:12:58.920" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:12:59.920" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s where Lewis&#039;s family came from.</div><div

class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no two ways about it.</div><div id="00:13:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;ve generated enough rugby legends,</div><div id="00:13:12.000" class="transcript_line"> particularly from the Bay.</div><div id="00:13:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Isn&#039;t he just another one of those boys</div><div id="00:13:18.000" class="transcript_line"> whose blood comes from the Bay</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> who&#039;s shown it?</div><div id="00:13:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, all of the rugby.</div><div id="00:13:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, at least he&#039;s playing rugby union for Wales.</div><div id="00:13:28.000" class="transcript_line"> You remember all the boys who had to go north</div><div id="00:13:31.000" class="transcript_line"> to the rugby league.</div><div id="00:13:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course I do.</div><div id="00:13:33.000"

class="transcript_line"> And they were working.</div><div id="00:13:46.080" class="transcript_line"> Because they said Lewis was incredible.</div><div id="00:13:49.080" class="transcript_line"> And they were working men who had to make a living.</div><div id="00:13:52.080" class="transcript_line"> Of course.</div><div id="00:13:54.080" class="transcript_line"> I mean, today there is a sport</div><div id="00:13:56.080" class="transcript_line"> and they get fantastic money.</div><div id="00:13:58.080" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t know what the rugby players get.</div><div id="00:14:01.080" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t ask, but I know footballers do.</div><div id="00:14:04.160" class="transcript_line"> Well, you know, years ago they had jobs.</div><div id="00:14:08.160" class="transcript_line"> And they played on a Saturday.</div><div id="00:14:11.160" class="transcript_line"> You know, no sport can add jobs.</div><div id="00:14:14.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:16.160" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:14:17.160" class="transcript_line"> I mean, people don&#039;t appreciate just how much</div><div id="00:14:20.160" class="transcript_line"> the Bay has contributed to sport.</div><div id="00:14:23.160" class="transcript_line"> What with...</div><div id="00:14:24.160"
