    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I went to kindergarten in Vienna and then I started the ordinary primary school, which I remember as being very academic, very strict.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> When I give talks about my story, which I do, I tell the people how we used to have to sit with our hands flat on the desk in front of us, unless we were writing.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> This is so that the teacher would know where our hands were.</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> And when we answered a question, we had to lift them with just two fingers up like the Bozka absolute.</div><div id="00:00:29.000" class="transcript_line"> It was very disciplined and very academic, and we just studied the normal academic subjects.</div><div id="00:00:36.000" class="transcript_line"> You woke to school early in the morning and you only had morning school.</div><div id="00:00:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the afternoon you did all the extramural things.</div><div id="00:00:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And the things I did were skating, swimming, gymnastics, and my homework, and most importantly, English.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother was an extraordinary woman.</div><div id="00:00:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Although it was a fashion to have your children privately taught French, she thought somehow that English might be of more use, which indeed it was.</div><div id="00:01:04.000" class="transcript_line"> So I had private lessons in English, and as I came to this country when I was 10 and passed the 11 plus, the 11 plus, it&#039;s all credit to my teacher, I suppose.</div><div id="00:01:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So primary school was just an ordinary primary school nearby.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> You went to your neighborhood school, and I must have done reasonably well.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then I went on to a school called the Farnoverfend, which is a little bit like the Girls&#039; Public Day School Trust schools in this country, where I started early.</div><div id="00:01:37.000" class="transcript_line"> I think you should have started at 11, but I was already there when I was 10.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was also very academic, but it seems that I was doing all right.</div><div id="00:01:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The idea was that all the girls who went there would eventually enter the professions and certainly go to university.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> But of course I didn&#039;t stay there long enough for that to happen.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I had a very happy childhood, and full of activity, and very proud when my sister was born when I was six.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And I have very good memories of visiting my father&#039;s shop and going to the opera and swimming and going on wonderful holidays and going skiing and skating and playing the piano.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t that keen on practicing the piano, although I was beginning to do pieces before we came away, and that&#039;s what I enjoyed.</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Scales I didn&#039;t enjoy so much.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And I enjoyed my English lessons.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And the greatest advantage to me was that I had been away from home two or three times before I came to this country.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> So unlike many of the other children who had never been away before they emigrated, for me it wasn&#039;t such a shock.</div></div></p>
