    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for supporting this short project of</div><div id="00:00:10.260" class="transcript_line"> memories of people who lived and were from Butetown, Tiger Bay, the docks.</div><div id="00:00:20.240" class="transcript_line"> And I hope you find the time to listen to it fully.</div><div id="00:00:25.180" class="transcript_line"> This next one is from Dold Salomon.</div><div id="00:00:28.180" class="transcript_line"> My name is Dold Salomon. My dad was Ali Salomon, who ran the Cairo Calf at 236 Bute Street.</div><div id="00:00:42.180" class="transcript_line"> I was born and raised in Butetown and I still spend most of my time in Butetown.</div><div id="00:00:49.180" class="transcript_line"> Let me interrupt very briefly there the conversation with Dold.</div><div id="00:00:55.180" class="transcript_line"> This next clip is from a BBC program in 2011. It was originally recorded in 1968.</div><div id="00:01:05.180" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t think he, and he doesn&#039;t know I&#039;m putting this into the podcast.</div><div id="00:01:10.180" class="transcript_line"> This is Dold&#039;s mother, Olive Salomon, talking about bumping into his father outside the Cairo Café when she was 15.</div><div id="00:01:23.180" class="transcript_line"> And she was a nurse on her way back from the cinema. And she was from the valleys.</div><div id="00:01:29.180" class="transcript_line"> My dad had just opened up the Cairo Café, not long, and he happened to be standing outside on the front door.</div><div id="00:01:41.180" class="transcript_line"> I stopped and asked this boy then the way to Queen Street. And he said I was losing my way to the docks.</div><div id="00:01:50.180" class="transcript_line"> And we started talking. I think we fell in love there and then.</div><div id="00:01:55.180" class="transcript_line"> We got married when I was 16 and three weeks actually. I had five children before I was 21.</div><div id="00:02:02.180" class="transcript_line"> We got, we had ten children, five boys and five girls.</div><div id="00:02:08.180" class="transcript_line"> Of course when I got married there was a great stir at home because the priest from the church even came and told my mother that</div><div id="00:02:16.180" class="transcript_line"> marrying an Arab, I was marrying a heathen. There was quite a stir at home.</div><div id="00:02:22.180" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s return to the interview with Dold, which was recorded by the way during lockdown on the 24th of February 2021.</div><div id="00:02:38.180" class="transcript_line"> Now to mention a bit about Butone, when I was born and grew up in Butone, it was a unique place.</div><div id="00:02:50.180" class="transcript_line"> We had people there from every part of the world. Everybody treated their neighbors and friends.</div><div id="00:03:00.180" class="transcript_line"> We were all welcome. Nobody looked at the color of anybody.</div><div id="00:03:05.180" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t even think of the color of this person was a different color to be on. That person was a different color.</div><div id="00:03:12.180" class="transcript_line"> We looked at people and took them for what they were. And people didn&#039;t have a lot in those days.</div><div id="00:03:21.180" class="transcript_line"> But what they had, they were prepared to share with one another.</div><div id="00:03:26.180" class="transcript_line"> If somebody was in trouble, people would run to their aid and try to help them as best they could.</div><div id="00:03:32.180" class="transcript_line"> You had many people described Butone as a place not to go to.</div><div id="00:03:41.180" class="transcript_line"> But you had some of the nicest people in the world you could ever meet or come across.</div><div id="00:03:48.180" class="transcript_line"> Growing up, we had no problems in Butone.</div><div id="00:03:54.180" class="transcript_line"> It was when we went over the bridge and through the traffic lights into outside Butone that we encountered people abusing us, calling us names and things.</div><div id="00:04:11.180" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t bad people, but we were able to defend ourselves. And defend ourselves we did.</div><div id="00:04:17.180" class="transcript_line"> We put a lot of those problems with ignorance and lack of knowledge.</div><div id="00:04:23.180" class="transcript_line"> Because later on, we became friends with those people and we all grew up.</div><div id="00:04:29.180" class="transcript_line"> A lot of people succeeded in businesses and whatnot. But we managed to keep a friendship going.</div><div id="00:04:36.180" class="transcript_line"> No, today, rather when they began to demolish Butone, they split up a very tight community.</div><div id="00:04:44.180" class="transcript_line"> And people were sent out to these new estates while they were knocking down the buildings.</div><div id="00:04:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And there were some beautiful buildings there.</div><div id="00:04:54.180" class="transcript_line"> If the government could have only had foresight and redeveloped those homes, it would have been lovely.</div><div id="00:05:00.180" class="transcript_line"> They were beautiful buildings. They had character.</div><div id="00:05:03.180" class="transcript_line"> But then they decided to build what we&#039;ve got there today.</div><div id="00:05:06.180" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a different place altogether now.</div><div id="00:05:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Those people left and went to other communities.</div><div id="00:05:13.180" class="transcript_line"> And the community was split.</div><div id="00:05:15.180" class="transcript_line"> And then, you know, to rub people&#039;s face in it, they brought other troublesome families from outside of Butone to Butone.</div><div id="00:05:24.180" class="transcript_line"> And those people had a bit of respect, to respect the elderly.</div><div id="00:05:30.180" class="transcript_line"> And we did. But the place is not the same, though.</div><div id="00:05:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Butone&#039;s not the same.</div><div id="00:05:36.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was a great place to grow up in.</div><div id="00:05:39.180" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t matter what religion you were or what country you came from.</div><div id="00:05:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was treated exactly the same.</div><div id="00:05:49.180" class="transcript_line"> And we all took part in our religious festivals and whatnot.</div><div id="00:05:53.180" class="transcript_line"> The Christian sector of the community would come and celebrate with us at the end of Ramadan.</div><div id="00:05:59.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we&#039;d cook lots of food and share it with the community.</div><div id="00:06:03.180" class="transcript_line"> People used to look forward to it. It was nice.</div><div id="00:06:07.180" class="transcript_line"> Even on the Wits and Treats, there&#039;d be more kids in Sunday school, more Muslim kids, than Christians, to get a ticket to go on the Wits and Treats.</div><div id="00:06:18.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, this is how it was.</div><div id="00:06:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Nobody got turned away because they were a different faith or anything.</div><div id="00:06:23.180" class="transcript_line"> We were all one. And they were good, happy days.</div><div id="00:06:26.180" class="transcript_line"> And in those days, we used to go on the Wits and Treats on the back of a lorry.</div><div id="00:06:30.180" class="transcript_line"> We had clacks, transport.</div><div id="00:06:34.180" class="transcript_line"> We used to provide the church with a couple of wagons, and they&#039;d put all the church pews on the back.</div><div id="00:06:41.180" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we said. They probably couldn&#039;t do it today.</div><div id="00:06:44.180" class="transcript_line"> But they were good days. And we went off into the countryside and had a nice day.</div><div id="00:06:50.180" class="transcript_line"> For the kids, that would have just been an adventure.</div><div id="00:06:53.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everybody used to look forward to it coming.</div><div id="00:06:59.180" class="transcript_line"> It was great. And there was no hassle. You know, it was lovely.</div><div id="00:07:07.180" class="transcript_line"> One of my early memories of the bay is my uncle Darwin, Darwin Hinds.</div><div id="00:07:15.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I know Darwin. I knew Darwin.</div><div id="00:07:18.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, my uncle Darwin brought me down to the mosque when I was a kid.</div><div id="00:07:23.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. Well, Darwin, you know, he was a special person in itself</div><div id="00:07:30.180" class="transcript_line"> because he was very big friends with our late Checksite.</div><div id="00:07:35.180" class="transcript_line"> And they were very close.</div><div id="00:07:38.180" class="transcript_line"> And Delgado and that, they were all sort of pals together.</div><div id="00:07:44.180" class="transcript_line"> And Darwin converted to Islam.</div><div id="00:07:48.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right. I mean, he was a wonderful leader, Checksite, a wonderful leader.</div><div id="00:07:53.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a wonderful man, you know, difficult to replace.</div><div id="00:07:57.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, we never replaced him, you know. He was a special person.</div><div id="00:08:02.180" class="transcript_line"> And Darwin contributed a lot to his faith in Cardiff and in Barry.</div><div id="00:08:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:10.180" class="transcript_line"> Because he enabled us to purchase the old police station there.</div><div id="00:08:14.180" class="transcript_line"> And that was converted into a place of prayer, mosque.</div><div id="00:08:18.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, Darwin helped us a great deal in doing that.</div><div id="00:08:21.180" class="transcript_line"> They were good days. They were good days, the old days.</div><div id="00:08:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Things have changed and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s for the better.</div><div id="00:08:29.180" class="transcript_line"> It was much better in those days than what it is now.</div><div id="00:08:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go to school, Don?</div><div id="00:08:36.180" class="transcript_line"> I went to school South Church Street.</div><div id="00:08:39.180" class="transcript_line"> That was just across the road from St. Mary&#039;s Church there up on Bute Street.</div><div id="00:08:44.180" class="transcript_line"> It was in South Church Street and the school was called South Church Street,</div><div id="00:08:49.180" class="transcript_line"> which the majority of the Bute Town families, they all went there.</div><div id="00:08:55.180" class="transcript_line"> And we had some very special people as well who did well for themselves.</div><div id="00:08:59.180" class="transcript_line"> And they all started off in South Church Street.</div><div id="00:09:03.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, Billy Boston, fantastic rugby player.</div><div id="00:09:09.180" class="transcript_line"> He represented the community.</div><div id="00:09:11.180" class="transcript_line"> And yet because of his colour, he was denied to play with whales.</div><div id="00:09:15.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, later on, he was well capable of playing for whales and he would have done well.</div><div id="00:09:22.180" class="transcript_line"> But you have these stupid, I don&#039;t know what you say,</div><div id="00:09:26.180" class="transcript_line"> people who use colour and whatnot to prevent somebody getting on in life.</div><div id="00:09:32.180" class="transcript_line"> The trouble with Billy Boston and Freeman and a load of them is</div><div id="00:09:37.180" class="transcript_line"> not only were they black, but they were also working class.</div><div id="00:09:42.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, exactly.</div><div id="00:09:44.180" class="transcript_line"> Which is one of the reasons all the white people who were in the bay got on with the black people.</div><div id="00:09:51.180" class="transcript_line"> They were all working class.</div><div id="00:09:53.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, exactly.</div><div id="00:09:55.180" class="transcript_line"> We were all one.</div><div id="00:09:57.180" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t see anybody was better than the other all.</div><div id="00:09:59.180" class="transcript_line"> We were all the same.</div><div id="00:10:01.180" class="transcript_line"> And like later on, Billy Boston, he was lucky enough that the Scouts came along</div><div id="00:10:06.180" class="transcript_line"> and he was playing with the kayaks and they picked him and took him up north.</div><div id="00:10:11.180" class="transcript_line"> And the people up there in Wigan, they loved him.</div><div id="00:10:14.180" class="transcript_line"> They took him into their house and he did them prog.</div><div id="00:10:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was because of his ability to play rugby, not because of his colour or anything.</div><div id="00:10:25.180" class="transcript_line"> They appreciated him for what he did and they loved him.</div><div id="00:10:31.180" class="transcript_line"> But today we&#039;ve got problems with the youth.</div><div id="00:10:36.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got nothing to do.</div><div id="00:10:38.180" class="transcript_line"> The clubs are all closed and they&#039;re hanging about on the streets with nothing to do</div><div id="00:10:44.180" class="transcript_line"> and they get into a bit of mischief from time to time.</div><div id="00:10:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Other people have mentioned Chalky White&#039;s place.</div><div id="00:10:50.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, Chalky White, he kept them in hand.</div><div id="00:10:54.180" class="transcript_line"> He was brilliant.</div><div id="00:10:56.180" class="transcript_line"> He run the youth club there and he did a great job.</div><div id="00:11:01.180" class="transcript_line"> He would take no messing off.</div><div id="00:11:03.180" class="transcript_line"> Nobody like you, you all came in and listened to the rules and regulations.</div><div id="00:11:08.180" class="transcript_line"> As long as you stood by them, you were fine.</div><div id="00:11:10.180" class="transcript_line"> But if you crossed, he could deal with you.</div><div id="00:11:14.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a great man.</div><div id="00:11:16.180" class="transcript_line"> One of the things that worked was when the parents handed over the kid to Chalky White,</div><div id="00:11:22.180" class="transcript_line"> it was clear he&#039;s the man in charge.</div><div id="00:11:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:28.180" class="transcript_line"> He was trusted and he always looked out for the benefit of the youth.</div><div id="00:11:33.180" class="transcript_line"> And this is why he got on with the youth.</div><div id="00:11:35.180" class="transcript_line"> He wanted to help the youth get on and make something of their lives and whatnot.</div><div id="00:11:42.180" class="transcript_line"> And he did all he could to help them.</div><div id="00:11:44.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a great man.</div><div id="00:11:48.180" class="transcript_line"> What was it like when you left school and you were trying to get work?</div><div id="00:11:54.180" class="transcript_line"> What was that like?</div><div id="00:11:56.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, in those days, in the docks, because the majority of people were OXC men and whatnot,</div><div id="00:12:03.180" class="transcript_line"> the thing was that when you left school, everybody wanted to go away to sea.</div><div id="00:12:09.180" class="transcript_line"> I went down to the shipping federation and I got the forms to join up as a merchant seaman.</div><div id="00:12:17.180" class="transcript_line"> And my dad had to sign the papers.</div><div id="00:12:21.180" class="transcript_line"> And I took it back home to my dad and my dad looked at it and he ripped the papers up.</div><div id="00:12:30.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what he thought were my choice.</div><div id="00:12:33.180" class="transcript_line"> But he said to me, go and see if you can find an apprenticeship and learn something and do something with your life.</div><div id="00:12:43.180" class="transcript_line"> And funny enough, the next day, there was a lot of industry in Cardiff in those days.</div><div id="00:12:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And I went out the following day and I found a job as an apprentice fitter turner.</div><div id="00:13:00.180" class="transcript_line"> I was so happy because I walked in very cheekily.</div><div id="00:13:03.180" class="transcript_line"> And the guy that gave me the job, he worked in a company called Trouble Cane Foundry and Engineering.</div><div id="00:13:14.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was a top company.</div><div id="00:13:16.180" class="transcript_line"> They, I think, the propeller for the first Queen Elizabeth was cast there.</div><div id="00:13:25.180" class="transcript_line"> They did a lot of, you know, they were the foundry, they cast the material there and then went into the machine shop for machining.</div><div id="00:13:34.180" class="transcript_line"> And then he was a French guy who looked after the engine sector.</div><div id="00:13:40.180" class="transcript_line"> They built these old pumps and generators and whatnot there.</div><div id="00:13:46.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;d taken over a company called Imperial Keighley from up north.</div><div id="00:13:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And he was in charge of building all these engines, different types of engines, which were sent all over the world, you know, countries like third world countries.</div><div id="00:14:02.180" class="transcript_line"> There were lots in Brazil, in Peru, those kind of places, and they used them for all sorts of things.</div><div id="00:14:09.180" class="transcript_line"> I got a job with him and he took me in hand, gave me the job and he looked after me throughout my apprenticeship.</div><div id="00:14:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And when I was four and a half years into my apprenticeship, I approached Reardon Smith, which was an old shipping company in Cardiff,</div><div id="00:14:32.180" class="transcript_line"> and applied for a job there as a junior engineer.</div><div id="00:14:36.180" class="transcript_line"> And they gave me the job and they gave me a sub to go buy my uniform and whatnot.</div><div id="00:14:44.180" class="transcript_line"> And we had a shop down in James Street, Silvers.</div><div id="00:14:49.180" class="transcript_line"> And when you went down there, he kept you out with all the necessary things that you need.</div><div id="00:14:56.180" class="transcript_line"> And off I went with Reardon Smith.</div><div id="00:15:00.180" class="transcript_line"> Later on, I came home. My dad had passed away by then and my mother was hoping to take on one of the new buildings that they&#039;d built</div><div id="00:15:11.180" class="transcript_line"> and open it up as a cafe to commemorate my dad.</div><div id="00:15:16.180" class="transcript_line"> So I had to take some time off to help her because she was getting on by then.</div><div id="00:15:24.180" class="transcript_line"> But it wasn&#039;t my thing, you know.</div><div id="00:15:27.180" class="transcript_line"> So I took time off there, a couple of years of it, and then I went back into the shipping.</div><div id="00:15:35.180" class="transcript_line"> And I worked for a company who employed a lot of the people from Butone.</div><div id="00:15:42.180" class="transcript_line"> A lot of the people had good Christmases and whatnot from this company.</div><div id="00:15:46.180" class="transcript_line"> A company called, it was Worldwide Marine Engineers at first, and it changed later on to Cardiff Craftsmen.</div><div id="00:15:56.180" class="transcript_line"> We managed to get a contract with PNORM, repairing their ships.</div><div id="00:16:02.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, I spent 30 odd years doing that.</div><div id="00:16:07.180" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d fly out. If there was an emergency or anything, they&#039;d call us and we&#039;d have to be ready to go like that.</div><div id="00:16:15.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was great because at one time there was about four of us in the team.</div><div id="00:16:23.180" class="transcript_line"> We all grew up together. We went to school together.</div><div id="00:16:28.180" class="transcript_line"> And we worked together, you know, for a long, long time.</div><div id="00:16:33.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, we just got on great with each other.</div><div id="00:16:37.180" class="transcript_line"> It was nice.</div><div id="00:16:40.180" class="transcript_line"> And we earned the respect of the PNOR offices and whatnot because they gave us a name.</div><div id="00:16:50.180" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh Wizards, they used to call us.</div><div id="00:16:55.180" class="transcript_line"> Because we used to go out and we&#039;d perform some big jobs, you know, which were dry dock jobs, really.</div><div id="00:17:03.180" class="transcript_line"> But we&#039;d do them at sea while the ship was working.</div><div id="00:17:06.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, the passengers didn&#039;t know what was going on down below.</div><div id="00:17:11.180" class="transcript_line"> And we saved them a lot of money.</div><div id="00:17:14.180" class="transcript_line"> So, and they showed their respect to us, you know.</div><div id="00:17:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was good.</div><div id="00:17:20.180" class="transcript_line"> And whenever we took somebody new who was from Buton, they used to say, hey, this is great, man. I made it.</div><div id="00:17:31.180" class="transcript_line"> One day we&#039;re in America, next day Mexico, next, you know.</div><div id="00:17:37.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, they were, I mean, an opening like that is very difficult to find.</div><div id="00:17:44.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:17:46.180" class="transcript_line"> But they were good boys.</div><div id="00:17:48.180" class="transcript_line"> And whenever we needed them to pull their socks up, they did.</div><div id="00:17:52.180" class="transcript_line"> And we were repaid by PNOR.</div><div id="00:17:55.180" class="transcript_line"> PNOR loved us, you know.</div><div id="00:17:57.180" class="transcript_line"> And they kept on using us until they went over to America then.</div><div id="00:18:05.180" class="transcript_line"> And they were bought out.</div><div id="00:18:07.180" class="transcript_line"> And things changed.</div><div id="00:18:08.180" class="transcript_line"> And the management changed.</div><div id="00:18:10.180" class="transcript_line"> And the whole structure of PNOR changed.</div><div id="00:18:13.180" class="transcript_line"> But we had 30 odd wonderful years with them.</div><div id="00:18:17.180" class="transcript_line"> Let me take you back.</div><div id="00:18:19.180" class="transcript_line"> Cairo Cafe.</div><div id="00:18:21.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a legend.</div><div id="00:18:23.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a legend in a way.</div><div id="00:18:25.180" class="transcript_line"> Tell me more about the Cairo.</div><div id="00:18:27.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, when my dad first came over to this country, he used to work in one of the boarding houses.</div><div id="00:18:39.180" class="transcript_line"> He was a top cook, you know.</div><div id="00:18:42.180" class="transcript_line"> And of course, whilst he was working in this boarding house, people started to come and eat there and it became great.</div><div id="00:18:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And this guy wanted my dad to marry his daughter.</div><div id="00:18:58.180" class="transcript_line"> And my dad wasn&#039;t too keen on it.</div><div id="00:19:02.180" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;d been saving up his coppers and whatnot.</div><div id="00:19:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And he had enough to rent 236 Bute Street and opened it up as the Cairo Cafe.</div><div id="00:19:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And in those days, he bought secondhand furniture and whatnot, you know.</div><div id="00:19:24.180" class="transcript_line"> And his luck was opened up there.</div><div id="00:19:29.180" class="transcript_line"> And he did well.</div><div id="00:19:30.180" class="transcript_line"> And then he was able to purchase the property.</div><div id="00:19:34.180" class="transcript_line"> And he went on to purchase 234, 235, and 236 four-hoses.</div><div id="00:19:42.180" class="transcript_line"> And inside, we had about 40 rooms, which he sort of joined them everything together.</div><div id="00:19:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And we had lodgers there with the Yevheny Sibin, also Mali Sibin.</div><div id="00:19:58.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, things went well for him.</div><div id="00:20:04.180" class="transcript_line"> And his luck turned up, but he never forgot where he came from.</div><div id="00:20:09.180" class="transcript_line"> Because my dad would never throw food away.</div><div id="00:20:13.180" class="transcript_line"> And he always taught us to respect food and not to abuse it.</div><div id="00:20:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And every night, all the, you know, the donor notices would turn up.</div><div id="00:20:27.180" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;d give them whatever food was left from the day.</div><div id="00:20:30.180" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d give it all to them.</div><div id="00:20:32.180" class="transcript_line"> And they used to come every night and line up.</div><div id="00:20:37.180" class="transcript_line"> And when my dad passed away, they all came as well to see him off.</div><div id="00:20:43.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was very sad to see them, you know.</div><div id="00:20:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:49.180" class="transcript_line"> But he did well.</div><div id="00:20:52.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, everybody respected him.</div><div id="00:20:56.180" class="transcript_line"> He had a good life.</div><div id="00:20:58.180" class="transcript_line"> During the war, he was in an air raid shelter.</div><div id="00:21:02.180" class="transcript_line"> Air raid warden.</div><div id="00:21:05.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:07.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, with many of the other people.</div><div id="00:21:10.180" class="transcript_line"> And they&#039;d go out in the night searching the bomb buildings and whatnot.</div><div id="00:21:17.180" class="transcript_line"> And helping the people with whatever they had to do.</div><div id="00:21:21.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, no big thing was made of it.</div><div id="00:21:26.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, people did what they had to do.</div><div id="00:21:28.180" class="transcript_line"> And that was it.</div><div id="00:21:29.180" class="transcript_line"> It was their community.</div><div id="00:21:31.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:36.180" class="transcript_line"> And like I say, people from all different nations, but everybody worked together lovely.</div><div id="00:21:43.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, one of the things you&#039;re saying about your father passing and people being there.</div><div id="00:21:48.180" class="transcript_line"> People talk about funerals and the way people are respectful in funerals around Butown and the Bay.</div><div id="00:21:57.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah. Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:59.180" class="transcript_line"> And it doesn&#039;t matter what religion it is.</div><div id="00:22:04.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, everybody will come out to see the person off.</div><div id="00:22:10.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, the...</div><div id="00:22:12.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, in later years, you had Peter Phillips like he sounded a band up.</div><div id="00:22:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And he did like the old New Orleans type funeral where he&#039;d be up the front in front of the hearse banging away.</div><div id="00:22:27.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was great.</div><div id="00:22:29.180" class="transcript_line"> Like, you know, it gave a little bit of spirit.</div><div id="00:22:32.180" class="transcript_line"> It made the funeral a little bit more cheerful.</div><div id="00:22:36.180" class="transcript_line"> And of course, everybody and people would carry their deceased all up Beach Street up to the as far as the church.</div><div id="00:22:46.180" class="transcript_line"> Because our place, we were very close to St. Mary&#039;s Church.</div><div id="00:22:51.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, everybody had come out to watch the, you know, the passing of the funeral.</div><div id="00:22:59.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It was great.</div><div id="00:23:02.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I can remember Michael Darwin&#039;s funeral.</div><div id="00:23:06.180" class="transcript_line"> And they had to close the middle of town.</div><div id="00:23:09.180" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they realized just how seriously people took funerals.</div><div id="00:23:16.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. That&#039;s right. Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:18.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, and the people...</div><div id="00:23:20.180" class="transcript_line"> And that thing about burying, you know, filling in the grave.</div><div id="00:23:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:23:26.180" class="transcript_line"> Shift back. The guy&#039;s just doing it.</div><div id="00:23:29.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s emotional, that is, I think. I think that&#039;s really special.</div><div id="00:23:33.180" class="transcript_line"> It is. It&#039;s a very nice thing to do for the families, respectful to the families.</div><div id="00:23:40.180" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, even people from St. Mary&#039;s Church, when they were buried, they&#039;d still fill in the...</div><div id="00:23:48.180" class="transcript_line"> You know, the local people would still fill in the grave once they were there.</div><div id="00:23:54.180" class="transcript_line"> And it sort of caught on.</div><div id="00:23:57.180" class="transcript_line"> And it was a great thing, you know.</div><div id="00:24:01.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I always thought of that as being a Muslim tradition.</div><div id="00:24:05.180" class="transcript_line"> That it shifted over.</div><div id="00:24:07.180" class="transcript_line"> And now that says so much about faith.</div><div id="00:24:11.180" class="transcript_line"> That this is the tradition of one faith.</div><div id="00:24:14.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:24:15.180" class="transcript_line"> But people did it.</div><div id="00:24:16.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, it just shows that level of respect.</div><div id="00:24:20.180" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very, very special.</div><div id="00:24:22.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh, it&#039;s very special, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:24.180" class="transcript_line"> Very special.</div><div id="00:24:26.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there was no hatred or anything like some of the things that we have today, you know.</div><div id="00:24:35.180" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got these wild Muslims who were miseducated.</div><div id="00:24:40.180" class="transcript_line"> And they carry out atrocities.</div><div id="00:24:42.180" class="transcript_line"> None of that, them days.</div><div id="00:24:44.180" class="transcript_line"> It was pure Islam.</div><div id="00:24:47.180" class="transcript_line"> And Islam is a religion.</div><div id="00:24:50.180" class="transcript_line"> It means peace, you know.</div><div id="00:24:52.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, to go and take somebody&#039;s life.</div><div id="00:24:57.180" class="transcript_line"> Or do mischief as a thing to people.</div><div id="00:25:03.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not looked at as very good in Islam.</div><div id="00:25:09.180" class="transcript_line"> But like you say, that was a tradition.</div><div id="00:25:13.180" class="transcript_line"> The Muslims always did it.</div><div id="00:25:15.180" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re deceased.</div><div id="00:25:17.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, it was the youth of the community that carried that on to the Christian burials.</div><div id="00:25:31.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was very nice.</div><div id="00:25:34.180" class="transcript_line"> Well, as you say about your dad and feeding people who had nothing.</div><div id="00:25:39.180" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s another concept of Islam. Charity.</div><div id="00:25:43.180" class="transcript_line"> Exactly, yeah.</div><div id="00:25:45.180" class="transcript_line"> I mean, it doesn&#039;t matter what religion, whether you&#039;re Jewish, Christian, or Muslim.</div><div id="00:25:53.180" class="transcript_line"> The aim, the books are all the same.</div><div id="00:25:56.180" class="transcript_line"> The story in the book is exactly the same.</div><div id="00:25:59.180" class="transcript_line"> And, you know, it&#039;s a way of life.</div><div id="00:26:04.180" class="transcript_line"> And God is trying to teach us to live a good life.</div><div id="00:26:09.180" class="transcript_line"> And he promises us a better life in the year after.</div><div id="00:26:13.180" class="transcript_line"> And if we succeed, you know, so really we&#039;re all connected.</div><div id="00:26:20.180" class="transcript_line"> And we all come from Adam and Eve.</div><div id="00:26:23.180" class="transcript_line"> So we believe.</div><div id="00:26:26.180" class="transcript_line"> So what does that tell you?</div><div id="00:26:28.180" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re all related.</div><div id="00:26:30.180" class="transcript_line"> So we should get on better with one another.</div><div id="00:26:33.180" class="transcript_line"> And literally in the Bay and Bute town, so many families have cross-married and all the rest of it.</div><div id="00:26:41.180" class="transcript_line"> And still people in the same family worshipping differently.</div><div id="00:26:47.180" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:26:49.180" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s amazing.
