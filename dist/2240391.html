    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not just about the images here, it&#039;s how you feel in your heart, that&#039;s the key.</div><div id="00:00:19.560" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s about understanding pain, knowing it&#039;s not your enemy, it&#039;s life trying to show</div><div id="00:00:23.520" class="transcript_line"> you the person that you can really be.</div><div id="00:00:26.400" class="transcript_line"> Maybe I&#039;ve been learning not to run away from the pain.</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> I know it&#039;s hard, everybody feels the same, but what I&#039;ve learned is to step in out from</div><div id="00:00:34.200" class="transcript_line"> a gate.</div><div id="00:00:35.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve stormed me to love instead of hate.</div><div id="00:00:39.200" class="transcript_line"> Thinking of the place I left behind, leaving for a memory is in my mind.</div><div id="00:00:51.920" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it&#039;s hard to live and say, but things are meant to be the same.</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve laid through the place I left behind, leaving for a memory.</div><div id="00:01:29.360" class="transcript_line"> This land holds love as vast as the ocean.</div><div id="00:01:33.080" class="transcript_line"> Open hearts are never to be broken.</div><div id="00:01:36.080" class="transcript_line"> Living with two tongues, song and spoken.</div><div id="00:01:39.480" class="transcript_line"> Strong emotions are not scared to show them.</div><div id="00:01:42.480" class="transcript_line"> All of this connection makes people feel related.</div><div id="00:01:45.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how a lot of stories were created.</div><div id="00:01:49.120" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s how we make many places become one.</div><div id="00:01:52.120" class="transcript_line"> Wrote to the future that all become.</div><div id="00:01:56.280" class="transcript_line"> This is a podcast about East.</div><div id="00:01:59.560" class="transcript_line"> Inrexam.</div><div id="00:02:00.560" class="transcript_line"> East stands for.</div><div id="00:02:02.280" class="transcript_line"> Ethnic youth support.</div><div id="00:02:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Team Wales.</div><div id="00:02:05.520" class="transcript_line"> Which is a posh name for a place where young people from ethnic minorities and their families</div><div id="00:02:12.200" class="transcript_line"> can come after school.</div><div id="00:02:14.640" class="transcript_line"> And have fun.</div><div id="00:02:16.040" class="transcript_line"> And have opportunities.</div><div id="00:02:17.840" class="transcript_line"> And feel that they belong.</div><div id="00:02:19.880" class="transcript_line"> And feel safe.</div><div id="00:02:21.200" class="transcript_line"> Some people who come here are refugees, are silent seekers.</div><div id="00:02:24.880" class="transcript_line"> Some aren&#039;t.</div><div id="00:02:26.000" class="transcript_line"> East support all young people and their families.</div><div id="00:02:29.800" class="transcript_line"> This podcast is about what it&#039;s like for some of us living in Wales.</div><div id="00:02:33.960" class="transcript_line"> And what we think about Welsh history and Welsh culture.</div><div id="00:02:38.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s also about what we, in our turn, bring to Wales our history and our culture, our</div><div id="00:02:45.600" class="transcript_line"> own rich traditions.</div><div id="00:02:48.360" class="transcript_line"> We have created songs and poems and thoughts.</div><div id="00:02:51.840" class="transcript_line"> All the words in this podcast have been written or spoken by people in our group.</div><div id="00:02:57.120" class="transcript_line"> But sometimes their words will be spoken by other members of the group.</div><div id="00:03:01.840" class="transcript_line"> So who are we to introduce ourselves?</div><div id="00:03:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Arleith.</div><div id="00:03:06.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m originally from Portugal.</div><div id="00:03:08.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a youth worker here at least in Rexam.</div><div id="00:03:11.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Tony and I&#039;m a youth worker here at East.</div><div id="00:03:15.840" class="transcript_line"> Although originally I&#039;m from Nicaragua.</div><div id="00:03:18.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Gosha and I&#039;m a regional youth worker here and I&#039;m from Poland.</div><div id="00:03:24.200" class="transcript_line"> The song you heard at the beginning was created by Denise, one of our young adult members</div><div id="00:03:28.960" class="transcript_line"> here who studied music at college, with a bit of help from Diego.</div><div id="00:03:34.480" class="transcript_line"> Diego is 18 and he&#039;s at college now, but studying engineering, not music.</div><div id="00:03:40.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Kelvin, I&#039;m 12.</div><div id="00:03:41.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m originally from Portugal like I&#039;ve ever met.</div><div id="00:03:44.040" class="transcript_line"> But now I live here in Rexam with my mom, dad, brother and sister.</div><div id="00:03:48.680" class="transcript_line"> School&#039;s okay though it gets loud and we get a lot of homework.</div><div id="00:03:53.560" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s good that I learn.</div><div id="00:03:55.120" class="transcript_line"> I like PE especially when we do basketball or football.</div><div id="00:03:58.520" class="transcript_line"> My name is Mercy Grace and I&#039;m 11.</div><div id="00:04:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Nigeria and my parents come from two different places there.</div><div id="00:04:05.480" class="transcript_line"> From Joss in Benway and from Nicaragua.</div><div id="00:04:09.160" class="transcript_line"> After we left Nigeria, we lived in leads for a time before coming to Rexam.</div><div id="00:04:14.520" class="transcript_line"> I live with my mom, my dad and my two sisters and I go to Clare Dog High School.</div><div id="00:04:20.080" class="transcript_line"> I love school.</div><div id="00:04:21.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s all about learning.</div><div id="00:04:23.400" class="transcript_line"> It helps you gain more knowledge for the future.</div><div id="00:04:26.080" class="transcript_line"> Also, it&#039;s a good and interesting way to make lots of friends.</div><div id="00:04:30.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Trenaza and I&#039;m Mercy Grace&#039;s younger sister and I&#039;m nine.</div><div id="00:04:35.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Latissia and I&#039;m 17.</div><div id="00:04:37.600" class="transcript_line"> My name is Inshira and I&#039;m eight.</div><div id="00:04:39.960" class="transcript_line"> I was born on the 24th of December in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:04:43.400" class="transcript_line"> And I live in Wales ever since.</div><div id="00:04:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Now I live here in Rexam.</div><div id="00:04:49.440" class="transcript_line"> I love baking cookies, pancakes and other desserts.</div><div id="00:04:52.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve had a great time since we moved to Rexam and I&#039;ve made lots of friends at school.</div><div id="00:04:57.960" class="transcript_line"> What I love is going to new places and chasing sheep.</div><div id="00:05:01.440" class="transcript_line"> I hope there aren&#039;t any Welsh farmers listening.</div><div id="00:05:04.280" class="transcript_line"> My name is Avi and I&#039;m 12 years old.</div><div id="00:05:07.760" class="transcript_line"> And I used to live in London before we came here.</div><div id="00:05:11.600" class="transcript_line"> I live with my mom.</div><div id="00:05:13.080" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m in year eight at school and I love to play football.</div><div id="00:05:17.640" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m basketball.</div><div id="00:05:18.960" class="transcript_line"> My name is Noah and I am eight.</div><div id="00:05:20.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Hadja and I&#039;m eleven.</div><div id="00:05:23.040" class="transcript_line"> We didn&#039;t exercise for this podcast or we had to pick a word from a big bowl of cut</div><div id="00:05:27.720" class="transcript_line"> out words and write about it.</div><div id="00:05:31.280" class="transcript_line"> I chose a word past and this is what I wrote.</div><div id="00:05:35.680" class="transcript_line"> To me, London is more busy than Rexam.</div><div id="00:05:38.880" class="transcript_line"> Rexam is more quieter.</div><div id="00:05:40.920" class="transcript_line"> My past has been sad because my father always used to hit me and my mom.</div><div id="00:05:46.560" class="transcript_line"> Since we moved to Rexam, I&#039;ve been scared because he was always hitting my mom.</div><div id="00:05:52.640" class="transcript_line"> But this was the past.</div><div id="00:05:54.320" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s better now.</div><div id="00:05:55.440" class="transcript_line"> Although now I get bullied at school because of my turban.</div><div id="00:06:00.680" class="transcript_line"> People think silent seekers are always running away from war.</div><div id="00:06:04.840" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they are not.</div><div id="00:06:06.520" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes they are just running from family relationships.</div><div id="00:06:10.680" class="transcript_line"> But some of us have sought refuge from violence in our birth countries.</div><div id="00:06:15.320" class="transcript_line"> Some of us have written or spoken about this for this podcast.</div><div id="00:06:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Some have chosen not to.</div><div id="00:06:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Diego, who helped write the song at the beginning, came from San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador.</div><div id="00:06:29.400" class="transcript_line"> He said he left five years ago because of the violence there.</div><div id="00:06:32.840" class="transcript_line"> He said it wasn&#039;t like a violent regime, more like two violent rival gangs fighting.</div><div id="00:06:40.280" class="transcript_line"> Tony here.</div><div id="00:06:41.280" class="transcript_line"> I was a journalist in Nicaragua where I did a degree in journalists.</div><div id="00:06:46.160" class="transcript_line"> But there were riots about pensions people were against the government.</div><div id="00:06:51.760" class="transcript_line"> And I wrote about how the government was not telling the truth.</div><div id="00:06:56.440" class="transcript_line"> Soon they were chasing me in the street.</div><div id="00:07:00.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was very dangerous for me.</div><div id="00:07:02.520" class="transcript_line"> So I left and I became an asylum seeker in Wales.</div><div id="00:07:07.960" class="transcript_line"> This was five years ago.</div><div id="00:07:11.480" class="transcript_line"> Since then I visit Cardiff and live in London, a handslet in Wrexon.</div><div id="00:07:17.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a musician as well as a journalist.</div><div id="00:07:21.400" class="transcript_line"> I play guitar.</div><div id="00:07:22.720" class="transcript_line"> So when I was in Cardiff, I volunteered with Welsh National Opera and was in three professional</div><div id="00:07:30.080" class="transcript_line"> production as a volunteer.</div><div id="00:07:32.760" class="transcript_line"> My team composing and performing in a handslet, I volunteer as a youth worker.</div><div id="00:07:39.360" class="transcript_line"> Over four years I apply for refugee status five times.</div><div id="00:07:44.560" class="transcript_line"> And finally got it in 2023.</div><div id="00:07:47.320" class="transcript_line"> So now here in Wrexon, since I got my status, I can work as a pay youth worker.</div><div id="00:07:55.680" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s it like coming from somewhere else to live in Wales?</div><div id="00:08:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, again, I think living in Wales is way different from Portugal.</div><div id="00:08:05.080" class="transcript_line"> Here in Wales it has more bad weather.</div><div id="00:08:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Like Portugal has really good heart weather and our traditions and culture are way different.</div><div id="00:08:13.800" class="transcript_line"> And everyone is always nice and safe streets and people.</div><div id="00:08:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Wales has a very different culture to Nigeria too.</div><div id="00:08:21.280" class="transcript_line"> For example, we wear normal clothes at home like other people in Wales.</div><div id="00:08:26.040" class="transcript_line"> But in my culture, the traditional dress for women is a long skirt with a cold fushre</div><div id="00:08:32.400" class="transcript_line"> or a long dress wrapped around the body and tied up the waist.</div><div id="00:08:36.840" class="transcript_line"> In bright colour for fabric with a bumpy texture to it and hair ties that are like big pieces</div><div id="00:08:42.880" class="transcript_line"> of cloth wrapped around the head.</div><div id="00:08:45.320" class="transcript_line"> They are hard to tie and wear properly.</div><div id="00:08:48.680" class="transcript_line"> Only women wear these.</div><div id="00:08:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Girls wear headband.</div><div id="00:08:52.360" class="transcript_line"> We still wear our traditional clothes for church or special occasions.</div><div id="00:08:56.840" class="transcript_line"> Then there&#039;s food.</div><div id="00:08:58.880" class="transcript_line"> People in Wales eat pasta and fish and chips, but we eat different kinds of food, like</div><div id="00:09:04.880" class="transcript_line"> fufu, gari, pounded yam and some soups like egusi, okra and vegetable soup.</div><div id="00:09:13.360" class="transcript_line"> Longer dress in Wales people speak Welsh or English, but sometimes both.</div><div id="00:09:19.640" class="transcript_line"> But I have three languages.</div><div id="00:09:22.320" class="transcript_line"> Ibo from my dad, Tiv from my mum and now English.</div><div id="00:09:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Diego told us he had no English when he came to Wales, but now at 18 he&#039;s fluent.</div><div id="00:09:35.760" class="transcript_line"> I think living in Wales is good.</div><div id="00:09:38.440" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s quiet and peaceful.</div><div id="00:09:40.760" class="transcript_line"> In Leeds it was a lot nausea because the roads were usually busy and cars were always</div><div id="00:09:46.040" class="transcript_line"> passing by.</div><div id="00:09:47.440" class="transcript_line"> In Leeds it was harder to sleep because it was always so noisy.</div><div id="00:09:52.440" class="transcript_line"> In Wrexham it&#039;s a lot easier to fall asleep.</div><div id="00:10:06.280" class="transcript_line"> Excuse me, wake up.</div><div id="00:10:09.480" class="transcript_line"> So what do you think of when you think about Welsh history and Welsh culture?</div><div id="00:10:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Tony again, what is Welsh culture for me?</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it is a mix of culture, it is an interesting country and very friendly.</div><div id="00:10:26.440" class="transcript_line"> In my opinion, Mahanset has the richest culture.</div><div id="00:10:31.440" class="transcript_line"> People there live a simple life.</div><div id="00:10:33.760" class="transcript_line"> It seems to have more of Welsh language and the culture they are engaged better with</div><div id="00:10:39.800" class="transcript_line"> teenager.</div><div id="00:10:41.680" class="transcript_line"> They have a distinct call No Sons Saur or Laurin.</div><div id="00:10:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Like open mics, night where people can bring along violins and other instruments and play</div><div id="00:10:55.600" class="transcript_line"> music and sing.</div><div id="00:10:57.480" class="transcript_line"> When I think of Welsh culture I think of castles.</div><div id="00:11:01.320" class="transcript_line"> Umm, that was a beautiful countryside.</div><div id="00:11:05.200" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh flag.</div><div id="00:11:06.560" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh language.</div><div id="00:11:08.600" class="transcript_line"> Music maybe.</div><div id="00:11:09.880" class="transcript_line"> Singing.</div><div id="00:11:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Rugby?</div><div id="00:11:12.400" class="transcript_line"> We have written some poems and words about different aspects of Welsh life and culture.</div><div id="00:11:17.840" class="transcript_line"> Arna, another member of East, has written a poem about Welsh rivers.</div><div id="00:11:22.600" class="transcript_line"> River poem.</div><div id="00:11:24.240" class="transcript_line"> I like the river how it flows peacefully, moving past slowly gently.</div><div id="00:11:29.920" class="transcript_line"> I like how the wind ripples the surface, catches the light and glides and chimmas.</div><div id="00:11:37.600" class="transcript_line"> I like how the rocks split the river and the waters swirls wobbly round then.</div><div id="00:11:43.320" class="transcript_line"> I like how it&#039;s always moving, always changing, always singing its song.</div><div id="00:11:49.560" class="transcript_line"> This is Gossha again.</div><div id="00:11:50.800" class="transcript_line"> I have written about the Welsh castles.</div><div id="00:11:54.080" class="transcript_line"> On the hill of ways where the sea seems to the slip forever, stand majestic castles.</div><div id="00:12:00.920" class="transcript_line"> They are like fennful sensitors.</div><div id="00:12:05.120" class="transcript_line"> They are yielding to the passage of the time and the rustling of the wind, that carriers</div><div id="00:12:10.400" class="transcript_line"> memories of bygondays.</div><div id="00:12:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Free of them, Conwy, Carnarfon and Harlech, high history on their walls, like treads,</div><div id="00:12:21.400" class="transcript_line"> worn with the blood of heroes.</div><div id="00:12:24.040" class="transcript_line"> Conwy proudly raced above the river, attracts the eye with its silver walls, ship grace</div><div id="00:12:30.120" class="transcript_line"> on the green pastures that stretch as its fit.</div><div id="00:12:34.360" class="transcript_line"> The white silhouettes create a contrast with the lush green of the meadows, bathed with</div><div id="00:12:40.800" class="transcript_line"> the glow of the morning sun.</div><div id="00:12:43.240" class="transcript_line"> Carnarfon builds on the menace straight, looks all out over the surrounding landscape</div><div id="00:12:49.760" class="transcript_line"> from Estonia Hill.</div><div id="00:12:52.160" class="transcript_line"> The sroyal castle has witness many wars and rules who raised the sword in the defence</div><div id="00:12:59.520" class="transcript_line"> of freedom and the land of ways.</div><div id="00:13:02.760" class="transcript_line"> These mighty walls still bear the marks of the past battles and in their shadow history</div><div id="00:13:10.680" class="transcript_line"> comes alive in the minds of those who respectfully enter its gates.</div><div id="00:13:18.560" class="transcript_line"> Harlech, standing proudly on a cliff, watches over the stormy sea that crashed against</div><div id="00:13:26.160" class="transcript_line"> the rock at its feet.</div><div id="00:13:28.560" class="transcript_line"> It was here in the shadow of history that Honour was faultful, never giving up, even</div><div id="00:13:36.160" class="transcript_line"> in the face of the greatest challenges.</div><div id="00:13:39.240" class="transcript_line"> In the place where history interwines with nature, the wind carries the old songs of ways.</div><div id="00:13:47.880" class="transcript_line"> Stone and green create a harmonious hole and the castles of Conwy, Carnarfon and Harlech</div><div id="00:13:55.440" class="transcript_line"> stand unchanging, guarding the dreams of independence, hope and glory of the nation.</div><div id="00:14:03.440" class="transcript_line"> Hadja has written about castles too.</div><div id="00:14:06.600" class="transcript_line"> She wrote this, I want to see the people in the castles, I want to see the dresses and</div><div id="00:14:12.760" class="transcript_line"> the rooms and the books, I want to see the castles as they used to be before they got broken</div><div id="00:14:18.920" class="transcript_line"> by history.</div><div id="00:14:20.760" class="transcript_line"> I want to see the king and the queen on their thrones.</div><div id="00:14:24.720" class="transcript_line"> I want to see a suit of arbor tonight on a ghost&#039;s bones.</div><div id="00:14:29.120" class="transcript_line"> I wish I could be the queen.</div><div id="00:14:31.800" class="transcript_line"> I wish I could see all the things that have been.</div><div id="00:14:35.920" class="transcript_line"> Mercy Grace, in that exercise where we had to pick words out of a bowl, I picked the</div><div id="00:14:42.040" class="transcript_line"> word questions.</div><div id="00:14:43.920" class="transcript_line"> Some people I know say that asking questions like Hadja doesn&#039;t have poem is not important,</div><div id="00:14:50.600" class="transcript_line"> but I think it&#039;s very important.</div><div id="00:14:53.680" class="transcript_line"> Because if you ask lots of questions and you&#039;re always curious in class, you&#039;ll be very small</div><div id="00:14:58.920" class="transcript_line"> or brilliant.</div><div id="00:15:00.400" class="transcript_line"> Asking questions is a very good way to learn.</div><div id="00:15:03.320" class="transcript_line"> You can learn ahead and learn about the past and you&#039;ll get answers and be more knowledgeable</div><div id="00:15:08.920" class="transcript_line"> about a lot of things.</div><div id="00:15:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Diego told us he likes the culture of Wales, the history, the castles.</div><div id="00:15:15.760" class="transcript_line"> But he says things are much better in Salvador now than they were.</div><div id="00:15:20.480" class="transcript_line"> He says now if someone kills someone else, they get picked up and arrested in about five</div><div id="00:15:26.040" class="transcript_line"> minutes so he would like to go back there one day.</div><div id="00:15:30.240" class="transcript_line"> In October 2024, Arlette and Cadu, the organisation that looks after the Welsh castles, took a group</div><div id="00:15:37.760" class="transcript_line"> of us from East on a visit to Crickf Castle.</div><div id="00:15:40.880" class="transcript_line"> Tunaza here.</div><div id="00:15:42.600" class="transcript_line"> Afterwards, I wrote this.</div><div id="00:15:45.240" class="transcript_line"> Crickf Castle was made by two princes and destroyed by another prince.</div><div id="00:15:50.680" class="transcript_line"> It was a fun experience going there.</div><div id="00:15:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I am so happy that I got to see such a super-calor, fragilistic, expialledosius castle.</div><div id="00:15:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Victoria, another member of East, who also went on the trip, wrote a poem about the castle</div><div id="00:16:05.360" class="transcript_line"> called Castle in the Sky.</div><div id="00:16:07.960" class="transcript_line"> The magnificent castle, seen by all, a vision once imagined.</div><div id="00:16:13.400" class="transcript_line"> A shadow over those below, once history now a legend.</div><div id="00:16:19.120" class="transcript_line"> Fits for princes of all of Wales, mighty fortress soaring high, and our land and our nation,</div><div id="00:16:26.920" class="transcript_line"> a show of power in the sky.</div><div id="00:16:29.920" class="transcript_line"> Mercy Grace, I also wrote a poem about the castle, but from a very different point of</div><div id="00:16:35.960" class="transcript_line"> view.</div><div id="00:16:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I am a stone.</div><div id="00:16:38.240" class="transcript_line"> I have lived here on the beach for hundreds of years.</div><div id="00:16:41.800" class="transcript_line"> I am half white and half brown, and the bottom edge of me is also white.</div><div id="00:16:46.960" class="transcript_line"> I feel rough and smooth at the same time.</div><div id="00:16:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Back in the day, there was a castle at Crickf Castle, and I have seen everything that went</div><div id="00:16:55.320" class="transcript_line"> on in that castle.</div><div id="00:16:56.800" class="transcript_line"> I have looked up to it my whole life.</div><div id="00:16:59.080" class="transcript_line"> I can tell you all about it.</div><div id="00:17:01.800" class="transcript_line"> It was started by a Welsh prince and finished by another Welsh prince, but then an English</div><div id="00:17:07.440" class="transcript_line"> king came and took the castle away from the Welsh people.</div><div id="00:17:12.040" class="transcript_line"> So another Welsh prince came to take it back from the English king and burnt it down.</div><div id="00:17:18.240" class="transcript_line"> This is the story of the castle of Crickets, written by the glorious stone that has looked</div><div id="00:17:23.720" class="transcript_line"> up to it&#039;s whole life.</div><div id="00:17:25.840" class="transcript_line"> As well as her castle poem, Hadja has written a poem about the Welsh flag, like the ones</div><div id="00:17:31.460" class="transcript_line"> fluttering above Cricket&#039;s castle.</div><div id="00:17:34.000" class="transcript_line"> The Welsh flag is a red dragon.</div><div id="00:17:36.480" class="transcript_line"> It has three colours, red, white and green.</div><div id="00:17:40.920" class="transcript_line"> The dragon&#039;s feet are standing in the green.</div><div id="00:17:43.760" class="transcript_line"> The green of grass, the green of leaves, the green of apples.</div><div id="00:17:49.200" class="transcript_line"> The red is the colour of blood.</div><div id="00:17:51.800" class="transcript_line"> Of the jewels in the king and queen&#039;s crown.</div><div id="00:17:55.840" class="transcript_line"> The colour of fire.</div><div id="00:17:58.400" class="transcript_line"> White is the colour of a wall.</div><div id="00:18:00.880" class="transcript_line"> The colour of milk.</div><div id="00:18:02.760" class="transcript_line"> The white, like the whites of my eyes.</div><div id="00:18:05.440" class="transcript_line"> The flags fly above the castle.</div><div id="00:18:08.080" class="transcript_line"> They look beautiful.</div><div id="00:18:10.080" class="transcript_line"> Avi here.</div><div id="00:18:11.080" class="transcript_line"> I liked the trip to Cricket&#039;s castle because I liked the beach and we were next to the</div><div id="00:18:16.640" class="transcript_line"> beach and we had lunch.</div><div id="00:18:19.960" class="transcript_line"> The food was given by the castle, yum yum yum.</div><div id="00:18:23.200" class="transcript_line"> And then we went up to the castle and the food was so tasty.</div><div id="00:18:28.680" class="transcript_line"> I loved the view.</div><div id="00:18:30.960" class="transcript_line"> And we could put 20p into the telescope to look at the sea.</div><div id="00:18:36.480" class="transcript_line"> Thanks for the trip.</div><div id="00:18:37.800" class="transcript_line"> I met some new people.</div><div id="00:18:39.880" class="transcript_line"> Thank you Aile.</div><div id="00:18:40.880" class="transcript_line"> I appreciate you.</div><div id="00:18:42.400" class="transcript_line"> The castle was beautiful.</div><div id="00:18:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And now here is the writing by...</div><div id="00:18:47.720" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no, I am a...</div><div id="00:18:49.240" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:18:50.240" class="transcript_line"> Me in Shira, age 8.</div><div id="00:18:52.240" class="transcript_line"> And these next bits are really nothing to do with culture or history at all.</div><div id="00:18:56.800" class="transcript_line"> But just go to show how imaginative our young people at East are.</div><div id="00:19:01.200" class="transcript_line"> I was told I wasn&#039;t very good at writing at school.</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And I don&#039;t usually like it.</div><div id="00:19:06.160" class="transcript_line"> But in the workshop when we were giving a bowl of words to choose from, I chose the</div><div id="00:19:13.040" class="transcript_line"> way to enter.</div><div id="00:19:14.040" class="transcript_line"> And here&#039;s a funny story I wrote all from my imagination.</div><div id="00:19:17.880" class="transcript_line"> Here it is.</div><div id="00:19:18.880" class="transcript_line"> Once upon a time there was a pig that lived in the centre of McDonald&#039;s in Raxon.</div><div id="00:19:25.640" class="transcript_line"> And the burgers were all gone.</div><div id="00:19:27.760" class="transcript_line"> They turned the pig into burgers.</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And teed just for the...</div><div id="00:19:32.480" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s going to eat a burger?</div><div id="00:19:34.360" class="transcript_line"> The end.</div><div id="00:19:35.560" class="transcript_line"> I chose the word memories and wrote a funny poem.</div><div id="00:19:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Here it is.</div><div id="00:19:40.080" class="transcript_line"> My best memory was when I said about my cheese sandwich.</div><div id="00:19:43.920" class="transcript_line"> More cheese, more cheese.</div><div id="00:19:45.640" class="transcript_line"> And I said it was such a dear please.</div><div id="00:19:47.720" class="transcript_line"> But I really wanted a tuna sandwich with two command carrot sticks.</div><div id="00:19:52.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d already asked my mum if I could have a normal toast with jam or porridge with a</div><div id="00:19:57.520" class="transcript_line"> bomb.</div><div id="00:19:58.520" class="transcript_line"> But I didn&#039;t see what food was already inside of me.</div><div id="00:20:01.960" class="transcript_line"> I am not Luna so I sneakily said tuna.</div><div id="00:20:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Write quite a lot about food don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:20:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Food is comfort.</div><div id="00:20:11.840" class="transcript_line"> Last word about living in Wales.</div><div id="00:20:15.400" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve developed since coming here.</div><div id="00:20:17.920" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know that when I first crossed over here that I would lose my identity.</div><div id="00:20:24.360" class="transcript_line"> In Icaragua I was a journalist, a song to my mum, a brother to my two brothers.</div><div id="00:20:31.640" class="transcript_line"> I had a girlfriend.</div><div id="00:20:33.640" class="transcript_line"> But coming to Wales I lost everyone.</div><div id="00:20:37.960" class="transcript_line"> I lost my identity.</div><div id="00:20:40.040" class="transcript_line"> My mental health became really bad but my friends I made in Wales helped me.</div><div id="00:20:46.600" class="transcript_line"> My friends from Wales National Opera helped me with mental health, with my application</div><div id="00:20:52.800" class="transcript_line"> for status, with everything.</div><div id="00:20:56.160" class="transcript_line"> I am here now because of these friends and I still have them.</div><div id="00:21:01.880" class="transcript_line"> For me Wales is the best place a refugee can be.</div><div id="00:21:05.880" class="transcript_line"> And East is part of that.</div><div id="00:21:08.560" class="transcript_line"> Supporting people in their lives here.</div><div id="00:21:10.680" class="transcript_line"> Helping to bring about the future of all our different experiences and cultures.</div><div id="00:21:16.600" class="transcript_line"> The place I left behind.</div><div id="00:21:21.600" class="transcript_line"> Living for the memories in my mind.</div><div id="00:21:26.600" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes it&#039;s hard to live and change.</div><div id="00:21:32.600" class="transcript_line"> But things are meant to be the same.</div></div></p>
