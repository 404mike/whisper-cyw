class="transcript_line"> We went through the estate and we picked everybody up,</div><div id="00:07:36.760" class="transcript_line"> so it was the same group of people going and coming back every day.</div><div id="00:07:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Were they factory buses?</div><div id="00:07:42.760" class="transcript_line"> No, they were public transport buses.</div><div id="00:07:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a test or an interview for the job?</div><div id="00:07:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, I was interviewed.</div><div id="00:07:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Gosh, I can&#039;t remember what they asked me.</div><div id="00:08:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose they must have asked me why I didn&#039;t continue working as a short-term typist,</div><div id="00:08:07.760" class="transcript_line"> as I got the qualification for doing that,</div><div id="00:08:09.760" class="transcript_line"> and why I wanted to work in the factory.</div><div id="00:08:11.760" class="transcript_line"> But I don&#039;t remember what I answered.</div><div id="00:08:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I probably told them I was bored stiff</div><div id="00:08:15.760" class="transcript_line"> and wanted something a bit more challenging and interesting to do.</div><div id="00:08:18.760" class="transcript_line"> But I had reasonably good qualifications from school and from college,</div><div id="00:08:23.760" class="transcript_line"> so they seemed quite keen to have me there.</div><div id="00:08:26.760" class="transcript_line"> I did work on the telephone switchboard there for a while as well,</div><div id="00:08:30.760" class="transcript_line"> answering incoming calls and connecting people.</div><div id="00:08:33.760" class="transcript_line"> I did train to work on the old-fashioned switchboards with the leads going in.</div><div id="00:08:40.760" class="transcript_line"> They were fantastic things.</div><div id="00:08:42.760" class="transcript_line"> So did your job change while you were at his then?</div><div id="00:08:49.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I did that while the telephonist was away,</div><div id="00:08:52.760" class="transcript_line"> or if she was off on holiday or ill or she did have maternity leave,</div><div id="00:08:56.760" class="transcript_line"> things like that I&#039;d fill in.</div><div id="00:08:58.760" class="transcript_line"> But no, I went back onto the factory floor</div><div id="00:09:00.760" class="transcript_line"> and I just eventually began working on the machines,</div><div id="00:09:03.760" class="transcript_line"> which were quite dangerous actually.</div><div id="00:09:05.760" class="transcript_line"> Although they did have safety guards on them,</div><div id="00:09:08.760" class="transcript_line"> they were still quite dangerous things.</div><div id="00:09:10.760" class="transcript_line"> So I did eventually start working on the machinery</div><div id="00:09:14.760" class="transcript_line"> and then later on still training other people how to operate the machinery.</div><div id="00:09:19.760" class="transcript_line"> So just explain to me then what the machines did.</div><div id="00:09:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, what they actually did was they trimmed the brushes</div><div id="00:09:29.760" class="transcript_line"> because they all had to be a standard size.</div><div id="00:09:32.760" class="transcript_line"> And they also attached the bristles to the plastic handles.</div><div id="00:09:38.760" class="transcript_line"> You lined them all up on the machine</div><div id="00:09:41.760" class="transcript_line"> and then the bristles would be attached to the plastic handles.</div><div id="00:09:44.760" class="transcript_line"> And you also individually by hand sometimes</div><div id="00:09:47.760" class="transcript_line"> had to make sure that the bristles were of a standard size</div><div id="00:09:51.760" class="transcript_line"> so you actually had to run a brush through a machine which kept the bristles.</div><div id="00:09:55.760" class="transcript_line"> And as I recall, you did that by hand.</div><div id="00:09:58.760" class="transcript_line"> So that could have been extremely dangerous to do.</div><div id="00:10:01.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember us having any special gloves or even glasses,</div><div id="00:10:06.760" class="transcript_line"> though we must have had safety glasses.</div><div id="00:10:09.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember wearing them</div><div id="00:10:11.760" class="transcript_line"> because the very sharp little nylon bristles flew in all directions.</div><div id="00:10:17.760" class="transcript_line"> I must have had safety glasses, though I don&#039;t remember wearing them.</div><div id="00:10:21.760" class="transcript_line"> But some of the machines were quite large.</div><div id="00:10:25.760" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask you about health and safety then.</div><div id="00:10:28.760" class="transcript_line"> What was health and safety like at the factory?</div><div id="00:10:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, they did all have safety guards on.</div><div id="00:10:34.760" class="transcript_line"> We were given good training, I have to be honest, on how to operate.</div><div id="00:10:38.760" class="transcript_line"> We were constantly being told to be careful</div><div id="00:10:41.760" class="transcript_line"> and that these machines were dangerous.</div><div id="00:10:44.760" class="transcript_line"> So considering it was all that time ago, I suppose it wasn&#039;t too bad, to be

Sweeping...</div><div id="00:17:00.760" class="transcript_line"> Sink tidies, everything like that really.</div><div id="00:17:06.760" class="transcript_line"> So, did you enjoy working at the factory?</div><div id="00:17:14.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a difficult question to answer that really.</div><div id="00:17:18.760" class="transcript_line"> Some aspect of it I enjoyed.</div><div id="00:17:20.760" class="transcript_line"> But as time went on, I became quite frustrated</div><div id="00:17:24.760" class="transcript_line"> and felt that there was something more I could be doing.</div><div id="00:17:30.760" class="transcript_line"> If you know what I mean.</div><div id="00:17:32.760" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t being stretched.</div><div id="00:17:36.760" class="transcript_line"> What about the workforce? Was it mainly women?</div><div id="00:17:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:17:40.760" class="transcript_line"> How many people were there?</div><div id="00:17:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Must have been hundreds.</div><div id="00:17:45.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t remember there being any male employees.</div><div id="00:17:48.760" class="transcript_line"> Apart from, strangely enough, the bosses who were all male.</div><div id="00:17:54.760" class="transcript_line"> The supervisors were female and all the workers were female.</div><div id="00:17:58.760" class="transcript_line"> It was a huge building, so I have no idea how many actually...</div><div id="00:18:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, for goodness sake!</div><div id="00:18:06.760" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit worried about the work.</div><div id="00:18:09.760" class="transcript_line"> I was worried about the work.</div><div id="00:18:11.760" class="transcript_line"> For goodness sake!</div><div id="00:18:16.760" class="transcript_line"> So, mainly women then?</div><div id="00:18:18.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, mainly all women except for the bosses.</div><div id="00:18:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Except for the bosses.</div><div id="00:18:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there what you considered unskilled and skilled jobs?</div><div id="00:18:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, now I think about it.</div><div id="00:18:29.760" class="transcript_line"> There was a workshop where they repaired...</div><div id="00:18:33.760" class="transcript_line"> They did all the repairs and that was all male.</div><div id="00:18:36.760" class="transcript_line"> But you know, in all the years I was there,</div><div id="00:18:38.760" class="transcript_line"> I never walked into it, I never went there.</div><div id="00:18:40.760" class="transcript_line"> But I did speak to some of the men who worked there.</div><div id="00:18:43.760" class="transcript_line"> That would be considered skilled work.</div><div id="00:18:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Because they were the men that fixed the machines when they broke down.</div><div id="00:18:48.760" class="transcript_line"> And anything that was broken, they would fix it.</div><div id="00:18:51.760" class="transcript_line"> So that was considered skilled.</div><div id="00:18:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Working on the machines was skilled.</div><div id="00:18:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Because, you know, obviously it took a lot more skill to operate a machine</div><div id="00:19:00.760" class="transcript_line"> than it did to pack an item.</div><div id="00:19:04.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, so that would be considered more skilled.</div><div id="00:19:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Were you paid more to work on the machine than you?</div><div id="00:19:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:19:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, your rate increased just the longer you were there anyway.</div><div id="00:19:14.760" class="transcript_line"> You got increments, you know.</div><div id="00:19:16.760" class="transcript_line"> They paid you for loyalty basically, the longer you stayed.</div><div id="00:19:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Your pay went up incrementally anyway if you stayed.</div><div id="00:19:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Because so many people left, obviously, when they had children and stuff.</div><div id="00:19:30.760" class="transcript_line"> And then came back when their children were grown up quite often.</div><div id="00:19:33.760" class="transcript_line"> So there was a big gap.</div><div id="00:19:35.760" class="transcript_line"> No, the pay increased.</div><div id="00:19:37.760" class="transcript_line"> It increased with time spent.</div><div id="00:19:41.760" class="transcript_line"> And obviously there were things like if you were promoted to a supervisory position,</div><div id="00:19:46.760" class="transcript_line"> your rates obviously went up.</div><div id="00:19:52.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d like to ask you actually, because you did all these other things first.</div><div id="00:19:59.760" class="transcript_line"> How old were you when you went to work there?</div><div id="00:20:02.760" class="transcript_line"> And what year was it?</div><div id="00:20:06.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it was 1963.</div><div id="00:20:11.760" class="transcript_line"> So you were 19?</div><div id="00:20:13.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I was born in 1946.</div><div id="00:20:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, sorry, 17.</div><div id="00:20:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:20:17.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it was either 16 or 17.</div><div id="00:20:20.760" class="transcript_line"> I think it was, I left school at 16.</div><div id="00:20:24.760" class="transcript_line"> And none of my jobs lasted more than a few weeks before I went to Addis.</div><div id="00:20:30.760" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t yet 17 before I went there, don&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:20:34.760" class="transcript_line"> Great, OK.</div><div id="00:20:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Sorry.</div><div id="00:20:40.760" class="transcript_line"> So were there married women working in the factory?</div><div id="00:20:44.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, lots of them.</div><div id="00:20:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and there was no problem with that?</div><div id="00:20:47.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:20:49.760" class="transcript_line"> And what about when you said when they had children they came back?</div><div id="00:20:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there any child caring facilities in the factory?</div><div id="00:20:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh no.</div><div id="00:20:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh good Lord, not in 1963.</div><div id="00:20:59.760" class="transcript_line"> It didn&#039;t even enter their thinking.</div><div id="00:21:01.760" class="transcript_line"> No way.</div><div id="00:21:02.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:21:03.760" class="transcript_line"> There were women with young children who were working there.</div><div id="00:21:07.760" class="transcript_line"> How they coped, I don&#039;t know, because they didn&#039;t even leave at three to pick up their children from school.</div><div id="00:21:12.760" class="transcript_line"> So it must have been their mothers who did that, or members of the family.</div><div id="00:21:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Because they had to finish at four, four thirty, and that was long after the kids had come home from school.</div><div id="00:21:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:21:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, that wouldn&#039;t have even occurred to them in those days.</div><div id="00:21:28.760" class="transcript_line"> You weren&#039;t encouraged to have time off, even if your child was ill, you know, that was tough really.</div><div id="00:21:33.760" class="transcript_line"> You had to come in to work, whatever.</div><div id="00:21:36.760" class="transcript_line"> They kept a very, very keen eye on the number of days you took off sick.</div><div id="00:21:41.760" class="transcript_line"> A lot of us used to have very painful periods.</div><div id="00:21:46.760" class="transcript_line"> I was one of those, I was usually in agony.</div><div id="00:21:49.760" class="transcript_line"> And standing when you had an extremely painful period was not funny.</div><div id="00:21:55.760" class="transcript_line"> And I quite often used to end up in the sick room.</div><div id="00:21:57.760" class="transcript_line"> We had a sick room.</div><div id="00:21:59.760" class="transcript_line"> And a nurse who worked there and who would give you pills if the pain got too bad.</div><div id="00:22:04.760" class="transcript_line"> Or you were even allowed to lie down for a bit if the pain got too bad.</div><div id="00:22:09.760" class="transcript_line"> And then when the pain wore off, you had to go back on your machine.</div><div id="00:22:11.760" class="transcript_line"> There was no question of you going home.</div><div id="00:22:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Because obviously their argument was that they would be sending you all home.</div><div id="00:22:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Because in all our periods, possibly at the same time, you&#039;d all be going off.</div><div id="00:22:21.760" class="transcript_line"> And the factory would come to a complete stop.</div><div id="00:22:23.760" class="transcript_line"> So tough you had to get on with it really.</div><div id="00:22:26.760" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, they were very tight on sick time.</div><div id="00:22:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Any kind of sick time.</div><div id="00:22:31.760" class="transcript_line"> The person with the least sick time was always praised very highly.</div><div id="00:22:37.760" class="transcript_line"> And that was easy for me because I had no family.</div><div id="00:22:40.760" class="transcript_line"> I had nothing to worry about except myself.</div><div id="00:22:42.760" class="transcript_line"> So I never took sick time.</div><div id="00:22:44.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a different issue if you&#039;ve got children.</div><div id="00:22:46.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not that you&#039;re idle.</div><div id="00:22:48.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s that you&#039;ve got other priorities and commitments you have to see to.</div><div id="00:22:51.760" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, I was always, well done Yvonne, you haven&#039;t taken any sick time this year.</div><div id="00:22:56.760" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, well, fine.</div><div id="00:22:59.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve only got myself to bother about really.</div><div id="00:23:02.760" class="transcript_line"> If you did take sick time, was there sick pain?</div><div id="00:23:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:23:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember how much that was?</div><div id="00:23:11.760" class="transcript_line"> No, it was too long ago.</div><div id="00:23:13.760" class="transcript_line"> It was too long ago now.</div><div id="00:23:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Can we go on to wages anyway?</div><div id="00:23:18.760" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember how much you were paid a week at the beginning?</div><div id="00:23:24.760" class="transcript_line"> I know when I was working that year before I started in Addis as a shorthand typist, I think it was,</div><div id="00:23:31.760" class="transcript_line"> I was earning about £3.15 a week in those days.</div><div id="00:23:35.760" class="transcript_line"> It must have been in that area.</div><div id="00:23:38.760" class="transcript_line"> It certainly wasn&#039;t less because I was happy with the money that I got.</div><div id="00:23:42.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, being a single person, I mean, it was a reasonable amount of money.</div><div id="00:23:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Are you still living at home then?</div><div id="00:23:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:23:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you give your mum?</div><div id="00:23:52.760" class="transcript_line"> I gave my mum some money, yeah.</div><div id="00:23:54.760" class="transcript_line"> She didn&#039;t ask for a lot to be fair.</div><div id="00:23:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, no, I didn&#039;t leave home until I was in my twenties.</div><div id="00:24:02.760" class="transcript_line"> So what did you do with the rest of the money? Do you remember?</div><div id="00:24:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Just enjoyed it really. Spent it.</div><div id="00:24:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Went shop.</div><div id="00:24:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember?</div><div id="00:24:12.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I like going to the cinema, so I used to go a lot.</div><div id="00:24:16.760" class="transcript_line"> And the usual stuff, I suppose, buy clothes, records, particularly because I loved music.</div><div id="00:24:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Bought loads of records, went into town with my friends and just enjoyed spending it really.</div><div id="00:24:30.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, you say they played music in the factory.</div><div id="00:24:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember whether it was on the radio or did people just take records?</div><div id="00:24:37.760" class="transcript_line"> It was on the radio. The radio was always on. Nonstop really.</div><div id="00:24:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember which station that was?</div><div id="00:24:43.760" class="transcript_line"> No, probably Radio 2.</div><div id="00:24:48.760" class="transcript_line"> The light service.</div><div id="00:24:49.760" class="transcript_line"> The light service. The light programme as it was called then.</div><div id="00:24:52.760" class="transcript_line"> The light programme, yeah.</div><div id="00:24:53.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, popular music.</div><div id="00:24:54.760" class="transcript_line"> Pre-radio.</div><div id="00:24:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Pre-radio too. Yes, yeah, popular music. Music non-stop really.</div><div id="00:25:02.760" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t remember any pay rises or anything like that?</div><div id="00:25:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember how much it was when you left, for example?</div><div id="00:25:12.760" class="transcript_line"> No, but it was higher than when I started.</div><div id="00:25:16.760" class="transcript_line"> I know it went up.</div><div id="00:25:18.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s all I was concerned about. It went up rather than down.</div><div id="00:25:23.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I can&#039;t remember now. That&#039;s too long ago really.</div><div id="00:25:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you have to wear any kind of uniform?</div><div id="00:25:31.760" class="transcript_line"> No, we all wore overalls. Not overalls. Yes, overalls.</div><div id="00:25:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Not overalls. What do they call them?</div><div id="00:25:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I suppose it was a kind of overall.</div><div id="00:25:46.760" class="transcript_line"> No, we always brought our own in.</div><div id="00:25:48.760" class="transcript_line"> We bought them ourselves.</div><div id="00:25:50.760" class="transcript_line"> What we chose, what we wanted to do was to have a uniform.</div><div id="00:25:54.760" class="transcript_line"> We bought them ourselves.</div><div id="00:25:56.760" class="transcript_line"> What we wore, we bought ourselves. It wasn&#039;t provided for us.</div><div id="00:26:00.760" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay. So you could buy any kind of...?</div><div id="00:26:05.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, we bought our own stuff in order to obviously take care of our own clothing,</div><div id="00:26:11.760" class="transcript_line"> so that wasn&#039;t damaged in any way or made dirty or whatever.</div><div id="00:26:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Was that an issue that they didn&#039;t pay for your protective clothing?</div><div id="00:26:20.760" class="transcript_line"> I think people did complain about it, yes.</div><div id="00:26:24.760" class="transcript_line"> I think some people felt that they should be provided.</div><div id="00:26:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember any injuries that people had during...?</div><div id="00:26:37.760" class="transcript_line"> You said that some of the machines were quite dangerous.</div><div id="00:26:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I do remember them being minor though.</div><div id="00:26:45.760" class="transcript_line"> They weren&#039;t anything major, like nobody lost a limb or anything,</div><div id="00:26:49.760" class="transcript_line"> or a finger or a hand or anything like that.</div><div id="00:26:53.760" class="transcript_line"> There were some minor cuts and minor injuries, but nothing major.</div><div id="00:27:09.760" class="transcript_line"> You said it was quite noisy. Did you have any hearing...?</div><div id="00:27:13.760" class="transcript_line"> I remember some people having it.</div><div id="00:27:17.760" class="transcript_line"> If the machines were particularly noisy, but the rest of us no.</div><div id="00:27:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Even though we were in the same area as the machines,</div><div id="00:27:26.760" class="transcript_line"> when you were packing, the machines were kind of all around you</div><div id="00:27:30.760" class="transcript_line"> and the noise level was just as high really, but we didn&#039;t have any.</div><div id="00:27:35.760" class="transcript_line"> But then you see, we weren&#039;t keen on wearing them anyway</div><div id="00:27:39.760" class="transcript_line"> because we were talking to each other all the time.</div><div id="00:27:42.760" class="transcript_line"> We kept you sane talking to other people and having a laugh,</div><div id="00:27:46.760" class="transcript_line"> and you couldn&#039;t have heard them, so we wouldn&#039;t have worn them.</div><div id="00:27:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, we would have worn them reluctantly.</div><div id="00:27:54.760" class="transcript_line"> Like we knew many other women in the past, lip read as a way of communicating with each other,</div><div id="00:28:02.760" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s probably what we would have done.</div><div id="00:28:05.760" class="transcript_line"> We would have learned to lip read.</div><div id="00:28:08.760" class="transcript_line"> The noisiest machines you were told to wear your earmuffs to protect yourself.</div><div id="00:28:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that you suffered any long-term health issues from your work there?</div><div id="00:28:25.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:28:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Were you allowed to smoke?</div><div id="00:28:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that was a massive issue.</div><div id="00:28:34.760" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t allowed to smoke on the factory floor,</div><div id="00:28:38.760" class="transcript_line"> and everybody wanted to smoke during their break,</div><div id="00:28:40.760" class="transcript_line"> and because we were on the factory floor it wasn&#039;t allowed, and it was a massive issue.</div><div id="00:28:45.760" class="transcript_line"> We all felt that we should be able to go to a room, not me, I&#039;ve never smoked in my entire life,</div><div id="00:28:50.760" class="transcript_line"> but all my colleagues felt that they should be allowed to go to a specific room</div><div id="00:28:54.760" class="transcript_line"> that was set aside downstairs for people who smoked,</div><div id="00:28:59.760" class="transcript_line"> or even a specific room where we could take our sandwiches or a snack,</div><div id="00:29:03.760" class="transcript_line"> or to take our coffee breaks rather than sit on the factory floor,</div><div id="00:29:07.760" class="transcript_line"> so everybody would go to the toilets as often as they could get away with,</div><div id="00:29:11.760" class="transcript_line"> and have a quick fag in there.</div><div id="00:29:14.760" class="transcript_line"> But quite often the supervisors would follow you in and double-check you weren&#039;t smoking,</div><div id="00:29:19.760" class="transcript_line"> and you had to go into the actual loo itself and lock the door,</div><div id="00:29:24.760" class="transcript_line"> but they could always smell it and see the smoke rising and whatever,</div><div id="00:29:28.760" class="transcript_line"> and they used to tell you to put it out,</div><div id="00:29:30.760" class="transcript_line"> it was a bit like a regime where people watched you and followed you in there.</div><div id="00:29:35.760" class="transcript_line"> What about going to the toilet, did you have to have permission?</div><div id="00:29:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, particularly if you were on, well no, in either event,</div><div id="00:29:42.760" class="transcript_line"> whether you were on a machine or on a line packing,</div><div id="00:29:45.760" class="transcript_line"> you always had to say, I&#039;m clocking off, going to the loo,</div><div id="00:29:49.760" class="transcript_line"> and then I&#039;m back kind of thing now,</div><div id="00:29:52.760" class="transcript_line"> because of course you had to make up that time to make sure that that number of hours,</div><div id="00:29:57.760" class="transcript_line"> the number of packages or the number of brushes you had to do that hour were caught up with,</div><div id="00:30:03.760" class="transcript_line"> so whatever time you spent in the loo, you had to make it up when you came back</div><div id="00:30:07.760" class="transcript_line"> and make sure within that hour you got that number back,</div><div id="00:30:10.760" class="transcript_line"> so you were going like the clappers when you got back to your station to make sure you didn&#039;t lose out.</div><div id="00:30:16.760" class="transcript_line"> So did you have to clock in in the morning then?</div><div id="00:30:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:20.760" class="transcript_line"> And clock out when you went into the toilet?</div><div id="00:30:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:30:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Clock out for you?</div><div id="00:30:24.760" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t clock out, we didn&#039;t use the clock,</div><div id="00:30:27.760" class="transcript_line"> but we had to say, is it okay if I go to the loo,</div><div id="00:30:31.760" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m going now kind of thing.</div><div id="00:30:34.760" class="transcript_line"> So did you just clock out in the evening?</div><div id="00:30:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, morning and evening, clock in and clock out when you left.</div><div id="00:30:42.760" class="transcript_line"> So who timed your breaks then?</div><div id="00:30:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Well there were always supervisors on the floor, quite often they used to sit with you in groups,</div><div id="00:30:50.760" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;d look at their watches and say, right, 50 minutes is up now guys, back to work.</div><div id="00:30:56.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean it was just a strict for them in a sense, because they couldn&#039;t go anywhere either really,</div><div id="00:31:01.760" class="transcript_line"> except that they did have their own office.</div><div id="00:31:04.760" class="transcript_line"> So they could have their sandwiches in there and have a drink in there any time they wanted really.</div><div id="00:31:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you get on with the supervisors?</div><div id="00:31:12.760" class="transcript_line"> They varied, they varied.</div><div id="00:31:16.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean obviously they vary as individuals, some are much nicer than others, you know,</div><div id="00:31:20.760" class="transcript_line"> so some were quite reasonable human beings and others were not.</div><div id="00:31:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Some we felt were more sort of sympathetic and empathetic with the workforce,</div><div id="00:31:28.760" class="transcript_line"> and others were definitely not.</div><div id="00:31:30.760" class="transcript_line"> They were very much, you know, the bosses.</div><div id="00:31:35.760" class="transcript_line"> And they kind of watched us.</div><div id="00:31:39.760" class="transcript_line"> I remember we had one from Scotland who was absolutely terrifying.</div><div id="00:31:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was scared of her, she was so strict.</div><div id="00:31:48.760" class="transcript_line"> And then we had another one, a local girl, who was absolutely lovely.</div><div id="00:31:52.760" class="transcript_line"> And she came to the loose with everybody and had to fag herself,</div><div id="00:31:59.760" class="transcript_line"> which probably could have got her sacked.</div><div id="00:32:01.760" class="transcript_line"> So you had that huge spectrum, you had some that were really nice and others not so nice.</div><div id="00:32:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Why did the supervisors come from, what I mean is, did they come from the factory floor,</div><div id="00:32:11.760" class="transcript_line"> or were they given jobs?</div><div id="00:32:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Both, some could be promoted from the factory floor,</div><div id="00:32:18.760" class="transcript_line"> and some came in as supervisors having worked elsewhere.</div><div id="00:32:22.760" class="transcript_line"> It varied really.</div><div id="00:32:25.760" class="transcript_line"> Come to think of it, I don&#039;t remember many promotions within the factory.</div><div id="00:32:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Even the women who had been there many, many years that I was friendly with,</div><div id="00:32:34.760" class="transcript_line"> unless they didn&#039;t actually apply for supervisory positions, maybe that was it.</div><div id="00:32:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Maybe they didn&#039;t want them.</div><div id="00:32:43.760" class="transcript_line"> But no, I tended to be women who came in as supervisors.</div><div id="00:32:47.760" class="transcript_line"> But nearly all of them had factory experience, they&#039;d worked on factory floors.</div><div id="00:32:52.760" class="transcript_line"> How were you, the workers, viewed by other people in Swansea?</div><div id="00:32:59.760" class="transcript_line"> Was it a perfectly good job?</div><div id="00:33:04.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:07.760" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:33:10.760" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:33:13.760" class="transcript_line"> I was very happy.</div><div id="00:33:16.760" class="transcript_line"> How were you, the workers, viewed by other people in Swansea?</div><div id="00:33:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Was it a perfectly good job?</div><div id="00:33:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:33:25.760" class="transcript_line"> We weren&#039;t looked down on in any way.</div><div id="00:33:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, I never felt that.</div><div id="00:33:31.760" class="transcript_line"> No, not by anybody.</div><div id="00:33:34.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:37.760" class="transcript_line"> So how many days did you work a week?</div><div id="00:33:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Five days, Monday to Friday.</div><div id="00:33:44.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:33:47.760" class="transcript_line"> I never did any overtime at weekends.</div><div id="00:33:50.760" class="transcript_line"> I remember not being pressured into doing weekend work.</div><div id="00:33:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Nobody ever pressured me into doing weekend work.</div><div id="00:33:59.760" class="transcript_line"> But there was weekend work.</div><div id="00:34:01.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean there must have been because the factory was open seven days a week.</div><div id="00:34:04.760" class="transcript_line"> So there must have been.</div><div id="00:34:07.760" class="transcript_line"> And how many hours a day?</div><div id="00:34:10.760" class="transcript_line"> 7.30am to 4.30am or 8am to 4.30am.</div><div id="00:34:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Something like that.</div><div id="00:34:16.760" class="transcript_line"> So quite long days then, especially with no breaks in different places.</div><div id="00:34:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there shifts then?</div><div id="00:34:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Were you aware of people doing shifts?</div><div id="00:34:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I didn&#039;t do them though.</div><div id="00:34:30.760" class="transcript_line"> I only worked those hours.</div><div id="00:34:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that was because you were younger or you didn&#039;t want to,</div><div id="00:34:37.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t mean to lead you, but you weren&#039;t even asked, were you?</div><div id="00:34:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Nobody ever asked me, no.</div><div id="00:34:45.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:34:48.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m pretty sure, as far as I can remember it, we all left at the same time.</div><div id="00:34:55.760" class="transcript_line"> We all finished at the same time because there was a mass exodus.</div><div id="00:34:59.760" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m not sure what happened after that, what happened in the evening.</div><div id="00:35:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Because I remember, I mean there was a mass of women all going at the same time.</div><div id="00:35:08.760" class="transcript_line"> So we must have all vacated the factory together.</div><div id="00:35:12.760" class="transcript_line"> What about holidays with pay, holiday allowance?</div><div id="00:35:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember anything about that?</div><div id="00:35:24.760" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what the holiday allowance was.</div><div id="00:35:28.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean we had paid holidays, probably only a fortnight a year or something.</div><div id="00:35:33.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember if you could pick your holidays or was it this minus holiday thing?</div><div id="00:35:43.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:35:44.760" class="transcript_line"> Did the factory close down or did people take different holidays?</div><div id="00:35:50.760" class="transcript_line"> No, people took different holidays.</div><div id="00:35:52.760" class="transcript_line"> No, the factory didn&#039;t close down.</div><div id="00:35:53.760" class="transcript_line"> We all had stacket holidays.</div><div id="00:35:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you had to put in your request for a holiday in advance.</div><div id="00:35:59.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:36:01.760" class="transcript_line"> And what about bank holidays?</div><div id="00:36:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we had bank holidays off.</div><div id="00:36:06.760" class="transcript_line"> And was the factory shut down?</div><div id="00:36:09.760" class="transcript_line"> No idea.</div><div id="00:36:13.760" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember whether it was shut or not.</div><div id="00:36:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:36:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go on holiday?</div><div id="00:36:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, because as I said I was born in Belgium, we always went back to Belgium.</div><div id="00:36:25.760" class="transcript_line"> My mother&#039;s family were all still there, her sister and her mother.</div><div id="00:36:28.760" class="transcript_line"> So we always spent our fortnight going back to Belgium to see my mother&#039;s family.</div><div id="00:36:33.760" class="transcript_line"> So it was pretty much the same every year for us really.</div><div id="00:36:36.760" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t take any independent?</div><div id="00:36:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Not until I was much older and my grandmother in Belgium and my aunt.</div><div id="00:36:43.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, my grandmother eventually passed away obviously.</div><div id="00:36:47.760" class="transcript_line"> But we still continued to go after that.</div><div id="00:36:50.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a photograph of myself there when I was 18.</div><div id="00:36:53.760" class="transcript_line"> I was in Belgium then on holiday.</div><div id="00:36:56.760" class="transcript_line"> And we carried right on going until I was quite old.</div><div id="00:37:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Over 20, we were still going every year.</div><div id="00:37:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:37:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:37:10.760" class="transcript_line"> You mentioned the sickness days alone.</div><div id="00:37:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Were you allowed days for personal reasons?</div><div id="00:37:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Funerals, maybe it didn&#039;t happen to you, but were you aware of difficulty if people needed to go to a funeral or any other kind of personal reason?</div><div id="00:37:32.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I think you were asked permission to go to a funeral, but I don&#039;t remember ever being refused.</div><div id="00:37:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:37:39.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:37:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay then, so down to the social life.</div><div id="00:37:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there any social activities organised by the workers?</div><div id="00:37:50.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I mean in the sense that if anybody had a birthday or a special event, we all sort of celebrated it together.</div><div id="00:37:58.760" class="transcript_line"> And Christmas time, we all had a works do as they used to call it, where we all went to a club together and had a Christmas party and Christmas meal and stuff.</div><div id="00:38:09.760" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go? Do you remember?</div><div id="00:38:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I can&#039;t remember what it was called now, but it&#039;s still there because I passed it a few, when I went recently.</div><div id="00:38:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Something like the, not the Star Inn, no that was the other end of Glansamle.</div><div id="00:38:28.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s still there as you go into Swansea, on the right hand side as you&#039;re driving into Swansea.</div><div id="00:38:36.760" class="transcript_line"> So was it down near town?</div><div id="00:38:40.760" class="transcript_line"> Very near town.</div><div id="00:38:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Was it near the factory?</div><div id="00:38:44.760" class="transcript_line"> It was only a few minutes drive from the factory or a few minutes on the bus from the factory. It was very local.</div><div id="00:38:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Right. Explain to me where the factory was because you explained to me on the phone.</div><div id="00:38:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, it&#039;s in Pentrichwyth because it was right next to the river, but you actually go through Boli Mine.</div><div id="00:39:04.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s where you get off the bus and then you walk down a very, very steep hill because it was right alongside the river.</div><div id="00:39:11.760" class="transcript_line"> So it was really in Boli Mine, I would say.</div><div id="00:39:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay, is it still there?</div><div id="00:39:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;m obviously not operating anymore, but I&#039;m told the buildings are still there.</div><div id="00:39:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Right, okay.</div><div id="00:39:26.760" class="transcript_line"> So a Christmas dance, can you remember any special Christmas dance or were they all the same? Were they good?</div><div id="00:39:42.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I mean we just had, yeah, everybody got drunk basically. We had a nice meal, everybody got drunk, we went to this club.</div><div id="00:39:50.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a pub restaurant it was, kind of. Wish I could remember what it was called because it would come to me.</div><div id="00:39:58.760" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;re driving into Swansea from Cardiff, just before you get to what is now, is it Sainsbury&#039;s on the left?</div><div id="00:40:07.760" class="transcript_line"> Just before, there&#039;s a set of traffic lights and if you look to your right, that place still exists that we used to go to.</div><div id="00:40:17.760" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a kind of pub club there on the right hand side before you go through those traffic lights past Sainsbury&#039;s and so on and go further down.</div><div id="00:40:26.760" class="transcript_line"> That club is still there. So I&#039;m not sure what area of Swansea that would be, whether it would be Port Tennant or if it&#039;s too far towards Swansea to be Port Tennant.</div><div id="00:40:39.760" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s still there anyway.</div><div id="00:40:41.760" class="transcript_line"> I know what you mean.</div><div id="00:40:42.760" class="transcript_line"> So did you go there for the birthday parties as well? Was it always the same place?</div><div id="00:40:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, we tended to go to the same place, yes. Or sometimes we&#039;d go to pubs, you know, obviously pubs in Swansea.</div><div id="00:40:57.760" class="transcript_line"> What about trips? Did you go on trips?</div><div id="00:40:59.760" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t remember any trips at all, none at all, no.</div><div id="00:41:03.760" class="transcript_line"> So you said you were friendly with the older women and the factory. Was there a good camaraderie?</div><div id="00:41:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes. Yes, we were all very tight. Oh yes, we were always aware of one another&#039;s private lives and personal issues that were going on with people&#039;s marriages and relationships and stuff. Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:41:25.760" class="transcript_line"> And did you remain friends with them after you left?</div><div id="00:41:28.760" class="transcript_line"> After I left the factory?</div><div id="00:41:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:41:31.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, we all remained on good terms, but obviously, you know, eventually I left Swansea completely, so I didn&#039;t see them anymore.</div><div id="00:41:38.760" class="transcript_line"> No, no, no. The thing is, if you start another job and they&#039;re still working there, you&#039;re not going to come across one another very much.</div><div id="00:41:45.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just, you know, you&#039;re deliberately avoiding one another, but unless you live very close to each other.</div><div id="00:41:52.760" class="transcript_line"> I had one or two close friends, though, I continued to keep in touch with.</div><div id="00:41:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Even now?</div><div id="00:41:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, not since I left Swansea. No.</div><div id="00:42:01.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean, there&#039;ll all be a lot of them being a better place now, won&#039;t they? I mean, they were twenty odd years older than I was, so they&#039;ll be long gone, really.</div><div id="00:42:09.760" class="transcript_line"> So how long were you with the factory for?</div><div id="00:42:14.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know exactly how long I was there, because I left to work. I know I went from there to a milliner&#039;s to work, where I actually delivered millinery to all the major stores in Swansea, and I was there for quite a while.</div><div id="00:42:34.760" class="transcript_line"> And I also can&#039;t even remember chronologically in which order it went.</div><div id="00:42:41.760" class="transcript_line"> And subsequently I went back to Addis a second time.</div><div id="00:42:46.760" class="transcript_line"> Now that wasn&#039;t until much later, because I actually left to join the army.</div><div id="00:42:56.760" class="transcript_line"> And I went and did my basic training. I was only in the army a few months, because just before I went into the army, I&#039;d met Margaret.</div><div id="00:43:05.760" class="transcript_line"> And I decided to buy myself out of the army in order to continue, well, not continue, begin a relationship.</div><div id="00:43:17.760" class="transcript_line"> So I bought myself out.</div><div id="00:43:20.760" class="transcript_line"> And I went back there for a while to work.</div><div id="00:43:26.760" class="transcript_line"> And I left, when I left there, I left Swansea and went to live in Bridgend.</div><div id="00:43:33.760" class="transcript_line"> To live with Margaret, because she lived on her own in Bungalow.</div><div id="00:43:37.760" class="transcript_line"> But that took quite a long time.</div><div id="00:43:39.760" class="transcript_line"> I can remember going back and forth for something like 16 months between Addis, leaving Addis on a Friday, going to Bridgend for the weekend and going back to Addis on a Monday morning.</div><div id="00:43:51.760" class="transcript_line"> So I must have been there a fair while, because we met in February of 72.</div><div id="00:43:57.760" class="transcript_line"> No, we didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:43:59.760" class="transcript_line"> We met in 1970, in November of 1970.</div><div id="00:44:05.760" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t move into Bridgend until February of 72.</div><div id="00:44:10.760" class="transcript_line"> So that period of time, again, I was working in Addis.</div><div id="00:44:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:44:17.760" class="transcript_line"> So why do you think you went back there?</div><div id="00:44:22.760" class="transcript_line"> Was it, I mean, did you feel, did you feel happy there?</div><div id="00:44:29.760" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s just a question of the familiar really.</div><div id="00:44:32.760" class="transcript_line"> I knew exactly what I was going back to.</div><div id="00:44:35.760" class="transcript_line"> And I thought rather, because I had it in the back of my mind that wherever I went I wouldn&#039;t be there very long.</div><div id="00:44:43.760" class="transcript_line"> I just thought, well, I go back to what I know.</div><div id="00:44:45.760" class="transcript_line"> The money&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:44:46.760" class="transcript_line"> I know I can do the job.</div><div id="00:44:48.760" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll stick it out there for a little while and see how things turn out.</div><div id="00:44:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Why did you leave in the first place then?</div><div id="00:44:57.760" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember.</div><div id="00:44:58.760" class="transcript_line"> I just thought probably I wanted to change.</div><div id="00:45:01.760" class="transcript_line"> It was just, you know, familiar routine.</div><div id="00:45:04.760" class="transcript_line"> I just wanted to change really and do something different.</div><div id="00:45:08.760" class="transcript_line"> And did you enjoy these different things, like the milling as, as much as you enjoyed the factory?</div><div id="00:45:15.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:45:16.760" class="transcript_line"> No, because I was working with them, two initially, and two women initially, and then one of them left to have a baby, and I was working with one other woman.</div><div id="00:45:26.760" class="transcript_line"> And it was kind of lonely in a sense after working with that huge crowd of people in a factory.</div><div id="00:45:34.760" class="transcript_line"> It was lonely in that sense.</div><div id="00:45:36.760" class="transcript_line"> I had a female boss who was very kind to me.</div><div id="00:45:38.760" class="transcript_line"> But, and I&#039;ve spent most of my time outside.</div><div id="00:45:43.760" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s part of the reason I left, I think, was because I was beginning to feel claustrophobic and enclosed really.</div><div id="00:45:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Being indoors for those number of hours every day, every week.</div><div id="00:45:54.760" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re never seeing the outside.</div><div id="00:45:56.760" class="transcript_line"> Never, you know.</div><div id="00:45:57.760" class="transcript_line"> I got a job where I spent a lot of my time outside because I was delivering millinery, so I was outside a great deal.</div><div id="00:46:03.760" class="transcript_line"> Walking round Swansea really, different parts, and seeing different people when I was going to the stores to hand over the millinery.</div><div id="00:46:09.760" class="transcript_line"> I thought that would, you know, that would be great.</div><div id="00:46:12.760" class="transcript_line"> I worked in Wine Street.</div><div id="00:46:14.760" class="transcript_line"> The millinery was in Wine Street, and it was a really interesting area.</div><div id="00:46:16.760" class="transcript_line"> It was a red light district in those days.</div><div id="00:46:18.760" class="transcript_line"> Not posh like it is now, full of restaurants and clubs and bars.</div><div id="00:46:21.760" class="transcript_line"> It was very interesting working there.</div><div id="00:46:24.760" class="transcript_line"> But, as I say, it was lonely after working with, I was working with one other person who wasn&#039;t exactly a joy to work with, looking back on it now.</div><div id="00:46:33.760" class="transcript_line"> So, yeah.</div><div id="00:46:36.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I did regret it actually.</div><div id="00:46:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:46:39.760" class="transcript_line"> What about joining the Army?</div><div id="00:46:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Why did you feel you wanted to join the Army?</div><div id="00:46:43.760" class="transcript_line"> God alone knows, Catherine.</div><div id="00:46:45.760" class="transcript_line"> God alone knows.</div><div id="00:46:46.760" class="transcript_line"> What I was thinking at the time, I have no idea.</div><div id="00:46:49.760" class="transcript_line"> Lots of my friends left.</div><div id="00:46:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Two of my friends went to join the Army that I was in school with, and they said it was a very interesting, exciting life, and you know, why, what you do, why are you wasting your life doing those crap jobs?</div><div id="00:47:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Why don&#039;t you join the Army?</div><div id="00:47:02.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s fun.</div><div id="00:47:03.760" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ll have a great time, you know.</div><div id="00:47:05.760" class="transcript_line"> So, I think I was partly influenced by them.</div><div id="00:47:07.760" class="transcript_line"> One of the friends I was very close to in school, I continued to have a friendship with after she joined the Army.</div><div id="00:47:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Two of my closest friends joined the Army.</div><div id="00:47:15.760" class="transcript_line"> I think I was influenced by them, and my father had been in the Army as well.</div><div id="00:47:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Not that he recommended it, because he hated the Army, but I think it was the two women who said to me, you know, it&#039;s much more interesting than working in a factory or a shop or whatever.</div><div id="00:47:30.760" class="transcript_line"> You know, there&#039;s so much going on, it&#039;s so interesting, you really enjoy it.</div><div id="00:47:34.760" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:47:35.760" class="transcript_line"> So off I went.</div><div id="00:47:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:47:40.760" class="transcript_line"> So, can I just ask you, you said you&#039;d started a relationship with your partner, Margaret, in early 70s, and you went back to the factory.</div><div id="00:47:54.760" class="transcript_line"> Were you open about your sexuality, and if you were, or if you weren&#039;t, if you know what I mean, how were people&#039;s attitudes in the factory?</div><div id="00:48:08.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I knew I was gay when I was in school, and people, you know, generally said everybody went through this phase where they had crushes on other girls, and they grew out of them.</div><div id="00:48:18.760" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, fine, that&#039;ll happen to me as well, but it didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:48:22.760" class="transcript_line"> I had boyfriends, a number of boyfriends at the same time as it happened, but most of my friends had sex at quite an early age, you know, when they were still in their mid-teens and had babies subsequently, and I wouldn&#039;t have sex with boys.</div><div id="00:48:39.760" class="transcript_line"> I always refused.</div><div id="00:48:41.760" class="transcript_line"> And I had a bit of a reputation as being frigid.</div><div id="00:48:48.760" class="transcript_line"> I was told I was frigid, and, you know, I wasn&#039;t coming across, so I was frigid, there was something wrong with me, but I knew it was because I was gay.</div><div id="00:48:55.760" class="transcript_line"> I just, I slowly came to realise that I was gay anyway, right through my teens.</div><div id="00:49:02.760" class="transcript_line"> And when I was, I mean, as far as the women were concerned, that was something they almost spat out, as though it was something disgusting and dirty.</div><div id="00:49:15.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean, if you told them that you were gay, I suspect not many of them would have spoken to me or got anywhere close to me in case, you know, it rubbed off on them by reputation.</div><div id="00:49:26.760" class="transcript_line"> It was a very different atmosphere in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:49:30.760" class="transcript_line"> Things were slowly beginning to change, but really it wasn&#039;t until the 70s that the major changes began, and attitudes began to change.</div><div id="00:49:40.760" class="transcript_line"> No, I never discussed it with anyone.</div><div id="00:49:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Even when you&#039;d started a relationship?</div><div id="00:49:45.760" class="transcript_line"> Well, I had a relationship before Margaret when I was, I must have been around 20, I suppose.</div><div id="00:49:54.760" class="transcript_line"> I met somebody who was a lot older than I was, and who was bisexual.</div><div id="00:50:00.760" class="transcript_line"> And she was much older, much more sophisticated, when she was 31, and I was, you know, I was green really, I was very young and naïve in many ways.</div><div id="00:50:11.760" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d got a degree at Sheffield University. She was highly intelligent.</div><div id="00:50:16.760" class="transcript_line"> And she was the first person, whoever, showed me any true respect that I didn&#039;t get any at home.</div><div id="00:50:24.760" class="transcript_line"> Because my brother was considered to be highly intelligent, which he was and still is, and I was considered, you know, to be average.</div><div id="00:50:32.760" class="transcript_line"> And letting the family down because I wasn&#039;t going out with boys and I wasn&#039;t getting engaged and I wasn&#039;t getting married and I wasn&#039;t having babies.</div><div id="00:50:40.760" class="transcript_line"> But she was the first person to ask me for my opinion on anything.</div><div id="00:50:45.760" class="transcript_line"> If we discussed things, you know, general things that were going on in the world and in society around us, social events and political events and stuff, and she would actually say, what do you think?</div><div id="00:50:56.760" class="transcript_line"> I remember being absolutely gobsmacked the first time she said that to me.</div><div id="00:51:00.760" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about it? Have you thought about that? What&#039;s your opinion on it?</div><div id="00:51:04.760" class="transcript_line"> And I thought, my God, nobody has ever asked me for my opinion. Nobody.</div><div id="00:51:09.760" class="transcript_line"> So I was silent for a long time and I thought, I did think about things, but I never discussed them with anyone.</div><div id="00:51:16.760" class="transcript_line"> Because I was never asked. So she was the first relationship I had.</div><div id="00:51:22.760" class="transcript_line"> And that was going on when I was still working in the factory. So I was going to work and she was then working as a civil servant.</div><div id="00:51:33.760" class="transcript_line"> There was no way I could have discussed that with anybody.</div><div id="00:51:36.760" class="transcript_line"> And I mean, we broke up because she actually had a relationship with a married man while she was seeing me at the same time.</div><div id="00:51:42.760" class="transcript_line"> And I decided enough was enough really. And I basically packed it in because she became pregnant by him.</div><div id="00:51:48.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a long, complicated story.</div><div id="00:51:51.760" class="transcript_line"> He paid for an abortion and I was the one who went to the hospital with her, but we won&#039;t go there.</div><div id="00:51:56.760" class="transcript_line"> I decided that was enough. Finished.</div><div id="00:51:59.760" class="transcript_line"> But there was no way I could have discussed that with anybody. I never discussed it with anyone.</div><div id="00:52:03.760" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t have a single friend that I could discuss that with.</div><div id="00:52:06.760" class="transcript_line"> So definitely not with anybody in the factory?</div><div id="00:52:08.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:52:09.760" class="transcript_line"> OK. OK.</div><div id="00:52:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Looking back now, this is the last question.</div><div id="00:52:18.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh.</div><div id="00:52:20.760" class="transcript_line"> I just asked. You didn&#039;t go and work in any other factory after that, did you?</div><div id="00:52:25.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:52:26.760" class="transcript_line"> So looking back now, how do you feel?</div><div id="00:52:28.760" class="transcript_line"> I tell a lie. I did. But that was after I moved in with Margaret. So that was in Bridgend.</div><div id="00:52:35.760" class="transcript_line"> And what factory was that?</div><div id="00:52:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Miles Laboratories, it was called.</div><div id="00:52:39.760" class="transcript_line"> If you can think of any household medication, any sort of familiar brand name that you can think of, they bottled.</div><div id="00:52:48.760" class="transcript_line"> So it was a line, it was machinery and it was a series of bottles that you had to fill.</div><div id="00:52:54.760" class="transcript_line"> How did that compare with Addis?</div><div id="00:52:58.760" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot less camaraderie there. A lot more focus on the work.</div><div id="00:53:06.760" class="transcript_line"> And no chatting. Because the machines were a lot faster and you had to keep up with them.</div><div id="00:53:11.760" class="transcript_line"> You didn&#039;t have time to chat to people. Except of course during your breaks.</div><div id="00:53:15.760" class="transcript_line"> I mean the conditions were much better. Extremely clean, extremely hygienic, much better facilities.</div><div id="00:53:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Decent breaks, good money, blah blah blah.</div><div id="00:53:23.760" class="transcript_line"> But the camaraderie was virtually, I mean except during lunch breaks when you had an opportunity to chat.</div><div id="00:53:30.760" class="transcript_line"> It was totally focused on the work really.</div><div id="00:53:33.760" class="transcript_line"> And was that a smaller factory?</div><div id="00:53:35.760" class="transcript_line"> No, it was quite large.</div><div id="00:53:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Was that mainly women?</div><div id="00:53:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:53:39.760" class="transcript_line"> And what years, do you remember?</div><div id="00:53:41.760" class="transcript_line"> Well I moved in in 1972, so it must have been between 1972 and 1974 I worked there.</div><div id="00:53:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Right. And do you remember any social occasions, that kind of thing?</div><div id="00:53:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it was a lot more sophisticated. We all went into Cardiff.</div><div id="00:53:55.760" class="transcript_line"> A different world really.</div><div id="00:53:59.760" class="transcript_line"> And sorry, what was it called?</div><div id="00:54:01.760" class="transcript_line"> Miles Laboratories. I&#039;ve got a feeling it&#039;s probably still there.</div><div id="00:54:06.760" class="transcript_line"> Enbridge End Industrial Estate, it&#039;s probably still there.</div><div id="00:54:09.760" class="transcript_line"> And the conditions were good, so you were, do you remember how much you earned?</div><div id="00:54:17.760" class="transcript_line"> No, no idea.</div><div id="00:54:19.760" class="transcript_line"> But you were happy with the wage?</div><div id="00:54:21.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, the money was fine.</div><div id="00:54:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Looking back then, how do you feel about the time you spent working in these factories?</div><div id="00:54:29.760" class="transcript_line"> Well it was very formative in a way. I didn&#039;t realise it at the time.</div><div id="00:54:33.760" class="transcript_line"> But it helped me get through some very difficult years at home.</div><div id="00:54:44.760" class="transcript_line"> And I formed some very close relationships really.</div><div id="00:54:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Which helped me through difficult times really.</div><div id="00:54:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Generally, how do you think, generally for women, were they important places?</div><div id="00:55:00.760" class="transcript_line"> Everybody there felt that. It gave them a sense of independence and also a sense of who they were as individuals.</div><div id="00:55:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Because most of them were married with families and everybody related to them in that way.</div><div id="00:55:17.760" class="transcript_line"> They were somebody&#039;s wife and somebody&#039;s mother.</div><div id="00:55:19.760" class="transcript_line"> But while they were in the factories, they were themselves.</div><div id="00:55:22.760" class="transcript_line"> And they got back in touch with their identity and who they were.</div><div id="00:55:25.760" class="transcript_line"> And they formed close relationships with other women.</div><div id="00:55:28.760" class="transcript_line"> And I think they were able to be themselves in a way that they probably weren&#039;t at home.</div><div id="00:55:34.760" class="transcript_line"> It taught you a lot of things about yourself.</div><div id="00:55:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Forming relationships, being able to work as a member of a team.</div><div id="00:55:44.760" class="transcript_line"> Things like loyalty.</div><div id="00:55:46.760" class="transcript_line"> And I also learned to be discreet because a lot of people told you personal stuff.</div><div id="00:55:52.760" class="transcript_line"> Which they trusted you with.</div><div id="00:55:55.760" class="transcript_line"> Not necessarily anyone else.</div><div id="00:55:58.760" class="transcript_line"> Maybe things they couldn&#039;t talk about even to members of their family.</div><div id="00:56:02.760" class="transcript_line"> What about Addis? Do you think they were good employers on the home?</div><div id="00:56:08.760" class="transcript_line"> For the time they were.</div><div id="00:56:11.760" class="transcript_line"> Considering it was the early 60s.</div><div id="00:56:13.760" class="transcript_line"> What was the factory called by the way?</div><div id="00:56:15.760" class="transcript_line"> Addis. Addis Limited, yeah.</div><div id="00:56:17.760" class="transcript_line"> And what about the other place in Bridgend Mills?</div><div id="00:56:20.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they were probably reasonable employers as well.</div><div id="00:56:23.760" class="transcript_line"> They followed all the rules.</div><div id="00:56:26.760" class="transcript_line"> They had no complaints about working conditions.</div><div id="00:56:30.760" class="transcript_line"> But you were expected to pull your finger out and work hard really.</div><div id="00:56:34.760" class="transcript_line"> Nothing major to complain about.</div><div id="00:56:38.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much Yvonne.</div><div id="00:56:41.760" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re welcome, that&#039;s okay.</div><div id="00:56:43.760" class="transcript_line"> I forgot to ask you this Yvonne.</div><div id="00:56:48.760" class="transcript_line"> Were there any perks from working in the factory?</div><div id="00:56:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you did get everything at a reduced cost.</div><div id="00:56:56.760" class="transcript_line"> But every night when you left the factory you were at randomly searched by security.</div><div id="00:57:05.760" class="transcript_line"> To make sure you didn&#039;t have anything on your person that you shouldn&#039;t have had.</div><div id="00:57:09.760" class="transcript_line"> So you had to go through a gate.</div><div id="00:57:12.760" class="transcript_line"> And at random they just picked you out.</div><div id="00:57:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Went through your handbag, went through your shopping bag.</div><div id="00:57:17.760" class="transcript_line"> Quite often used to frisk you to make sure you didn&#039;t have anything on your body that you shouldn&#039;t have had.</div><div id="00:57:21.760" class="transcript_line"> So were any people caught?</div><div id="00:57:23.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:57:24.760" class="transcript_line"> What happened to them?</div><div id="00:57:26.760" class="transcript_line"> They were sucked.</div><div id="00:57:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:57:30.760" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think you had the opportunity to do it a second time.</div><div id="00:57:33.760" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:57:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div><div id="00:57:36.760" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much.</div><div id="00:57:37.760" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s okay.</div></div></p>
