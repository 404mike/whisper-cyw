    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m Vicki MacDonald and I&#039;m at Holy Trinity Church in London now for the exhibition of</div><div id="00:00:05.200" class="transcript_line"> The Longest Yarn and I have Gwyneth Peters with me and she&#039;s going to talk about her</div><div id="00:00:09.520" class="transcript_line"> childhood in Anglesey during the wartime.</div><div id="00:00:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Thank you Gwyneth.</div><div id="00:00:13.400" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:00:14.400" class="transcript_line"> My name was Gwyneth Brown.</div><div id="00:00:15.400" class="transcript_line"> I was born and brought up in Hollyhead where I was born in 1935 at which time during the</div><div id="00:00:23.280" class="transcript_line"> war my father was away with Trinity House and clearing the mines, following the minesweepers,</div><div id="00:00:31.360" class="transcript_line"> but we had the army in Tee-Croix, we had the Royal Air Force in Valley and we had the Navy</div><div id="00:00:42.240" class="transcript_line"> in Hollyhead and there was a barrage, I remember the barrage balloons floating up high to stop</div><div id="00:00:48.240" class="transcript_line"> the Germans bombing.</div><div id="00:00:51.440" class="transcript_line"> So I was brought up on going along the seashore looking for tins of flour, the sweetened flour</div><div id="00:00:59.280" class="transcript_line"> that came from the Canadian ships that had been torpedoed on the way to Liverpool.</div><div id="00:01:04.320" class="transcript_line"> My father being a seaman, he used to bring home seagull&#039;s eggs and we used to look for</div><div id="00:01:09.840" class="transcript_line"> this sweetened flour and we would have pancakes.</div><div id="00:01:12.400" class="transcript_line"> And was the sweetened flour in good condition?</div><div id="00:01:14.720" class="transcript_line"> In cans, in good condition in cans, yes.</div><div id="00:01:20.800" class="transcript_line"> The other interesting thing that was from each of the ships in the harbour in Hollyhead,</div><div id="00:01:25.920" class="transcript_line"> there were barrage balloons and my mother kept having little babies when my father came</div><div id="00:01:30.720" class="transcript_line"> home from war and she wanted something waterproof to put in the cot.</div><div id="00:01:37.520" class="transcript_line"> So when the barrage balloons were blown up by enemy fire, you could use this material</div><div id="00:01:44.640" class="transcript_line"> from the barrage balloons to use as waterproofing for putting underneath the sheet in the baby&#039;s</div><div id="00:01:50.000" class="transcript_line"> cot.</div><div id="00:01:52.080" class="transcript_line"> So that was one thing.</div><div id="00:01:53.280" class="transcript_line"> The other thing I remember is going to Rosneiger and where the RAF camp was and we used to</div><div id="00:02:01.680" class="transcript_line"> go to their rubbish heap looking for food scraps and I think we did find a necklace</div><div id="00:02:08.720" class="transcript_line"> one time, some beads, but if we saw the Americans we&#039;d say, got any gum, chum?</div><div id="00:02:14.720" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what we would, and sometimes they would give us some chewing gum and if you</div><div id="00:02:19.200" class="transcript_line"> know we didn&#039;t have sweets and all that because there was so many Russians.</div><div id="00:02:23.760" class="transcript_line"> So and the other thing, did I mention that my father used to bring home seagulls eggs?</div><div id="00:02:30.400" class="transcript_line"> Yes and you had pancakes.</div><div id="00:02:31.840" class="transcript_line"> And we had pancakes.</div><div id="00:02:33.120" class="transcript_line"> I know you&#039;ve mentioned seagull eggs before.</div><div id="00:02:35.760" class="transcript_line"> What do they taste like Gwyneth?</div><div id="00:02:37.280" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, I can&#039;t remember because I was born in 35.</div><div id="00:02:41.280" class="transcript_line"> So you know I was only 10 when the war finished wasn&#039;t I?</div><div id="00:02:45.600" class="transcript_line"> They must have tasted slightly fishy.</div><div id="00:02:48.160" class="transcript_line"> Probably.</div><div id="00:02:49.280" class="transcript_line"> But I was so used to eating winkles.</div><div id="00:02:52.880" class="transcript_line"> Winkles and don&#039;t eat dog whelks, they&#039;re not very good.</div><div id="00:02:58.320" class="transcript_line"> And you have to cook them with nettles.</div><div id="00:03:02.640" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t realize until I studied botany at university that the Latin name for nettle</div><div id="00:03:09.680" class="transcript_line"> is urticaria and the disease on my face was called urticaria but it was because I was</div><div id="00:03:15.600" class="transcript_line"> eating winkles cooked with net stinging nettles.</div><div id="00:03:20.960" class="transcript_line"> So were your your father was at sea then?</div><div id="00:03:23.920" class="transcript_line"> He was at sea.</div><div id="00:03:24.560" class="transcript_line"> During the war?</div><div id="00:03:25.120" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:03:25.440" class="transcript_line"> And your mother was left with how many of you at home?</div><div id="00:03:27.760" class="transcript_line"> Well the first one was born in 33.</div><div id="00:03:31.280" class="transcript_line"> My brother Gwilym was born in 1933 and she had Gwyneth 35, Eileen 37, Gilbert 1940, Avril 1942,</div><div id="00:03:44.400" class="transcript_line"> and then the poor woman thought that she was all passed it all and in 1949 she had her sixth child</div><div id="00:03:49.840" class="transcript_line"> David who still lives in and my three brothers were all apprentices to be marine engineers</div><div id="00:03:56.560" class="transcript_line"> so they went around the world.</div><div id="00:03:58.720" class="transcript_line"> But the sad thing that my mother&#039;s brother Eddie was a flying officer and he&#039;d been on a sortie in</div><div id="00:04:07.520" class="transcript_line"> Italy and coming back to south of England he was shot down by friendly fire</div><div id="00:04:14.880" class="transcript_line"> and it was they thought that it was a German airplane but it was in fact</div><div id="00:04:19.360" class="transcript_line"> Was he killed?</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was killed and he was a golf professional in Chester.</div><div id="00:04:25.600" class="transcript_line"> I lost my cousin but it all said lost at sea.</div><div id="00:04:31.040" class="transcript_line"> He was my cousin also my father was William Robert Brown he was William Robert Brown</div><div id="00:04:36.320" class="transcript_line"> and then I had one of my mother&#039;s brothers was lieutenant colonel and he was very involved in</div><div id="00:04:45.360" class="transcript_line"> the army so we lost my father&#039;s brother my father&#039;s nephew and my mother&#039;s brother in the war.</div><div id="00:04:56.960" class="transcript_line"> So that was very sad.</div><div id="00:04:58.320" class="transcript_line"> Very sad.</div><div id="00:04:58.800" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:04:59.360" class="transcript_line"> But my</div><div id="00:04:59.920" class="transcript_line"> Very difficult for your mother.</div><div id="00:05:01.280" class="transcript_line"> Yeah very difficult for my mother and she had to you know live off</div><div id="00:05:05.840" class="transcript_line"> all because rushing but the interesting thing about my husband he was an only child</div><div id="00:05:12.480" class="transcript_line"> living in London and he was somewhere by Clapham or something like that and his father and mother</div><div id="00:05:19.280" class="transcript_line"> were both on warden duty for the bombs and he was in his pajamas and house got bombed</div><div id="00:05:27.360" class="transcript_line"> and his mother did manage to rush and say get under the stairs.</div><div id="00:05:32.080" class="transcript_line"> He was found under the stairs in his pajamas by a policeman who took him to the vicarage</div><div id="00:05:38.720" class="transcript_line"> where they had a bundle of clothes on the floor said take some clothes but he had no shoes</div><div id="00:05:44.960" class="transcript_line"> but it was the eve of his 11 plus exam and he had been told you have a little pencil</div><div id="00:05:50.960" class="transcript_line"> and a protractor and if you come to school without the pencil and protractor you can&#039;t</div><div id="00:05:55.600" class="transcript_line"> do the 11 plus.</div><div id="00:05:57.840" class="transcript_line"> So he&#039;s been found by this policeman and he was taking him for the clothes he says please don&#039;t</div><div id="00:06:02.960" class="transcript_line"> leave me to the policeman because that&#039;s my 11 plus exam and the teacher won&#039;t let me in if I</div><div id="00:06:08.800" class="transcript_line"> don&#039;t have my protractor and pencil.</div><div id="00:06:11.120" class="transcript_line"> So the policeman stayed with him and true enough went to the primary school and the teacher</div><div id="00:06:16.960" class="transcript_line"> immediately said get out you can&#039;t come in here you haven&#039;t got your pencil or your protractor</div><div id="00:06:21.360" class="transcript_line"> and the policeman grabbed it by the shoulder and said this child was born at two o&#039;clock in the</div><div id="00:06:26.240" class="transcript_line"> morning under the stairs he doesn&#039;t know where his parents are give him a pencil and a protractor</div><div id="00:06:33.600" class="transcript_line"> and he concentrated so much on passing that 11 plus he did pass.</div><div id="00:06:37.600" class="transcript_line"> He passed it down with his parents okay?</div><div id="00:06:39.760" class="transcript_line"> They took three days.</div><div id="00:06:41.280" class="transcript_line"> But they did find him.</div><div id="00:06:42.240" class="transcript_line"> They did find him his mother&#039;s face was even to she died when she was 83 or something her</div><div id="00:06:49.280" class="transcript_line"> face is still speckled with the black thing from the the bombing and she had a great big</div><div id="00:06:55.840" class="transcript_line"> hole in the calf of her leg from where she had been injured during the bombing but his father</div><div id="00:07:02.080" class="transcript_line"> went to a Iraq petroleum company and so they had no more children they had a divorce.</div><div id="00:07:09.200" class="transcript_line"> So but it&#039;s interesting.</div><div id="00:07:10.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes what an interesting story Gwena thank you so much that&#039;s so kind of you.</div><div id="00:07:15.200"
