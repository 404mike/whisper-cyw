    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jill Willey. Today it&#039;s the 8th of August and I&#039;m here at the Ellen Lynx offices</div><div id="00:00:08.800" class="transcript_line"> talking to Liz Fosse, Ian Billings and Nathan Preece. Now these people are members of a</div><div id="00:00:18.440" class="transcript_line"> very interesting organisation known as GOATS, meaning Getting On in the Shed group. My apologies,</div><div id="00:00:28.960" class="transcript_line"> Getting On at the Shed. Thank you, Liz. Liz, could you just give us your full name and</div><div id="00:00:34.640" class="transcript_line"> the year in which you were born? Liz Fosse, 1952. Fine. Can you tell me just a little</div><div id="00:00:42.760" class="transcript_line"> bit about yourself, as much or as little as you choose to tell me in the next couple of</div><div id="00:00:47.280" class="transcript_line"> minutes? I was born in the Midlands. I was born in Nottingham where I spent almost 30</div><div id="00:00:52.720" class="transcript_line"> years there. Then I moved down to Devon, to Plymouth and I spent almost 30 years there</div><div id="00:00:59.480" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;ve come to Birmingham and I&#039;m going to spend 30 years here. Thank you very much</div><div id="00:01:06.120" class="transcript_line"> indeed. May I call you Liz? You can, yes. Right, thank you very much. We&#039;ll just move</div><div id="00:01:14.440" class="transcript_line"> on now to Ian. One moment please. Okay, we&#039;ll just pin on to the research. I&#039;ll just clip</div><div id="00:01:22.240" class="transcript_line"> on. Anywhere at all. No, sorry. Right, and now we&#039;re moving on to Nathan. So Nathan,</div><div id="00:01:34.200" class="transcript_line"> could you just give us your full name please, the year you were born and just a little snapshot</div><div id="00:01:40.160" class="transcript_line"> of yourself. Yes, I&#039;m Nathan Price. I was born in 1946. I&#039;m a retired accountant. I</div><div id="00:01:49.960" class="transcript_line"> was born in Gloucestershire. I lived in West Midlands for about 50 years now I guess. I</div><div id="00:01:56.400" class="transcript_line"> joined the goats about six months ago and enjoyed the company and very much enjoyed</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> the trip here today. Well, we&#039;re very pleased to welcome the three of you here at the Ellen</div><div id="00:02:07.600" class="transcript_line"> Ling&#039;s office. Yeah, and that&#039;s Don who is a minor. Because I&#039;d heard about the, that they were</div><div id="00:02:16.880" class="transcript_line"> talking about the Valley and where Birmingham water comes from, my friend told me about it and</div><div id="00:02:23.320" class="transcript_line"> I thought, oh that sounds really interesting. And so I came along right at the start, we were</div><div id="00:02:27.680" class="transcript_line"> talking about that. Well, I think some of them had done a bit of a walk of the pipe as well.</div><div id="00:02:33.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and other things that we do. You obviously do a lot of interesting things. We do local</div><div id="00:02:45.360" class="transcript_line"> history. We&#039;ve been on little trips around our local area and found out things that we didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:02:52.760" class="transcript_line"> even know about, you know, on our doorstep. It sounds very interesting what you do and what</div><div id="00:03:00.280" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re doing while you&#039;re here in the Valley. Would you mind just tell me a little bit about</div><div id="00:03:04.240" class="transcript_line"> the gentleman you referred to as the Mine of Information? I think I had a technical blip there.</div><div id="00:03:09.120" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what was his name? His name&#039;s Don and he&#039;s well into his eighties I think. Mine of Information,</div><div id="00:03:18.040" class="transcript_line"> if we ask a question he always knows the answer and if he doesn&#039;t he goes back,</div><div id="00:03:25.560" class="transcript_line"> researches it and comes back and tells us all what he&#039;s learnt. He sounds like a very useful</div><div id="00:03:32.840" class="transcript_line"> gentleman. He&#039;s very useful, very interesting man. Fine, fine. I&#039;ll move on to Ian now if I may.</div><div id="00:03:40.920" class="transcript_line"> Hello. Hello Ian, we talk again. Right, is this your first time in the Ellen Valley?</div><div id="00:03:49.640" class="transcript_line"> It is my first time here, yes, in the Ellen Valley. I&#039;ve travelled quite a lot in Wales</div><div id="00:03:56.320" class="transcript_line"> because I used to work across Wales and but yes, it&#039;s my first time in the Ellen Valley.</div><div id="00:04:09.520" class="transcript_line"> And what do you think of it? Have you had a pleasant experience?</div><div id="00:04:13.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been absolutely beautiful. We&#039;ve been very lucky with the weather, not just because it&#039;s</div><div id="00:04:22.320" class="transcript_line"> been hot and sunny but because it&#039;s been so bright and the landscape has looked very beautiful.</div><div id="00:04:30.080" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re familiar with the layout of the valley from the model in Cannon Hill Park but you don&#039;t get</div><div id="00:04:36.960" class="transcript_line"> a sense of the scale and quite how pretty it is until you&#039;re walking and driving around it.</div><div id="00:04:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Right, we might just move on to Nathan now. So nice to hear that you&#039;re really enjoying</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> yourselves here. Nathan, we&#039;ve just discussed the water and the model. I take it you yourself were</div><div id="00:05:03.120" class="transcript_line"> aware of where your water came from in Birmingham? Oh yes, yes, I knew it came from the Ellen Valley,</div><div id="00:05:08.640" class="transcript_line"> yes. Right, and have you actually seen the model? I have, only fairly recently, it&#039;s only after I</div><div id="00:05:18.800" class="transcript_line"> joined GOAPS where people were starting to talk about it that I realised it was there. I hadn&#039;t</div><div id="00:05:24.880" class="transcript_line"> lived really right in Birmingham, well I&#039;d lived in Birmingham itself for about 10 years now but</div><div id="00:05:29.680" class="transcript_line"> I never actually knew it was there and I did go and find it and yeah it&#039;s very interesting.</div><div id="00:05:37.120" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s quite a little gem in the middle of the Cannon Hill Park isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:41.600" class="transcript_line"> Yes it is. Right, thank you. We&#039;ll move back to Liz now, many thanks.</div><div id="00:05:51.120" class="transcript_line"> Liz you&#039;ve given me a little snapshot of what goes on at GOAPS. Now is this your first time in the</div><div id="00:05:57.920" class="transcript_line"> valley? I&#039;m not sure how far away it was that I&#039;ve been before but it was definitely Central Wales</div><div id="00:06:05.760" class="transcript_line"> and I&#039;m going to say this wrong, it was Clanddilos, something like that. Clidloes, I would imagine.</div><div id="00:06:13.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes, is that too far away from here? No it is not, it&#039;s just in fact people commute so it&#039;s really</div><div id="00:06:18.880" class="transcript_line"> not that far at all. Well I came here in 1976 when there was a drought so I&#039;ve seen all the</div><div id="00:06:26.080" class="transcript_line"> reservoirs, never seen a reservoir full and the weather was just like this, so my vision of Wales</div><div id="00:06:34.400" class="transcript_line"> is always sunny. Sunny, yes. Not always of course but you&#039;ve obviously come. And I have to say that probably my son was conceived in Wales</div><div id="00:06:50.480" class="transcript_line"> so if we gave him a name it would be Aberystwyth.</div><div id="00:06:52.800" class="transcript_line"> Can you put that one off? Take that one out.</div><div id="00:07:00.400" class="transcript_line"> Whatever you like. Right and Liz were you well aware of the fact that the water here goes down to</div><div id="00:07:11.200" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham? Were you aware that was your supply? Not until I came to Birmingham and since I&#039;ve been</div><div id="00:07:16.960" class="transcript_line"> at Goats I&#039;ve talked about it with my friends and they all learned about the Elan Valley and</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> the water at school and they made models of it, they all went to visit it as a school trip</div><div id="00:07:32.560" class="transcript_line"> so they all knew exactly what I was talking about. Right so you&#039;re well aware of this model in</div><div id="00:07:38.320" class="transcript_line"> Mill Park. Yes. I see. Right thank you. Ian then is there anything else you&#039;d like to say about</div><div id="00:07:48.880" class="transcript_line"> what you do at Goats at all? Yes you were right when you said earlier it was set up as a group for</div><div id="00:08:00.320" class="transcript_line"> men. I think the original idea had been that there was a possible problem of isolation</div><div id="00:08:07.440" class="transcript_line"> in older men and I&#039;m 53 and the youngest goat but when I joined it was a lot more of a men&#039;s group</div><div id="00:08:21.360" class="transcript_line"> and we did some very manly activities. We made nails for example in a forge which is a traditional</div><div id="00:08:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham industry or a traditional black country industry I should say and we learned scything from</div><div id="00:08:39.200" class="transcript_line"> Ida who&#039;s with us on this trip and which I can&#039;t describe as a manly activity since Ida is a woman</div><div id="00:08:45.200" class="transcript_line"> who was teaching us to be experts. So we&#039;ve done quite a lot of sort of conservation focused things</div><div id="00:08:54.000" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s an orchard associated with the shed and some people work there and yes it&#039;s been</div><div id="00:09:04.160" class="transcript_line"> local history and industrial history has been a focus but we&#039;ve also done some craft type things</div><div id="00:09:11.840" class="transcript_line"> and so on chorus oh yes some nature-based nature focused things as well.</div><div id="00:09:23.120" class="transcript_line"> Absolutely lovely what you do lovely camaraderie I would imagine. We&#039;ve also done some singing</div><div id="00:09:29.040" class="transcript_line"> because Kate Green who as you know was artist in residence here had written two songs which our</div><div id="00:09:40.560" class="transcript_line"> group one member of our group wrote melodies a four-part vocal harmony and guitar line and a</div><div id="00:09:50.560" class="transcript_line"> piano part and then we recorded those songs and one of our number who you might interview later</div><div id="00:09:59.440" class="transcript_line"> wrote some goats lyrics so we added some extra verses of our own and we sang them we sent the</div><div id="00:10:06.640" class="transcript_line"> recording to Kate and she joined us last night and we had a little sing of her version and our</div><div id="00:10:13.200" class="transcript_line"> version and played around with some musical instruments so there&#039;s a some of the goats are</div><div id="00:10:17.920" class="transcript_line"> musical. So really your talents are quite legion aren&#039;t they they appear to be? Collectively yes</div><div id="00:10:23.840" class="transcript_line"> not necessarily individually. What was the name of the song because Kate Green has actually given</div><div id="00:10:29.520" class="transcript_line"> a performance of all her songs walking the pipeline what was the name of your song? There were two</div><div id="00:10:35.280" class="transcript_line"> there was walking the pipe and the other one was called 73 and a half miles. Right thank you thank</div><div id="00:10:43.120" class="transcript_line"> you very much. So Ian I take it you&#039;re aware that Birmingham is supplied by the water from the</div><div id="00:10:49.120" class="transcript_line"> Elan Valley? Well yes but I wasn&#039;t at school in Birmingham so I hadn&#039;t learned that at school or</div><div id="00:10:54.640" class="transcript_line"> made models at school but I was born in Crewe and my dad always told me water came from Wales</div><div id="00:11:05.360" class="transcript_line"> and I don&#039;t know if cruise water comes from the Elan Valley or not but</div><div id="00:11:12.800" class="transcript_line"> it certainly comes from somewhere in Wales. I see and you&#039;d be aware of the model in Cannon Hill Park?</div><div id="00:11:18.720" class="transcript_line"> In Cannon Hill Park yes yes and I believe that it was in working condition when I first came to</div><div id="00:11:24.720" class="transcript_line"> Birmingham it&#039;s in need of some restoration at the moment and I believe there&#039;s a project</div><div id="00:11:30.080" class="transcript_line"> underway or under discussion to renovate it and get it back up to a working model with water</div><div id="00:11:38.160" class="transcript_line"> flowing through it. Well let&#039;s hope that comes to fruition in the not too distant future then.</div><div id="00:11:44.240" class="transcript_line"> Thank you very much Ian. Nathan if I can just ask you now is there anything you&#039;d like to add to the</div><div id="00:11:52.960" class="transcript_line"> activities that you all do in the goats? I think to be honest about 90 percent of the time we</div><div id="00:12:00.320" class="transcript_line"> spend drinking coffee and just having a chat and catching up on what&#039;s been happening</div><div id="00:12:08.160" class="transcript_line"> and we sort of plan trips and events so it&#039;s just having a chat and</div><div id="00:12:16.960" class="transcript_line"> planning forward events coming here. I mean it&#039;s been a lot of discussion about coming here obviously</div><div id="00:12:22.160" class="transcript_line"> so yeah but it&#039;s just nice to have an hour or two a week just meeting up with my old friends.</div><div id="00:12:30.720" class="transcript_line"> And is this your first time in the Elan Valley? Well to be honest I thought I&#039;d been here before</div><div id="00:12:36.160" class="transcript_line"> but now I&#039;ve come and seen it I don&#039;t think I have so I would say it was my first yeah I must</div><div id="00:12:41.600" class="transcript_line"> have been somewhere else I was thinking of which was in Wales. And what do you think of it then?</div><div id="00:12:47.680" class="transcript_line"> Oh it&#039;s absolutely stunning yeah really beautiful and I guess it&#039;s maybe larger than I expected the</div><div id="00:12:54.160" class="transcript_line"> whole area probably probably larger than I expected. Yes and of course now you&#039;ll be aware of it</div><div id="00:13:01.040" class="transcript_line"> you probably have a better idea of its links now with this area supplying the water and</div><div id="00:13:06.800" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re obviously aware of that little model in the can. Yes that&#039;s right yeah yeah yeah it&#039;s sort of</div><div id="00:13:11.840" class="transcript_line"> put it all together now. Well one question I&#039;d like to ask you collectively if I may and that&#039;s</div><div id="00:13:18.080" class="transcript_line"> will you come again? Yes I will have you come again. Yes probably yes yes I would bring my family.</div><div id="00:13:25.680" class="transcript_line"> Thank you. Well I think we&#039;ve more or less covered it about what you&#039;ve been doing and where you&#039;ve</div><div id="00:13:32.720" class="transcript_line"> been and how much you like it and we&#039;ve established a connection between Birmingham and</div><div id="00:13:38.640" class="transcript_line"> Elan Valley now so thank you very very much. So you&#039;ve talked about the games games oh we haven&#039;t</div><div id="00:13:44.320" class="transcript_line"> mentioned yet. Right there&#039;s a little bit more I think Liz would like to say.</div><div id="00:13:52.880" class="transcript_line"> One of our group Hugh asked if we&#039;d like to do board games and people bring board games along</div><div id="00:14:01.920" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re all introduced to new games and yeah it can be quite competitive sometimes.</div><div id="00:14:09.360" class="transcript_line"> Yeah would you say it&#039;s a it&#039;s a very good way of getting to know people and the camaraderie.</div><div id="00:14:15.200" class="transcript_line"> Definitely yeah. Keeping you together. Yeah yeah a lot of us are on our own</div><div id="00:14:19.600" class="transcript_line"> um so you know that&#039;s good for an ideal place to meet. Especially after lockdown you know you</div><div id="00:14:26.560" class="transcript_line"> sort of. We&#039;re all coming out again now aren&#039;t we? Yes well look that&#039;s lovely I think that more or</div><div id="00:14:32.960" class="transcript_line"> less sums it up and thank you very much Liz, Ian and Nathan for your time and your input. Thank you.</div></div></p>
