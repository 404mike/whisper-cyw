Go Go Bells were the first thing I did yes every Sunday evening and that&#039;s how I started.</div><div id="00:02:20.440" class="transcript_line"> Yes it was amazing.</div><div id="00:02:22.200" class="transcript_line"> How about you Sally what was your first point of contact?</div><div id="00:02:24.040" class="transcript_line"> I mean it&#039;s almost a shared experience definitely by being a spectator and witnessing</div><div id="00:02:28.280" class="transcript_line"> and seeing it and like Jane said that the right world is spectacle there</div><div id="00:02:32.520" class="transcript_line"> but and I feel like my memory is failing me and I don&#039;t know what order this all happened in</div><div id="00:02:37.720" class="transcript_line"> but because I came to work at Rubicon I was very aware then and I and because I came to</div><div id="00:02:44.360" class="transcript_line"> meet with Jane I was very aware of the carnival but I also got involved with dancing with</div><div id="00:02:50.680" class="transcript_line"> Sally McLennan and my Adrian ran the Samba band and she set up a dance group for it</div><div id="00:02:56.920" class="transcript_line"> and I really can&#039;t remember in what order it all happened but I was a participant of one of the</div><div id="00:03:03.080" class="transcript_line"> carnivals and I think...</div><div id="00:03:03.960" class="transcript_line"> Was the last one called the Tarzan Angels or something like that?</div><div id="00:03:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah that was another one but yeah that&#039;s interesting yeah.</div><div id="00:03:10.200" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:03:11.560" class="transcript_line"> I was dancing with June and Sally and Tracy and myself and then Adrian did some music for us as</div><div id="00:03:16.920" class="transcript_line"> well yes yeah so that was kind of an offshoot actually yeah and that was just not very much</div><div id="00:03:21.800" class="transcript_line"> about dancing in the street and for festivals but yeah no so I was a dancer with Sally&#039;s group</div><div id="00:03:28.440" class="transcript_line"> and we danced with the Samba band and so I was a participant in the carnival soon after as well</div><div id="00:03:33.880" class="transcript_line"> before becoming involved in the making of it but yeah for me it&#039;s just yes I think it&#039;s something</div><div id="00:03:41.160" class="transcript_line"> and I think I&#039;m quite selfish about this if you see something like that you want to be in it</div><div id="00:03:45.320" class="transcript_line"> rather than observing it and so I was delighted when I became involved in it yeah.</div><div id="00:03:51.880" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve both been I think working as a team really wasn&#039;t it as animators actually</div><div id="00:03:58.280" class="transcript_line"> trying to help put the bullet in the gun of actually yes I mean you know nine tenths of the</div><div id="00:04:03.640" class="transcript_line"> iceberg is the making of costumes but if on you know come the big day come the day of actually</div><div id="00:04:08.440" class="transcript_line"> showing the work if the costumes aren&#039;t kinetic if the dance groups don&#039;t dance</div><div id="00:04:14.840" class="transcript_line"> with joy then we have no carnival so 1994 at Kittays Community Center you&#039;d have been part</div><div id="00:04:24.600" class="transcript_line"> of the teams then I think I was there as I came in as part of the team then that was when I first</div><div id="00:04:29.960" class="transcript_line"> came that was my first year yes it was yeah and of course that we wouldn&#039;t have had a specific</div><div id="00:04:36.440" class="transcript_line"> dance space for it wasn&#039;t a specific dance space and it was basically just right everybody wants</div><div id="00:04:42.520" class="transcript_line"> to move we&#039;re doing it here now at this point in time and then we had maybe a couple of drummers</div><div id="00:04:48.360" class="transcript_line"> and that was Chris was there that time as well Chris Chris yes that&#039;s right and we just</div><div id="00:04:56.200" class="transcript_line"> just gathered everybody together who wanted to dance whether they were going to be dancers in</div><div id="00:04:59.480" class="transcript_line"> or not they would all have to move at some point the music and we just did these huge I remember</div><div id="00:05:04.520" class="transcript_line"> huge sessions it was quite impressive and we just took over the space basically and then everyone</div><div id="00:05:11.800" class="transcript_line"> making as it goes to the next space or people making were around the space and yeah that first</div><div id="00:05:18.600" class="transcript_line"> year was quite um having seen hundred years of resistance be 500 years of resistance before</div><div id="00:05:24.440" class="transcript_line"> in the year before it was almost like you&#039;ve gone part of it but also it&#039;s this whole thing</div><div id="00:05:29.880" class="transcript_line"> about getting people participating and that&#039;s what I enjoyed about it you know just encouraging</div><div id="00:05:36.920" class="transcript_line"> people who perhaps haven&#039;t moved at all just to step yeah do a few steps and um and feel</div><div id="00:05:44.600" class="transcript_line"> comfortable doing it and just letting themselves go because that I mean obviously carnival that&#039;s</div><div id="00:05:48.760" class="transcript_line"> what it&#039;s about it&#039;s expressing yourself through music and being somebody else maybe for that day</div><div id="00:05:57.880" class="transcript_line"> and if you can help them move within their costume to do that then that&#039;s</div><div id="00:06:02.440" class="transcript_line"> yeah that would be a good thing yeah I also have memories of almost collecting people</div><div id="00:06:06.600" class="transcript_line"> and it&#039;s it&#039;s that idea of yes there would be advertised a dance workshop would be going on</div><div id="00:06:12.440" class="transcript_line"> but actually that to me isn&#039;t part of what carnival&#039;s about it&#039;s not this separate thing</div><div id="00:06:16.600" class="transcript_line"> and so actually people would be in the space making joining some people would be dropping in</div><div id="00:06:20.760" class="transcript_line"> off of the street literally and all dropping out actually became part of it and it was it was almost</div><div id="00:06:26.040" class="transcript_line"> processional in the making you do they disappear they come back so yeah and again that&#039;s what&#039;s so</div><div id="00:06:32.040" class="transcript_line"> lovely about it it isn&#039;t about this advertised thing you come and you do this actually one minute</div><div id="00:06:37.560" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re making one minute you&#039;re joining in and yeah there&#039;s a fluidity about it well there was</div><div id="00:06:43.080" class="transcript_line"> we talk a lot about access and being inclusive it seems to be that bubble it you know had no</div><div id="00:06:48.120" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s no membrane for people to you know provided they could actually come through the door</div><div id="00:06:52.120" class="transcript_line"> yeah they were welcoming and it used to because on I think that&#039;s just it and it was all the mass</div><div id="00:06:58.360" class="transcript_line"> camps were in the summer and in those lovely moments when it is sunny in Cardiff I think it</div><div id="00:07:03.240" class="transcript_line"> used to spill out didn&#039;t it yeah it wasn&#039;t just it was spill outside yes yeah yeah but I&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:07:09.880" class="transcript_line"> memories as well as sometimes the workshops literally happening outside they did yeah yeah</div><div id="00:07:14.120" class="transcript_line"> I was especially when chap today was a lot outside and and it&#039;s and also the fact that you know</div><div id="00:07:19.480" class="transcript_line"> families would come together and let you get a family dancing especially I mean each kind of</div><div id="00:07:25.000" class="transcript_line"> was different because of the different people that took part in it but quite often there was</div><div id="00:07:28.680" class="transcript_line"> lots of that&#039;s what I enjoyed was the family sessions where you&#039;d have everybody have mum dad</div><div id="00:07:33.080" class="transcript_line"> grandma if you might be you never know granddad not many grand dads but you know you know but</div><div id="00:07:39.720" class="transcript_line"> everybody just having a go that&#039;s what I enjoyed about that&#039;s quite a lot of memories especially</div><div id="00:07:46.680" class="transcript_line"> when we had our children as well I was just about to say our children came around yeah yeah</div><div id="00:07:51.560" class="transcript_line"> because we had them yeah they were really young weren&#039;t they at that time and they used to get</div><div id="00:07:56.280" class="transcript_line"> I mean they still remember it now so they wake up screaming</div><div id="00:08:03.080" class="transcript_line"> no they do they do remember it and they always remember it oh you know remember I used to because</div><div id="00:08:08.520" class="transcript_line"> I always thought well am I dragging them along or they do they want to come along or it&#039;s mum</div><div id="00:08:12.760" class="transcript_line"> doing what she does and getting embarrassed by me and things like that but no they&#039;ve got really</div><div id="00:08:17.000" class="transcript_line"> positive memories and and I think um yeah definitely well for me and it also it forms part of my only</div><div id="00:08:23.960" class="transcript_line"> memories of their life yes it really does and because the first carnival I was in because I</div><div id="00:08:30.440" class="transcript_line"> was too attached to my children I Laurie was on my back in a in a holder so I danced the whole thing</div><div id="00:08:36.840" class="transcript_line"> and made me sorry can we get this now I um went away on holiday and then discovered I was pregnant</div><div id="00:08:43.000" class="transcript_line"> with Finn and then he came along to the next carnival and that&#039;s when Natasha looked at so</div><div id="00:08:48.440" class="transcript_line"> Natasha used to look after Finn because it was it wasn&#039;t just you know you were there all the time</div><div id="00:08:52.920" class="transcript_line"> you were there all the time so you&#039;d have someone to look after them or just to give an eye on them</div><div id="00:08:57.960" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;re doing your bit yeah we were looking at photographs recently because Laurie the one</div><div id="00:09:03.960" class="transcript_line"> that was on my back is now 22 and and he had remembered his experience and we were getting</div><div id="00:09:09.240" class="transcript_line"> out photographs to show his girlfriend and we found photographs of him with really long hair</div><div id="00:09:13.720" class="transcript_line"> and being a monkey did he have a red fez on no no some of the monkeys did yes no he didn&#039;t</div><div id="00:09:22.600" class="transcript_line"> no he didn&#039;t he had long blonde hair and a tail and a monkey face yeah yeah yeah so I was thinking</div><div id="00:09:30.280" class="transcript_line"> but it is but I think that&#039;s what Jane just said it isn&#039;t just about it&#039;s a whole family</div><div id="00:09:34.600" class="transcript_line"> experience and it is it connects with people and brings out something from I think I really do</div><div id="00:09:42.200" class="transcript_line"> the I mean obviously uh parading has been a constant over the past 25 years there&#039;s always</div><div id="00:09:48.280" class="transcript_line"> been a you know a parading element and the route has changed over the years and the staging again</div><div id="00:09:53.880" class="transcript_line"> has changed over the 25 years but we&#039;ve just watched a video looking at an ending which went</div><div id="00:10:01.960" class="transcript_line"> onto the haze for a bit of a party but that happened on the steps of the National Museum</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> of Wales before they put in the handrails which certainly facilitate access for those</div><div id="00:10:12.840" class="transcript_line"> with mobility problems but actually took away our stage from us um looking at the video I mean</div><div id="00:10:20.760" class="transcript_line"> the groups do look highly choreographed I mean you were clearly involved in all that I mean I can</div><div id="00:10:26.840" class="transcript_line"> remember you coming through coming on walkthroughs and the rest of it and we&#039;d be there certainly I</div><div id="00:10:31.480" class="transcript_line"> my mind&#039;s like the two of you were pointing and and sort of doing some steps up here and</div><div id="00:10:35.880" class="transcript_line"> on this podium well the following will be happening is it is this all true have I made it all up</div><div id="00:10:40.520" class="transcript_line"> I think there was a whole when we started there was a parading and then with it was a vision I</div><div id="00:10:46.440" class="transcript_line"> think of Amaru really thinking about this idea of having carnival theatre telling a story telling</div><div id="00:10:53.320" class="transcript_line"> a story and and I think that was part of it so you had the element which was moving around but</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> actually it was it was thinking about what what were those costumes about what was underlying</div><div id="00:11:03.800" class="transcript_line"> what message what what was the theme and underneath it and trying to to replicate that in a sort of a</div><div id="00:11:10.120" class="transcript_line"> theatre theatre context I suppose but yeah and to some extent it it worked and then to other</div><div id="00:11:18.360" class="transcript_line"> extents everything went into chaos so so I mean the idea so it was like so I don&#039;t know whether</div><div id="00:11:28.760" class="transcript_line"> we actually got to that point where it it sort of found a sort of a you know a space a happy</div><div id="00:11:37.240" class="transcript_line"> yeah happy middle ground and maybe maybe it&#039;s something still to be explored I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:11:43.560" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s interesting because Jane used the absolute word for me that something came out of the chaos</div><div id="00:11:49.720" class="transcript_line"> but and I actually think for us we have a picture in our head but not not a definite it wasn&#039;t about</div><div id="00:11:54.600" class="transcript_line"> people being having to be there and I think just in watching back actually is what I saw going on</div><div id="00:11:59.880" class="transcript_line"> there&#039;s a lot of connecting visually with people and then having that moment of dancing with them</div><div id="00:12:04.120" class="transcript_line"> and there was a very very loose structure and selfishly I kind of remember that I was doing a</div><div id="00:12:09.640" class="transcript_line"> water section and so we literally used that idea like you said earlier the fluidity will allow it</div><div id="00:12:14.840" class="transcript_line"> to be what it is and we had moments of spiralling like you know the idea of water and waves and</div><div id="00:12:20.520" class="transcript_line"> fall them back but I can remember the eco I definitely remember the eco mass because there</div><div id="00:12:25.320" class="transcript_line"> was that I think that&#039;s when it came in the height of putting together some kind of a story it was a</div><div id="00:12:30.840" class="transcript_line"> very complex story to it so I remember Amara had it in his head what it was going to be and I had</div><div id="00:12:36.520" class="transcript_line"> little snippets of it and then all of a sudden he said right Jane okay so we know what we&#039;re</div><div id="00:12:39.720" class="transcript_line"> going to do now I&#039;m going yes and he said because I&#039;m going to go on the stage now and drum so I had</div><div id="00:12:47.160" class="transcript_line"> no clue what was going on I had little snippets and then I&#039;m trying to herd people on and then</div><div id="00:12:52.280" class="transcript_line"> people coming off and then people going on and actually not wanting to leave the space so I think</div><div id="00:12:56.360" class="transcript_line"> oh there we are that&#039;s it that&#039;s where they are that&#039;s fine that&#039;s okay you didn&#039;t get out of</div><div id="00:12:59.800" class="transcript_line"> with and drive them off the steps or something no exactly because they were right in the zone</div><div id="00:13:04.120" class="transcript_line"> Amara was in the zone and everybody&#039;s in the zone so that was fine but the idea behind it the</div><div id="00:13:10.600" class="transcript_line"> actual story was very very and maybe that&#039;s okay then maybe that&#039;s just what it needs to be</div><div id="00:13:16.840" class="transcript_line"> you know it doesn&#039;t need to be any more than that so that I think that was the the most ambitious</div><div id="00:13:21.400" class="transcript_line"> one I&#039;m sure that was most ambitious one I want to think I&#039;m just trying to give some of the other</div><div id="00:13:25.240" class="transcript_line"> ones but that was when we had the stage as well didn&#039;t we we had the steps in the stage and we</div><div id="00:13:31.320" class="transcript_line"> had a flat back lorry because we wanted we needed to we needed to extend it because we were trying</div><div id="00:13:35.560" class="transcript_line"> harder to tell whether to be some received meaning yes yeah and I think you know I think it it works</div><div id="00:13:42.760" class="transcript_line"> I you know but but do you know it&#039;s your perception of what this thing would be we don&#039;t I just think</div><div id="00:13:48.760" class="transcript_line"> I think that was what&#039;s the main thing what what&#039;s the performance going to be like and I don&#039;t think</div><div id="00:13:53.720" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s about taking away the fact that there was a narrative there but actually the whole carnival is</div><div id="00:13:58.360" class="transcript_line"> visual is a spectacle and people watching they make up their own stories and actually as a</div><div id="00:14:03.240" class="transcript_line"> participant in it you make up your own story and especially when you&#039;re in that moment you really</div><div id="00:14:07.800" class="transcript_line"> do yes I&#039;ve got to say that takes me off on another journey we were really lucky to do workshops with</div><div id="00:14:14.200" class="transcript_line"> that guy from Billy&#039;s yes and well I will not even say workshops we were kind of experiences I think</div><div id="00:14:20.440" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s the first time I felt like I was in a trance totally hypnotized because I think we danced in a</div><div id="00:14:25.080" class="transcript_line"> room non-stop for about three hours and yes it was here it was yeah and I actually came out of it</div><div id="00:14:31.160" class="transcript_line"> and felt like I had been transported into another space and it was amazing and and that is almost</div><div id="00:14:37.000" class="transcript_line"> something I wanted to be able to share with people allow yourself just to just to be there</div><div id="00:14:41.560" class="transcript_line"> and we&#039;ve been using I&#039;ve been using it ever since all that material I&#039;ve been using ever since all</div><div id="00:14:46.120" class="transcript_line"> that sort of those traditions the those things he imparted on us which was to do with the music as</div><div id="00:14:51.480" class="transcript_line"> well in the rhythms and and yes no that was an that was a really and I don&#039;t do this easily but</div><div id="00:14:57.080" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s actually getting in touch with your spiritual self and you did he did we were allowed to do that</div><div id="00:15:02.040" class="transcript_line"> in that moment and yeah transcending moment there we are if you had a I mean obviously it&#039;s a visual</div><div id="00:15:11.480" class="transcript_line"> feast carnival but if you had to pick your most striking costume may not be one that you wore</div><div id="00:15:20.120" class="transcript_line"> yourself may not even be one that you well you probably wrapped everything when you were there</div><div id="00:15:24.920" class="transcript_line"> what can yes what have you just come to your mind going down the street I mean oh going down the</div><div id="00:15:31.400" class="transcript_line"> street I the one that I really remember is when there was the opening for the world cup</div><div id="00:15:38.200" class="transcript_line"> that was I it was yeah I I just was there and there was all these people from different countries</div><div id="00:15:44.840" class="transcript_line"> or it was a South Africa and different places it was Argentina was the first one wasn&#039;t it</div><div id="00:15:49.800" class="transcript_line"> but there was lots of people there on the side I just remember just going dancing with was I what</div><div id="00:15:55.240" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t remember what I was wearing a load of daffodils yeah when we woke up we were going to be</div><div id="00:15:59.640" class="transcript_line"> loaded daffodils yeah there&#039;s bound to be that yeah yeah no no I think we were trying to side with subvert</div><div id="00:16:05.080" class="transcript_line"> stereotypes I hasten to act you know that was our plan but we were all coming down and just seeing</div><div id="00:16:09.560" class="transcript_line"> everybody coming down because as you came down past the castle there&#039;s a slight slope isn&#039;t there</div><div id="00:16:15.640" class="transcript_line"> and you could see everybody in front of you and everybody behind you you could just see everything</div><div id="00:16:19.480" class="transcript_line"> and it was just quite impressive I thought I thought that was a really strong memory most</div><div id="00:16:25.480" class="transcript_line"> definitely just because you know different audience is the dancing daft I think was in red actually</div><div id="00:16:35.400" class="transcript_line"> ah I know the picture of which you speak yes styrofoam yeah I think there&#039;s also something</div><div id="00:16:43.400" class="transcript_line"> about the scale though because there are there were some beautiful magnificent huge costumes</div><div id="00:16:48.680" class="transcript_line"> and to a certain extent actually the costume was the choreography of it because actually the person</div><div id="00:16:52.920" class="transcript_line"> within it just had to shift this thing along the street but then you had the contrast of the people</div><div id="00:16:57.320" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re talking about earlier they&#039;re just body painted and actually that allowed for the freedom</div><div id="00:17:01.320" class="transcript_line"> of movement so it&#039;s just exactly it&#039;s almost like that they became the dancing costume themselves</div><div id="00:17:06.360" class="transcript_line"> and for me that&#039;s one of the strong memories actually yes yeah different kind of traditions</div><div id="00:17:12.040" class="transcript_line"> different different points of access different points of ways of expressing yourself really I</div><div id="00:17:16.120" class="transcript_line"> suppose variety it&#039;s got to be good it&#039;s got to be good I think the other the other memories is</div><div id="00:17:20.120" class="transcript_line"> is and that must be the same year in Swansea yeah the very first Swansea that was very special</div><div id="00:17:27.800" class="transcript_line"> I think it&#039;s special because of the place I don&#039;t know it just um yeah that was very special I think</div><div id="00:17:35.400" class="transcript_line"> it was very good that one yeah very uh I can&#039;t put my finger on why it was because it opened the door</div><div id="00:17:42.440" class="transcript_line"> in Swansea I think probably probably they&#039;ve been dying out for some kind of public celebration</div><div id="00:17:47.240" class="transcript_line"> you know we showed them what they were capable of so enthusiastic they were so</div><div id="00:17:52.200" class="transcript_line"> open to everything and and uh yeah that was great</div><div id="00:18:01.320" class="transcript_line"> can I thank you both for your contribution those years ago and your eloquence now Sally and Jane</div><div id="00:18:07.880" class="transcript_line"> thank you very much indeed</div></div></p>
