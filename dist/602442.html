    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> How&#039;s that working? Can you tell me your name, just for the purposes of the recording?</div><div id="00:00:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, Gareth Jones.</div><div id="00:00:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And are you from Swansea, Gareth?</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;m from Morriston, Bournemouth.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So you grew up here, and when did you first go to a football match?</div><div id="00:00:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I think I was in my twenties, because I was working in town, and I finished at midday on a Saturday, so it was a kind of ritual.</div><div id="00:00:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I met some mates and made some prasada, do you remember the prasada? Are you from Swansea?</div><div id="00:00:53.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not from Swansea, but where was that then? A pub, I presume?</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, by the castle, there&#039;s a green patch of grass to the right of the castle, and that&#039;s where the pub was, prasada.</div><div id="00:01:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Right by the old Eden &amp; Post building.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we&#039;d go down to the Wretch or St Helens.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Either or, you would go to whoever was playing.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Because virtually one was home one week, and the other one the other week.</div><div id="00:01:31.000" class="transcript_line"> So whichever was at home.</div><div id="00:01:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We had no drafts, and it was very rare they were home the same day anyway.</div><div id="00:01:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So it would normally be like that every other week.</div><div id="00:01:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go back to my mates then, to eat again, and then go down to Mumford Street with us.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a busy Saturday.</div><div id="00:01:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a busy Saturday.</div><div id="00:01:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry, can I ask you how old you are?</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m seventy-six.</div><div id="00:02:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Seventy-six, right, so you didn&#039;t go when you were a child then?</div><div id="00:02:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a child.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Not when you were a grown-up?</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I was in my twenties.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I was in my twenties.</div><div id="00:02:22.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to go there.</div><div id="00:02:24.000" class="transcript_line"> So that would have been, I can&#039;t word that out, in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:02:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Fifty years ago, was it?</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, in the 1960s.</div><div id="00:02:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, sorry, I can&#039;t word that out.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t word it.</div><div id="00:02:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, when were you born?</div><div id="00:02:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in 1936.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So it would have been around the beginning of the 1960s.</div><div id="00:02:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:02:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And so was it more just like to go and watch a bit of sport rather than particularly the football or particularly the rugby?</div><div id="00:03:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you have a preference?</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always had a preference for rugby.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right.</div><div id="00:03:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, particularly now when people are playing football, I don&#039;t know what to call it.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m overpaid and...</div><div id="00:03:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Overpaid.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:03:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t do that.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t like it.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I did watch the Spanish game, the final.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the only one I watched.</div><div id="00:03:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was a good game.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> They were playing just like Swansea.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> They were.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Tim told you that there&#039;s a man here who used to play for us once?</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, but he&#039;s had a stroke.</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s had a stroke, yeah, and he can&#039;t really...</div><div id="00:04:00.000" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;d be very excited that you were there.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I was ashamed, but I understand we couldn&#039;t really talk to him.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Trying to remember the players around about things.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I go out yet, and then out yet.</div><div id="00:04:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, again, because they either had been away and come back again.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, right.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Towards the end of his career.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And...</div><div id="00:04:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Jones, there&#039;s a Jones boy, Jones, in the wing.</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Barry, Barry Jones.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Barry.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Cliff.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Cliff Jones.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, he was another international.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course the Swans had the best schoolboy team.</div><div id="00:04:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Indeed, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> They were excellent.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> They were, it was really good.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And they came up through the ranks then, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> No, they had even back into the 1930s, they had schoolboy teams that won the cup, you know, for the whole country.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s a centre forward called Trevor Ford.</div><div id="00:05:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, he was a good local boy.</div><div id="00:05:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, he brought many in there, I think.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> He would just let it go in, otherwise he&#039;d go in with it.</div><div id="00:05:25.000" class="transcript_line"> I think there is a, I think I read a story about that, that he scored and the referee didn&#039;t give it, and he made them come and look, there was actually a hole in the net.</div><div id="00:05:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a...</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Which was good for...</div><div id="00:05:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He was very famous.</div><div id="00:05:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m trying to remember some defenders.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t quite remember.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been reading about them but I can&#039;t remember them all.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:55.000" class="transcript_line"> So then, but did you carry on going there?</div><div id="00:05:59.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I...</div><div id="00:06:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I stopped going to both actually when I got married.</div><div id="00:06:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I got married in 66.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Right, so...</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And I didn&#039;t bother.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> And not only that, I just realised now, the company I was working for, I was a travel agent.</div><div id="00:06:24.000" class="transcript_line"> They started opening all day Saturday.</div><div id="00:06:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, so that was it.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> To now the naps.</div><div id="00:06:33.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve been down the stadium.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The new one?</div><div id="00:06:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you go, because Tipper was saying he took a group of people down there, or have you been on the...</div><div id="00:06:48.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;ve been down, yeah, I&#039;ve just had to pluck up courage, you know, I&#039;m starting to get myself, pull myself together, it&#039;s a quite fascinating time.</div><div id="00:06:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going out tomorrow with my steps and I&#039;m coming over from Florida to see me, you know.</div><div id="00:07:07.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;m going down to Mumbles.</div><div id="00:07:10.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to be living only my second time out.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:07:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:15.000" class="transcript_line"> You wouldn&#039;t be drinking quite as much as...</div><div id="00:07:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Quite as much, but I like it.</div><div id="00:07:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Not when you were 20.</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> I got one there.</div><div id="00:07:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I like that.</div><div id="00:07:22.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s my lunchtime...</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Perotif, is it, Igor?</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Excellent.</div><div id="00:07:27.000" class="transcript_line"> I stopped after that, so I was very short-lived in the vegetable.</div><div id="00:07:34.000" class="transcript_line"> We all was under the double decker.</div><div id="00:07:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Ah, right, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was a beautiful, well, it wasn&#039;t a beautiful stand, but everybody there in the vegetable did.</div><div id="00:07:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know, it was a...</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it was very, very swish and new when they built it in 1927.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> It was quite modern.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> We were just under it, just under it to the right, so we could see the goal, the slide down there.</div><div id="00:08:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Right.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So many a goal going there.</div><div id="00:08:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Didn&#039;t the away supporters go up that end as well?</div><div id="00:08:21.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I think the away supporters were on the...</div><div id="00:08:27.000" class="transcript_line"> On the little...</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What do you think about that?</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> The towel end.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, of course they built a stand there after I left, so I think a lot of them were put in there.</div><div id="00:08:39.000" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t be sure about that.</div><div id="00:08:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, they...</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I think Leighton, yeah, I think they used to...</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I can&#039;t remember, I used to go down there in the 1980s, but I think they built that stand at the towel end.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right, that would have been called the North Stand.</div><div id="00:08:58.000" class="transcript_line"> The North Bank was the main home, terrace was there all along that one side.</div><div id="00:09:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And there was a little bank at one end, the town, the bus station.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> The end behind one end, that&#039;s right, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they double-decked it.</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I&#039;d stopped going a long time before that, so I can&#039;t be sure.</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was...</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a long time ago that I saw a football match, a live football match.</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, so you said you&#039;d been to the stadium, but just to have a look.</div><div id="00:09:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I was just going to see Robbie.</div><div id="00:09:32.000" class="transcript_line"> I have come here to see the...</div><div id="00:09:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I am a rugby man.</div><div id="00:09:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And I went with my sister and family there to season tickets.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, right, right.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> He and my mother, some of us couldn&#039;t go either, through the streets kind of.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but was it a bit... because the Swans, I mean the Whites still play at St Helens.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> The Whites still play at St Helens, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they are not quite at the same standard.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> No, no.</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And Neath, of course, they still got a side.</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So... and that&#039;s in Neath.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And they all got...</div><div id="00:10:17.000" class="transcript_line"> The north.</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> The north, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> But did... I mean, now you&#039;ve seen... I know it&#039;s not quite as thing...</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I was a bit more interested in the football,</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> but interested to know what you think about watching any game up at the Liberty,</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> say compared to St Helens or the...</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I think the Liberty is a fine stadium.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you prefer it, do you think?</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, absolutely.</div><div id="00:10:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And the pitch was brilliant.</div><div id="00:10:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I mean, it&#039;s great.</div><div id="00:10:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah. It&#039;s the same at the end of the season, is it?</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Or was it the beginning of the season, kind of?</div><div id="00:10:53.000" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no... because the... I mean, people...</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, especially the Vetch people look...</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s quite nostalgic, the vision of it, but it was pretty scrubby.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I thought this dude would be knocked down.</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> It has been. It&#039;s gone now.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Has it gone?</div><div id="00:11:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it&#039;s an empty space.</div><div id="00:11:09.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been left in circulation for the last six, eight months.</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s... it&#039;s finally been demolished.</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Right. And they put in hoses and screws and...</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s nothing...
