    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I see that Jerry Journey is heading up here already to tell us something about remembering</div><div id="00:00:07.440" class="transcript_line"> Seattlean poetry and also Jennifer Nightingale is going to get help too.</div><div id="00:00:14.120" class="transcript_line"> Say, how do you do?</div><div id="00:00:24.680" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a great honor to be here.</div><div id="00:00:27.760" class="transcript_line"> I was supposed to be a bar.</div><div id="00:00:29.280" class="transcript_line"> This was supposed to be Calling of the Bards, at which my name was not supposed to be in</div><div id="00:00:33.600" class="transcript_line"> here.</div><div id="00:00:34.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m very flattered that it was though because I&#039;m always referred to as Bron Journey&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:38.960" class="transcript_line"> dad or Betty Pritchard&#039;s dad sometimes, but Betty Pritchard&#039;s husband most of the time,</div><div id="00:00:46.200" class="transcript_line"> but I have been accused of being her father.</div><div id="00:00:48.600" class="transcript_line"> Two reasons, she&#039;s got hair and I haven&#039;t and hers is not gray and mine is.</div><div id="00:00:55.240" class="transcript_line"> But at any rate, that was my attempt at being humorous.</div><div id="00:00:59.120" class="transcript_line"> I should let Bron tell the jokes, but by your laughter you must be Presbyterians who don&#039;t</div><div id="00:01:05.160" class="transcript_line"> really think very much is funny or you could be Baptists who don&#039;t think anything is funny.</div><div id="00:01:11.800" class="transcript_line"> But at least the General Assembly of regular Baptists, Methodists however, they politely</div><div id="00:01:19.080" class="transcript_line"> laugh even if they don&#039;t think it&#039;s funny and Baptists don&#039;t laugh even if they think</div><div id="00:01:25.000" class="transcript_line"> it.</div><div id="00:01:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m getting so deep in here and my wife said, do not bring up anything controversial.</div><div id="00:01:30.440" class="transcript_line"> So I better go.</div><div id="00:01:31.440" class="transcript_line"> Now, what I&#039;m going to do, Mrs. or Ms. or Jackie Cederholm has given me an allocation</div><div id="00:01:39.400" class="transcript_line"> of five minutes to not say my poem necessarily, but my wife has spent three weeks, well she</div><div id="00:01:47.200" class="transcript_line"> spent three days in historical events around the Old Wells Church.</div><div id="00:01:53.560" class="transcript_line"> The three weeks has been spent in my typing it.</div><div id="00:01:57.440" class="transcript_line"> So I think I would like to read what she wrote and then maybe I can get your assistance because</div><div id="00:02:05.920" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I can do this in five minutes.</div><div id="00:02:08.840" class="transcript_line"> So to keep me from watching my watch, would you please watch your watches and when five</div><div id="00:02:14.840" class="transcript_line"> minutes are up, get up and tell Mrs. Cederholm and she will jump up and say, kajda gegg,</div><div id="00:02:21.040" class="transcript_line"> which means in Welsh, please be quiet or a more literal translation would be shut up</div><div id="00:02:26.600" class="transcript_line"> and sit down and that&#039;s what I&#039;ll do and then I&#039;ll steal away and we can forget that poem.</div><div id="00:02:31.360" class="transcript_line"> But if I can, anyway, I&#039;ve used the five minutes on this preamble.</div><div id="00:02:37.600" class="transcript_line"> So at any rate, my wife wrote this and she was in the Welsh Church for 25 years of her</div><div id="00:02:43.560" class="transcript_line"> first 25 years of her life and this is her memories.</div><div id="00:02:49.160" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s titled Memories of the Welsh in Seattle.</div><div id="00:02:51.600" class="transcript_line"> I am not a public speaker and she thinks I am.</div><div id="00:02:54.560" class="transcript_line"> So take three seconds.</div><div id="00:02:55.920" class="transcript_line"> I am not a public speaker but my husband agreed to deliver this talk if I would jot down some</div><div id="00:03:01.240" class="transcript_line"> of my fond memories of the Welsh times.</div><div id="00:03:04.320" class="transcript_line"> Once I heard a friend give a talk and she too was uncomfortable speaking publicly and</div><div id="00:03:09.160" class="transcript_line"> she used the alphabet as a guide.</div><div id="00:03:11.400" class="transcript_line"> It worked for her so I will do the same using as many letters as time will permit.</div><div id="00:03:16.960" class="transcript_line"> A stands for Anwyl, which is a word of endearment.</div><div id="00:03:21.760" class="transcript_line"> I like the definition beloved because 10th and East John was the home of the Welsh Presbyterian</div><div id="00:03:27.200" class="transcript_line"> Church, a beloved place to many Welsh that came from near and far.</div><div id="00:03:32.320" class="transcript_line"> B is for Bible because the small band of people truly believed in the word of God and their</div><div id="00:03:38.440" class="transcript_line"> faith took them through the many hardships that occurred in that time in history.</div><div id="00:03:43.680" class="transcript_line"> C is for Cymru or Cymraeg.</div><div id="00:03:46.920" class="transcript_line"> They spoke Welsh, they prayed in Welsh, they preached in Welsh, sang in Welsh and they</div><div id="00:03:53.280" class="transcript_line"> settled here because the climate and countryside reminded them of their home in Welsh called</div><div id="00:04:00.920" class="transcript_line"> Cartref.</div><div id="00:04:02.440" class="transcript_line"> C also stands for Celebrity.</div><div id="00:04:04.880" class="transcript_line"> We had our share of those.</div><div id="00:04:06.640" class="transcript_line"> Frances Williams, with the help of her Welsh Church family, went to New York City to become</div><div id="00:04:11.080" class="transcript_line"> an arranger and composer for the Harold Flammer Music Publishing Company.</div><div id="00:04:16.440" class="transcript_line"> The tutor, known as Ted Jones, is a nationally acclaimed hydroplane designer and driver and</div><div id="00:04:22.520" class="transcript_line"> is still involved in his field.</div><div id="00:04:25.200" class="transcript_line"> Arthur and Jane Davis pursued a successful career in the singing and acting on the stage</div><div id="00:04:29.960" class="transcript_line"> of theaters and opera in New York City.</div><div id="00:04:33.480" class="transcript_line"> Betty Lee Watson became a champion swimmer and she was trained by Ray Daughters, one</div><div id="00:04:39.520" class="transcript_line"> of the great swimming coaches in the United States of America.</div><div id="00:04:43.440" class="transcript_line"> She even got in contests, swimming contests with Helene Madison and Beter on several occasions</div><div id="00:04:50.200" class="transcript_line"> and she was the greatest women swimmer in that era in the United States.</div><div id="00:04:58.080" class="transcript_line"> So anyway, that was the celebrities that came from that little church, which the whole church</div><div id="00:05:01.720" class="transcript_line"> was about one half the size of this.</div><div id="00:05:04.840" class="transcript_line"> D reminds me of Mrs. George Davies, who lived in the Antique Chapel, which means church</div><div id="00:05:11.960" class="transcript_line"> along with her daughter, Gwen, and Emlyn, her son.</div><div id="00:05:14.560" class="transcript_line"> Mrs. Davies made real Welsh tea, hot and flavorful.</div><div id="00:05:18.200" class="transcript_line"> I can attest to that.</div><div id="00:05:19.200" class="transcript_line"> Boy, was that good tea.</div><div id="00:05:20.800" class="transcript_line"> E stands for eglois, which means church.</div><div id="00:05:25.720" class="transcript_line"> This place was the center of their spiritual and social life.</div><div id="00:05:28.920" class="transcript_line"> My Sunday school class met in the first two rows of the sanctuary and Mrs. T.C. Williams</div><div id="00:05:35.360" class="transcript_line"> was our teacher.</div><div id="00:05:36.720" class="transcript_line"> Other classes were held in the sanctuary as well as the entire church.</div><div id="00:05:41.260" class="transcript_line"> We had prayer meetings, choir practice, as well as Gmanbaganys and the first of marches,</div><div id="00:05:46.640" class="transcript_line"> as this is, St. David&#039;s Day celebrations, unsurpassed anywhere, plus church dinners</div><div id="00:05:52.100" class="transcript_line"> and small and great istead beds, where my mom&#039;s barabrith almost always took first prize.</div><div id="00:05:59.100" class="transcript_line"> F stands for fighenu, which means disguised or barred name.</div><div id="00:06:09.660" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I&#039;m supposed to be, a bard.</div><div id="00:06:11.900" class="transcript_line"> But this poem, compared to these great bards, is pretty much like my poem compared to Longfellow&#039;s.</div><div id="00:06:20.980" class="transcript_line"> These people were very excellent.</div><div id="00:06:22.460" class="transcript_line"> At any rate, not that I could understand them, they were all in Welsh.</div><div id="00:06:26.700" class="transcript_line"> The bards sent their poverty from afar, such as Olin Hughes.</div><div id="00:06:30.960" class="transcript_line"> Bard name was Glasgowite from Vancouver, B.C.</div><div id="00:06:34.900" class="transcript_line"> Richard Morris, Kyriag bard name, from Seldovia, Alaska, and our version, our very own bard,</div><div id="00:06:42.340" class="transcript_line"> T.
