    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> I only found out probably less than a year ago. It&#039;s normally referred to in the</div><div id="00:00:12.600" class="transcript_line"> National Fruit Collection is called Channel Beauty. I don&#039;t know much about it.</div><div id="00:00:18.120" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s in the National Fruit Collection and you can buy wood</div><div id="00:00:22.360" class="transcript_line"> off them. I think it was bred by someone and they have his date about the</div><div id="00:00:28.760" class="transcript_line"> 1920s I think but you could easily find that out. It&#039;s a Cox seedling I believe.</div><div id="00:00:35.720" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s really that&#039;s all I know. Channel Beauty. That probably becomes let&#039;s say</div><div id="00:00:41.520" class="transcript_line"> the official name but a lot of varieties have lots of pseudonyms,</div><div id="00:00:48.680" class="transcript_line"> different names. Some of them will have a hundred different names. When and where</div><div id="00:00:53.800" class="transcript_line"> is it called? Gower? I don&#039;t know. I know what it looks like. The tree that I grow,</div><div id="00:00:59.320" class="transcript_line"> these ones are quite small. Pale yellow, long stalk. It&#039;s striped and splashed</div><div id="00:01:07.920" class="transcript_line"> with red splash. This means you&#039;re doing that with the Bainbrush.</div><div id="00:01:13.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s sort of crisp, juicy, obvious and it&#039;s got sort of an aromatic taste like Cox does.</div><div id="00:01:23.480" class="transcript_line"> Quite a brisk, clean flavour and I think it was bred by whoever it was as a Cox seedling</div><div id="00:01:31.800" class="transcript_line"> or it might have been a Cox pit plant. I can&#039;t remember but all that stuff is easy to find.</div><div id="00:01:38.360" class="transcript_line"> In fact on the label of my label for Channel Beauty there&#039;s a picture of Mumbles pear with</div><div id="00:01:48.040" class="transcript_line"> I think a Swansea Beauty stood outside. I was hoping for one in the bikini or something</div><div id="00:01:53.720" class="transcript_line"> but I can&#039;t remember now whether I&#039;ve got one in the end. Sort of thing you&#039;ll get outside of</div><div id="00:01:58.760" class="transcript_line"> pier so I went and spent a lot of time on Google Images. The other half of the label is the National</div><div id="00:02:05.960" class="transcript_line"> Fruit Collection picture which is a standard thing. Six views of the apple which will be</div><div id="00:02:15.800" class="transcript_line"> the apple with stalk cut in half up and down, cut in half on the equator. A view from the top,</div><div id="00:02:24.040" class="transcript_line"> a view from the bottom. For a full description, taste and seasonality, flowering times, it&#039;s all</div><div id="00:02:31.240" class="transcript_line"> on the national records. It&#039;s in the National Fruit Collection and will stay there presumably forever.</div></div></p>
