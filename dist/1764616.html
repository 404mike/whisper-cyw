    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> In a second, should say, there we go, we&#039;re recording now. Where are you at the moment?</div><div id="00:00:07.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m at home.</div><div id="00:00:08.720" class="transcript_line"> Okay, so I&#039;m going to ask you to introduce yourself. I&#039;ll introduce myself and say today&#039;s</div><div id="00:00:14.600" class="transcript_line"> date and then we&#039;ll just get going. Is that okay?</div><div id="00:00:18.360" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:00:19.360" class="transcript_line"> Bear with me one second. I realize I&#039;ve lost something that&#039;s got some of the things that</div><div id="00:00:24.120" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re going to talk about. I&#039;ve got so many screens open, I can&#039;t find anything.</div><div id="00:00:37.640" class="transcript_line"> Lovely.</div><div id="00:00:38.640" class="transcript_line"> There we go. So today is Monday the 26th of October 2020 and my name is Paul Hunt. Could</div><div id="00:00:49.400" class="transcript_line"> you introduce yourself please?</div><div id="00:00:51.520" class="transcript_line"> Hi, I&#039;m Rhiannon. That&#039;s it, my name is Rhiannon. Hello.</div><div id="00:01:02.920" class="transcript_line"> So Rhiannon, you spoke to Anna before, didn&#039;t you, about just friendships and relationships</div><div id="00:01:08.680" class="transcript_line"> in general?</div><div id="00:01:09.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I did.</div><div id="00:01:12.080" class="transcript_line"> And how have things been on that front, ignoring, I suppose, Covid and lockdown for now, but</div><div id="00:01:20.080" class="transcript_line"> how did you find it up to March? Any developments?</div><div id="00:01:24.200" class="transcript_line"> Yes, there have been quite a lot of developments, although I was doing online dating, which</div><div id="00:01:37.640" class="transcript_line"> At first I didn&#039;t think it was very successful, but now I&#039;ve met someone and we&#039;ve been together</div><div id="00:01:52.960" class="transcript_line"> for 11 months, so it&#039;s been really good.</div><div id="00:01:57.760" class="transcript_line"> Wow.</div><div id="00:01:58.760" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s been the first time for a long time that I&#039;ve actually been in a good place.</div><div id="00:02:06.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s nice to hear. So are you comfortable talking about them?</div><div id="00:02:12.520" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I am.</div><div id="00:02:14.000" class="transcript_line"> So what&#039;s their name?</div><div id="00:02:17.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, his name is Andy. Obviously, as I said before, we&#039;ve been talking online and we got</div><div id="00:02:27.880" class="transcript_line"> together at the end of last year, which has been great because the company&#039;s been great,</div><div id="00:02:39.160" class="transcript_line"> the conversation&#039;s been flowing very well and it&#039;s a good place that I&#039;m in right now.</div><div id="00:02:50.440" class="transcript_line"> And where does Andy live?</div><div id="00:02:53.480" class="transcript_line"> He lives up in the valleys.</div><div id="00:03:01.080" class="transcript_line"> Do you know which valley?</div><div id="00:03:03.080" class="transcript_line"> Marseille-Cama.</div><div id="00:03:06.040" class="transcript_line"> Oh, OK. We know, yeah, I know.</div><div id="00:03:08.040" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s up there somewhere. But we keep in touch every day. We message each other every day and we</div><div id="00:03:18.280" class="transcript_line"> video call sometimes, which is good.</div><div id="00:03:24.760" class="transcript_line"> And so were you able to meet him before everything kicked off in person?</div><div id="00:03:29.880" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely. We met each other twice before the whole lockdown started happening.</div><div id="00:03:39.880" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s been really good. I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d find that person because I didn&#039;t think</div><div id="00:03:51.800" class="transcript_line"> relationships would happen in my life. But now that I&#039;ve found love, it&#039;s the best thing</div><div id="00:04:01.160" class="transcript_line"> that&#039;s ever happened. I&#039;ve never been so happy.</div><div id="00:04:05.720" class="transcript_line"> So who made the first contact?</div><div id="00:04:11.800" class="transcript_line"> I made the first contact and then I didn&#039;t hear from him for a while. And then I messaged him again</div><div id="00:04:25.960" class="transcript_line"> and it went on from then. So, yeah, it took a bit of persuading because I don&#039;t give up a fight.</div><div id="00:04:41.560" class="transcript_line"> What attracted you to Andy?</div><div id="00:04:43.160" class="transcript_line"> Personality, humour, which also is very important.</div><div id="00:04:53.400" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s always up for doing new things, like going out, going places.</div><div id="00:05:04.440" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;s actually made me push the boat out and made me do a lot more.</div><div id="00:05:09.800" class="transcript_line"> And I feel a lot more confident in myself.</div><div id="00:05:13.160" class="transcript_line"> What kind of things has he pushed you to do?</div><div id="00:05:17.480" class="transcript_line"> Going to Cardiff. He&#039;s actually, I wouldn&#039;t say made me, but he&#039;s given me the opportunity to</div><div id="00:05:31.720" class="transcript_line"> have the confidence to go out more, to go to new places.</div><div id="00:05:48.280" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;s made me feel very relaxed as well.</div><div id="00:05:52.920" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember the first time that you met him in person?</div><div id="00:05:55.720" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we went to a pub when the Six Nations was on last year.</div><div id="00:06:07.880" class="transcript_line"> And we ended up going to a pub watching the game in a pub and then having a few drinks and then</div><div id="00:06:16.440" class="transcript_line"> going somewhere else for food and watching the rest of the game. So that was the first of many,</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> which was really good.</div><div id="00:06:34.200" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel on the day before you met him?</div><div id="00:06:38.200" class="transcript_line"> I felt very nervous because I didn&#039;t know what to expect. I didn&#039;t know what to do.</div><div id="00:06:42.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d never been on a real date, if you could say that, because I&#039;ve never had</div><div id="00:06:58.760" class="transcript_line"> proper relationships or I would say friendships, but that&#039;s a different story. But</div><div id="00:07:07.160" class="transcript_line"> having a relationship is the best thing that can happen to me right now. And what&#039;s the best part</div><div id="00:07:18.440" class="transcript_line"> is that my whole family like him as well. So at least I&#039;ve done something good.</div><div id="00:07:25.160" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask what do your family make of him?</div><div id="00:07:27.880" class="transcript_line"> They like him a lot. I think they feel comfortable around him and he&#039;s a good love as well.</div><div id="00:07:43.960" class="transcript_line"> He is sometimes very quiet, but once you get to know him, he does start to</div><div id="00:07:52.040" class="transcript_line"> talk a lot, which I&#039;m liking a lot. I&#039;m happy to introduce him to all my friends and family</div><div id="00:08:02.360" class="transcript_line"> so they know that I&#039;m at last as happy as Larry.</div><div id="00:08:12.920" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve talked before, obviously, you&#039;ve mentioned before some mental health issues and</div><div id="00:08:20.600" class="transcript_line"> the fact that you have a learning disability. Does he have a learning disability?</div><div id="00:08:28.760" class="transcript_line"> Not that I can see or I&#039;m aware of. He does look after me really well,</div><div id="00:08:39.480" class="transcript_line"> which is good. We look after each other. It&#039;s actually good to have, if I can say it,</div><div id="00:08:50.840" class="transcript_line"> an ordinary normal relationship and not having to be watched by someone else just to check that</div><div id="00:09:05.800" class="transcript_line"> we&#039;re doing okay and we&#039;re keeping safe and stuff.</div><div id="00:09:12.280" class="transcript_line"> Has that happened to you before? Are you thinking of instances that happened before</div><div id="00:09:16.600" class="transcript_line"> or do you think that would happen if he had a learning disability?</div><div id="00:09:20.200" class="transcript_line"> I think it would happen if I did go out with someone who did have a learning disability,</div><div id="00:09:27.320" class="transcript_line"> that it would be monitored on a regular basis because I don&#039;t class myself as having a learning</div><div id="00:09:39.080" class="transcript_line"> disability. As I said before, in a lot of my things that I&#039;ve done, I sit on the fence with</div><div id="00:09:51.480" class="transcript_line"> with disability because I can do what everyone else does. I can go out on my own. I can</div><div id="00:10:01.960" class="transcript_line"> live independently and I don&#039;t have to have someone watch me 24-7.</div><div id="00:10:16.120" class="transcript_line"> Can you talk about what you have in common?</div><div id="00:10:18.520" class="transcript_line"> We like sports. He likes rugby and he&#039;s very into his cars, which is great.</div><div id="00:10:34.840" class="transcript_line"> We like going to the cinema together. We&#039;ve been going a lot</div><div id="00:10:41.080" class="transcript_line"> a lot lately to the cinema to watch a film, which is great. We like going out for food</div><div id="00:10:54.360" class="transcript_line"> and I think that&#039;s about it.</div><div id="00:11:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Next thing I&#039;m going to talk about is whether you&#039;re comfortable talking about it or not.</div><div id="00:11:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Completely up to you. If you think I don&#039;t want to talk about that, that&#039;s fine.</div><div id="00:11:10.760" class="transcript_line"> Is there a physical aspect to your relationship with Andy?</div><div id="00:11:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Sometimes there is, but not always.</div><div id="00:11:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Did you ask anyone for advice or support around that?</div><div id="00:11:23.480" class="transcript_line"> I didn&#039;t know how to approach the subject, but I speak to my best friend back home.</div><div id="00:11:42.680" class="transcript_line"> I try and catch up with her when I can about how things are going and</div><div id="00:11:57.960" class="transcript_line"> what stuff that she can recommend to do or not to do. At least she&#039;s on hand at that.</div><div id="00:12:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think I would be very comfortable approaching my mum and dad about this.</div><div id="00:12:20.760" class="transcript_line"> They probably think that I&#039;m not being careful, if that makes sense.</div><div id="00:12:29.800" class="transcript_line"> My dad beforehand, before I got into a relationship, was saying to me,</div><div id="00:12:41.480" class="transcript_line"> when are you going to settle down, find a boyfriend and settle down and start a family?</div><div id="00:12:50.440" class="transcript_line"> I hope you&#039;re being really careful. It&#039;s a different side now that I&#039;m in a relationship.</div><div id="00:13:05.720" class="transcript_line"> I suppose we&#039;ll only have to cross that bridge when we come to it.</div><div id="00:13:10.280" class="transcript_line"> Is it something you&#039;ve talked to Andy about?</div><div id="00:13:13.320" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we have. Not too much, but it has been on the cards sometimes when it comes up into conversation.</div><div id="00:13:30.840" class="transcript_line"> You say you spoke to your friend about things and obviously you didn&#039;t feel comfortable</div><div id="00:13:34.440" class="transcript_line"> talking to your parents. Do you think your parents see you differently now?</div><div id="00:13:41.080" class="transcript_line"> Yes, they can see how happy I am and how confident I am in myself as well.</div><div id="00:13:53.320" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m finding that as well. I&#039;m finding it more pleasurable going out to places that I wouldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:14:02.280" class="transcript_line"> dream of going. That&#039;s given me a big boost, if that makes sense.</div><div id="00:14:13.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it does. Thinking then of the last seven and a half months,</div><div id="00:14:22.680" class="transcript_line"> how have you found this period in time?</div><div id="00:14:25.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s very difficult. Not seeing friends or family or all going out.</div><div id="00:14:39.160" class="transcript_line"> Being stuck home all day every day is giving me cabin fever.</div><div id="00:14:49.480" class="transcript_line"> Could you just say if you live on your own or with other people?</div><div id="00:14:53.880" class="transcript_line"> I do live with my boyfriend at the moment.</div><div id="00:14:58.680" class="transcript_line"> I was going to ask.</div><div id="00:15:00.280" class="transcript_line"> He does go home sometimes, but we do live together now.</div><div id="00:15:06.680" class="transcript_line"> At the start back in March, were you living together then or were you apart?</div><div id="00:15:11.960" class="transcript_line"> We were together, thankfully.</div><div id="00:15:22.200" class="transcript_line"> I knew that if Andy wasn&#039;t around that it would be very lonely.</div><div id="00:15:29.320" class="transcript_line"> I wouldn&#039;t be as happy as I am now because I wouldn&#039;t be able to see anyone.</div><div id="00:15:35.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m only maybe FaceTime or Teams or on Zoom.</div><div id="00:15:45.400" class="transcript_line"> But I am also at the moment, I have been doing a little bit of work here and there, but only at home.</div><div id="00:15:55.400" class="transcript_line"> I see. Sorry, go on.</div><div id="00:15:59.640" class="transcript_line"> Which has been keeping my brain occupied.</div><div id="00:16:05.080" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s given me something to do.</div><div id="00:16:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Who do you work for again?</div><div id="00:16:11.160" class="transcript_line"> I work for, well, I&#039;ve got two jobs now.</div><div id="00:16:16.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m still with Newport People First, but I haven&#039;t been able to</div><div id="00:16:25.160" class="transcript_line"> really start with work with them for a while because my job has changed in that respect.</div><div id="00:16:33.640" class="transcript_line"> But I am working for Growing Spaces.</div><div id="00:16:45.160" class="transcript_line"> They do all sorts of stuff.</div><div id="00:16:47.160" class="transcript_line"> Like they&#039;ve got a gardening group.</div><div id="00:16:50.360" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got a travel buddy group, which I&#039;m involved in.</div><div id="00:16:58.600" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve got quite a few shops happening as well.</div><div id="00:17:04.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hopefully going to get more involved with that if and when everything goes back to</div><div id="00:17:12.040" class="transcript_line"> the way it was before lockdown.</div><div id="00:17:15.400" class="transcript_line"> Were you furloughed at all or not?</div><div id="00:17:17.560" class="transcript_line"> No, my job finished with Newport People First at the end of February this year.</div><div id="00:17:26.680" class="transcript_line"> I was going to have a month off and then start back in April.</div><div id="00:17:32.840" class="transcript_line"> But because of the lockdown, I haven&#039;t been back since.</div><div id="00:17:40.680" class="transcript_line"> But there&#039;s plans for you to go back at some point, is there?</div><div id="00:17:43.320" class="transcript_line"> Because I&#039;ve got a new job happening if and when I go back.</div><div id="00:17:50.440" class="transcript_line"> Because my project, as I said before, it&#039;s finished now.</div><div id="00:17:55.400" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ll be going on to something different.</div><div id="00:18:02.600" class="transcript_line"> There was no question at the start of lockdown that you would stay with Andy rather than</div><div id="00:18:08.360" class="transcript_line"> maybe going back on your own, is it?</div><div id="00:18:10.440" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m quite happy with Andy being here.</div><div id="00:18:19.720" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s also a company for me.</div><div id="00:18:30.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m glad it&#039;s happened when it has happened, if that makes sense.</div><div id="00:18:35.480" class="transcript_line"> How do you think you would be coping if you were still single?</div><div id="00:18:39.800" class="transcript_line"> I think I&#039;d be tearing my hair out and thinking, what have I done wrong?</div><div id="00:18:46.040" class="transcript_line"> What am I doing wrong?</div><div id="00:18:50.440" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s just one of those things that I think, why haven&#039;t I managed to find the right person?</div><div id="00:18:59.480" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I know it&#039;s taken me 16 years to get to where I am.</div><div id="00:19:04.520" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m in a good place now and hopefully it&#039;ll be forever.</div><div id="00:19:16.360" class="transcript_line"> And thinking outside of your relationship with Andy, how has it affected the way that</div><div id="00:19:21.320" class="transcript_line"> you access the groups or social activities that you attend?</div><div id="00:19:26.120" class="transcript_line"> Are you still able to do them online?</div><div id="00:19:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Have you been to any before we got lockdown?</div><div id="00:19:31.080" class="transcript_line"> I have been to Zoom calls first, having meetings once a week just to see how everyone&#039;s coping,</div><div id="00:19:46.040" class="transcript_line"> what they&#039;ve been up to, that sort of thing.</div><div id="00:19:50.520" class="transcript_line"> And again, I&#039;ve been doing that with Growing Space.</div><div id="00:19:55.960" class="transcript_line"> They have been keeping in touch with them once a week, once maybe twice a week.</div><div id="00:20:04.040" class="transcript_line"> But I know Newport People First haven&#039;t been having Zoom calls for a while.</div><div id="00:20:11.320" class="transcript_line"> But I think this week they&#039;re starting up again.</div><div id="00:20:15.160" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s the only group that I&#039;ve been involved in.</div><div id="00:20:32.600" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t been involved in any other groups.</div><div id="00:20:37.560" class="transcript_line"> How did you find socializing and talking to people through Zoom rather than face to face?</div><div id="00:20:43.720" class="transcript_line"> I found it really hard because I&#039;m so used to seeing people in the flesh,</div><div id="00:20:50.440" class="transcript_line"> not over a computer screen.</div><div id="00:20:55.400" class="transcript_line"> But I suppose you can&#039;t really help that.</div><div id="00:21:00.360" class="transcript_line"> But at the moment you can&#039;t see people in the flesh or have meetings outdoors or indoors</div><div id="00:21:11.240" class="transcript_line"> because it&#039;s just not happening.</div><div id="00:21:16.760" class="transcript_line"> But I&#039;m looking forward to the time where things do go back to normal.</div><div id="00:21:23.960" class="transcript_line"> And we can see people in person and to have meetings and to meet up for coffee like we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:21:35.720" class="transcript_line"> done before, go out as a group.</div><div id="00:21:39.960" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s what I&#039;m missing right now is literally going out.</div><div id="00:21:46.840" class="transcript_line"> So how has it affected your well-being being locked down and not being able to do those things?</div><div id="00:21:55.640" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it has because I&#039;m in hibernation mode</div><div id="00:21:59.800" class="transcript_line"> because I haven&#039;t been able to see anyone.</div><div id="00:22:07.320" class="transcript_line"> I am finding it hard.</div><div id="00:22:10.920" class="transcript_line"> I mean, I&#039;m not coping right now.</div><div id="00:22:12.920" class="transcript_line"> I just want to go outside and scream.</div><div id="00:22:17.960" class="transcript_line"> But I mean, it&#039;s not only happening here, it&#039;s happening all over the world.</div><div id="00:22:22.600" class="transcript_line"> I could imagine what other people are feeling, not having to go out to go to work or go shopping</div><div id="00:22:33.640" class="transcript_line"> and just having a good time.</div><div id="00:22:38.120" class="transcript_line"> And obviously we&#039;re back into day three of the second lockdown now.</div><div id="00:22:44.440" class="transcript_line"> How did you feel when that was announced?</div><div id="00:22:46.040" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s deflating because I thought in some ways that we were slowly going to go back to work</div><div id="00:22:55.960" class="transcript_line"> and to do what we can do like go out.</div><div id="00:23:02.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hoping that if we do this now, we can still see friends and family over Christmas</div><div id="00:23:11.080" class="transcript_line"> because that&#039;s what&#039;s warning us.</div><div id="00:23:13.800" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hoping that we can still see friends and family over Christmas.</div><div id="00:23:20.920" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hoping that we can still see friends and family over Christmas.</div><div id="00:23:25.960" class="transcript_line"> Because that&#039;s what&#039;s worrying me a lot now is that because of lockdown,</div><div id="00:23:31.560" class="transcript_line"> that we won&#039;t be able to have a Christmas.</div><div id="00:23:36.040" class="transcript_line"> What would be your plans if there wasn&#039;t a lockdown?</div><div id="00:23:42.280" class="transcript_line"> Now I&#039;d be working for Deafinite.</div><div id="00:23:48.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be carrying out my work.</div><div id="00:23:52.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d be carrying out my meetings like I have done over the few years that I&#039;ve been with</div><div id="00:24:01.800" class="transcript_line"> Newport People First and hopefully I&#039;d be making a difference to people&#039;s lives with</div><div id="00:24:12.600" class="transcript_line"> taking them places they&#039;ve never been to before.</div><div id="00:24:15.720" class="transcript_line"> Thinking Christmas Day, would you normally go to see your parents or go somewhere else?</div><div id="00:24:22.680" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I&#039;d be going to my parents over Christmas because we usually have Christmas together anyway</div><div id="00:24:35.720" class="transcript_line"> with my sister and her husband coming down from London.</div><div id="00:24:43.720" class="transcript_line"> If we have a lockdown like this over Christmas,</div><div id="00:24:50.200" class="transcript_line"> Christmas isn&#039;t going to be the same this year.</div><div id="00:24:54.520" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think.</div><div id="00:24:56.600" class="transcript_line"> Were you with Andy last Christmas?</div><div id="00:24:59.400" class="transcript_line"> No, I was with Andy last Christmas.</div><div id="00:25:03.720" class="transcript_line"> No, this will be our first proper Christmas together.</div><div id="00:25:10.600" class="transcript_line"> So if you&#039;re still locked down at Christmas, will you be spending it with Andy then?</div><div id="00:25:14.760" class="transcript_line"> Yes, definitely.</div><div id="00:25:19.720" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ve had ups and downs in the last few months, who do you speak to about those things?</div><div id="00:25:26.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been talking to, because I also get support as well.</div><div id="00:25:31.160" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;ve been having support about it.</div><div id="00:25:39.880" class="transcript_line"> But now because of the new lockdown, I&#039;ve cancelled my support for these two weeks.</div><div id="00:25:50.360" class="transcript_line"> What kind of support do they give you?</div><div id="00:25:51.880" class="transcript_line"> I have support with going shopping or sometimes they&#039;ll help with housework,</div><div id="00:26:08.440" class="transcript_line"> things like that.</div><div id="00:26:14.200" class="transcript_line"> If I need to go to a doctor&#039;s appointment, they&#039;ll come with me.</div><div id="00:26:18.600" class="transcript_line"> That sort of thing.</div><div id="00:26:20.600" class="transcript_line"> How did they react to your new relationship?</div><div id="00:26:24.920" class="transcript_line"> They were very happy.</div><div id="00:26:27.080" class="transcript_line"> Although with the support workers that I&#039;ve been having, I haven&#039;t had a constant one coming every week.</div><div id="00:26:36.840" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve been having different people come every week, so it&#039;s really difficult.</div><div id="00:26:43.880" class="transcript_line"> Not having the same people every time?</div><div id="00:26:45.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:26:46.520" class="transcript_line"> Do you feel that they know you well or is it not enough time to get to know someone?</div><div id="00:26:52.520" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not enough time to get to know them because you have one person and then you don&#039;t see them</div><div id="00:27:00.360" class="transcript_line"> for a month or two and then they just rock up out of the blue.</div><div id="00:27:04.280" class="transcript_line"> The thing is I get so many new people come see me that I don&#039;t even know.</div><div id="00:27:08.600" class="transcript_line"> I haven&#039;t met before and with that I always like to get to know them first before I chuck them in the deep end.</div><div id="00:27:19.640" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know which is better, throwing them in the deep end first and then getting to know them</div><div id="00:27:26.600" class="transcript_line"> or getting to know them first and then chucking them in the deep end. I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:27:35.240" class="transcript_line"> Where do you feel the most comfortable?</div><div id="00:27:38.280" class="transcript_line"> The first thing I feel is that I feel comfortable with the people that I&#039;ve met before.</div><div id="00:27:46.200" class="transcript_line"> When the restrictions first eased, do you remember what the first thing you did was?</div><div id="00:27:54.600" class="transcript_line"> I went out for a meal and I saw my parents.</div><div id="00:28:04.520" class="transcript_line"> Where did you go for food?</div><div id="00:28:06.520" class="transcript_line"> I forgot now. We went somewhere in town but I know that we went out for a meal on Friday afternoon</div><div id="00:28:15.720" class="transcript_line"> with my parents. We went to the the pen and wig and we had a meal with my parents.</div><div id="00:28:24.680" class="transcript_line"> We went to the pen and wig and we had a meal with my parents.</div><div id="00:28:31.960" class="transcript_line"> We went to the pen and wig in town so that was good to have a catch up and</div><div id="00:28:41.880" class="transcript_line"> just see them before we get locked away again.</div><div id="00:28:46.040" class="transcript_line"> How did it feel that first time you went back out after the restrictions first got eased?</div><div id="00:28:51.960" class="transcript_line"> I felt like it was as if that I&#039;ve been let out for good behaviour.</div><div id="00:29:02.120" class="transcript_line"> It was great because I could have fresh air and I didn&#039;t have a time limit as to when I had to be</div><div id="00:29:12.840" class="transcript_line"> home again but just going out was the best thing because it blew all the cobwebs away.</div><div id="00:29:21.320" class="transcript_line"> We were out in the fresh air and it was just great.</div><div id="00:29:27.320" class="transcript_line"> Obviously although some of the restrictions have been removed now you&#039;ve got to wear a mask when</div><div id="00:29:32.920" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re in shops. You&#039;ve got two metre distances and things. How did you find dealing with that?</div><div id="00:29:39.240" class="transcript_line"> Very difficult. I&#039;m finding it hard doing the two metre distance and I&#039;m really struggling with</div><div id="00:29:49.880" class="transcript_line"> masks. Is that wearing them or having to talk to people who are wearing them?</div><div id="00:30:02.520" class="transcript_line"> I just feel with wearing a mask it feels like someone&#039;s constantly</div><div id="00:30:10.360" class="transcript_line"> behind you with their mouth covering your nose and mouth so you can&#039;t breathe.</div><div id="00:30:17.480" class="transcript_line"> In a way to say I feel very suffocated with the mask on. I just can&#039;t breathe.</div><div id="00:30:30.360" class="transcript_line"> Are you aware of things that you can do like get a lanyard that you&#039;re exempt from wearing a mask?</div><div id="00:30:38.200" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a lanyard. I&#039;m just looking for a card to go with it.</div><div id="00:30:47.640" class="transcript_line"> Because I think I&#039;ve seen two or three people with the actual disability</div><div id="00:30:59.160" class="transcript_line"> lanyard and the exemption card you get with it.</div><div id="00:31:06.840" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know where you can get them from and I&#039;m really struggling. I&#039;ve got the</div><div id="00:31:17.400" class="transcript_line"> sunflower yellow and green lanyard. I just need that card to go with it and I&#039;ve got no idea where</div><div id="00:31:29.160" class="transcript_line"> to get one from. After the interview I&#039;ll give you a helpline. They might be able to help you.</div><div id="00:31:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Okay thank you.</div><div id="00:31:39.720" class="transcript_line"> Let me just have a look. I remember you saying in your original interview that one of your best</div><div id="00:31:46.360" class="transcript_line"> friends was still living in South Africa. Yes. I presume your relationship with her hasn&#039;t</div><div id="00:31:52.280" class="transcript_line"> necessarily changed that much? No it hasn&#039;t. We keep in touch almost every day.</div><div id="00:31:58.360" class="transcript_line"> Although she doesn&#039;t have a disability of any sort she&#039;s still struggling with day-to-day stuff.</div><div id="00:32:11.480" class="transcript_line"> She gets panic attacks as well. But who would get panic attacks when you&#039;re in an environment</div><div id="00:32:24.440" class="transcript_line"> like you are in this present day? Have you felt lonely at all in the last not seven months?</div><div id="00:32:39.160" class="transcript_line"> Not really. No. Because I&#039;ve had Andy to hand. He&#039;s been good company. It seems weird because</div><div id="00:32:51.960" class="transcript_line"> sometimes when I&#039;m in a relationship I sometimes think I want to be on my own. I can&#039;t wait</div><div id="00:33:00.120" class="transcript_line"> to be on my own and almost 12 months down the line I&#039;ve never felt like that. I&#039;ve never felt</div><div id="00:33:10.120" class="transcript_line"> like I wanted to check anyone out because I wanted time to myself which I find really strange.</div><div id="00:33:22.120" class="transcript_line"> So you&#039;re not planning to have some alone time at the moment then? Not at all. Are you worried</div><div id="00:33:29.480" class="transcript_line"> about catching the Covid-19? I am when I&#039;m out although having the face mask does work.</div><div id="00:33:42.680" class="transcript_line"> But as soon as we had lockdown I got a cold and trying to see if I could get a test</div><div id="00:34:00.440" class="transcript_line"> was really difficult. If I had a car it wouldn&#039;t be so bad but because I don&#039;t have a car and I&#039;ve</div><div id="00:34:12.920" class="transcript_line"> got no one to take me it was hard to get a test as well. To get a test I&#039;d have to pay like £160</div><div id="00:34:27.320" class="transcript_line"> something like that. For a private one is it? Well I wouldn&#039;t know if that would be a private</div><div id="00:34:35.160" class="transcript_line"> one or just in general. The tests that everyone can get are free.</div><div id="00:34:47.640" class="transcript_line"> So you didn&#039;t get one done did you? No I didn&#039;t.</div><div id="00:34:50.360" class="transcript_line"> So you mentioned the lack of access to a car and stuff. I presume your support still helped you</div><div id="00:34:58.680" class="transcript_line"> with shopping during the first lockdown? Yes they did. Thankfully I live near a shop so</div><div id="00:35:08.440" class="transcript_line"> because support workers aren&#039;t allowed to use their cars with taking people places</div><div id="00:35:15.640" class="transcript_line"> because of not restrictions but policy that they&#039;ve their new policy they&#039;ve got in now.</div><div id="00:35:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we&#039;ve been walking to the shop and then bringing it home.</div><div id="00:35:35.720" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s helped in a lot of ways but since lockdown as well I&#039;ve been doing online shopping</div><div id="00:35:44.280" class="transcript_line"> which is better because you&#039;re not interacting with other people</div><div id="00:35:53.080" class="transcript_line"> which I suppose is a good thing because in that way you are saving lives.</div><div id="00:36:00.920" class="transcript_line"> But I prefer going to a shop buying what you want in the store and then come home because</div><div id="00:36:10.600" class="transcript_line"> you know what you&#039;re getting.</div><div id="00:36:17.480" class="transcript_line"> There have been a lot of rules and regulations over our lives in the last few months. Have you</div><div id="00:36:23.240" class="transcript_line"> always understood what they are? No because it&#039;s been very confusing. It&#039;s okay for one</div><div id="00:36:32.840" class="transcript_line"> for one part of the country and then it&#039;s a different story for the next. So I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:36:43.160" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s true and what&#039;s not. Sorry to hear that. That must be quite difficult. It is very difficult.</div><div id="00:36:55.160" class="transcript_line"> Do you think that your relationship with your family Andy or your friends have changed in the</div><div id="00:37:02.040" class="transcript_line"> last seven months? I don&#039;t think so. I think it&#039;s brought us closer together because</div><div id="00:37:10.200" class="transcript_line"> because of the situation we&#039;re in I think it&#039;s brought us closer.</div><div id="00:37:17.240" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s definitely made me closer to my parents because</div><div id="00:37:30.200" class="transcript_line"> the thing is when I see them I almost cry when I say goodbye because I never know when I&#039;m going</div><div id="00:37:38.360" class="transcript_line"> to see them again which is I don&#039;t know I really don&#039;t know how to explain that.</div><div id="00:37:51.640" class="transcript_line"> But I just find it difficult now because we&#039;re not able to see people in the flesh.</div><div id="00:38:01.240" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m really struggling.</div><div id="00:38:10.760" class="transcript_line"> And so do you talk to Andy about those feelings that you have? I do sometimes.</div><div id="00:38:18.200" class="transcript_line"> Does that help? It does. It definitely helps</div><div id="00:38:22.520" class="transcript_line"> when and if you can speak to people about how you&#039;re feeling.</div><div id="00:38:26.760" class="transcript_line"> Do you think there&#039;s been any positive things that come out of all of this?</div><div id="00:38:32.200" class="transcript_line"> Well for me definitely getting a relationship. That&#039;s the best thing on top of my list.</div><div id="00:38:43.720" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any other thing that I can think of that&#039;s different.</div><div id="00:39:04.280" class="transcript_line"> And so when things return to normal or whatever normal will be now what&#039;s the one thing you&#039;re</div><div id="00:39:10.600" class="transcript_line"> looking forward to doing the most? I think seeing my mum and dad. I think they&#039;re the</div><div id="00:39:20.600" class="transcript_line"> most important people I want to see because I mean okay</div><div id="00:39:27.640" class="transcript_line"> I mean they&#039;re at the age where they&#039;re almost at retiring age so I don&#039;t know</div><div id="00:39:38.200" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s best to take advantage when you can see them because again you don&#039;t know when</div><div id="00:39:47.240" class="transcript_line"> when you&#039;re going to see them in the long run.</div><div id="00:39:50.600" class="transcript_line"> And so I think we&#039;re nearly at the end now so is there anything else you&#039;d like to talk about or</div><div id="00:39:57.400" class="transcript_line"> something that you think we haven&#039;t covered? I don&#039;t think there is anything that I can think</div><div id="00:40:03.000" class="transcript_line"> of at the top of my head. Thank you very much Rhianna I&#039;m going to stop recording now. No problem.</div><div id="00:40:13.160" class="transcript_line"> Let me find the button.</div><div id="00:40:20.040" class="transcript_line"> Okay.</div></div></p>
