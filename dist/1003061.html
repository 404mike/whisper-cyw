    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Even though this band has only started about a year and a half or so ago, they&#039;re really getting to be quite popular.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;ve been doing quite a lot of concert work. We wish to thank them for their contributions.</div><div id="00:00:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Right now, we&#039;re going to have some talk about remembering.</div><div id="00:00:18.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandfather&#039;s parents and grandmother came over from Wales in 1900, and they landed in New York City in May.</div><div id="00:00:27.000" class="transcript_line"> They came with four children ages 6 to 14.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They were coming across the country by train, but before they left Wales, they were told all these horror stories about the cowboys and the Indians.</div><div id="00:00:42.000" class="transcript_line"> The Indians scalped you and the cowboys just as well shoot you for nothing.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> So when they were on a day out of Chicago, five cowboys came on the train. They were all afraid.</div><div id="00:00:54.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother told the children to stop staring and be quiet.</div><div id="00:00:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Speaking in Wales, one of the cowboys turned around and looked at her.</div><div id="00:01:02.000" class="transcript_line"> After a while, my grandparents started the children singing, which they had been doing along on the train, and everybody on the train liked to hear them singing.</div><div id="00:01:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Because each of them sang... Well, Dave sang in bass, and Maude, my mother, sang in alto, and May soprano, and Albert tenor.</div><div id="00:01:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmother had a good soprano voice, and my grandfather was a tenor.</div><div id="00:01:22.000" class="transcript_line"> So they started the children singing.</div><div id="00:01:24.000" class="transcript_line"> And one of the cowboys turned around and stared at them.</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And pretty soon he got up and walked towards them.</div><div id="00:01:30.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course they got scared.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> But they looked up at him, and then they saw tears running down his cheeks.</div><div id="00:01:36.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, do not be afraid. In Welsh to them.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> He says, because I am from Wales. I left Wales seven years ago, and that&#039;s the most beautiful music that I&#039;ve ever heard since I left there.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother started talking with him, and she found out that he had not been riding home.</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So she told him he better ride home to his mother.</div><div id="00:01:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And tell her that he was all right.</div><div id="00:02:02.000" class="transcript_line"> But the first Indians they saw was when they got off the train at Auburn.</div><div id="00:02:06.000" class="transcript_line"> But they weren&#039;t very bad-looking Indians.</div><div id="00:02:11.000" class="transcript_line"> They went to my grandmother&#039;s brother&#039;s place, which was at Covington, which is just out between Auburn and Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:02:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandfather got work right away in the mines in Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:02:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Mr. Morgan, the mine superintendent, took a liking to my grandfather and soon found him a house.</div><div id="00:02:28.000" class="transcript_line"> It was the one house that was next to the confectionery store across from the depot in Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Being a mining town, it was kind of a bad place with all the pool halls and taverns.</div><div id="00:02:41.000" class="transcript_line"> And my grandparents realized there was no place for the young men that were working in the mine, the young single Welsh people, to go.</div><div id="00:02:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So they opened up their house to them. And day and night people came and went.</div><div id="00:02:53.000" class="transcript_line"> My grandmother had a steady order for five pounds of tea a month from Dan Davis the tea man.</div><div id="00:03:00.000" class="transcript_line"> They came out on the train from Seattle.</div><div id="00:03:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Even after they moved out into the country on the farm between Auburn and Enumka, the Welsh people still came.</div><div id="00:03:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And even some of these Welsh boys, even though they had married and had families, they would still bring their Welsh families out to the country.</div><div id="00:03:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And they would all gather around the old pump organ and sing in Welsh and have tea and Welsh cakes.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Of course, my grandfather was Sunday school superintendent.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> He served Sunday school superintendent in the church in Black Diamond.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And then he started the Wabash Presbyterian Church out there where they lived.</div><div id="00:03:35.000" class="transcript_line"> And he was Sunday school superintendent for 50 years.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And Welsh people used to come out.</div><div id="00:03:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Our church service was because we shared it with the minister from the Auburn church.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> The service was in the afternoon.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> And many of the Welsh would, after being in church in Seattle, would drive out to the little country churches, they called it, and come.</div><div id="00:03:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, when they came, the raptors really rang with their singing.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Somebody asked me about food.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, yes, we did have some Welsh food in our home.</div><div id="00:04:07.000" class="transcript_line"> There was one dish that my mother used to make.</div><div id="00:04:11.000" class="transcript_line"> It was called the old country steak.</div><div id="00:04:12.000" class="transcript_line"> She would take and cut up onions in the bottom of the casserole and then cut up the steak in thin strips and put a little water with that.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And then put it in the old wood stove in the oven and let it cook for a long time.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> That made a really delicious gravy.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And that usually served with a little thick thing was usually served over potatoes or with parsnips and carrots or rutabagas.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And she did make pickled red cabbage.</div><div id="00:04:35.000" class="transcript_line"> I sure wish I knew how she used to do it because I remember used to cutting up the cabbage, but I don&#039;t remember how she did it.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when my father butchered, she always made faggots.</div><div id="00:04:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And she and my grandmother would also take and make bacon and ham by rubbing brown sugar and salt into fresh pork.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And it would hang until it was dry.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> It was wonderful.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> On Ash Wednesday, my grandmother always made croiss.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s like a very thin pancake, something like a Swedish pancake.</div><div id="00:05:02.000" class="transcript_line"> And after it&#039;s cooked, it&#039;s buttered and sprinkled with sugar and a little lemon juice and then rolled up and served.</div><div id="00:05:09.000" class="transcript_line"> They were delicious.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And my mother always made pies on Friday.</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And she would always make about seven or eight of them.</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> And we&#039;d always hurry home from school because we knew that she would always roll out this Welsh apple pie.</div><div id="00:05:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Now, this was made by rolling out a big sheet of dough.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And then she would cut apples on half of it and then bring the dough up over the top of it and then put it in the oven and bake it.</div><div id="00:05:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And then when it was baked, she would take it out, slice it in two, taking that top crust off,</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> and then spreading the apples over it and with butter and sugar on that.</div><div id="00:05:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was really wonderful.</div><div id="00:05:45.000" class="transcript_line"> And of course, we had the plum pudding and the raisin cake at Easter.</div><div id="00:05:50.000" class="transcript_line"> My mother and my grandmother always attended the St. David&#039;s Day or any of the Kamanas here in Seattle or in Renton.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Anytime the Welsh were singing anyplace, they were there.</div></div></p>
