    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Hello, Tony Byrd speaking, actually Ralph, Anthony Byrd, Tony for short,</div><div id="00:00:06.560" class="transcript_line"> but I was at school, I was always called Dickie. Anyway, here we go, I was born in Cowbridge,</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> L&#039;Morgan in 1924. My father ran an agricultural, well it was really an ironmongry business,</div><div id="00:00:22.560" class="transcript_line"> which he inherited from his father, which I think was started in 1783, so it was quite a</div><div id="00:00:29.600" class="transcript_line"> well-established business. I was educated at Pontbine Council School in Cowbridge from the</div><div id="00:00:37.520" class="transcript_line"> age of about probably three until ten when my father went up to Gloucestershire to open a branch</div><div id="00:00:46.080" class="transcript_line"> because the Cowbridge business is doing very well and he&#039;d been offered the franchise with the</div><div id="00:00:51.680" class="transcript_line"> Massey, or not then Massey, but the Ferguson tractor and he&#039;d been offered quite a number of</div><div id="00:00:57.920" class="transcript_line"> counties distributed. Anyway, now that&#039;s jumping ahead a bit. I was educated at</div><div id="00:01:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Gnarling School&#039;s Shroud and then I went to Wycliffe College at Stonehouse, which was a</div><div id="00:01:10.560" class="transcript_line"> boarding school quite adjacent to our home and the school was evacuated to Lampeter</div><div id="00:01:20.480" class="transcript_line"> during the early part of the war because the Admiralty had taken a fancy to the school buildings</div><div id="00:01:27.200" class="transcript_line"> and I went to Lampeter where I stayed for three years very happily. We used to</div><div id="00:01:35.040" class="transcript_line"> organise shooting parties for rabbits, I remember. The local farmers were very keen, but we, of course,</div><div id="00:01:42.240" class="transcript_line"> we shouldn&#039;t have had guns there, but three or four of us organised little shooting parties and</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> we had a good time. I think my vivid memory of Lampeter was the winter of 42 when the local lake</div><div id="00:02:00.800" class="transcript_line"> froze up and I think we were skating up there for many, many times and we had great fun.</div><div id="00:02:08.720" class="transcript_line"> I played for the school at Cricket and Rugby and was contemporary with Gilbert Parkhouse,</div><div id="00:02:15.600" class="transcript_line"> who later became an England cricketer and a Welsh rugby footballer.</div><div id="00:02:24.960" class="transcript_line"> While I was at Lampeter, we were visited by a naval officer who was trying to conscript</div><div id="00:02:33.440" class="transcript_line"> public school boys for the Navy and I actually volunteered at that time. I think I was about 17</div><div id="00:02:42.720" class="transcript_line"> and I attended an interview in Swansea and when I left school at the age of 18,</div><div id="00:02:49.920" class="transcript_line"> I was sent a letter asking to report to ACMS at Raleigh in Devonport where I spent three</div><div id="00:02:59.600" class="transcript_line"> arduous months marching up and down and generally being taught how to behave.</div><div id="00:03:06.720" class="transcript_line"> I think one of my vivid memories of that was taking rowing courses on one of the rivers</div><div id="00:03:15.040" class="transcript_line"> and deliberately catching the horse. We fell backwards and the chief pass officer thought</div><div id="00:03:22.720" class="transcript_line"> that was a really good joke and he took it in good part. Anyway, after that, I went to a</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> barracks in Devonport and was then sent to join a ship which was just being refitted in Harlequin</div><div id="00:03:44.400" class="transcript_line"> Wolf&#039;s Yard in Belfast. ACMS escapade. We were a completely new crew, the ship having been</div><div id="00:03:55.120" class="transcript_line"> extensively refitted after many very difficult arctic convoys and we understood from some of</div><div id="00:04:03.760" class="transcript_line"> the old crew that they&#039;d been on that infamous convoy, Q17, where the Navy were totally disbanded</div><div id="00:04:13.200" class="transcript_line"> leaving the merchant ships to the mercy of the Germans. Whether that was actually true in essence,</div><div id="00:04:20.560" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t honestly know. Anyway, the ship we worked, we had trials after the refit and my memory there</div><div id="00:04:32.880" class="transcript_line"> is one of us, our steering motor failed owing to I think sabotage and we rammed a jetty which put</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> us back about a fortnight and then we went up to Scapa Flow to work up where we did extensive</div><div id="00:04:51.760" class="transcript_line"> gunnery and sea trials and we went up to Bear Island and being a sort of potential officer</div><div id="00:05:02.960" class="transcript_line"> material, I was posted as a lookout on the bridge where we were able to observe the operation of the</div><div id="00:05:13.040" class="transcript_line"> ship as a whole. While working up, I was asked to spot the port of Shot when we were</div><div id="00:05:21.280" class="transcript_line"> undertaking gunnery files at day and night. Anyway, we did some Atlantic convoys and we were</div><div id="00:05:32.240" class="transcript_line"> then detailed to accompany a huge fleet of ships going down to North Africa for the operation Torch</div><div id="00:05:41.440" class="transcript_line"> which was a joint American British invasion of North Africa. I always remember we were escorting</div><div id="00:05:49.360" class="transcript_line"> HMS Furious, the aircraft carrier, and she was taking a pretty rough trip going down to the Bay</div><div id="00:05:57.520" class="transcript_line"> of Biscay and I always remember Seafarers taking off her deck. The deck must have been at angles</div><div id="00:06:05.280" class="transcript_line"> of 15 to 20 degrees and how the pilots ever got the things done I don&#039;t honestly know.</div><div id="00:06:11.360" class="transcript_line"> But after Operation Torch, we did we returned to Gibraltar and stayed there for some weeks I</div><div id="00:06:19.440" class="transcript_line"> remember and then we went back to Scapa Flow, did a couple of Atlantic convoys and I left the ship</div><div id="00:06:27.600" class="transcript_line"> in January 1943 having been asked to attend the training college at Brighton HMS Alfred.</div><div id="00:06:40.320" class="transcript_line"> Anyway, I went to HMS Alfred and was promoted to temporary midshipman but that was,</div><div id="00:06:47.680" class="transcript_line"> I remember rescinded, they wrote in my paybook promoted to temporary midshipman RNVR</div><div id="00:06:55.280" class="transcript_line"> but the captain Pelly was in charge he sent for me he said I think that you&#039;re a bit too young</div><div id="00:07:03.120" class="transcript_line"> to go see as a midshipman I think I&#039;m going to send you back for further training at sea.</div><div id="00:07:10.880" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s what happened but well I was then in Devonport dockyard, the barracks, and a fleet order</div><div id="00:07:23.040" class="transcript_line"> appeared on the notice board asking for people to volunteer as fleet air arm pilots</div><div id="00:07:30.480" class="transcript_line"> and as I was at a dead end waiting for another ship and nothing seemed to be happening I volunteered</div><div id="00:07:37.280" class="transcript_line"> and I just went for an interview I think in Brighton for that and then reported to HMS St. Vincent</div><div id="00:07:46.880" class="transcript_line"> which I think was in Portsmouth where we did a three-month training course as sort of forthcoming</div><div id="00:07:57.680" class="transcript_line"> pilots in the fleet air arm and during that time I was put forward for what they a draft called the</div><div id="00:08:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Admiral Towers Scheme which meant we would be sent training to America to be trained by the marines</div><div id="00:08:14.400" class="transcript_line"> and that&#039;s what happened we went I went across to America and I think in about probably June,</div><div id="00:08:21.760" class="transcript_line"> June of 43 and went to Grosse Eagle having landed at Halifax Nova Scotia in a snowstorm I always</div><div id="00:08:30.560" class="transcript_line"> remember we traveled to Detroit by train and although the railway carriage had double glazing</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I remember the snow was blowing in on us sleeping in our seats very very cold anyway Grosse Eagle</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> was an eye-opener American marine pilots trained us very very good and efficient they were mostly</div><div id="00:08:56.240" class="transcript_line"> young people I was taught to fly by an ensign and also by a lieutenant and but pretty young people</div><div id="00:09:07.760" class="transcript_line"> we I I forget we trained on trained on two wings by planes quite quite nice they&#039;re bigger than</div><div id="00:09:16.960" class="transcript_line"> the Tiger Moth and I went solo after about 12 hours and stayed Grosse Eagle for about three months</div><div id="00:09:27.760" class="transcript_line"> clocking up 50 or 60 hours of flying time but I think it was a biplane steerman very nice</div><div id="00:09:34.160" class="transcript_line"> air very very capable aircraft very steady it must have been for me to fly it anyway after</div><div id="00:09:42.800" class="transcript_line"> arriving at Grosse Eagle I think there were about 30 of us in the party we were asked to attend a</div><div id="00:09:51.920" class="transcript_line"> reception which is being held I think by the United Services Organization anyway at a</div><div id="00:09:59.440" class="transcript_line"> at a hotel in Detroit where we met with quite a number of Americans who adopted each one of</div><div id="00:10:09.840" class="transcript_line"> each family adopted one of us which is very good and I was adopted by the the the husband and wife</div><div id="00:10:18.880" class="transcript_line"> the husband being the manager of the Detroit Gas Company which is interesting anyway they they were</div><div id="00:10:25.520" class="transcript_line"> very very kind and every weekend if we had to leave they used to come to the base of Grosse</div><div id="00:10:32.160" class="transcript_line"> Eagle and pick us up and take us out you know show us sights and were very very hospitable</div><div id="00:10:39.280" class="transcript_line"> so that was interesting anyway after after some I I did quite a bit of flying at Grosse</div><div id="00:10:47.840" class="transcript_line"> Eagle I think the aircraft was steerman by planes I can&#039;t remember the model but they were</div><div id="00:10:54.720" class="transcript_line"> quite nice aircraft I didn&#039;t really enjoy flying I went solo after about 12 hours but I&#039;ve to be</div><div id="00:11:02.800" class="transcript_line"> quite honest I found flying boring the the instructors were marine</div><div id="00:11:12.000" class="transcript_line"> American marine pilots mostly young and they were very meticulous always telling us to keep</div><div id="00:11:19.760" class="transcript_line"> if your engine fails where you were you going to land and all that sort of thing</div><div id="00:11:24.080" class="transcript_line"> and on one occasion we actually had engine failure and we landed at a farm and I remember I think</div><div id="00:11:32.480" class="transcript_line"> it was in the middle of a maize crop and the farmer came out in constation because we&#039;d</div><div id="00:11:40.160" class="transcript_line"> ruined quite a bit of his landing and he wanted to know when he discovered I was busiest he wanted</div><div id="00:11:47.120" class="transcript_line"> if I just so mere dynamic which is rather amusing so this went on for some weeks</div><div id="00:11:56.880" class="transcript_line"> I think I did about 50 hours flying and then I was asked by Lieutenant Commander Jackson R.M. to</div><div id="00:12:08.480" class="transcript_line"> report to his office where he advised me that I was going to leave the course and would</div><div id="00:12:15.600" class="transcript_line"> be returning to the UK to join the fleet somewhere and that happened I returned</div><div id="00:12:24.480" class="transcript_line"> after about a couple of weeks spent in New York which is very interesting waiting for a ship</div><div id="00:12:31.440" class="transcript_line"> I write back I think in granite and report it back to Davenport where I stayed for some weeks</div><div id="00:12:41.120" class="transcript_line"> and then was asked to report to a class corvette agent to Macy&#039;s which was stationed at Cherness</div><div id="00:12:50.320" class="transcript_line"> and I reported there a very very very lovely little ship very very very nice crew I think the</div><div id="00:13:00.560" class="transcript_line"> crew could serve probably I think totaled about 30 or 40 but they were all very very nice chaps</div><div id="00:13:08.480" class="transcript_line"> because a border corps had the sleeping arrangement of very very odd they had a series</div><div id="00:13:15.360" class="transcript_line"> of flat wooden bunks adjacent to each other in the mid part of the ship we used to we didn&#039;t have a</div><div id="00:13:24.320" class="transcript_line"> bunk allocated to us we if one person left we just hopped into the the the one which was available</div><div id="00:13:31.360" class="transcript_line"> and that went on which is very very good so after some weeks we we did</div><div id="00:13:41.040" class="transcript_line"> North Sea convoys and then channel convoys and we were under fire I remember from German batches on</div><div id="00:13:50.320" class="transcript_line"> the French coast they used to lob over shells of the convoys you were escorting in the hope of</div><div id="00:13:57.200" class="transcript_line"> making a hit but they never seemed to and that went on for some time but we were all aware that</div><div id="00:14:06.240" class="transcript_line"> there was something going to happen because there was a tremendous lot of rumours flying around about</div><div id="00:14:12.240" class="transcript_line"> the invasion upcoming invasion and we continued with these convoys and then we were based in</div><div id="00:14:22.400" class="transcript_line"> Chesnes but we used to go ashore in Southend quite a lot if we were you know in that vicinity</div><div id="00:14:29.280" class="transcript_line"> you know I always remember going up the tremendously long pier which we used to anchor off and then</div><div id="00:14:36.640" class="transcript_line"> if we had a bit of leave we would go trundle up this tremendously long causeway to town</div><div id="00:14:43.600" class="transcript_line"> and later to rejoin the ship about midnight which was good anyway D-Day approach we were</div><div id="00:14:53.120" class="transcript_line"> ordered to pick up a convoy going a guy heading for Aramon but we didn&#039;t know that at the time</div><div id="00:15:01.440" class="transcript_line"> and my most vivid memory of the invasion was the tremendous number of aircraft flying over as we</div><div id="00:15:09.600" class="transcript_line"> were going across channel there were literally hundreds of aircraft going over obviously going</div><div id="00:15:16.640" class="transcript_line"> in to drop their troops inland in anticipation of the invasion and we eventually arrived off a</div><div id="00:15:26.720" class="transcript_line"> little port called Aramon where we escorted quite a number of LCA&#039;s ashore some light fire</div><div id="00:15:38.240" class="transcript_line"> uh artillery fire and rifle fire but not very much and I remember I was standing on the bridges</div><div id="00:15:46.160" class="transcript_line"> as a lookout and a bullet whizzed past my left ear at high velocity and I said good god that</div><div id="00:15:53.680" class="transcript_line"> was a close one but that was the nearest I came to to fire at that time so we we proceeded to escort</div><div id="00:16:04.400" class="transcript_line"> ships across the we particularly remember the Mulberry Casen the big</div><div id="00:16:11.520" class="transcript_line"> sort of huge tanks which were acting as temporary harbors we escorted those across and also</div><div id="00:16:19.680" class="transcript_line"> a couple of ships with huge reels on them which turned out to be Pluto</div><div id="00:16:24.640" class="transcript_line"> the fuel lines and as they proceeded across the the reels disembarked their hoses and these were</div><div id="00:16:35.920" class="transcript_line"> eventually connected up at the Mulberry so the troops had plenty of petrol and diesel at their</div><div id="00:16:44.160" class="transcript_line"> command so this went on for some weeks we moved from beach to beach and at that time or some</div><div id="00:16:57.360" class="transcript_line"> little time later the Germans started firing their rockets over at particularly at London</div><div id="00:17:05.760" class="transcript_line"> this is the v1s what they called the v1 yeah and I had the great</div><div id="00:17:13.200" class="transcript_line"> honor of shooting one down um with an oricon which the the the rocket actually grazed</div><div id="00:17:22.160" class="transcript_line"> Dungeness lighthouse and exploded so I was very glad it didn&#039;t hit the lighthouse otherwise I was</div><div id="00:17:29.360" class="transcript_line"> being court-martialed I would think but the Americans were particularly good</div><div id="00:17:35.600" class="transcript_line"> at flying alongside these these rockets and tipping their wings over so that they they lost their</div><div id="00:17:43.840" class="transcript_line"> sense of direction and plunged to earth exploding in in the sea or on land particularly the the</div><div id="00:17:53.280" class="transcript_line"> army put up a most tremendous barrage at night the whole of the coast was alive with with gunfire</div><div id="00:18:04.560" class="transcript_line"> shooting at these rockets and they were quite successful in shooting a number down but</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> unfortunately a lot as we all know got through to London causing tremendous havoc and then the v2</div><div id="00:18:19.760" class="transcript_line"> started going which we couldn&#039;t we didn&#039;t know about it heard about that they they they were</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> beyond human intervention they used to land unexpectedly causing untold damage so there we</div><div id="00:18:35.120" class="transcript_line"> are I&#039;ve got a listen I&#039;ve got the invasion behind me uh we we&#039;ve encountered the rockets</div><div id="00:18:43.680" class="transcript_line"> and then yes what occurred then sometime I was asked to report to HMS King Alfred Brighton which</div><div id="00:18:54.560" class="transcript_line"> was a training school for potential officers and I went there and did a three-month course</div><div id="00:19:01.920" class="transcript_line"> and was commissioned as a sub lieutenant RNBR temporary in brackets and joined</div><div id="00:19:10.960" class="transcript_line"> joined uh we were set up to decline to fairfields yard at govern to join us a landing ship tank</div><div id="00:19:22.080" class="transcript_line"> which was in course of construction at that yard I was the first officer to report</div><div id="00:19:29.360" class="transcript_line"> to commander bell who was eventually to become for a leader of a flotilla of 10</div><div id="00:19:36.400" class="transcript_line"> LSTs and the first job he gave me the worst he said dicky I want you to we are going out to the</div><div id="00:19:45.440" class="transcript_line"> far east I want you to get as much booze as you can in the wardroom locker wine store so I spent</div><div id="00:19:55.600" class="transcript_line"> many days going around Glasgow to various whiskey distilleries trying to catch cases of scotch</div><div id="00:20:04.160" class="transcript_line"> out of them and to be honest it&#039;s quite successful because we when we eventually</div><div id="00:20:09.680" class="transcript_line"> say that the wine locker was particularly full commander bell he was a heaps of big chap about</div><div id="00:20:17.600" class="transcript_line"> 66 heavily built excellent seaman had been in been in the far east under uh commanding oil vessels</div><div id="00:20:28.080" class="transcript_line"> before the war but he was a tremendous drinker in harbor he never touched a drop at sea but in</div><div id="00:20:36.400" class="transcript_line"> harbor he used to go you know he used to go quite heavily on the bottom stuff and he used to try</div><div id="00:20:43.840" class="transcript_line"> and get the his young sub lieutenant drunk so that he could tease them and allocate them difficult</div><div id="00:20:51.360" class="transcript_line"> tasks it was so I stood by this LST for about probably two or three weeks</div><div id="00:20:59.520" class="transcript_line"> limited on a Glasgow family and I always remember they had a daughter</div><div id="00:21:08.000" class="transcript_line"> who I think was trying to trying to seduce me but I avoided her advances very fortunately</div><div id="00:21:16.400" class="transcript_line"> anyway we sailed a sail for the far east I think the ship was uh flotilla leader but we</div><div id="00:21:28.080" class="transcript_line"> they were building the ships at that time we didn&#039;t have maybe sailed for Plymouth in company with</div><div id="00:21:34.880" class="transcript_line"> one other LST and we had only three officers aboard at that particular time so it was watch</div><div id="00:21:44.000" class="transcript_line"> on watch and as a very inexperienced sub lieutenant I felt my responsibilities very heavily but</div><div id="00:21:52.880" class="transcript_line"> nothing under war transpired and we safely arrived at Plymouth where we picked up I think</div><div id="00:22:00.880" class="transcript_line"> seven or eight other officers including a doc who doctor who being recently recently commissioned</div><div id="00:22:10.720" class="transcript_line"> he was our NBR and he his father was a very prominent surgeon in London and he turned out</div><div id="00:22:19.360" class="transcript_line"> to be an absolutely marvelous chap you&#039;re capable of carrying out all sorts of difficult operations</div><div id="00:22:26.560" class="transcript_line"> at sea as I&#039;ll recount later and we eventually sailed the far east in company with I think three</div><div id="00:22:37.440" class="transcript_line"> other LSTs proceeding through the bay land arriving at Gibraltar where we oiled ship pretty slow</div><div id="00:22:49.440" class="transcript_line"> after the corvettes are not fast vessels but they used to average about 15 knots the LSTs we used to</div><div id="00:22:57.680" class="transcript_line"> average voyage speed was about 10 knots which is very very slow really in comparison</div><div id="00:23:05.760" class="transcript_line"> to a destroyer which I also had experience of an important anecdote has come to mind regarding my</div><div id="00:23:15.360" class="transcript_line"> service on HMS Escapade during an Atlantic convoy we needed oil so we proceeded to the Azores</div><div id="00:23:25.600" class="transcript_line"> to do so the Azores being a Portuguese owned and neutral at the time and we oiled and I recall</div><div id="00:23:35.680" class="transcript_line"> loading up with the ship loading up with a tremendous number of pineapple pineapple which were</div><div id="00:23:43.120" class="transcript_line"> in production on the Azores at that time quite heavily we loaded the ship up and I think they</div><div id="00:23:49.520" class="transcript_line"> kept us going for about 10 days until we got to got back to harbor in the UK anyway while we we</div><div id="00:23:58.800" class="transcript_line"> oiled and then left left about midday and as we were leaving to our amazement a German U-boat</div><div id="00:24:08.880" class="transcript_line"> was entering the harbor and we the officers saluted each other and all the ratings were</div><div id="00:24:16.640" class="transcript_line"> waving at each other we were quite astounded of course we realized that the the island being</div><div id="00:24:23.280" class="transcript_line"> neutral it could accommodate warships of any nation and that&#039;s what occurred</div><div id="00:24:31.280" class="transcript_line"> anyway that was an interesting experience and it made me think how futile war really was because</div><div id="00:24:38.320" class="transcript_line"> we here we were waving to people who were the next day would like to blow us out of the water</div><div id="00:24:47.280" class="transcript_line"> so having having arrived at jib we were ordered to proceed to Naples to pick up some Sherman</div><div id="00:24:58.400" class="transcript_line"> rotation tanks for the oncoming invasion of Malaya which was the intention of the British</div><div id="00:25:09.040" class="transcript_line"> governments and the Americans of course this was the bringing about the downfall of Japan</div><div id="00:25:18.080" class="transcript_line"> we discovered that the operation was called operation zipper and we were to land in the</div><div id="00:25:26.240" class="transcript_line"> land at some date in the future and we were picking up these tanks from Naples which are then</div><div id="00:25:33.360" class="transcript_line"> surplus to requirements the the German war having finished some weeks before</div><div id="00:25:41.120" class="transcript_line"> so we picked up 14 Sherman tanks we were in company then I think with five other LSTs of</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Argentina and proceeded to Aden and then to Suez through the canal and across the Indian Ocean</div><div id="00:26:01.520" class="transcript_line"> the only episode of note there being one of the LSTs one of their ratings suffered appendicitis</div><div id="00:26:10.720" class="transcript_line"> and we had to transfer lieutenant Roxburgh by boat to the other LST with very very heavy seas</div><div id="00:26:21.360" class="transcript_line"> running so we successfully transferred him with great difficulty I let you know but</div><div id="00:26:32.160" class="transcript_line"> we couldn&#039;t recover our boat because the sea conditions were too bad so we the crew had to</div><div id="00:26:40.480" class="transcript_line"> jump up scrambling nets to come aboard again and we sank our lovely motorboat by gunfire so it</div><div id="00:26:47.920" class="transcript_line"> wouldn&#039;t be a hazard to other shipping and we then proceeded not Roxburgh couldn&#039;t</div><div id="00:26:54.160" class="transcript_line"> couldn&#039;t rejoin our ship so we left him aboard the other LST until we reached Bombay where we</div><div id="00:27:02.240" class="transcript_line"> refueled I discovered when we were in Aden the captain commander Bell thought it would be very</div><div id="00:27:15.920" class="transcript_line"> nice if we had some form of transport and I remember surreptitiously a jeep being</div><div id="00:27:24.480" class="transcript_line"> wholly being landed aboard us I think it was stolen of course but it landed on our in one</div><div id="00:27:33.760" class="transcript_line"> of our holes and so he was determined to have transport of his own and it turned out that I</div><div id="00:27:42.080" class="transcript_line"> was the only chap aboard only officer aboard who could drive which is rather astonishing but this</div><div id="00:27:48.880" class="transcript_line"> was in year 43 or 44 and I was commissioned to take him with this jeep to naval headquarters in</div><div id="00:27:59.120" class="transcript_line"> Bombay to pick up our orders and driving through the streets of Bombay in a jeep with which I was</div><div id="00:28:07.040" class="transcript_line"> very familiar was quite a feat of engineering because the Indians they just would not take any</div><div id="00:28:13.520" class="transcript_line"> notice or give way to road traffic so we stayed in in Bombay for a couple of weeks made honorary</div><div id="00:28:24.160" class="transcript_line"> members of the Saturday Club which was an exclusive club which the Brits seemed to establish in all</div><div id="00:28:32.560" class="transcript_line"> ports where we played tennis and I always recall that instead of having two you know the the</div><div id="00:28:40.640" class="transcript_line"> Indians they they they love helping other people instead of having two ball boys or one ball boy</div><div id="00:28:48.880" class="transcript_line"> playing tennis they used to have about six so we didn&#039;t have to stoop to pick up a ball or</div><div id="00:28:55.760" class="transcript_line"> anything like that which is great anyway we had a lovely time in Bombay and then sailed for</div><div id="00:29:02.560" class="transcript_line"> Calcutta which would turn out to be our base and we landed there in company by this time I think</div><div id="00:29:12.160" class="transcript_line"> we all had eight eight other LSDs in company and we landed there doing various exercises off</div><div id="00:29:23.200" class="transcript_line"> of Calcutta and then we were detailed to go up to Rangoon for some reason to</div><div id="00:29:30.080" class="transcript_line"> but I think deliver some Indian troops to the Burmese war our next port of call</div><div id="00:29:37.520" class="transcript_line"> proved to be Aden and we entertained our passengers with shoots quizzes and deck games to keep up</div><div id="00:29:44.800" class="transcript_line"> morale we left Aden on 7th April 46 foot passage to the UK calling at port side Oran and and</div><div id="00:29:55.600" class="transcript_line"> Drogota the only notable events during the voyage were the recovery of a man overboard by LSD-3007</div><div id="00:30:04.480" class="transcript_line"> which took only 15 minutes a really good recovery our diversion to Oran to land seriously of failure</div><div id="00:30:15.120" class="transcript_line"> sailors soldier honor who happily we recovered who happily recovered we later heard to much</div><div id="00:30:25.760" class="transcript_line"> jubilation by all on board we birthed at Spithead on 30th of April 1946 and the ship finally paid</div><div id="00:30:35.440" class="transcript_line"> off there the total number of miles completed by LSD-307 during his commission amounted to 34,968</div><div id="00:30:48.240" class="transcript_line"> and over 3,000 troops and civilians 480 tanks and vehicles and 3,800 tons of stores</div><div id="00:30:58.080" class="transcript_line"> which delivered to strategic destinations during that time the ability of MSTs</div><div id="00:31:07.280" class="transcript_line"> to reach virtually anywhere their shallow draft and vast storage spaces ensured their gainful</div><div id="00:31:19.920" class="transcript_line"> deployment in all phases of operation and this was fully illustrated in both the European and</div><div id="00:31:28.160" class="transcript_line"> Far Eastern campaigns on leaving the Navy in August 46 I joined the family agriculture</div><div id="00:31:36.880" class="transcript_line"> engineering businesses in Boston and Stafford dealing in Ferguson and Massey had its equipment</div><div id="00:31:43.040" class="transcript_line"> of all types in 2015 I was invited to apply for a French decoration and was honoured on returning</div><div id="00:31:54.240" class="transcript_line"> from a trip abroad to find a letter from the French Embassy in London enclosing the medal in</div><div id="00:32:00.480" class="transcript_line"> and signature chevalier de la liga donnaire which was a tremendous surprise and what a really fine</div><div id="00:32:09.840" class="transcript_line"> gesture on the part of the French I thought and that&#039;s about brings it to an end too</div></div></p>
