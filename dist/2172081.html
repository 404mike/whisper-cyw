It&#039;s a clear, strong spirit manufactured from grape pressings or so I&#039;ve been told</div><div id="00:00:19.200" class="transcript_line"> and it appears that licensing regulations are more relaxed than it&#039;s made as a sort</div><div id="00:00:24.000" class="transcript_line"> of home brew. It&#039;s traditional for a small flask and glasses to be brought to your table</div><div id="00:00:29.840" class="transcript_line"> at the end of a meal, sometimes with a complimentary sweet course. I&#039;m pleased if it&#039;s a plate</div><div id="00:00:35.640" class="transcript_line"> of fresh fruit as grapes, apple slices or melon pieces dipped in the spirit is my preferred</div><div id="00:00:41.640" class="transcript_line"> way to consume it. There are other traditions that seem to be associated with it. Men will</div><div id="00:00:48.880" class="transcript_line"> often throw it down like a shot and then slam the empty glass on the table where it&#039;s refilled.</div><div id="00:00:55.520" class="transcript_line"> We also suffered one evening in one of the family restaurants where after already relaxing</div><div id="00:01:00.840" class="transcript_line"> from a hearty meal with plentiful wine we were brought a small flask and drank it slowly</div><div id="00:01:07.160" class="transcript_line"> while listening to the owner&#039;s son playing me traditional music on a liner. When the</div><div id="00:01:11.920" class="transcript_line"> performance had finished we clapped to Ioko enthusiastically as it was clear that he had</div><div id="00:01:17.320" class="transcript_line"> musical skills. He came over to our table with another flask and explained this as from</div><div id="00:01:22.680" class="transcript_line"> his father, the owner of the restaurant. He pointed at a bearded gentleman closer to</div><div id="00:01:28.000" class="transcript_line"> our age sitting in the corner and we both raised glasses to one another. We drank two</div><div id="00:01:33.800" class="transcript_line"> small glasses each of the strong spirit emptying the flask but to our alarm Ioko brought another</div><div id="00:01:39.540" class="transcript_line"> full flask. We didn&#039;t know whether to refuse as bad etiquette so we compromised by ordering</div><div id="00:01:45.440" class="transcript_line"> a flask for Ioko and his father and drank just half of our flask before insisting on</div><div id="00:01:50.320" class="transcript_line"> getting the bill and paying it while I could still see and stand up. In future I vowed</div><div id="00:01:56.040" class="transcript_line"> to always leave a little in the flask to demonstrate clearly that we&#039;d finished for the night.</div><div id="00:02:01.400" class="transcript_line"> On other occasions, particularly if it&#039;s a lunchtime meal, on leaving you may be handed</div><div id="00:02:06.360" class="transcript_line"> a small recycled water bottle with a hushed description, this is my raki, the best. I</div><div id="00:02:12.800" class="transcript_line"> carry a recurrent dread of leaving one of these in the hire car like a lurking unexploded</div><div id="00:02:18.160" class="transcript_line"> bomb, either waiting to spontaneously combust in the heat or almost as bad being mistaken</div><div id="00:02:24.120" class="transcript_line"> for a refreshing drink of water, a large swig of which would probably immediately exceed</div><div id="00:02:29.120" class="transcript_line"> the breathalyzer allowance. Thankfully neither of these have yet occurred, though I do speculate</div><div id="00:02:35.280" class="transcript_line"> how debilitating a new arrival at night at the airport would find their first drive on</div><div id="00:02:40.440" class="transcript_line"> the always exciting Cretan National Road if it was unwittingly enlivened by a hearty swig</div><div id="00:02:46.520" class="transcript_line"> from a forgotten raki bottle found in the hire car.</div><div id="00:02:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The discovery of the raki industry on the island cleared up another mystery when we</div><div id="00:02:55.400" class="transcript_line"> spotted what looked like Anthony Gormley&#039;s foray into recreating the Clangers. Fans</div><div id="00:03:01.080" class="transcript_line"> of 1970s TV will recognise the likeness. They looked ancient and apparently they were distillation</div><div id="00:03:07.520" class="transcript_line"> vessels for creating the spirit, but I quite like them as a sort of metallic homage to</div><div id="00:03:12.560" class="transcript_line"> the Clangers. The abundance of the free raki bottles and the occasional house warming gift</div><div id="00:03:18.080" class="transcript_line"> of a bottle, again the promise this is my own or my uncle&#039;s, my brother&#039;s, father&#039;s</div><div id="00:03:23.360" class="transcript_line"> raki, the best, meant some kind of plan of action was required. We&#039;d heard it was recommended</div><div id="00:03:30.600" class="transcript_line"> for aching joints and muscles, but currently not suffering from those problems and also</div><div id="00:03:35.720" class="transcript_line"> not wanting to go about in the daytime smelling of spirits for obvious reasons. The smell</div><div id="00:03:40.880" class="transcript_line"> in a hot car could also be dangerous. A cafe owner in the town recommended soaking fruit</div><div id="00:03:46.240" class="transcript_line"> in a bottle with a little sugar and turning it daily for a couple of weeks before straining</div><div id="00:03:51.560" class="transcript_line"> off the fruit. This process seems similar to making slow gin, so it certainly sounded</div><div id="00:03:57.520" class="transcript_line"> an option and we may end up with a more palatable drink. We experimented with lemon, strawberries</div><div id="00:04:04.080" class="transcript_line"> and cherries, but balked at the suggestion of coffee to provide a Cretan Tia Maria drink.</div><div id="00:04:10.360" class="transcript_line"> It was a success and proved to be a welcome gift in small bottles to give to friends,</div><div id="00:04:15.360" class="transcript_line"> so the surplus problem was solved.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Archaeology For some visitors to Crete, the wealth of</div><div id="00:04:23.480" class="transcript_line"> archaeological sites on the island is a major attraction. I&#039;d always been impressed by</div><div id="00:04:28.960" class="transcript_line"> the abundance of the sites, but also by their similarity to modern day hill villages. This</div><div id="00:04:34.800" class="transcript_line"> is not true with the royal palaces like Knossos and Malia, both of which we&#039;ve visited and</div><div id="00:04:40.640" class="transcript_line"> vowed to return at a quieter time to try and avoid the crowds.</div><div id="00:04:45.960" class="transcript_line"> The sites that I found more interesting were the Minoan towns like Gurnia to the south</div><div id="00:04:50.520" class="transcript_line"> of us, set in an idyllic position near the coast and covering a relatively large area</div><div id="00:04:55.600" class="transcript_line"> of hillside, sloping down towards the sea. Walking around the site, the width of the</div><div id="00:05:01.680" class="transcript_line"> streets and the footprints of the small houses and the rooms within were so close in scale</div><div id="00:05:07.280" class="transcript_line"> that they were a bit of a different layout to our own and many other traditional villages on the island.</div><div id="00:05:12.160" class="transcript_line"> We can imagine our own village would look very similar if all the houses were demolished</div><div id="00:05:17.000" class="transcript_line"> to leave the walls only one metre high, and the remaining walls in this ancient town appeared</div><div id="00:05:22.640" class="transcript_line"> of very similar construction to what we have seen of our own stone walls during the renovation</div><div id="00:05:27.880" class="transcript_line"> process.</div><div id="00:05:30.880" class="transcript_line"> Archaeologists have dated the settlements back to 3000 years BC, but have since concluded</div><div id="00:05:35.720" class="transcript_line"> that part of the original town was levelled around 1700 BC for the construction of a small</div><div id="00:05:41.840" class="transcript_line"> palace. At its most populous, the town was estimated to have a population of some 4000,</div><div id="00:05:49.320" class="transcript_line"> but excavations suggest the palace was destroyed by fire around 1450 BC, at a time when every</div><div id="00:05:57.300" class="transcript_line"> major Minoan centre was destroyed or abandoned.</div><div id="00:06:01.480" class="transcript_line"> The town was excavated in the early 20th century and is one of the Minoan settlements to be</div><div id="00:06:06.440" class="transcript_line"> fully excavated. The town lies on a small hill a few hundred metres from the coast and</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> in the Gulf of Marabella. The location is an important one, lying on the logical east-west</div><div id="00:06:18.880" class="transcript_line"> route across the island, but also near the north-south route at the narrowest point of</div><div id="00:06:24.200" class="transcript_line"> the island. The routes avoid the mountain heights, allowing easier communications. The</div><div id="00:06:30.600" class="transcript_line"> town was thought to extend down towards the seashore, and evidence of seashore installations</div><div id="00:06:36.080" class="transcript_line"> with excavations by archaeologists, naming a shore house, thought to be a ship shed,</div><div id="00:06:42.120" class="transcript_line"> used as a long and narrow form of boat house. It was a large building, estimated at least</div><div id="00:06:48.280" class="transcript_line"> 25 by 10 metres, incorporating storage rooms as well as ship stores. There are also remains</div><div id="00:06:55.760" class="transcript_line"> of a pier-type promontory foundations, both above water level and extending below the</div><div id="00:07:01.240" class="transcript_line"> water. These are fascinating remains and the Guernier site is heartily recommended for</div><div id="00:07:07.200" class="transcript_line"> a visit, but for us the most interesting detail is in the writings about the site and the</div><div id="00:07:13.720" class="transcript_line"> reference to Minoan houses. A quote from this, An idea of what Minoan houses looked</div><div id="00:07:20.040" class="transcript_line"> like can be gained from the ivory plaques discovered in the east wing of Knossos. These</div><div id="00:07:25.200" class="transcript_line"> plaques show what houses in the town of Knossos looked like in the seventeenth century B.C.</div><div id="00:07:31.880" class="transcript_line"> On the roof there was a small room. This may have been used for sleeping in during the</div><div id="00:07:36.280" class="transcript_line"> hot summer months. The rooms on the first floor had windows, but those on the ground</div><div id="00:07:41.600" class="transcript_line"> floor did not, although some of them had doors on the ground floor. It may be that</div><div id="00:07:46.840" class="transcript_line"> the windows on the ground floor were avoided for simple reasons of security. The houses</div><div id="00:07:52.440" class="transcript_line"> were built around a wooden frame, wooden beams running horizontally and were linked to upright</div><div id="00:07:57.960" class="transcript_line"> beams. The most likely reason for the use of these beams was as protection against earthquake</div><div id="00:08:03.560" class="transcript_line"> damage. I was astounded reading this, as the description so closely matched our own house</div><div id="00:08:09.920" class="transcript_line"> before the renovation. The ground floor lacked a window, these on the first floor, and the</div><div id="00:08:15.560" class="transcript_line"> constructions were reinforced with timbers. As part of the rebuilding works, these were</div><div id="00:08:21.520" class="transcript_line"> replaced with steel frame construction as earthquake protection. There was also mention</div><div id="00:08:27.520" class="transcript_line"> of access between the floors by wooden ladders through a trap door inside the house. Shown</div><div id="00:08:33.160" class="transcript_line"> below is the hatch and ladder staircase when we first saw the house. One thing that has</div><div id="00:08:38.720" class="transcript_line"> always fascinated me about the island was the abundance of stones. Where in Britain</div><div id="00:08:43.680" class="transcript_line"> fields should be subdivided by hedgerows, here there were miles and miles of dry stone</div><div id="00:08:48.640" class="transcript_line"> walls. The stones were often used for elaborate terracing following the steep contours of</div><div id="00:08:54.160" class="transcript_line"> the mountains, but the surprising thing was that the fields and landscapes were still</div><div id="00:08:58.720" class="transcript_line"> covered in large stones. The rural depopulation and abandonment was not enough to explain</div><div id="00:09:04.920" class="transcript_line"> the quantity. It seemed as if despite all the traditional houses, the original paved</div><div id="00:09:10.280" class="transcript_line"> tracks and the boundary walls using these stones, there was still just too many to allow</div><div id="00:09:15.360" class="transcript_line"> the clearance of the land. To me it was a mystery.</div><div id="00:09:20.680" class="transcript_line"> Tree in Daphilos One of my favourite restaurants in our early</div><div id="00:09:25.200" class="transcript_line"> stays was in the next village where you ate out of doors under the stars with a menu that</div><div id="00:09:31.480" class="transcript_line"> was all mezzas and predominantly vegetable dishes. They were always delicious and reasonably</div><div id="00:09:36.120" class="transcript_line"> priced and accompanied by metal flasks of the local house wine, nicely chilled. One</div><div id="00:09:41.840" class="transcript_line"> of the best things about the place was the waiter who was always welcoming but with a</div><div id="00:09:45.960" class="transcript_line"> very dry sense of humour. When it wasn&#039;t busy we would pester him with questions, most</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> of which he would answer with a shrug and a, I don&#039;t know, why do you want to know</div><div id="00:09:54.960" class="transcript_line"> that? He mostly reserved factual replies for questions about the food or recipes and</div><div id="00:10:01.960" class="transcript_line"> in these areas he was helpful. I recall that he was one of the first people to tell us</div><div id="00:10:07.040" class="transcript_line"> the name of the place across the large bay that we had discovered was Thripty but when</div><div id="00:10:12.320" class="transcript_line"> asked what it would be like he retorted, cold I should think, like this wine. One surprise</div><div id="00:10:18.280" class="transcript_line"> was when we asked his name and although he warned us it was unusual, we were amazed to</div><div id="00:10:23.400" class="transcript_line"> be told it was Triandaphalos which translates as rose or literally thirty petals. We were</div><div id="00:10:30.600" class="transcript_line"> disappointed one year to find the restaurant all closed up or the furniture was neatly</div><div id="00:10:35.880" class="transcript_line"> stacked on the terrace part which was covered with a rustic sort of wooden veranda. On later</div><div id="00:10:41.760" class="transcript_line"> visits we discovered that it had reopened but the new proprietor lamented that trade</div><div id="00:10:46.560" class="transcript_line"> was very slow as people seemed to have forgotten about it and in truth it was a little way</div><div id="00:10:51.560" class="transcript_line"> out of town, an upper hill that might deter casual visits. Anyway we stayed and had a</div><div id="00:10:57.360" class="transcript_line"> meal that was as good as it had always been, fava, several different bean dishes, courgette</div><div id="00:11:04.360" class="transcript_line"> balls, grilled aubergines, spicy cheese dips, meatballs and peppers accompanied by home-baked</div><div id="00:11:11.360" class="transcript_line"> bread and local wine. When we finished the owner shared a flask of raggi with us and</div><div id="00:11:17.360" class="transcript_line"> on here in our house was in the upper village, offered us a lift home which was tempting</div><div id="00:11:22.560" class="transcript_line"> but we politely refused saying that the walk up would help us sleep but we promised a return.</div><div id="00:11:28.560" class="transcript_line"> The food was so good that we returned the following week bringing two friends who had</div><div id="00:11:32.360" class="transcript_line"> a shop in the resort. They enjoyed the meal but again we were the only diners. It was</div><div id="00:11:38.120" class="transcript_line"> in the early days of social media and I suggested they try to promote the business on TripAdvisor</div><div id="00:11:44.440" class="transcript_line"> which I wasn&#039;t sure that he saw the point of and our friends also promised to promote</div><div id="00:11:48.840" class="transcript_line"> the business to customers of their shop in the town. I thought no more about it but I</div><div id="00:11:54.200" class="transcript_line"> was pleased to see the following spring that as we walked past one evening the restaurant</div><div id="00:11:58.440" class="transcript_line"> seemed full, so full that we walked by suggesting we went on to somewhere quieter but the owner</div><div id="00:12:04.360" class="transcript_line"> had other plans calling out to us, hey Jeff come in I want to thank you so much. After</div><div id="00:12:10.480" class="transcript_line"> your visit last year your friends kept sending us new customers and we have a good TripAdvisor</div><div id="00:12:15.440" class="transcript_line"> score and things are going so well. I want to thank you for your help you must eat here</div><div id="00:12:20.640" class="transcript_line"> on the house. We were ushered in and treated like honoured guests. We had to go into the</div><div id="00:12:25.840" class="transcript_line"> kitchen where his wife who was the chef would also thank us and a space was cleared out</div><div id="00:12:31.440" class="transcript_line"> front for a table for us and we had a lovely meal for free. Maybe what goes around comes</div><div id="00:12:37.080" class="transcript_line"> around as they say. Wine. Crete has vineyards and produces some very good wine that is</div><div id="00:12:45.680" class="transcript_line"> rarely seen in Britain. We&#039;d seen vineyards on some of the plateaus and had noticed the</div><div id="00:12:50.440" class="transcript_line"> vines tended to be low growing and wired differently to farming methods noticed in Italy or Spain.</div><div id="00:12:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Our reaching out is frequent enough that we control our budget by sticking to the local</div><div id="00:13:01.280" class="transcript_line"> wines served in half or one kilo metal jugs and this white wine is usually served chilled</div><div id="00:13:07.720" class="transcript_line"> and tends to be light and refreshing. When a new taverna opened in our village our first</div><div id="00:13:13.280" class="transcript_line"> meal there was accompanied by the local wine and as sometimes happens a free drink is provided</div><div id="00:13:18.760" class="transcript_line"> at the end of the meal. As we paid our bill a large jug of wine was brought to our table.</div><div id="00:13:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Not wishing to offend we explained we&#039;d only arrived that afternoon and had some unpacking</div><div id="00:13:28.760" class="transcript_line"> and sorting out to do at the house. Where is your house? I pointed out through the side</div><div id="00:13:34.160" class="transcript_line"> window and said it&#039;s just at the back there. We&#039;re neighbours. Oh well take the jug home</div><div id="00:13:39.320" class="transcript_line"> with you it will help you with your unpacking. You can bring it back tomorrow. If we&#039;re not</div><div id="00:13:43.920" class="transcript_line"> open just leave it at the door. On returning the jug the next day to make conversation</div><div id="00:13:49.520" class="transcript_line"> I said how much we&#039;d enjoyed the meal and the wine. The wine can be bought in town.</div><div id="00:13:54.300" class="transcript_line"> You can keep the box in your fridge much cheaper than buying bottles. Always having</div><div id="00:13:59.220" class="transcript_line"> an eye for a bargain and knowing that jugs in the taverna were priced at only three or</div><div id="00:14:03.140" class="transcript_line"> six euros I enquired where I would find the boxes for sale. Do you know Andreas at the</div><div id="00:14:09.140" class="transcript_line"> bottom of the hill going into town? Isn&#039;t that the butcher&#039;s I asked curiously? Yes</div><div id="00:14:14.380" class="transcript_line"> he&#039;s my friend. Tell him Yanni sent you. He will give you my price if you&#039;re lucky.</div><div id="00:14:20.140" class="transcript_line"> So later that week I was parking nearby and entering the first butcher&#039;s shop I tried</div><div id="00:14:24.940" class="transcript_line"> to buy drinks in. Hello we had your wine at Yanni&#039;s Taverna. He said I could buy it here.</div><div id="00:14:32.300" class="transcript_line"> Of course white or red my friend? White please the same as Yanni has. 25 litres is that your</div><div id="00:14:39.140" class="transcript_line"> car nearby it&#039;s quite heavy. I roughly calculated this would be over five gallons and would</div><div id="00:14:44.780" class="transcript_line"> weigh around 50 pounds but also would completely fill the fridge and outlast our three week</div><div id="00:14:50.100" class="transcript_line"> stay by some margin. That&#039;s probably more than I want. Is that the only size you have?</div><div id="00:14:56.180" class="transcript_line"> Oh no 20 litres or 15. Anything smaller I asked tentatively? 10 litres then almost dismissively.</div><div id="00:15:05.900" class="transcript_line"> We also have the smaller five litres. I think that would probably suit us to start with</div><div id="00:15:10.820" class="transcript_line"> and one was produced from behind the counter. Nine euros pardon? Nine of course I thanked him</div><div id="00:15:18.980" class="transcript_line"> paid and stacked out to the butchers with the smallest wine box he had for sale and the largest</div><div id="00:15:24.380" class="transcript_line"> one I&#039;d ever bought while wondering how much the price per litre fairly have bought in bulk say</div><div id="00:15:30.100" class="transcript_line"> 25 litres bulk also working out the profit margin in Tavernas on their wine jug sales. Still I repeat</div><div id="00:15:37.460" class="transcript_line"> I love a bargain.</div></div></p>
