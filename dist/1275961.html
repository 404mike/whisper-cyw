    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> This is chapter 9 of our batch of short stories.</div><div id="00:00:03.680" class="transcript_line"> This next one is about the soldiers actually coming home after being demobilized.</div><div id="00:00:12.320" class="transcript_line"> And the problems that caused for David Lloyd George.</div><div id="00:00:16.240" class="transcript_line"> In the beginning of 1919, as we&#039;ve said, at the end of the war, there were 50 soldier mutinies.</div><div id="00:00:24.320" class="transcript_line"> Over 100,000 men refusing to obey orders, some even forming Bolshevik-style soldiers councils.</div><div id="00:00:32.000" class="transcript_line"> They wanted to be demobilized.</div><div id="00:00:34.480" class="transcript_line"> However, the scheme at the time introduced by Lord Darby meant that those who held important jobs before the war were released first.</div><div id="00:00:43.760" class="transcript_line"> As they were the last to be sent to war, this meant last in first out and caused significant iron anger in the army.</div><div id="00:00:51.760" class="transcript_line"> Especially amongst those soldiers who&#039;d been in the war since the beginning.</div><div id="00:00:56.560" class="transcript_line"> After the election in 1918, during which Lord George had promised instant demobilization,</div><div id="00:01:02.640" class="transcript_line"> Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of War.</div><div id="00:01:06.560" class="transcript_line"> And he introduced a new scheme that meant those with the longest service, most injuries, and over 37 years old, would be sent home first.</div><div id="00:01:18.160" class="transcript_line"> This wasn&#039;t an act of generosity.</div><div id="00:01:19.760" class="transcript_line"> It was mainly because he wanted to create a professional army to fight in Russia.</div><div id="00:01:26.160" class="transcript_line"> In 12 months, the army was reduced from 3.8 million to 900,000 soldiers.</div><div id="00:01:32.480" class="transcript_line"> This did not end their dissatisfaction.</div><div id="00:01:35.520" class="transcript_line"> Soldiers returning home received a railway ticket to their home destination.</div><div id="00:01:40.720" class="transcript_line"> They also got an out of work donation insurance policy,</div><div id="00:01:45.040" class="transcript_line"> which ensured them against unavoidable unemployment of up to 26 weeks in the 12 months following demobilization.</div><div id="00:01:55.680" class="transcript_line"> They received in addition an advance of pay, a fortnight&#039;s ration book,</div><div id="00:02:01.440" class="transcript_line"> and also a voucher, Army Form Z-50, for the return of their great coat to a railway station during leave.</div><div id="00:02:09.840" class="transcript_line"> Soldiers could also choose to either have a clothing allowance of 52 shillings and sixpence,</div><div id="00:02:16.080" class="transcript_line"> or be provided with a suit of plain clothes.</div><div id="00:02:19.760" class="transcript_line"> Final leave beginning the day after he was dispersed.</div><div id="00:02:23.920" class="transcript_line"> For most soldiers, keeping the 52 shillings and sixpence made more sense,</div><div id="00:02:29.040" class="transcript_line"> so they left to go home still in uniform, even with the steel helmet and great coat.</div><div id="00:02:37.040" class="transcript_line"> While on final leave, the soldier was technically still in the army,</div><div id="00:02:43.280" class="transcript_line"> so he could now go about in plain clothes or legally could wear uniform.</div><div id="00:02:49.360" class="transcript_line"> During leave, if the soldier went to a railway station with the great coat, he was paid a pound.</div><div id="00:02:57.440" class="transcript_line"> The fact was that the soldier was getting, even with insurance, less wages than anyone in work,</div><div id="00:03:05.120" class="transcript_line"> and had very little money when he arrived home.</div><div id="00:03:07.600" class="transcript_line"> In reality, these were unhappy and changed men.</div><div id="00:03:10.720" class="transcript_line"> As the Manchester Guardian stated,</div><div id="00:03:13.200" class="transcript_line"> the last three or four years of these men&#039;s lives have been spent in the scientific practice of violence.</div><div id="00:03:20.960" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s undoubtedly true, that must have affected them and their behaviour when they came home.</div><div id="00:03:27.520" class="transcript_line"> When they left for war, they were told they would return as heroes to a better life.</div><div id="00:03:32.480" class="transcript_line"> When they returned, there were fewer jobs, no new housing, rationing.</div><div id="00:03:36.960" class="transcript_line"> Many were also generally angry about the way they&#039;d been treated at the end of the war.</div><div id="00:03:42.160" class="transcript_line"> In port cities that had been booming when they went to war,</div><div id="00:03:45.680" class="transcript_line"> the whole economy had changed for these men and everything else around them.</div><div id="00:03:51.280" class="transcript_line"> Shipping companies had been decimated by war, trade was a problem, and their families,</div><div id="00:03:58.000" class="transcript_line"> well, the women they had left had changed.</div><div id="00:04:02.240" class="transcript_line"> Many had been working in the war industries and their attitudes were different.</div><div id="00:04:07.040" class="transcript_line"> Not surprisingly, when they&#039;d known about or been involved in mutiny on soldiers&#039; union,</div><div id="00:04:15.280" class="transcript_line"> many soldiers became involved in strike action or street violence after they were demobbed.</div><div id="00:04:23.440" class="transcript_line"> Many joining or supporting the sailors&#039; soldier and airmen&#039;s union,</div><div id="00:04:30.560" class="transcript_line"> which was run as a Soviet, a people&#039;s council rather than a standard leader-led union.</div><div id="00:04:36.880" class="transcript_line"> As Simon Webb says, many wearing old army great coats or metal ribbons</div><div id="00:04:42.480" class="transcript_line"> often appeared to be ringleaders when violent protests were taking place.</div><div id="00:04:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Active in industrial dispute situations as organisers of violent elements in the crowd,</div><div id="00:04:56.480" class="transcript_line"> that violence is demonstrated by the destruction of Luton Town Hall in July 1919,</div><div id="00:05:04.960" class="transcript_line"> which occurred because the British government decided to hold a peace day march on the 19th</div><div id="00:05:12.160" class="transcript_line"> July 1919 and across the country, parallel events were set up by local councils.</div><div id="00:05:20.240" class="transcript_line"> In Luton, the council decided to have a large amount of festivities,</div><div id="00:05:24.560" class="transcript_line"> but they denied the discharged sailors&#039; and soldiers&#039; association the right to use a local</div><div id="00:05:30.640" class="transcript_line"> park for religious service. So the ex-servicemen decided instead to arrange a rival march,</div><div id="00:05:38.400" class="transcript_line"> a rival to the Lord Mayor&#039;s procession. The floats and bands of the Mayor&#039;s parade arrived</div><div id="00:05:43.760" class="transcript_line"> at the town hall at the same time as a large group of ex-servicemen, who demanded to know why their</div><div id="00:05:52.080" class="transcript_line"> request to use Wardown Park had been denied. They were ignored and as a consequence the town hall</div><div id="00:06:00.720" class="transcript_line"> was stormed and stoned. The police managed to disperse the crowds, but at 10 pm that night,</div><div id="00:06:07.280" class="transcript_line"> the ex-servicemen returned crowbars, pickaxes and bricks and broke into the town hall,</div><div id="00:06:13.280" class="transcript_line"> and despite the police presence, they burnt it to the ground, joined by civilians.</div><div id="00:06:20.880" class="transcript_line"> Now Luton is just one example of ex-servicemen reacting violently to the situation they returned</div><div id="00:06:32.160" class="transcript_line"> back to. Across the way to the West Midlands and in Swindon and many other areas, there was</div><div id="00:06:40.960" class="transcript_line"> riots and looting involving ex-servicemen. Of course ex-servicemen were seen consistently</div><div id="00:06:51.680" class="transcript_line"> and were arrested as being involved in the race riots across Britain in June, but even as we&#039;ve</div><div id="00:06:59.280" class="transcript_line"> said upon their demobilization, they still were a problem for the British government</div><div id="00:07:05.680" class="transcript_line"> and their disillusionment was an ongoing problem and an ongoing part of the fear</div><div id="00:07:12.880" class="transcript_line"> of David Lloyd George and the government that a Bolshevik uprising was not only possible but likely.</div></div></p>
