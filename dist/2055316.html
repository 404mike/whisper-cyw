working on a project called</div><div id="00:01:03.960" class="transcript_line"> The Myths and Legends of North Wales</div><div id="00:01:06.480" class="transcript_line"> Because guess what?</div><div id="00:01:08.520" class="transcript_line"> Abbegelli is in North Wales, duh!</div><div id="00:01:11.680" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, and in North Wales we have the best stories</div><div id="00:01:16.040" class="transcript_line"> So now we are going to tell you the traditional story of Rhys and Maynia</div><div id="00:01:21.480" class="transcript_line"> A dark and twisted tale</div><div id="00:01:23.520" class="transcript_line"> And then afterwards</div><div id="00:01:24.800" class="transcript_line"> We will tell you</div><div id="00:01:26.160" class="transcript_line"> Our own special version of the story of Rhys and Maynia</div><div id="00:01:30.080" class="transcript_line"> An even darker and twisted tale</div><div id="00:01:33.040" class="transcript_line"> Erm, sorry, there&#039;s no such word as twisted-er</div><div id="00:01:37.440" class="transcript_line"> Okay, an even more dark and twisted tale</div><div id="00:01:41.600" class="transcript_line"> So, first of all, Rhys and Maynia, the traditional version</div><div id="00:01:56.520" class="transcript_line"> Once upon a time, in a beautiful little village called Porthonantyn Gwynedd</div><div id="00:02:01.360" class="transcript_line"> In a small valley at the foot of a mountain</div><div id="00:02:04.240" class="transcript_line"> Beside the sea, there lived two cousins, Rhys and Maynia</div><div id="00:02:09.200" class="transcript_line"> They were childhood sweethearts</div><div id="00:02:12.400" class="transcript_line"> Will you be my sweetheart, Rhys?</div><div id="00:02:14.960" class="transcript_line"> Yes, if you will be mine</div><div id="00:02:17.200" class="transcript_line"> Their favourite place to meet was under an ancient oak tree at the foot of a mountain</div><div id="00:02:23.320" class="transcript_line"> One day, meeting up with the old oak, they decided to get married</div><div id="00:02:27.960" class="transcript_line"> Will you marry me, Rhys?</div><div id="00:02:30.120" class="transcript_line"> Thought you&#039;d never ask</div><div id="00:02:32.720" class="transcript_line"> Hang on a minute</div><div id="00:02:34.040" class="transcript_line"> Cousins aren&#039;t supposed to marry each other, are they?</div><div id="00:02:36.960" class="transcript_line"> I mean, look at the Hasbigs</div><div id="00:02:38.920" class="transcript_line"> Who?</div><div id="00:02:40.080" class="transcript_line"> They were like this royal family</div><div id="00:02:42.400" class="transcript_line"> Ruled Austria, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire for centuries</div><div id="00:02:47.760" class="transcript_line"> Kept marrying their cousins</div><div id="00:02:49.920" class="transcript_line"> And because of all the inbreeding, ended up looking really weird</div><div id="00:02:53.840" class="transcript_line"> With weird sticky-out eyes, weird sticky-out noses and weird sticky-out jaws</div><div id="00:02:59.920" class="transcript_line"> We would</div><div id="00:03:01.600" class="transcript_line"> OK, maybe Rhys and Maynia weren&#039;t cousins then</div><div id="00:03:05.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s only a legend, we can change it</div><div id="00:03:07.720" class="transcript_line"> But they definitely decided to get married</div><div id="00:03:10.440" class="transcript_line"> In Clannog Church</div><div id="00:03:12.280" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a real church, you can go there, big one, quite fancy, posh</div><div id="00:03:18.120" class="transcript_line"> In Rhys and Maynia&#039;s village, there was this old tradition</div><div id="00:03:21.960" class="transcript_line"> Whenever there was a wedding, the bride would get ready in her bridal dress</div><div id="00:03:26.560" class="transcript_line"> Then run off and hide somewhere</div><div id="00:03:28.600" class="transcript_line"> The bride groom would wait in the church</div><div id="00:03:30.680" class="transcript_line"> And all the guests would go and look for the bride</div><div id="00:03:33.560" class="transcript_line"> And find her and bring her back to the church</div><div id="00:03:36.320" class="transcript_line"> Like hide and seek for grown-ups</div><div id="00:03:38.920" class="transcript_line"> So, on the big day, Mayna got ready in her bridal dress</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Then off went Rhys to the church</div><div id="00:03:44.800" class="transcript_line"> And off went Mayna to hide</div><div id="00:03:46.800" class="transcript_line"> And off the guests went to look for her</div><div id="00:03:49.240" class="transcript_line"> Leaving only the priest in the church</div><div id="00:03:51.520" class="transcript_line"> With the excited bride groom</div><div id="00:03:54.600" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t wait for her to come through those doors</div><div id="00:03:57.400" class="transcript_line"> My heart is racing</div><div id="00:03:59.720" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got her a flower, a wildflower</div><div id="00:04:02.720" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;ll like that</div><div id="00:04:03.960" class="transcript_line"> Rhys waited and waited</div><div id="00:04:06.240" class="transcript_line"> And waited</div><div id="00:04:08.200" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re taking a long time, aren&#039;t they, Father Brynne?</div><div id="00:04:11.360" class="transcript_line"> Something must have happened</div><div id="00:04:13.120" class="transcript_line"> Perhaps she&#039;s got lost</div><div id="00:04:14.880" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll find her soon</div><div id="00:04:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Let&#039;s take it forever</div><div id="00:04:18.240" class="transcript_line"> The flower is wilting</div><div id="00:04:27.160" class="transcript_line"> At last</div><div id="00:04:28.880" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s my best man, Tom Ross</div><div id="00:04:31.200" class="transcript_line"> My other friend, Godric</div><div id="00:04:33.400" class="transcript_line"> Mayna&#039;s mam</div><div id="00:04:34.960" class="transcript_line"> All the other guests</div><div id="00:04:36.920" class="transcript_line"> But...</div><div id="00:04:38.880" class="transcript_line"> No Mayna?</div><div id="00:04:40.960" class="transcript_line"> Where is she?</div><div id="00:04:42.760" class="transcript_line"> Please, we can&#039;t find her</div><div id="00:04:45.440" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve looked everywhere</div><div id="00:04:46.600" class="transcript_line"> On the beach</div><div id="00:04:47.480" class="transcript_line"> Around by the dock</div><div id="00:04:48.720" class="transcript_line"> Up on the mountain</div><div id="00:04:49.920" class="transcript_line"> Even in the forest</div><div id="00:04:51.280" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done everything we could to find her</div><div id="00:04:53.400" class="transcript_line"> But she&#039;s just...</div><div id="00:04:54.840" class="transcript_line"> Vanished</div><div id="00:04:55.640" class="transcript_line"> My lovely daughter</div><div id="00:04:56.960" class="transcript_line"> Missing</div><div id="00:04:57.960" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s freezing our thirties</div><div id="00:04:59.560" class="transcript_line"> And you can barely see</div><div id="00:05:01.600" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so sorry, Rhys</div><div id="00:05:03.240" class="transcript_line"> But I think the wedding&#039;s off</div><div id="00:05:05.240" class="transcript_line"> Maybe she&#039;s run away</div><div id="00:05:06.640" class="transcript_line"> A cold feet</div><div id="00:05:07.640" class="transcript_line"> No, she&#039;d never do that</div><div id="00:05:09.360" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;d never abandon me</div><div id="00:05:10.880" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s lost</div><div id="00:05:11.960" class="transcript_line"> Or hurt</div><div id="00:05:13.400" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only possible explanation</div><div id="00:05:15.480" class="transcript_line"> Yes</div><div id="00:05:16.680" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s it</div><div id="00:05:17.480" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s had an accident</div><div id="00:05:19.040" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go and look for her myself</div><div id="00:05:21.120" class="transcript_line"> So the wedding can go on</div><div id="00:05:23.040" class="transcript_line"> Yes</div><div id="00:05:23.880" class="transcript_line"> Do please keep looking for her, Rhys</div><div id="00:05:26.440" class="transcript_line"> Though, even if you find her now</div><div id="00:05:28.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit late for me to marry you today</div><div id="00:05:30.920" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;ll have to be next week</div><div id="00:05:32.960" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t get your hopes up, Rhys</div><div id="00:05:34.640" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve looked for well</div><div id="00:05:36.360" class="transcript_line"> It feels like hours</div><div id="00:05:37.840" class="transcript_line"> And there&#039;s no sign of her at all</div><div id="00:05:39.920" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t understand what it&#039;s like to really love someone</div><div id="00:05:42.560" class="transcript_line"> Do you, Thomas?</div><div id="00:05:44.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to look for her</div><div id="00:05:45.560" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m going to go on looking until I find her</div><div id="00:05:48.640" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s what he did</div><div id="00:05:50.440" class="transcript_line"> Rhys looked for Mania for the rest of the day</div><div id="00:05:53.200" class="transcript_line"> And for many days after that</div><div id="00:05:55.080" class="transcript_line"> And for many weeks</div><div id="00:05:56.280" class="transcript_line"> And for many months</div><div id="00:05:57.440" class="transcript_line"> I will never give up</div><div id="00:05:59.600" class="transcript_line"> God</div><div id="00:06:00.840" class="transcript_line"> If you&#039;ll only bring her back to me</div><div id="00:06:02.960" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll go to the church every week</div><div id="00:06:05.360" class="transcript_line"> And help Father Bryn with the Sunday school for the rest of my days</div><div id="00:06:08.960" class="transcript_line"> I promise</div><div id="00:06:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Just help me to find her again</div><div id="00:06:13.120" class="transcript_line"> But Rhys never did find Mania</div><div id="00:06:15.480" class="transcript_line"> And slowly, slowly</div><div id="00:06:17.640" class="transcript_line"> He went mad with grief</div><div id="00:06:20.040" class="transcript_line"> One day when Rhys was wandering round the mountain looking for Mania</div><div id="00:06:23.760" class="transcript_line"> A terrible storm blew up</div><div id="00:06:25.600" class="transcript_line"> He took shelter by his and Mania&#039;s favourite old oak tree</div><div id="00:06:29.200" class="transcript_line"> While he was sheltering</div><div id="00:06:30.440" class="transcript_line"> Lightning hit the tree</div><div id="00:06:31.880" class="transcript_line"> BOOM</div><div id="00:06:37.360" class="transcript_line"> And the tree split open</div><div id="00:06:41.200" class="transcript_line"> To reveal inside</div><div id="00:06:42.720" class="transcript_line"> A skeleton dressed in what was left of a wedding gown</div><div id="00:06:47.080" class="transcript_line"> Bones</div><div id="00:06:48.480" class="transcript_line"> Just bones</div><div id="00:06:50.840" class="transcript_line"> And a little piece of her dress</div><div id="00:06:52.480" class="transcript_line"> Mania had hidden in the old oak</div><div id="00:06:55.080" class="transcript_line"> She wheezed it in through a tiny crack</div><div id="00:06:58.160" class="transcript_line"> And then got stuck</div><div id="00:07:00.560" class="transcript_line"> She starved to death, poor Mania</div><div id="00:07:02.960" class="transcript_line"> Poor Rhys</div><div id="00:07:04.080" class="transcript_line"> For the story has it</div><div id="00:07:05.960" class="transcript_line"> That Rhys then also died of a broken heart</div><div id="00:07:10.520" class="transcript_line"> Well, we told you it was a dark and twisted tale</div><div id="00:07:14.320" class="transcript_line"> But if you think that was dark and twisted</div><div id="00:07:17.120" class="transcript_line"> Wait until you get a load of our version of the story</div><div id="00:07:20.080" class="transcript_line"> Here we go</div><div id="00:07:21.920" class="transcript_line"> Rhys and Mania</div><div id="00:07:23.760" class="transcript_line"> The Abigail Youth Shag Gothic version</div><div id="00:07:26.880" class="transcript_line"> So, in our version</div><div id="00:07:29.040" class="transcript_line"> The real truth behind the story is that</div><div id="00:07:31.640" class="transcript_line"> Rhys and Mania</div><div id="00:07:33.640" class="transcript_line"> Are the real truth behind the story</div><div id="00:07:36.240" class="transcript_line"> And the real truth behind the story</div><div id="00:07:38.520" class="transcript_line"> The real version, the real truth behind the legend is</div><div id="00:07:42.200" class="transcript_line"> That Mania had fallen in love with Rhys&#039; best friend, Thomas</div><div id="00:07:46.280" class="transcript_line"> And they were having a sneaky affair</div><div id="00:07:49.320" class="transcript_line"> The day before the wedding</div><div id="00:07:50.880" class="transcript_line"> They met up in Thomas&#039; cottage</div><div id="00:07:52.960" class="transcript_line"> For what was supposed to be the last time</div><div id="00:07:55.880" class="transcript_line"> Oh, what am I going to do, Tom?</div><div id="00:07:58.440" class="transcript_line"> I just don&#039;t want to marry him anymore</div><div id="00:08:01.120" class="transcript_line"> Then don&#039;t</div><div id="00:08:02.400" class="transcript_line"> Run away with me instead</div><div id="00:08:04.760" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s tomorrow</div><div id="00:08:06.160" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t let him down</div><div id="00:08:07.840" class="transcript_line"> Let the whole village down</div><div id="00:08:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you can</div><div id="00:08:11.320" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t love him</div><div id="00:08:12.640" class="transcript_line"> You love me</div><div id="00:08:13.880" class="transcript_line"> Run away with me, Mania</div><div id="00:08:15.960" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t, he loves me</div><div id="00:08:17.680" class="transcript_line"> And you know Rhys</div><div id="00:08:19.520" class="transcript_line"> If I disappear</div><div id="00:08:20.880" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;ll come looking for me</div><div id="00:08:22.640" class="transcript_line"> And he&#039;ll never stop</div><div id="00:08:23.960" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;ll go on and on</div><div id="00:08:25.360" class="transcript_line"> Until he finds me</div><div id="00:08:26.880" class="transcript_line"> Finds us</div><div id="00:08:28.440" class="transcript_line"> What if we were to get on a boat?</div><div id="00:08:30.720" class="transcript_line"> Go and live in some other country</div><div id="00:08:32.960" class="transcript_line"> He&#039;ll follow me wherever I go</div><div id="00:08:35.440" class="transcript_line"> Oh, I wish I could die</div><div id="00:08:37.760" class="transcript_line"> Did you say die?</div><div id="00:08:40.160" class="transcript_line"> Hang on a minute</div><div id="00:08:41.120" class="transcript_line"> I think I have an idea</div><div id="00:08:43.040" class="transcript_line"> That night</div><div id="00:08:43.960" class="transcript_line"> If you were to pass through the graveyard of Clunagh Church</div><div id="00:08:47.440" class="transcript_line"> You would have seen a very strange sight</div><div id="00:08:55.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m not sure I can go through with this, Tom</div><div id="00:08:58.840" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to go home?</div><div id="00:09:00.520" class="transcript_line"> No, but I feel really bad about this</div><div id="00:09:02.800" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s not exactly ethical, is it?</div><div id="00:09:05.120" class="transcript_line"> What we&#039;re doing?</div><div id="00:09:06.280" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the only way</div><div id="00:09:09.400" class="transcript_line"> All right, this is really what it takes</div><div id="00:09:12.360" class="transcript_line"> Pass me the lantern</div><div id="00:09:13.760" class="transcript_line"> Hey, this is my father&#039;s grave</div><div id="00:09:16.280" class="transcript_line"> You always hated him</div><div id="00:09:18.320" class="transcript_line"> Revenge at last</div><div id="00:09:20.280" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:09:21.160" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t be dumb, Mania</div><div id="00:09:22.680" class="transcript_line"> It needs to be a woman</div><div id="00:09:24.600" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t call me dumb</div><div id="00:09:26.320" class="transcript_line"> And aren&#039;t men&#039;s and women&#039;s skeletons the same?</div><div id="00:09:29.760" class="transcript_line"> No, they&#039;re completely different</div><div id="00:09:32.280" class="transcript_line"> Well, I didn&#039;t know that</div><div id="00:09:34.120" class="transcript_line"> How would I know that?</div><div id="00:09:35.760" class="transcript_line"> Just start looking for a woman&#039;s grave</div><div id="00:09:39.200" class="transcript_line"> We just split up in case we call</div><div id="00:09:41.400" class="transcript_line"> Easier to find a convincing excuse if it&#039;s just one of us</div><div id="00:09:44.640" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, what convincing excuse would that be?</div><div id="00:09:49.560" class="transcript_line"> Here, what about this one with all the flowers?</div><div id="00:09:52.440" class="transcript_line"> Jackpot, pass me the shovel</div><div id="00:09:59.760" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s that?</div><div id="00:10:00.840" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, Tom, someone&#039;s coming</div><div id="00:10:03.480" class="transcript_line"> Must be Father Brent</div><div id="00:10:04.960" class="transcript_line"> Quick, behind the graveyard, hide</div><div id="00:10:09.080" class="transcript_line"> That was a close shave</div><div id="00:10:10.920" class="transcript_line"> Or a close grave</div><div id="00:10:13.040" class="transcript_line"> I love your jokes, Tom, but not now</div><div id="00:10:16.320" class="transcript_line"> Who&#039;s there?</div><div id="00:10:17.960" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, it wasn&#039;t the priest, it&#039;s</div><div id="00:10:20.480" class="transcript_line"> Godric</div><div id="00:10:21.920" class="transcript_line"> Tom, what the hell are you doing?</div><div id="00:10:25.320" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re digging up a grave?</div><div id="00:10:27.400" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;d better come clean</div><div id="00:10:29.120" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve been having a secret affair behind Reacher&#039;s back</div><div id="00:10:32.040" class="transcript_line"> And now we&#039;re digging up a body</div><div id="00:10:33.880" class="transcript_line"> So we can fake Maynard&#039;s death</div><div id="00:10:35.680" class="transcript_line"> So she doesn&#039;t have to marry him</div><div id="00:10:38.040" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re going to hide the body in this stupid old oak tree</div><div id="00:10:41.360" class="transcript_line"> So we won&#039;t find it for a while</div><div id="00:10:43.440" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;ll explain why it&#039;s all rotted away</div><div id="00:10:46.600" class="transcript_line"> By then we&#039;ll be far away, married</div><div id="00:10:50.040" class="transcript_line"> Epic plan</div><div id="00:10:51.400" class="transcript_line"> You can turn us in now</div><div id="00:10:53.440" class="transcript_line"> Turn you in? No way</div><div id="00:10:55.680" class="transcript_line"> Anything, just right, Elise</div><div id="00:10:57.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve always hated him</div><div id="00:10:59.080" class="transcript_line"> Give me the shovel</div><div id="00:11:00.160" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ll dig up this body for you in no time</div><div id="00:11:03.840" class="transcript_line"> Tom, I think I&#039;ve hit the coffin</div><div id="00:11:22.560" class="transcript_line"> OK, we need to lift out</div><div id="00:11:24.400" class="transcript_line"> Oh wow, it&#039;s heavy, I thought</div><div id="00:11:28.040" class="transcript_line"> Right, let&#039;s pry this open</div><div id="00:11:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Have to wedge the shovel</div><div id="00:11:35.400" class="transcript_line"> Into the space</div><div id="00:11:37.520" class="transcript_line"> Put some mud in the bottom</div><div id="00:11:40.640" class="transcript_line"> Get on with it</div><div id="00:11:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We haven&#039;t got all night</div><div id="00:11:46.840" class="transcript_line"> There it is, one skeleton</div><div id="00:11:49.880" class="transcript_line"> Yuck</div><div id="00:11:51.080" class="transcript_line"> Lift it out quick and shove it in the sack</div><div id="00:11:53.680" class="transcript_line"> What if they realise it&#039;s missing?</div><div id="00:11:56.200" class="transcript_line"> We need to put the coffin back and fill the hole in</div><div id="00:11:59.720" class="transcript_line"> Really? We&#039;ll be here all night</div><div id="00:12:02.800" class="transcript_line"> Just fill it in Godric</div><div id="00:12:14.880" class="transcript_line"> The next day, Meenir got dressed in her bridal finery</div><div id="00:12:18.880" class="transcript_line"> And went running off, as she told the wedding guests, to hide</div><div id="00:12:23.360" class="transcript_line"> In fact, she ran as fast as she could to Tom&#039;s cottage</div><div id="00:12:27.720" class="transcript_line"> Meanwhile, Rhys, the proud groom, stood waiting in the church</div><div id="00:12:32.640" class="transcript_line"> As Tom, Godric and the other wedding guests</div><div id="00:12:35.840" class="transcript_line"> Set off on a traditional search for the bride</div><div id="00:12:38.960" class="transcript_line"> I can&#039;t wait for us to come through those doors</div><div id="00:12:41.800" class="transcript_line"> My heart is racing</div><div id="00:12:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got a flower, a wild flower</div><div id="00:12:47.280" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;ll like that</div><div id="00:12:48.720" class="transcript_line"> But really, Tom and Godric secretly headed at top speed to Tom&#039;s cottage</div><div id="00:12:53.720" class="transcript_line"> To meet Meenir there</div><div id="00:12:55.360" class="transcript_line"> Quick, we haven&#039;t much time</div><div id="00:12:57.320" class="transcript_line"> Meenir, get your dress off</div><div id="00:12:59.720" class="transcript_line"> Turn you back, Godric</div><div id="00:13:01.840" class="transcript_line"> Godric, where&#039;s the sack?</div><div id="00:13:03.440" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got it here</div><div id="00:13:04.600" class="transcript_line"> Tip it out then</div><div id="00:13:06.720" class="transcript_line"> OK, let&#039;s get the dress on the skeleton, head first</div><div id="00:13:10.880" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not the head hole, Godric, that&#039;s an arm hole</div><div id="00:13:14.960" class="transcript_line"> How would I know?</div><div id="00:13:16.640" class="transcript_line"> Now you&#039;re putting it on backwards</div><div id="00:13:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Oh no, the skeleton&#039;s falling to bits</div><div id="00:13:23.160" class="transcript_line"> How are we going to put that lot back together?</div><div id="00:13:25.240" class="transcript_line"> Just have to try, Godric, pass me that leg</div><div id="00:13:28.840" class="transcript_line"> Sometime later, Meenir, dressed in her ordinary clothes</div><div id="00:13:32.760" class="transcript_line"> Secretly slipped away to start her new life</div><div id="00:13:35.720" class="transcript_line"> While Thomas and Godric rejoined the other guests and headed for the church</div><div id="00:13:45.440" class="transcript_line"> Rhys, we can&#039;t find her</div><div id="00:13:48.080" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve looked everywhere, on the beach, round by the dock</div><div id="00:13:51.360" class="transcript_line"> Up on the mountain, even in the forest</div><div id="00:13:53.960" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve done everything we could to find her, but she&#039;s just vanished</div><div id="00:13:58.280" class="transcript_line"> My lovely daughter, missing</div><div id="00:14:00.640" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s freezing out there, Rhys, and you can barely see</div><div id="00:14:04.280" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m so sorry, Rhys, but I think the wedding&#039;s off</div><div id="00:14:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Maybe she&#039;s run away, like a cold feet</div><div id="00:14:11.280" class="transcript_line"> No, she&#039;d never do that, she&#039;d never abandon me</div><div id="00:14:15.200" class="transcript_line"> She&#039;s lost, or hurt</div><div id="00:14:18.160" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s the only possible explanation</div><div id="00:14:20.360" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to go and look for her myself</div><div id="00:14:22.760" class="transcript_line"> So the wedding can go on</div><div id="00:14:24.560" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t get your hopes up, Rhys, we&#039;ve looked for...</div><div id="00:14:27.640" class="transcript_line"> Well, it feels like hours, and there&#039;s no sign of her at all</div><div id="00:14:31.440" class="transcript_line"> You don&#039;t understand what it&#039;s like to really love someone, do you, Thomas?</div><div id="00:14:35.600" class="transcript_line"> Hmm, little does he know</div><div id="00:14:38.680" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m going to look for her, and I&#039;m going to go on looking until I find her</div><div id="00:14:43.320" class="transcript_line"> And offset Rhys on his hopeless search</div><div id="00:14:46.520" class="transcript_line"> Two days later, having secretly planted the skeleton in the oak tree</div><div id="00:14:51.440" class="transcript_line"> Thomas announced to Rhys that he&#039;d found a new job</div><div id="00:14:55.120" class="transcript_line"> and left the village to join Mania in a hotel in Rhyl</div><div id="00:14:59.280" class="transcript_line"> And Rhys carried on looking and gradually went mad</div><div id="00:15:02.320" class="transcript_line"> until the day he eventually found the skeleton he thought was Mania&#039;s in the tray</div><div id="00:15:06.600" class="transcript_line"> And Godric never said a word</div><div id="00:15:09.360" class="transcript_line"> And Mania and Thomas lived happily ever after</div><div id="00:15:13.920" class="transcript_line"> In Rhyl</div><div id="00:15:15.040" class="transcript_line"> And that is our version of the story of Rhys and Mania</div><div id="00:15:19.320" class="transcript_line"> Choose to believe whichever one you write</div><div id="00:15:21.760" class="transcript_line"> But we think the one that&#039;s the most fun is the one by the...</div><div id="00:15:25.560" class="transcript_line"> Abigail Ushad!
