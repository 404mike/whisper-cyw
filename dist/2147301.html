When my mom used to go out</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> to visit someone I just take some clothes</div><div id="00:09:34.000" class="transcript_line"> out and cut the clothes. I was very little, I was in fifth</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> grade and I used to cut them and stitch them and sew them</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> because when mom is home she won&#039;t let me do it. I was so</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> young but that was my hobby and still the same</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> it developed. Stitching</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> embroidery, knitting, these were the things in our times</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> and there was no internet, no</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> television when we was quite old.

When did you arrive in the UK</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and what was the motive? What was the reason to</div><div id="00:11:34.000" class="transcript_line"> come over to the UK?

same time same night</div><div id="00:15:14.000" class="transcript_line"> priest was there and close family members was there</div><div id="00:15:18.000" class="transcript_line"> and the nikah happened</div><div id="00:15:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and I have</div><div id="00:15:26.000" class="transcript_line"> I was quite calm that time wasn&#039;t anxious or anything</div><div id="00:15:30.000" class="transcript_line"> So what were the first six months like then?</div><div id="00:15:34.000" class="transcript_line"> If the first meeting was hard what was the first six months like?</div><div id="00:15:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Six months yes that was quite different</div><div id="00:15:42.000" class="transcript_line"> than the family I come from</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and I wasn&#039;t expecting because these people when they go</div><div id="00:15:50.000" class="transcript_line"> back to Pakistan they flatter a lot</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> this is there and we got this and we got that</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> but all I was disappointed</div><div id="00:16:02.000" class="transcript_line"> because obviously in your family may be the same</div><div id="00:16:06.000" class="transcript_line"> the life is like this perhaps</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> my husband&#039;s family they come from a village for them</div><div id="00:16:14.000" class="transcript_line"> they may be a lot but because I had everything</div><div id="00:16:18.000" class="transcript_line"> more than these things in my house over there</div><div id="00:16:22.000" class="transcript_line"> there wasn&#039;t any excitement</div><div id="00:16:26.000" class="transcript_line"> about those things which is a basic</div><div id="00:16:30.000" class="transcript_line"> household things and like that</div><div id="00:16:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was the most important thing you had to leave behind then?</div><div id="00:16:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Looking back on those six months let&#039;s say two in a year</div><div id="00:16:42.000" class="transcript_line"> what do you feel you left behind that you really could have missed?</div><div id="00:16:46.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s the parents and my family</div><div id="00:16:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I used to miss my mother because in those days</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> people wasn&#039;t traveling back</div><div id="00:16:58.000" class="transcript_line"> very quickly in this state</div><div id="00:17:02.000" class="transcript_line"> first time I went back was five years</div><div id="00:17:06.000" class="transcript_line"> obviously we missed parents and friends</div><div id="00:17:10.000" class="transcript_line"> it&#039;s not easy to make when you&#039;re staying home</div><div id="00:17:14.000" class="transcript_line"> you can&#039;t make many friends easily</div><div id="00:17:18.000" class="transcript_line"> So okay then let&#039;s extend that time first two years</div><div id="00:17:22.000" class="transcript_line"> what were the best things and what were the worst things?</div><div id="00:17:26.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband was very very</div><div id="00:17:30.000" class="transcript_line"> supportive and he wasn&#039;t like</div><div id="00:17:34.000" class="transcript_line"> making any he never said anything</div><div id="00:17:38.000" class="transcript_line"> whatever he is he was very</div><div id="00:17:42.000" class="transcript_line"> honest with me</div><div id="00:17:46.000" class="transcript_line"> that was the big support for me we lived with the family</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and obviously in laws are in laws</div><div id="00:17:54.000" class="transcript_line"> they pick on every little things</div><div id="00:17:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sleeping late I&#039;m waking up late if we wake up</div><div id="00:18:02.000" class="transcript_line"> early it&#039;s no good things like that</div><div id="00:18:06.000" class="transcript_line"> clean the house do this which we never used to</div><div id="00:18:10.000" class="transcript_line"> but I did it all I know we have to do everything</div><div id="00:18:14.000" class="transcript_line"> but slowly slowly I learned many things from my mother in law as well</div><div id="00:18:18.000" class="transcript_line"> because</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> then I had my daughter</div><div id="00:18:26.000" class="transcript_line"> two years later</div><div id="00:18:30.000" class="transcript_line"> but I start working after about</div><div id="00:18:34.000" class="transcript_line"> seven eight months I went out and find a job whatever I can</div><div id="00:18:38.000" class="transcript_line"> find and I start working</div><div id="00:18:42.000" class="transcript_line"> what was it like when you first moved into what was it like?</div><div id="00:18:46.000" class="transcript_line"> My in laws house</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> they had a big reasonable house five bedroom</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> but the decoration it was</div><div id="00:18:58.000" class="transcript_line"> up to living standard better than</div><div id="00:19:02.000" class="transcript_line"> normal people who was living here in those days it was better than theirs</div><div id="00:19:06.000" class="transcript_line"> they had all facilities like washing machine and</div><div id="00:19:10.000" class="transcript_line"> telephone in those days telephone was very few people used to have</div><div id="00:19:14.000" class="transcript_line"> a phone in their house because all their my</div><div id="00:19:18.000" class="transcript_line"> husband and his brothers they was all in universities</div><div id="00:19:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and all that so they knew all these things</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> and they tried to provide their parents though my father in law</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> was very illiterate but he was very sensible</div><div id="00:19:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and he tried to control everything even if</div><div id="00:19:38.000" class="transcript_line"> my sometimes my mother in law she little bit harsh</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> to me he tried to calm her down and</div><div id="00:19:46.000" class="transcript_line"> give us a comfort as well he was very nice and kind person</div><div id="00:19:50.000" class="transcript_line"> so everything was sort of okay</div><div id="00:19:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So how about culturally food wise</div><div id="00:19:58.000" class="transcript_line"> when you arrived here what was the stark</div><div id="00:20:02.000" class="transcript_line"> difference did you notice anything or what could you say about that?</div><div id="00:20:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously you feel taste and food</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> different here when you first come</div><div id="00:20:14.000" class="transcript_line"> especially milk was</div><div id="00:20:18.000" class="transcript_line"> taste different meat was taste different from back home</div><div id="00:20:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and slowly slowly we adopt</div><div id="00:20:26.000" class="transcript_line"> we used to it water taste was even different</div><div id="00:20:30.000" class="transcript_line"> in Mumbai?</div><div id="00:20:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know it was taste was different</div><div id="00:20:38.000" class="transcript_line"> like from one place to the other if you go</div><div id="00:20:42.000" class="transcript_line"> from here to Manchester water taste is different it was similar</div><div id="00:20:46.000" class="transcript_line"> it was coming here and it was different to me</div><div id="00:20:50.000" class="transcript_line"> and food was totally different taste</div><div id="00:20:54.000" class="transcript_line"> What was your first job like? I work in a factory they used to</div><div id="00:20:58.000" class="transcript_line"> make a blinds</div><div id="00:21:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Tell me more about that job did you enjoy it?</div><div id="00:21:06.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a necessity that time coming out of the house</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> and be independent and I was thinking if</div><div id="00:21:14.000" class="transcript_line"> because when I came here my husbands graduation was</div><div id="00:21:18.000" class="transcript_line"> after I was here I went to his graduation so he hasn&#039;t had any job before</div><div id="00:21:22.000" class="transcript_line"> and he</div><div id="00:21:26.000" class="transcript_line"> he start working and I start working so I can help each other</div><div id="00:21:30.000" class="transcript_line"> we can help each other and buy our own house</div><div id="00:21:34.000" class="transcript_line"> something</div><div id="00:21:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I was fully support to my husband and he support to me</div><div id="00:21:42.000" class="transcript_line"> he never hide anything from me even though sometimes</div><div id="00:21:46.000" class="transcript_line"> parents say don&#039;t tell this to your wife or anything but he was very honest</div><div id="00:21:50.000" class="transcript_line"> he said no I can&#039;t do that he was very respectful</div><div id="00:21:54.000" class="transcript_line"> to his parents as well but he was very</div><div id="00:21:58.000" class="transcript_line"> honest with me and throughout my life he was very supportive</div><div id="00:22:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Maintaining links back home what did you do to maintain</div><div id="00:22:10.000" class="transcript_line"> connection and the cultural practices what habits did you</div><div id="00:22:14.000" class="transcript_line"> inform or what did you do to try and maintain some link with back home?</div><div id="00:22:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Write a letter</div><div id="00:22:22.000" class="transcript_line"> sometime we make book a call in those days</div><div id="00:22:26.000" class="transcript_line"> we have to book a call and talk to my parents</div><div id="00:22:30.000" class="transcript_line"> mostly writing letters</div><div id="00:22:34.000" class="transcript_line"> What kind of thing did you talk about in your letters?</div><div id="00:22:38.000" class="transcript_line"> I never told them if I have a little bit hard time here</div><div id="00:22:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I never told my parents anything about that</div><div id="00:22:46.000" class="transcript_line"> and I was thinking that&#039;s the normal thing it can happen if I was in Pakistan</div><div id="00:22:50.000" class="transcript_line"> so I tell them if they can&#039;t do anything about it</div><div id="00:22:54.000" class="transcript_line"> so those things I never told them</div><div id="00:22:58.000" class="transcript_line"> the other things I&#039;m doing this and asking</div><div id="00:23:02.000" class="transcript_line"> them how they are doing and that&#039;s all</div><div id="00:23:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I was writing letters so they feel comfortable about me</div><div id="00:23:10.000" class="transcript_line"> So as part of this project the people&#039;s collection is the website and has</div><div id="00:23:14.000" class="transcript_line"> space for multimedia work as well so it means if you have</div><div id="00:23:18.000" class="transcript_line"> original letters or photographs or monuments</div><div id="00:23:22.000" class="transcript_line"> or anything like that they can be scanned to place with your story</div><div id="00:23:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you have anything that may be of interest to preserve for the future?</div><div id="00:23:30.000" class="transcript_line"> What type of photograph?</div><div id="00:23:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything that feels good with your story it&#039;s up to you but the idea is it will be professionally</div><div id="00:23:38.000" class="transcript_line"> scanned they have professional scanners that come and they do it very high resolution</div><div id="00:23:42.000" class="transcript_line"> After I came to this country or before my Pakistan photographs</div><div id="00:23:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I think anything is your opinion</div><div id="00:23:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t have any opinion here it&#039;s about if you want to add anything that&#039;s beyond audio</div><div id="00:23:54.000" class="transcript_line"> and transcription if you want to add anything to your story</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> so people are doing their wedding photograph or they&#039;re doing their picture of their mother</div><div id="00:24:02.000" class="transcript_line"> or whoever it may be and we attach it to the story</div><div id="00:24:06.000" class="transcript_line"> so when people read or listen they get to see a picture or photograph</div><div id="00:24:10.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s up to you</div><div id="00:24:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I have photographs and I have to dig into it</div><div id="00:24:18.000" class="transcript_line">

id="00:24:26.000" class="transcript_line"> as they go through the process they may call you and say would you like to add something</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> and they&#039;ll book a day where you can bring them in and the professional will come and they set up the cameras</div><div id="00:24:34.000" class="transcript_line"> and stuff like that to do high resolution scanners</div><div id="00:24:38.000" class="transcript_line"> What would you like to pass on to your children, grandchildren, great great great grandchildren</div><div id="00:24:44.000"

Yes the best thing I will tell them about the faith</div><div id="00:25:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Live the life whichever way they feel comfortable</div><div id="00:25:12.000" class="transcript_line"> but don&#039;t stop practicing</div><div id="00:25:16.000" class="transcript_line"> and your faith</div><div id="00:25:20.000" class="transcript_line"> We are Muslim, we should stay Muslim</div><div id="00:25:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and die as a Muslim, it doesn&#039;t matter</div><div id="00:25:28.000" class="transcript_line"> we are Muslim, we should stay

main thing</div><div id="00:25:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Is there anything you would like to tell them about the way you lived your life</div><div id="00:25:44.000" class="transcript_line"> or how you encouraged them to live their life</div><div id="00:25:48.000" class="transcript_line"> as well, the faith is an important part</div><div id="00:25:52.000" class="transcript_line"> any morals
