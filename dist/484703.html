    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Steve stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swickr Carnival who have</div><div id="00:00:09.040" class="transcript_line"> organised Cardiff Carnival ever since. Steve story number seven. Cardiff Carnival finales</div><div id="00:00:16.880" class="transcript_line"> on the steps of the National Museum of Wales. The highlight of every Cardiff Carnival over</div><div id="00:00:22.880" class="transcript_line"> the past 25 years has been a spectacular costume parade featuring hundreds of flamboyant paraders,</div><div id="00:00:29.360" class="transcript_line"> dancers and street musicians. However, over the years once the parade has finished there have</div><div id="00:00:36.320" class="transcript_line"> been various opportunities to present finales in different locations around the city.</div><div id="00:00:42.480" class="transcript_line"> In the mid 1990s the Carnival camp was hosted at Cateys Youth Centre and the parade route included</div><div id="00:00:49.280" class="transcript_line"> passing through the Civic Centre, past the doors of the Welsh office which was then the seat of</div><div id="00:00:55.120" class="transcript_line"> government in Wales. The site chosen for the finale presentation of the Carnival after the parade</div><div id="00:01:03.920" class="transcript_line"> was the steps of the National Museum of Wales. The various landings, levels and ledges of these</div><div id="00:01:10.720" class="transcript_line"> massive steps offered multiple layers of stages and platforms on which to perform and present</div><div id="00:01:17.840" class="transcript_line"> all the many different costumes and dance groups with great sight lines for our family audiences.</div><div id="00:01:23.360" class="transcript_line"> Here against the background of the Museum&#039;s towering classical pillars and overhanging ornate</div><div id="00:01:28.960" class="transcript_line"> portico, Cardiff Carnival would culminate with a crescendo of massed performance, dance, drumming</div><div id="00:01:35.680" class="transcript_line"> and singing. However, our first use of the National Steps Museum steps for the 1993 Cardiff Carnival</div><div id="00:01:44.880" class="transcript_line"> which was called Nightmass was almost the last. A key part of that year&#039;s finale presentation</div><div id="00:01:54.400" class="transcript_line"> involved a dramatic fight between good and evil. A troop of horned and leering, blood-red, body</div><div id="00:02:00.400" class="transcript_line"> painted devils were armed with powerful pump-action water pistols filled to the brim with scarlet dye.</div><div id="00:02:08.240" class="transcript_line"> Their adversaries were a group of singing and dancing angels with large wings</div><div id="00:02:13.360" class="transcript_line"> all dressed in purest white. So as the sun began to set the devils proceeded to attack the angels</div><div id="00:02:21.040" class="transcript_line"> and appear to mercilessly slaughter them all. The angels&#039; glowing white costumes were completely</div><div id="00:02:27.200" class="transcript_line"> splattered with fake blood and they collapsed to the floor, much to the horror of our audience.</div><div id="00:02:34.160" class="transcript_line"> Naturally the angel dancers were shortly resurrected, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil,</div><div id="00:02:41.360" class="transcript_line"> much to the relief of the younger children in the audience in particular.</div><div id="00:02:46.320" class="transcript_line"> However, the horror for me was not over. As the next day while passing the steps on the way to</div><div id="00:02:54.000" class="transcript_line"> help with the get out at the carnival camp I realized that the museum steps themselves</div><div id="00:02:59.840" class="transcript_line"> were still splattered with fake blood now disastrously absorbed into the stonework itself.</div><div id="00:03:06.960" class="transcript_line"> So whilst our earlier dress rehearsal on the steps had gone smoothly and stain free,</div><div id="00:03:11.920" class="transcript_line"> it was the case that one over enthusiastic devil had mixed a blood-red dye of a stronger brew.</div><div id="00:03:21.680" class="transcript_line"> Our agreement with the National Museum of Wales was that the steps would be returned as found,</div><div id="00:03:27.680" class="transcript_line"> not tappled with fake blood. Fortunately the museum director kindly agreed to wait three months</div><div id="00:03:35.040" class="transcript_line"> to see if the stained steps reverted to their original condition and, as luck would have it,</div><div id="00:03:41.040" class="transcript_line"> lashings of Welsh rain did indeed remove the offending red coloring and all was forgiven.</div><div id="00:03:49.120" class="transcript_line"> As part of these finale presentations on the museum steps there would be fireworks and</div><div id="00:03:54.240" class="transcript_line"> pyrotechnic special effects including smoke bombs of every color and the very last moments of the</div><div id="00:03:59.920" class="transcript_line"> finale would be marked by the title of that year&#039;s carnival picked out in giant fiery letters</div><div id="00:04:07.360" class="transcript_line"> up on high on the portico roof. These fiery words marked the very last moment of that year&#039;s carnival</div><div id="00:04:14.320" class="transcript_line"> and were the cue for all of the hundreds of costumed carnival revelers to return to the</div><div id="00:04:19.680" class="transcript_line"> steps for a final dance and drum whilst the very large family audiences which were normally over</div><div id="00:04:26.080" class="transcript_line"> 5,000 strong went absolutely crazy and showed their appreciation the best way possible by</div><div id="00:04:32.080" class="transcript_line"> cheering, whistling, clapping and whooping until the last firework had burnt out and darkness</div><div id="00:04:39.120" class="transcript_line"> resumed.</div></div></p>
