the Chequers.</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Then the Cottage.</div><div id="00:08:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Later again it was the Cottage.</div><div id="00:08:44.000" class="transcript_line"> When our boys were little,</div><div id="00:08:46.000" class="transcript_line"> we went to the Cottage.</div><div id="00:08:48.000" class="transcript_line"> The Cottage was a

class="transcript_line"> Yeah, Robin and I used to go out together.</div><div id="00:09:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Very bit.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> But going back further,</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> at the start,</div><div id="00:09:14.000" class="transcript_line"> what we haven&#039;t mentioned,</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Chris will remember, but John,</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> going back to our early days playing in the 50s,</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> we sort of straddled an era</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> because there was still one or two from the 30s,</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> pre-war players still playing.</div><div id="00:09:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember Walter Wood?</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I don&#039;t

id="00:09:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, in the knockouts, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:38.000" class="transcript_line"> They were played for Montgomery then.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Basel and Basel.</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I played against Fred Holloway in the knockouts.</div><div id="00:09:44.000" class="transcript_line"> The other Harold Davies, Brad they used to call him.</div><div id="00:09:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know him.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I know of him, but I can&#039;t remember him playing.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> They used to umpire a little bit still.</div><div id="00:09:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Sid Lewis, do you remember?</div><div id="00:09:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I know the name, but I can&#039;t remember him playing.</div><div id="00:09:56.000" class="transcript_line"> They were still playing a bit.</div><div id="00:09:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Really?</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, in the knockouts, not so much.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> I mean, Walter Wood apparently,</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> he was a master playing with a long outfield</div><div id="00:10:06.000" class="transcript_line"> because he used to hit every ball in the air,</div><div id="00:10:08.000" class="transcript_line"> drop them between the fielders,</div><div id="00:10:10.000" class="transcript_line"> which is clever.</div><div id="00:10:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I mentioned in the interview,</div><div id="00:10:14.000" class="transcript_line"> but they must have been,</div><div id="00:10:16.000" class="transcript_line"> when I first started practice,</div><div id="00:10:18.000" class="transcript_line"> there were pads that must have been there since the year

down there.</div><div id="00:10:24.000" class="transcript_line"> There were some of those still in the pavilion</div><div id="00:10:26.000" class="transcript_line"> that must have been there since the first World War time.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, well, there was pads there with only,</div><div id="00:10:30.000" class="transcript_line"> you know, used to do them with straps and buckles.</div><div id="00:10:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, there was a lot of pads there</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> with only one strap,</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> no buckles.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And those wind round gloves.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Cigar like gloves.</div><div id="00:10:42.000" class="transcript_line"> They had no protect, or little spikes on them.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Or a bit of the padding hanging out.</div><div id="00:10:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Did you ever find a picture</div><div id="00:10:48.000" class="transcript_line"> of the whole pavilion after John?</div><div id="00:10:50.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve got, I&#039;ve got</div><div id="00:10:52.000" class="transcript_line"> two or three</div><div id="00:10:54.000" class="transcript_line"> really of just</div><div id="00:10:56.000" class="transcript_line"> teams sitting in front of the pavilion,</div><div id="00:10:58.000" class="transcript_line"> but only being able to see</div><div id="00:11:00.000" class="transcript_line"> one window in it, Brian.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I had one of the whole thing</div><div id="00:11:04.000" class="transcript_line"> and I sent it high and low.</div><div id="00:11:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t find it.</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, you&#039;ve got another fortnight, three

but</div><div id="00:11:14.000" class="transcript_line"> otherwise...</div><div id="00:11:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there used to be a store shed out the back,</div><div id="00:11:18.000" class="transcript_line"> which is like an ice cream...</div><div id="00:11:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah, pulled it up.</div><div id="00:11:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit dodgy in the floor.</div><div id="00:11:24.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a thing off a lorry.</div><div id="00:11:26.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s right.</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> A canopy off a lorry.</div><div id="00:11:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Behind the pavilion in the wood?</div><div

the pavilion was in the wood.</div><div id="00:11:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, you&#039;ve got the pavilion.</div><div id="00:11:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Was it in the

id="00:11:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:11:58.000" class="transcript_line"> And there were</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> terrible toilets at the back
