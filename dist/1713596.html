    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Firstly, let us say thank you to Heritage Lottery in Wales for enabling us to bring you these podcasts.</div><div id="00:00:09.000" class="transcript_line"> My name is Jamie Baker and I am part of Horn Development Association, HDA, in Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:16.500" class="transcript_line"> And this site, Black Diverse and Welsh, is intended to bring together lots of initiatives</div><div id="00:00:24.500" class="transcript_line"> that we&#039;ve been involved in in terms of Black and Diverse people in Wales.</div><div id="00:00:31.000" class="transcript_line"> But most immediately, a series of episodes, a series of contributions, which are about Cardiff.</div><div id="00:00:38.500" class="transcript_line"> And if you sit outside the Norwegian Church on the bay in Cardiff and in better times have a cup of coffee,</div><div id="00:00:47.500" class="transcript_line"> hopefully this series of podcasts over the next few months will give you an idea what that place you&#039;re looking at used to be,</div><div id="00:00:56.500" class="transcript_line"> what&#039;s happened there and what it represents to the people who live or lived in the streets you, to a large extent, can&#039;t see anymore.</div><div id="00:01:06.500" class="transcript_line"> And this is Matthew Reed.</div><div id="00:01:09.500" class="transcript_line"> For me, I was not born at the tidal bay era. I&#039;m more Buteone.</div><div id="00:01:14.500" class="transcript_line"> My family&#039;s lived in Buteone for Tiger Bay for over 100 years.</div><div id="00:01:20.500" class="transcript_line"> My great-grandfather came over from St. Kitts. My grandfather came over from America as a GI.</div><div id="00:01:26.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s on my mother&#039;s side. On my father&#039;s side, my great-grandfather came over from Cape Verde or Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:01:32.500" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s sort of my little bit of melting pot of being a descendant of the Tiger Bay area, if that makes any sense,</div><div id="00:01:43.500" class="transcript_line"> of what Tiger Bay brought to not only Wales but to the world.</div><div id="00:01:49.500" class="transcript_line"> Truly, you represent the multiculturalism of the...</div><div id="00:01:54.500" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s only one United Nations.</div><div id="00:01:57.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for me, like I said, my mother&#039;s father was a GI from Cincinnati who came here and married my grandmother,</div><div id="00:02:08.500" class="transcript_line"> but they ended up splitting up. My father&#039;s father&#039;s father, Philip, was from Cape Verde.</div><div id="00:02:17.500" class="transcript_line"> My great-grandfather on my mother&#039;s side is from St. Kitts.</div><div id="00:02:21.500" class="transcript_line"> And my grandmother, who he married, was half Egyptian and half English.</div><div id="00:02:26.500" class="transcript_line"> So for me, I&#039;ve got a lot of mixed blood inside me.</div><div id="00:02:30.500" class="transcript_line"> But like I said, in Buteone or maybe even in Tiger Bay at one point, there were many religions and many colours and creeds</div><div id="00:02:37.500" class="transcript_line"> living in this one area, but still everybody had a respect for everybody&#039;s religion.</div><div id="00:02:41.500" class="transcript_line"> Whether people choose to believe that religion is real or not, the respect was still here in Buteone as a multicultural society</div><div id="00:02:50.500" class="transcript_line"> or as a multicultural path, the most multicultural path of Canada.</div><div id="00:02:54.500" class="transcript_line"> And through me going to Mount Stewart Primary School and having Betty Campbell as my headmistress, I will put down to her,</div><div id="00:03:00.500" class="transcript_line"> that lady there, if it weren&#039;t for her, I&#039;m not saying I would have a different aspect on life,</div><div id="00:03:05.500" class="transcript_line"> but through the unlimited assemblies and clans and religions we celebrated in school,</div><div id="00:03:12.500" class="transcript_line"> we were all sort of made to respect each other&#039;s religion, culture, creed.</div><div id="00:03:20.500" class="transcript_line"> And that&#039;s one of the benefits of coming from Tiger Bay and Buteone.</div><div id="00:03:25.500" class="transcript_line"> People talk about Betty Campbell in a really, really special way.</div><div id="00:03:31.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because she was, someone said, a trailblazer yesterday.</div><div id="00:03:35.500" class="transcript_line"> So yeah, she did lead the way for Black mixed race teachers or for just teachers in general.</div><div id="00:03:42.500" class="transcript_line"> The lady, she had a strong mind, the boas, and she delivered.</div><div id="00:03:48.500" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, through me living in Buteone, I do have a respect for culture and respect in that aspect.</div><div id="00:03:55.500" class="transcript_line"> So I am thankful that I went to that school.</div><div id="00:03:58.500" class="transcript_line"> Living in Buteone at the time, it was a different era.</div><div id="00:04:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, it was before the phones, not pre-computer games,</div><div id="00:04:07.500" class="transcript_line"> because living in the 80s, we were all Americanized.</div><div id="00:04:10.500" class="transcript_line"> We all had our skateboards at the same time.</div><div id="00:04:12.500" class="transcript_line"> We all had our roller skates at the same time.</div><div id="00:04:14.500" class="transcript_line"> We all had our bikes at the same time.</div><div id="00:04:16.500" class="transcript_line"> So when it was Christmas, we were all out in the square playing on our bikes, playing football.</div><div id="00:04:21.500" class="transcript_line"> Now it&#039;s a different world.</div><div id="00:04:23.500" class="transcript_line"> Now kids are all online, texting and everything else.</div><div id="00:04:28.500" class="transcript_line"> And a part of me, when I look at Buteone now, it&#039;s like a part of Buteone has died for me,</div><div id="00:04:34.500" class="transcript_line"> because when they took the lung out of Buteone, which was Angeline Street,</div><div id="00:04:39.500" class="transcript_line"> for me that was the lung with over maybe, I&#039;m not sure if there was eight maids and exes there.</div><div id="00:04:43.500" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t tell you how many maids and exes there was,</div><div id="00:04:45.500" class="transcript_line"> but just to think that when there was over maybe 20 families, maybe even more, that lived in each maids and exes.</div><div id="00:04:51.500" class="transcript_line"> So when you&#039;re taking out eight maids and exes with 20 plus families living in these maids and exes,</div><div id="00:04:56.500" class="transcript_line"> you&#039;re taking a big portion of Buteone to renovate it and to put people in now who I believe don&#039;t understand</div><div id="00:05:04.500" class="transcript_line"> that the area they inherited is probably the most culturalist part of Canada.</div><div id="00:05:09.500" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s sad to see that the maids and exes that we used to run through and chase and whatever are gone.</div><div id="00:05:18.500" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, with that, the memories of Buteone, I&#039;m not saying Buteone is dead,</div><div id="00:05:25.500" class="transcript_line"> but what I am saying is the history of that era is gone.</div><div id="00:05:30.500" class="transcript_line"> What I had is gone. What the old ones in the 70s had is gone.</div><div id="00:05:35.500" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s no pubs up there no more.</div><div id="00:05:37.500" class="transcript_line"> In fact, there&#039;s one pub in Buteone or on the Bay or whatever you want to call it,</div><div id="00:05:42.500" class="transcript_line"> is the packet, probably one of the longest, probably one of the oldest pubs without a name change.</div><div id="00:05:48.500" class="transcript_line"> That makes sense.</div><div id="00:05:49.500" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s the only the last standing pub in Buteone and it&#039;s the packet.</div><div id="00:05:54.500" class="transcript_line"> So whatever agenda is being or agenda kind of development has on Buteone, it&#039;s worked, unfortunately.</div><div id="00:06:03.500" class="transcript_line"> But there is still a community there.</div><div id="00:06:06.500" class="transcript_line"> We see the community come out recently from Hamon the Ravage in the case ongoing at the moment</div><div id="00:06:15.500" class="transcript_line"> with regards to him and South Wales police.</div><div id="00:06:18.500" class="transcript_line"> That shows me that there&#039;s still a community there.</div><div id="00:06:20.500" class="transcript_line"> They are Dutong, that they want to understand what&#039;s going on.</div><div id="00:06:25.500" class="transcript_line"> But like I said, I do believe that some people who inherited Dutong now just don&#039;t understand</div><div id="00:06:32.500" class="transcript_line"> the historical aspects of that place there.</div><div id="00:06:37.500" class="transcript_line"> Like I said, if it were for cows and a dog, then there wouldn&#039;t be no transport, you know, whatever.</div><div id="00:06:44.500" class="transcript_line"> And with the transport, it obviously brought the people into Buteone or Tiger Bay at that time.</div><div id="00:06:51.500" class="transcript_line"> We then settled down and they found it.</div><div id="00:06:54.500" class="transcript_line"> One question I&#039;d ask, mate, is would Cardiff be the capital of Wales without the docks?</div><div id="00:07:02.500" class="transcript_line"> Where would the money have come from?</div><div id="00:07:06.500" class="transcript_line"> I would like to know, yeah, obviously, Cardiff was obviously the leading import or export of coal.</div><div id="00:07:16.500" class="transcript_line"> And obviously with that, because we&#039;ve got capital status.</div><div id="00:07:20.500" class="transcript_line"> And I&#039;m not taking it away from Cardiff or the docks, but maybe we could have got the status</div><div id="00:07:26.500" class="transcript_line"> due to us having a cathedral in our city.</div><div id="00:07:30.500" class="transcript_line"> So maybe we&#039;ve got a city in a city and maybe that might have attracted attention as well as the docks.</div><div id="00:07:35.500" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, I do believe the docks in itself are the financial apparatus, would you say?</div><div id="00:07:43.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, yeah, and if you think about the docks, maybe financially drove Cardiff.</div><div id="00:07:48.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, who drove the docks? It&#039;s the people you&#039;re talking about.</div><div id="00:07:52.500" class="transcript_line"> Exactly. And especially having, you could call it the Welsh Wall Street down in the Bay, which was the coal exchange.</div><div id="00:08:01.500" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, it&#039;s nice to think how on a level or how far advanced Cardiff was at that time</div><div id="00:08:09.500" class="transcript_line"> with regards to the shit and quality of people that used to come to Cardiff.</div><div id="00:08:15.500" class="transcript_line"> How everything went electric, that was it. Dead. No more.</div><div id="00:08:22.500" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a bit like a motor city. It&#039;s like Detroit, when everything just went a bit and they started losing and losing money.</div><div id="00:08:30.500" class="transcript_line"> And now you see Detroit, Detroit is what it is.</div><div id="00:08:34.500" class="transcript_line"> It shambles and it&#039;s lucky that they&#039;ve been able to use whatever ugliness they took to the beauty, so to speak.</div><div id="00:08:42.500" class="transcript_line"> And it was an ugliness in the dollars. And as we see the docks now, that&#039;s what the docks is.</div><div id="00:08:48.500" class="transcript_line"> A multi-billion pound franchise, or multi-million pound business.</div><div id="00:08:53.500" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s just sad that people have had to be sacrificed in that process.</div><div id="00:09:00.500" class="transcript_line"> But it feels always different in the 80s. We had the youth club, Chalky White.</div><div id="00:09:05.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember being in the van with Elvin Blades and someone said to me,</div><div id="00:09:12.500" class="transcript_line"> Chalky White has just passed away. And I was really young. I remember that one image.</div><div id="00:09:18.500" class="transcript_line"> I wasn&#039;t again, I was Butow, but I was more of, I weren&#039;t Tiger Bay era, if that makes sense.</div><div id="00:09:24.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m 43 nearly in October. So yeah, that&#039;s one of my earliest recollections of Chalky White.</div><div id="00:09:33.500" class="transcript_line"> People speak about Chalky White and his effect on them when they were kids.</div><div id="00:09:39.500" class="transcript_line"> I crossed a long span.</div><div id="00:09:42.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, but I was more of the Steve Kyra era. The Algerian Foster, Mr. Foster as we used to call him.</div><div id="00:09:50.500" class="transcript_line"> Sheila Haddie, Frankie Ammon, Frankie Norman. So I was that sort of moniker on a Wednesday.</div><div id="00:09:58.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;d sneak into the club to pretend I was dancing, just to not dance and play on the floor.</div><div id="00:10:02.500" class="transcript_line"> So that was how we used to sneak in on a Wednesday. They used to do dance lessons on a Wednesday.</div><div id="00:10:07.500" class="transcript_line"> You pretend you&#039;re dancing and then what do you do then? You just go up and then you go play pool or table tennis or watch a film or whatever.</div><div id="00:10:16.500" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, we were sort of a different era then. It was nice. It was a real community at its best.</div><div id="00:10:23.500" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, fair play to Steve Kyra because Steve did his best for us when we were kids.</div><div id="00:10:29.500" class="transcript_line"> He took us, took us always trying to do our best.</div><div id="00:10:32.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember when he turned to my mum and he said, oh look, we&#039;re doing a run up with the Canada Devils.</div><div id="00:10:40.500" class="transcript_line"> Does your boy want to come and train or do this and do that?</div><div id="00:10:43.500" class="transcript_line"> And we were going up at the corporate events and we were allowed to go in there for free.</div><div id="00:10:50.500" class="transcript_line"> Obviously we had the name drop, etc. But yeah, the Six Week Holidays in the youth club was the best.</div><div id="00:10:57.500" class="transcript_line"> I couldn&#039;t think of anywhere else I&#039;d want to be on the Six Week Holidays in school or out of school.</div><div id="00:11:04.500" class="transcript_line"> And yeah, the Six Week Holidays youth club was the one for me at that time.</div><div id="00:11:08.500" class="transcript_line"> Do you think we miss those youth clubs?</div><div id="00:11:11.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, that&#039;s the one reason why kids aren&#039;t paying attention properly at the moment because they don&#039;t know what a youth club is.</div><div id="00:11:18.500" class="transcript_line"> No kids these days know what a youth club is.</div><div id="00:11:21.500" class="transcript_line"> I think because the financing was there to keep kids at bay or to give kids something to do</div><div id="00:11:27.500" class="transcript_line"> or try and get something like to try and find what the kid likes to then maybe channel that positive energy out of the kid</div><div id="00:11:35.500" class="transcript_line"> to maybe nurture that kid and try and make him become that thing he wants to be.</div><div id="00:11:41.500" class="transcript_line"> It doesn&#039;t matter what it is, but there were places for that and there&#039;s no places like that at the moment.</div><div id="00:11:45.500" class="transcript_line"> So right now kids know about street selling drugs, carrying knives and whatever culture comes with that.</div><div id="00:11:51.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s not a street element at the moment.</div><div id="00:11:54.500" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s sad. 13 year old kids shouldn&#039;t be on the street selling drugs.</div><div id="00:11:57.500" class="transcript_line"> They should at least be in a youth club doing 13 year old things.</div><div id="00:12:02.500" class="transcript_line"> The things have elevated so far from being in a youth club at maybe 10, 11 years of age to now 10, 11 years of age.</div><div id="00:12:12.500" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re more on the street selling drugs.</div><div id="00:12:14.500" class="transcript_line"> I remember I was in Barrie. My family are from Barrie.</div><div id="00:12:21.500" class="transcript_line"> I can remember when I used to go over to the bay, used to go out with the boys in the bay in the 80s.</div><div id="00:12:27.500" class="transcript_line"> Everybody was into something that was healthy and physical, whether it was boxing, martial arts.</div><div id="00:12:35.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah. Because I&#039;m a caddiff.</div><div id="00:12:38.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I&#039;m a caddiff and the doctor and the specialist was speaking about it to somebody.</div><div id="00:12:42.500" class="transcript_line"> The amount of people, whether they were black or white, that come from that kind of caddiff who didn&#039;t get a fair shot, who really were something.</div><div id="00:12:52.500" class="transcript_line"> You get what I&#039;m saying? They were like people like...</div><div id="00:12:54.500" class="transcript_line"> You look at the kayaks and you think everyone was afraid to play them.</div><div id="00:13:00.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, this is where I was going to go to. This is where I was going to go to. The kayaks.</div><div id="00:13:04.500" class="transcript_line"> They were famous. They were famous around wherever.</div><div id="00:13:09.500" class="transcript_line"> People knew that the kayaks were to be true. You can&#039;t beat the kayaks. If you do, then you&#039;re done.</div><div id="00:13:17.500" class="transcript_line"> But yeah, the kayaks, they were a formidable team.</div><div id="00:13:20.500" class="transcript_line"> And like I said, people like Sammy Jones, up until like Gerald Zerlis, they&#039;ve had some top players play for them.</div><div id="00:13:29.500" class="transcript_line"> But players, you should have been playing professional rugby, whether it was league or union, it doesn&#039;t matter.</div><div id="00:13:34.500" class="transcript_line"> There was a lot of people there that shouldn&#039;t have been playing for Wales, you could say. Maybe, I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:13:40.500" class="transcript_line"> Well, I was in Maisteg, Bridgend, the other day and someone said to me, do you know caddiff, I said yes.</div><div id="00:13:49.500" class="transcript_line"> Big old white guy and he said, my Maisteg Rugby Club, we used to be afraid to play the kayaks.</div><div id="00:13:57.500" class="transcript_line"> But what a party, what a friendly group of people. If you played them, you also had the time of your life.</div><div id="00:14:07.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because at the end of the day, whatever&#039;s on the pitch is left on the pitch.</div><div id="00:14:13.500" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s good that people can show other people from out of any way that they&#039;re past, future,</div><div id="00:14:22.500" class="transcript_line"> that people can be accommodating and friendly and non-judgmental.</div><div id="00:14:27.500" class="transcript_line"> And I do think sometimes people who maybe didn&#039;t want to play the kayaks, I&#039;m not saying they were racist or maybe they were scared or whatever.</div><div id="00:14:35.500" class="transcript_line"> But maybe they just had this thing in their head that when they were going to go down there, they were going to get burned at the stake or something in their head.</div><div id="00:14:43.500" class="transcript_line"> Maybe that was the fear factor, maybe that was the fear factor going into the ghetto and playing.</div><div id="00:14:49.500" class="transcript_line"> Obviously they were afraid of going somewhere with them up.</div><div id="00:14:51.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, just that thought of coming to Caddiff and then leaving there, taking the rooms and then going back to the pub and then apparently drinking and eating food.</div><div id="00:15:00.500" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a good memory. No violence.</div><div id="00:15:02.500" class="transcript_line"> He said that someone from the team, a couple of people from the team, said to him, stay later.</div><div id="00:15:11.500" class="transcript_line"> And they took him to a club in Butetown, in the bay, that used to be a church.</div><div id="00:15:20.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, that was the Casablanca.</div><div id="00:15:23.500" class="transcript_line"> But they&#039;d never been to a place like it.</div><div id="00:15:26.500" class="transcript_line"> I can imagine, I can imagine, I can imagine, I can imagine what it felt like when they walked in.</div><div id="00:15:31.500" class="transcript_line"> You know, he said, I&#039;d never heard Reggae before. Whoa!</div><div id="00:15:36.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I bet he didn&#039;t forget Reggae either.</div><div id="00:15:39.500" class="transcript_line"> No, that was the point. And I was saying to him, you like Reggae. And he was rolling off people&#039;s names. It&#039;s clear that that stuck with him forever then.</div><div id="00:15:49.500" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That&#039;s what&#039;s good about breaking people down as well.</div><div id="00:15:54.500" class="transcript_line"> Like, because people could have a stereotype on you.</div><div id="00:15:57.500" class="transcript_line"> But then it&#039;s like, once you get to know somebody, they may be your thoughts on somebody could just immediately just be like, perhaps I&#039;ve made a stupid decision all my life.</div><div id="00:16:08.500" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m hating on this one person or this one person because of what he looks like or because of who he is.</div><div id="00:16:15.500" class="transcript_line"> But immediately being brought down by humbleness and hospitality.</div><div id="00:16:20.500" class="transcript_line"> And I do think that can work.
