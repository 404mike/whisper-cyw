    <p><div id="transcript_container" class="transcript"><div id="00:00:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you Marion for doing this interview.</div><div id="00:00:06.000" class="transcript_line"> So I&#039;d just like to ask some questions about your life, especially about Caldecott, but I&#039;ll start first of all with where were you born?</div><div id="00:00:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I was born in Tiverton in Devon in 1938.</div><div id="00:00:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And what were your first memories?</div><div id="00:00:23.000" class="transcript_line"> I think my first memories of back in those days was having to draw the curtains to keep the light in.</div><div id="00:00:34.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know why, because at that time Tiverton really wasn&#039;t under threat, even though we were 15 miles from Exeter.</div><div id="00:00:47.000" class="transcript_line"> We never had air raid shelters and I really can&#039;t remember anything really happening during the war.</div><div id="00:00:58.000" class="transcript_line"> I must have been lived in the land of... what? Ignorance? Bliss? I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:01:07.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s all I can remember and having a gas mask to go to school.</div><div id="00:01:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And what about the house that you lived in? What sort of house was it?</div><div id="00:01:16.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a three bedroom, what would be termed as a terrace, kind of house, which backed onto fields and had a little stream at the bottom of the garden, which invariably you fell in.</div><div id="00:01:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Ideal really, idealic, out in the countryside on the outskirts of Tiverton.</div><div id="00:01:40.000" class="transcript_line"> And were you an only child?</div><div id="00:01:43.000" class="transcript_line"> No, I&#039;m from a large family.</div><div id="00:01:48.000" class="transcript_line"> It was idealic though, even though we were a large family.</div><div id="00:01:52.000" class="transcript_line"> And how many were you?</div><div id="00:01:54.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m one of 14.</div><div id="00:01:59.000" class="transcript_line"> It must have been hard work for your mother.</div><div id="00:02:01.000" class="transcript_line"> It was hard work for my mother and my father went to work every day of his life, every day.</div><div id="00:02:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And what work was that?</div><div id="00:02:12.000" class="transcript_line"> He worked at the quarry at Cove near Bempton, which in those days he didn&#039;t go to war because of... I forget what they call it.</div><div id="00:02:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It was something like a protected occupation?</div><div id="00:02:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, a reserved occupation.</div><div id="00:02:32.000" class="transcript_line"> A reserved occupation, so he was in the Home Guard.</div><div id="00:02:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And I can remember him telling many a tale about the Home Guard.</div><div id="00:02:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And one particular time was they had to share a gun.</div><div id="00:02:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Which seems crazy today, but they had to share this one gun and they had a whale of a time up in the hills with the Home Guard.</div><div id="00:03:01.000" class="transcript_line"> And it stayed with me to this day.</div><div id="00:03:06.000" class="transcript_line"> And so you were in Tiverton, in the town of Tiverton?</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes.</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So what was Tiverton like?</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> I would say it was quite like Chepstow is at the moment.</div><div id="00:03:19.000" class="transcript_line"> A lovely little town.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> It had about four churches, town hall, typical little country town.</div><div id="00:03:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And split into two.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> If you lived up over the hill or you lived beneath the hill.</div><div id="00:03:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And it was quite separated like that.</div><div id="00:03:41.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was a nice little town.</div><div id="00:03:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And which were you, over the hill?</div><div id="00:03:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Under the hill.</div><div id="00:03:47.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was very nice.</div><div id="00:03:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We had parks down there, schools, churches, shops, fine.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> And what brought you from Tiverton to Caldecott? And when was that?</div><div id="00:04:05.000" class="transcript_line"> We both worked at that time in the local factory.</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> But by coming to Lanwin Steelworks, my husband could double his pay for moving 100 odd miles.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So to make a better life, we had two boys at that time.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> We came to Caldecott.</div><div id="00:04:27.000" class="transcript_line"> My husband to work in the steelworks as an engineer.</div><div id="00:04:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And we bought our first house in Shelley Close.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And that was another big adventure.</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> So that was a big, I know it wasn&#039;t that far, 100 odd miles.</div><div id="00:04:49.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s still a big step to move away.</div><div id="00:04:51.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a really big step because not many people had cars in those days.</div><div id="00:04:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And we had to buy a car and a house and keep two little boys.</div><div id="00:05:05.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was a big, big move for us at that time.</div><div id="00:05:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And with no relatives in the area?</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, I had a sister who&#039;d also moved over here about two years before.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So that gave us that little incentive to come, I must say.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell us about the house that you moved into.</div><div id="00:05:30.000" class="transcript_line"> It was a brand new house in Shelley Close, which we bought for Â£3,000,</div><div id="00:05:37.000" class="transcript_line"> which seemed an awful lot of money.</div><div id="00:05:39.000" class="transcript_line"> But it was an end of terrace, lovely little house, really.</div><div id="00:05:46.000" class="transcript_line"> But then the following year my daughter came along.</div><div id="00:05:49.000" class="transcript_line"> So that made three children.</div><div id="00:05:52.000" class="transcript_line"> She was my Welsh gift, I think.</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we lived there until 1997.</div><div id="00:06:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And then we moved to Ebbw Road in Caldecott.</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> At that time, Ebbw Road was on the outskirts of Caldecott.</div><div id="00:06:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, no houses behind us in Wentwood View or down below in Elam Way.</div><div id="00:06:26.000" class="transcript_line"> It was an ideal place to be with the children.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> They could run in the fields, go, well, just run.</div><div id="00:06:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And today, I&#039;m afraid to say, it&#039;s all built up around us.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> But that&#039;s progress, they say.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So you missed the open countryside?</div><div id="00:06:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my husband also was born in the countryside, and he loved the fields.</div><div id="00:06:53.000" class="transcript_line"> He had a cottage in an idyllic little village called Hemiark.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And he just loved the fields.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s progress, or is it?</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:07:09.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell us about that house, what sort of house it was.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s a four-bed detached on Ebbw Road.</div><div id="00:07:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Sort of house I always look at and think this is a house I would have drawn as a child.</div><div id="00:07:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Two windows up, one down, and a door.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And it just reminds me of a house, but I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.</div><div id="00:07:36.000" class="transcript_line"> We moved there, as I say, in about 1997, and we&#039;ve been there ever since.</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> And what sort of facilities has the house got, perhaps by comparing it with your childhood?</div><div id="00:07:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think I was quite lucky in Tiverton because we always had an indoor bathroom and toilet.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Always.</div><div id="00:07:58.000" class="transcript_line"> In comparison to my husband, where he had to walk 100 yards down the garden to the toilet, I was a spoilt town girl.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We had running water, we had it all.</div><div id="00:08:11.000" class="transcript_line"> So really, my childhood wasn&#039;t, I can&#039;t say, because I loved to go to my auntie who had an outside toilet with a lovely wooden seat.</div><div id="00:08:25.000" class="transcript_line"> And we loved to go up that garden because it was so different.</div><div id="00:08:31.000" class="transcript_line"> And in the new house, obviously you had all of those facilities.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:08:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything more than you had when you were...</div><div id="00:08:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, just a downstairs cloakroom really, which was a bonus with the children not having to run up the stairs.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> A nice big garden, which we didn&#039;t have in Shelley Close.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> And obviously we still have a nice garden, big garden at the back.</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And cooking, kitchen and heating and so on, what sort of facilities have you got?</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got all facilities, gas, electric, central heating, it&#039;s all there.</div><div id="00:09:10.000" class="transcript_line"> We had that in Shelley Close actually, so we&#039;ve been quite lucky.</div><div id="00:09:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So when the children were young, and you were a young mother, so what were your social outlets?</div><div id="00:09:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, when they were really young, it was really just going out to the rugby club, being part of the landworn social.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> But really not much social life, a couple of times a year.</div><div id="00:09:49.000" class="transcript_line"> We formed a little children&#039;s play group back in those days that we had in St Mary&#039;s School in the old hall there.</div><div id="00:10:04.000" class="transcript_line"> And our children used to go there.</div><div id="00:10:07.000" class="transcript_line"> And at what age were they at that time?</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, Claire would have been about three, and the boys would have been in West End School by then.</div><div id="00:10:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And then they moved on to St Mary&#039;s School and then on to the college.</div><div id="00:10:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And as with the play group, the organisers were volunteers?</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes. Everybody gave a hand, everybody, all the mothers.</div><div id="00:10:44.000" class="transcript_line"> I think we used to pay something like 50p to cover the cost of the hall, and that was it at those days.</div><div id="00:10:51.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think at that time it must have been one of the first play groups to be established in Cardacot.</div><div id="00:10:59.000" class="transcript_line"> And you were a young mother.</div><div id="00:11:02.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you get to know people in the area?</div><div id="00:11:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Through the rugby club and through the play group. And that really was my only avenue to go.</div><div id="00:11:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And as the children grew older and went to school, did that change?</div><div id="00:11:28.000" class="transcript_line"> Not really. Our life has been wound around the rugby club, I&#039;ve got to say, over the years.</div><div id="00:11:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Because my maxim was, well, you&#039;re going to play rugby, I&#039;m not staying home.</div><div id="00:11:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So we all went to rugby. We all went as a family.</div><div id="00:11:46.000" class="transcript_line"> You know, all with a kit on, off we went.</div><div id="00:11:52.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was all encompassing. It was daytime activities to watch rugby and presumably a social activity.</div><div id="00:12:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes, yes. Obviously the more you meet parents outside of schools, you meet.</div><div id="00:12:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And that circle increases all the time. They were good days.</div><div id="00:12:16.000" class="transcript_line"> And which schools did the children go to?</div><div id="00:12:19.000" class="transcript_line"> They all started off in West End and then to St Mary&#039;s in Church Road and then to the Comp.</div><div id="00:12:29.000" class="transcript_line"> And stayed in Cardacot schools all the way through?</div><div id="00:12:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, yes.</div><div id="00:12:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So turning to the Cardacot town or village as it was, can you describe how it was, how you remember it when you first came?</div><div id="00:12:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, it was rather ramshackled as I remember.</div><div id="00:12:51.000" class="transcript_line"> The better side of the street was where Grimmers the Electric shop used to be.</div><div id="00:12:56.000" class="transcript_line"> But Washburns had a garage and things on the pavement and you could buy most things.</div><div id="00:13:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Shop across the road. The mace shop, as I remember.</div><div id="00:13:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There&#039;s a grocery down the bottom and you could buy furniture upstairs.</div><div id="00:13:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Adam&#039;s shop round the corner was like Aladdin&#039;s cave.</div><div id="00:13:21.000" class="transcript_line"> You wanted it, you could get it in Adam&#039;s shop. So that was fine.</div><div id="00:13:26.000" class="transcript_line"> So did you have to go outside of Cardacot to shop in those days?</div><div id="00:13:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Not really. No, you could get your groceries, you could get clothes.</div><div id="00:13:35.000" class="transcript_line"> As far as I&#039;m aware, very rarely did we have to travel to Newport. Very rarely.</div><div id="00:13:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And did you find that while shopping in Cardacot you would meet people you knew?</div><div id="00:13:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes. The village, like walking through the village, it&#039;s like walking through friends.</div><div id="00:13:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Everyone speaks to you and that&#039;s how you get to know.</div><div id="00:14:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Through your children mostly, in schools and what they do, whatever activities they did as children, you joined in.</div><div id="00:14:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And how have you seen it change over those years? Quite a few years of course.</div><div id="00:14:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it has changed. I mean it was rebuilt, if you like, way back.</div><div id="00:14:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Not necessarily for the better because a lot of the small shops went.</div><div id="00:14:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because people then became more travelled, they all got cars and went to Newport.</div><div id="00:14:41.000" class="transcript_line"> So really the big supermarkets killed the village. That little closeness that you could go down.</div><div id="00:14:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Living in West End mostly, the Co-op has been there forever. Clarks of Bookchis was there.</div><div id="00:15:01.000" class="transcript_line"> You really didn&#039;t need to go any further. But if you wanted other things you came up into the village.</div><div id="00:15:09.000" class="transcript_line"> And you knew you would get it somewhere. Little dress shops were there. And it was all there.</div><div id="00:15:19.000" class="transcript_line"> And the children&#039;s shopping, clothes, that sort of thing?</div><div id="00:15:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Well I&#039;m sure I must have bought it. Because I couldn&#039;t drive at that time.</div><div id="00:15:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And my husband would have taken the car to work. So I must have bought their clothes.</div><div id="00:15:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Because there was no computer, no shopping by computer or whatever you call it. Online. None of that.</div><div id="00:15:46.000" class="transcript_line"> So I must have got their clothes in the village. Adams&#039;s I think. Was the shop?</div><div id="00:15:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Marjory&#039;s.</div><div id="00:15:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Marjory&#039;s, yeah.</div><div id="00:15:56.000" class="transcript_line"> So school uniforms?</div><div id="00:15:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Adams&#039;s, you got that. Or either in the school at that time.</div><div id="00:16:04.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t think they were as particular about school uniform back then as they are today.</div><div id="00:16:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And I think school uniform is good.</div><div id="00:16:15.000" class="transcript_line"> So you said in the school, I mean I guess, the comprehensive school. So they supplied uniforms?</div><div id="00:16:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, you could buy it all in the school.</div><div id="00:16:28.000" class="transcript_line"> So was it a shop?</div><div id="00:16:31.000" class="transcript_line"> I suppose it must have been. Must have been.</div><div id="00:16:37.000" class="transcript_line"> Or Adams&#039;s sold what you required. Used to buy things like rugby shirts, ties.</div><div id="00:16:47.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m sure I must have bought blazers in Adams&#039;s. Must have. Shirts.</div><div id="00:16:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So when the children were growing up and became teenagers, so what was their, how did they exercise their social life?</div><div id="00:17:05.000" class="transcript_line"> What were the places they went to and enjoy?</div><div id="00:17:11.000" class="transcript_line"> There wasn&#039;t much, was there, really. There wasn&#039;t anywhere for them to go.</div><div id="00:17:16.000" class="transcript_line"> When the leisure centre opened up, then yes they could go there.</div><div id="00:17:21.000" class="transcript_line"> But really there was nowhere for the children to go. Nowhere.</div><div id="00:17:27.000" class="transcript_line"> And you just had to trust that if they went out they wouldn&#039;t get into any mischief.</div><div id="00:17:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Obviously like my daughter went to girl guides and things, well that was like a little bit social for her.</div><div id="00:17:44.000" class="transcript_line"> But looking back there was nowhere for my sons to go except rugby training.</div><div id="00:17:50.000" class="transcript_line"> So it was very poor for social.</div><div id="00:17:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Because they&#039;re looking to do more social things these days.</div><div id="00:18:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Whereas in my day you&#039;d sit on the pavement and you&#039;d all sit around under the lamp and you&#039;d talk.</div><div id="00:18:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Until that lamp went out and indoors you had to go.</div><div id="00:18:12.000" class="transcript_line"> So although things have changed today, and I think children today are so lucky because they can do anything they want.</div><div id="00:18:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything. And it&#039;s there for them. Just grab it.</div><div id="00:18:27.000" class="transcript_line"> What about the school? Were there any social activities associated with the school?</div><div id="00:18:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Any clubs? Any dances? Anything like that?</div><div id="00:18:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Not a lot. Probably the school had the disco. But no, not a lot.</div><div id="00:18:47.000" class="transcript_line"> That wasn&#039;t a frequent...</div><div id="00:18:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Not at all, no.</div><div id="00:18:54.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did they meet when the time came, boyfriends and girlfriends, how did they meet?</div><div id="00:19:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you know, I have no idea. I suppose in the village they would... school maybe?</div><div id="00:19:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I really don&#039;t know how they would meet each other.</div><div id="00:19:16.000" class="transcript_line"> The only place they could go would be to a local pub at that time. I really don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:19:26.000" class="transcript_line"> Would they have gone outside of Caldecott when they were teenagers?</div><div id="00:19:30.000" class="transcript_line"> No, because there was no transport, no buses. No. They wouldn&#039;t have even gone to Chepster. So it was all local.</div><div id="00:19:42.000" class="transcript_line"> So bringing us more up to date, so how do you think it&#039;s changed since those years when the children were younger to now?</div><div id="00:19:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Well it&#039;s not changed a lot because the leisure centre, fine, but you can&#039;t get into the leisure centre unless you&#039;ve booked something months in advance.</div><div id="00:20:10.000" class="transcript_line"> There is a youth club, I don&#039;t know how successful that is, and that&#039;s it as far as I see. I see children still hanging around the library.</div><div id="00:20:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Has that got any better? I don&#039;t think so. But what do children want? What do they want? Be entertained all the time? I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:20:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And again bringing us up to date as far as what is now a town, of course. So how has that changed?</div><div id="00:20:47.000" class="transcript_line"> In the shopping area, how would you see the changes that have taken place there?</div><div id="00:20:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, if you like charity shops, hairdressers, you&#039;ve got plenty of that. Betting shops, yes.</div><div id="00:21:05.000" class="transcript_line"> No, it&#039;s not changed for the better. I&#039;m quite sure of that.</div><div id="00:21:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And it&#039;s a vicious circle because people shop online. The big stores have taken the heart of the village away as it has most places.</div><div id="00:21:23.000" class="transcript_line"> So you don&#039;t really want to go to the village. The bank is gone. It&#039;s just fading away slowly.</div><div id="00:21:33.000" class="transcript_line"> And why do you think that has happened?</div><div id="00:21:35.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, I think people have become more mobile, more cars, or you can get to Newport easily, spitty, everything you could want.</div><div id="00:21:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And online shopping again. You just pick up your device and off you go. Easy.</div><div id="00:21:56.000" class="transcript_line"> And how do you see the future? How do you think it&#039;s going to develop in the future?</div><div id="00:22:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, unless they make room for more specialist little shops in Cardacombe. It makes it viable for them to come here. I can&#039;t see it.</div><div id="00:22:12.000" class="transcript_line"> And what sort of things, changes would be needed to make it more viable?</div><div id="00:22:19.000" class="transcript_line"> That&#039;s a million dollar question, isn&#039;t it? What do you want? What do you want? Progress? Is this progress? I don&#039;t think so. I don&#039;t think so.</div><div id="00:22:32.000" class="transcript_line"> So turning to your own social life now at this stage, what are your social outlets? And how do you meet your friends now?</div><div id="00:22:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, the U3A. I have so many friends in the U3A, through the walking group, the history, all groups. I think after being a member for so long, I think most people know me.</div><div id="00:23:00.000" class="transcript_line"> So it&#039;s good. And in fact, my sister was over the other day and went to the village and her comment was, people speak to you. And she found that really refreshing.</div><div id="00:23:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So you mentioned the walking group. Are there other groups that you?</div><div id="00:23:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I like the history. I like to go to history and gardening. And that&#039;s all time allows me to do at the moment.</div><div id="00:23:35.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell me about the history society. What sort of things does it provide for you?</div><div id="00:23:44.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, it provides me with a lot of knowledge, to get a lot of knowledge about Welsh history. As an English person, I know very little.</div><div id="00:23:58.000" class="transcript_line"> So by going to the history, I can find out a lot more about Welsh history. And that&#039;s quite fascinating to me.</div><div id="00:24:07.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;ve just always liked history, whether it&#039;s English or Welsh actually. And just that. I&#039;m fascinated by what&#039;s gone on in the past.</div><div id="00:24:22.000" class="transcript_line"> Satisfies your curiosity.</div><div id="00:24:24.000" class="transcript_line"> I must be a very curious person, I think. Yes.</div><div id="00:24:28.000" class="transcript_line"> And the gardening club, what does that offer?</div><div id="00:24:30.000" class="transcript_line"> That offers you, not gardening with tools, but actually seeing houses, wonderful gardens, gardens you can visit.</div><div id="00:24:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And it gives you some ideas. And you have demonstrations of how to cultivate your garden. So it brings a lightness into your life.</div><div id="00:24:55.000" class="transcript_line"> And where do these events take place?</div><div id="00:25:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Well, various club huts, halls, the history in the luncheon centre, the gardening in the cub hut, walking. Of course you&#039;re out in the countryside, wonderful.</div><div id="00:25:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And the gardens that you visit, where have you been?</div><div id="00:25:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, goodness me, there are too many to number.</div><div id="00:25:31.000" class="transcript_line"> What are two examples you can think of?</div><div id="00:25:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Dufferin Gardens down in Cardiff. We&#039;ve just been to Southport Flower Show.</div><div id="00:25:50.000" class="transcript_line"> Margam Abbey, we&#039;ve been walking in the gardens there, that&#039;s very nice these days.</div><div id="00:25:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Actually at this moment of time there&#039;s too many for me to remember.</div><div id="00:26:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Heavyslick?</div><div id="00:26:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Sorry?</div><div id="00:26:06.000" class="transcript_line"> Heavyslick we&#039;ve been to.</div><div id="00:26:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, so many.</div><div id="00:26:11.000" class="transcript_line"> And how is that organised?</div><div id="00:26:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, that&#039;s organised by the conveners of the gardening group. So they are very popular.</div><div id="00:26:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And they provide transport?</div><div id="00:26:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, it&#039;s all provided for. Same as the special events, it&#039;s organised for you to go. And it&#039;s easy for people who maybe don&#039;t have that facility to do on their own. It&#039;s very popular.</div><div id="00:26:42.000" class="transcript_line"> And have you taken a role yourself in the U3A?</div><div id="00:26:46.000" class="transcript_line"> I have. I&#039;ve been on the committee, I&#039;ve been vice chairman, I&#039;ve been convener of the walking group. And at this moment of time we&#039;ve just reorganised the history and I&#039;m going to become treasurer of the history.</div><div id="00:27:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And if you were to make some summary points or to say something about things I haven&#039;t asked about, is there anything you&#039;d like to say about your life here in Caldecott?</div><div id="00:27:26.000" class="transcript_line"> My life here has been very pleasant. I can&#039;t say that I wanted to, or we said I&#039;d go back to Tiverton, but no, I know an awful lot of people here, lots of friends, and we&#039;ve had a good life.</div><div id="00:27:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Well thank you for that interview.</div></div></p>
