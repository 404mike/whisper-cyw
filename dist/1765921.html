the street.</div><div id="00:03:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes, we go down the high street and we go round the back of the houses, don&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:03:10.000" class="transcript_line"> And what do we do when we&#039;re parading?</div><div id="00:03:12.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:03:14.000" class="transcript_line"> We

class="transcript_line"> And we just basically make loads of noise.</div><div id="00:03:22.000" class="transcript_line"> But it&#039;s good fun, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:03:25.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s good fun.</div><div id="00:03:26.000" class="transcript_line"> And the people of the town are always really smiley and they always look really happy to see us.</div><div id="00:03:32.000" class="transcript_line"> And they always make everyone shush when we walk past.</div><div id="00:03:36.000" class="transcript_line"> They switch off, because sometimes there&#039;s background music, because it&#039;s the festival day.</div><div id="00:03:40.000" class="transcript_line"> They always switch it off when we come, so we can make a good big racket.</div><div id="00:03:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Now we&#039;ve also performed at the Myvred Show a couple of times.</div><div id="00:03:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Have you been to

I think you did too.</div><div id="00:03:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Possibly the space one.</div><div id="00:04:01.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, the space one, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember what we held when we were doing the space shows?</div><div id="00:04:09.000" class="transcript_line"> Because the other thing we do in Masquerade is the art, isn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:04:13.000" class="transcript_line"> And the making of our props.</div><div id="00:04:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember making all of those planets?</div><div id="00:04:19.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:21.000" class="transcript_line"> And parading with the planets?</div><div id="00:04:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:04:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah.</div><div id="00:04:25.000" class="transcript_line"> So we did that and we did our show all about...</div><div id="00:04:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember?</div><div id="00:04:31.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:04:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Selwyn was the main character.</div><div id="00:04:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And he had a helmet on.</div><div id="00:04:38.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah.</div><div id="00:04:40.000" class="transcript_line"> Could you remember who he was?</div><div id="00:04:41.000" class="transcript_line"> The spaceman.</div><div id="00:04:42.000" class="transcript_line"> Yes!</div><div id="00:04:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Well done, you.</div><div id="00:04:44.000" class="transcript_line"> He was the spaceman.</div><div id="00:04:46.000" class="transcript_line"> And we talked about the spaceman and how he&#039;d got lost and he had to visit all the different planets.</div><div id="00:04:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:53.000" class="transcript_line"> You remember that one now.</div><div id="00:04:54.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:55.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, that&#039;s good.</div><div id="00:04:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:04:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:04:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you also remember what happened on the St. Muttlin&#039;s Day, Parade Day one day, when</div><div id="00:05:04.000" class="transcript_line"> it just poured with rain, where we had to go?</div><div id="00:05:08.000" class="transcript_line"> Remember we had to move the performance indoors.</div><div id="00:05:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember where we ended up?</div><div id="00:05:14.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:15.000" class="transcript_line"> Don&#039;t you remember being in the church?</div><div id="00:05:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yes.</div><div id="00:05:20.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:05:21.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, because it poured down the rain.</div><div id="00:05:26.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:05:27.000" class="transcript_line"> So how did you find that performance in the church?</div><div id="00:05:31.000" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:05:32.000" class="transcript_line"> It was good, wasn&#039;t it?</div><div id="00:05:34.000" class="transcript_line"> It was almost like the church was like a theatre space.</div><div id="00:05:38.000" class="transcript_line"> And we walked all around it, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:05:41.000" class="transcript_line"> We walked around all the pews and we used all the different parts of the church.</div><div id="00:05:47.000" class="transcript_line"> And we sang,</div><div id="00:05:48.000" class="transcript_line"> Here comes the sun, da da da da,</div><div id="00:05:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Here comes the sun, I say it&#039;s alright,</div><div id="00:05:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Do do do do do do do.</div><div id="00:05:58.000" class="transcript_line"> Because I know you love music, don&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:01.000" class="transcript_line"> I love music, yeah.</div><div id="00:06:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So tell us about your tiny little CD collection.</div><div id="00:06:08.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve got a lot.</div><div id="00:06:11.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve got a lot, haven&#039;t you?</div><div id="00:06:13.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:14.000" class="transcript_line"> And in Masquerade we try and use a lot of music.</div><div id="00:06:17.000" class="transcript_line"> What&#039;s your favourite type of music?</div><div id="00:06:23.000" class="transcript_line"> Dunno.</div><div id="00:06:25.000" class="transcript_line"> Have a think. I think I remember what your favourite type of music is.</div><div id="00:06:31.000" class="transcript_line"> It&#039;s country and western.</div><div id="00:06:34.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, I think you&#039;re right. It&#039;s country and western, isn&#039;t it? Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:38.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve tried to do a bit of that in Masquerade.</div><div id="00:06:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:06:42.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;ve tried various other evenings.</div><div id="00:06:45.000" class="transcript_line"> So when Masquerade has had to go on Zoom this year, how have you found that?</div><div id="00:06:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Good.</div><div id="00:06:52.000" class="transcript_line"> Good? Ah, what&#039;s been good about that?</div><div id="00:06:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Internet&#039;s not working.</div><div id="00:06:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Or sometimes if the internet&#039;s not working it could be a problem. Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because they&#039;re a bit slow sometimes when...</div><div id="00:07:06.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;re right. Sometimes we freeze.</div><div id="00:07:12.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:13.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think you&#039;ve been especially good at going away in the weeks in between</div><div id="00:07:19.000" class="transcript_line"> and thinking about what we&#039;re doing, what topic or theme we&#039;re doing,</div><div id="00:07:24.000" class="transcript_line"> and bringing things to us and then presenting the things.</div><div id="00:07:29.000" class="transcript_line"> Can you remember any of the things you&#039;ve done?</div><div id="00:07:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Anything you&#039;ve brought?</div><div id="00:07:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Drawings?</div><div id="00:07:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:42.000" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:07:43.000" class="transcript_line"> You&#039;ve brought your baby photos?</div><div id="00:07:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, yeah.</div><div id="00:07:46.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you remember that?</div><div id="00:07:49.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh yeah, and then we did stuff about holidays, didn&#039;t we?</div><div id="00:07:53.000" class="transcript_line"> Oh, and that was your suggestion, wasn&#039;t it? You wanted to talk about holidays.</div><div id="00:07:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:07:57.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, yeah, we did a whole session on holidays.</div><div id="00:07:59.000" class="transcript_line"> That was really good and you brought loads of photos.</div><div id="00:08:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:03.000" class="transcript_line"> That was a great session and everybody really wanted to talk about their holidays.</div><div id="00:08:07.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:08.000" class="transcript_line"> I think it was because it was the year, last year of Covid, where nobody had a holiday.</div><div id="00:08:13.000" class="transcript_line"> So we all wanted to talk about holidays, didn&#039;t we, because we were missing them.</div><div id="00:08:18.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:19.000" class="transcript_line"> So have you found doing it on Zoom... I mean, I suppose you don&#039;t have to travel.</div><div id="00:08:24.000" class="transcript_line"> You just do it from your own home or your mum&#039;s or your house in my smuggling.</div><div id="00:08:30.000" class="transcript_line"> Has that been quite good?</div><div id="00:08:32.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:33.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:34.000" class="transcript_line"> So that&#039;s been great.</div><div id="00:08:36.000" class="transcript_line"> And what about using it as a means of keeping in touch with all your friends in Masquerade?</div><div id="00:08:45.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:08:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Because you might not have seen people at all other than that, might you?</div><div id="00:08:50.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:08:51.000" class="transcript_line"> No.</div><div id="00:08:53.000" class="transcript_line"> So who are the people that you really like working with in Masquerade?</div><div id="00:08:56.000" class="transcript_line"> Who makes you laugh most?</div><div id="00:08:59.000" class="transcript_line"> Selwyn.</div><div id="00:09:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Selwyn, yes.</div><div id="00:09:03.000" class="transcript_line"> Michelle.</div><div id="00:09:04.000" class="transcript_line"> Michelle, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:05.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:11.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:09:12.000" class="transcript_line"> What about Alex and Ryan?</div><div id="00:09:16.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:09:18.000" class="transcript_line"> They&#039;re good fun, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:09:20.000" class="transcript_line"> And Angela.</div><div id="00:09:22.000" class="transcript_line"> And Angela, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:24.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah, because everyone&#039;s always pleased to see each other, aren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:09:27.000" class="transcript_line"> We&#039;re all pleased to see each other on Zoom.</div><div id="00:09:30.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know if you were there, still there last week, or you might have popped off when we talked about starting to come back together, like outside in real life.</div><div id="00:09:40.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Or were you?</div><div id="00:09:42.000" class="transcript_line"> I was there, yeah.</div><div id="00:09:43.000" class="transcript_line"> Because most people said they were a bit slightly nervous about it still, weren&#039;t they?</div><div id="00:09:47.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hm.</div><div id="00:09:48.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know how you felt about that.</div><div id="00:09:50.000" class="transcript_line"> What?</div><div id="00:09:51.000" class="transcript_line"> Were you one of the people who was a bit nervous about it, or were you keen to get back together properly?</div><div id="00:09:57.000" class="transcript_line"> I&#039;m a bit nervous about it, yeah.</div><div id="00:10:00.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:01.000" class="transcript_line"> So.</div><div id="00:10:02.000" class="transcript_line"> Yeah.</div><div id="00:10:03.000" class="transcript_line"> So we left it that we&#039;d leave it at least another month before we talked about that again.</div><div id="00:10:11.000" class="transcript_line"> But it would be nice to see everyone in the flesh.</div><div id="00:10:15.000" class="transcript_line"> But I think everyone&#039;s quite used to Zooming now, so, you know, that&#039;s OK.</div><div id="00:10:20.000" class="transcript_line"> So have you got any more ideas for themes or anything you might want us to look at coming up this year?</div><div id="00:10:27.000" class="transcript_line"> Do you want to do any more musicals or?</div><div id="00:10:33.000" class="transcript_line"> I don&#039;t know.</div><div id="00:10:34.000" class="transcript_line"> See what happens.</div><div id="00:10:36.000" class="transcript_line"> Mm-hm.</div><div id="00:10:37.000" class="transcript_line"> See what happens.</div><div id="00:10:38.000" class="transcript_line"> OK.</div><div id="00:10:39.000" class="transcript_line"> Great.</div><div id="00:10:40.000" class="transcript_line"> All right then.</div><div id="00:10:41.000" class="transcript_line"> Well,
